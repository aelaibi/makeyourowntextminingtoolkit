NOTE FOR REGIONAL F H E


Acceptable funding for training in relation to Hillsborough


1.                 informed me about difficulties in relation to accounting
     for money frcm CCETSW which had been made available to the Hillsborough
     Co-ordinating grot?) for training.

2.   My recollection was that there had been a personal conversation with
               and money promised.

3.   It would appear that when the necessary bureaucracy in CCETSW cane on
     stream and proper accounting systems were needed there were problems
     and David Mason was insisting that certain promises had been made which
     CCETSW laads"indicated was not the case.
            >vo o
4.   I was not prepared to take sides on this as I feel there is probably
     some truth on both sides although it seemed to me that it would be very
     necessary for the Hillsborough Co-ordinating Group to account for the
     money they had spent as CCETSW too had to give account of how it had
     spent its money.

5.   I agreed informally to try and sort something out with David Mason.

6.   Will Twist, Chairman of the Co-ordinating Committee had telephone me to
     give me some information relating to the meetings and in the course of
     conversation I raised with him the importance of accounting for the
     money that had been spent frcm CCETSW.        This led to a long long
     discussion about the problems and his agreement that David needed as a
     matter of some urgency to get a letter off. He indicated that David
     was presently travelling with               to Belfast and was going to
     sort it out then. I indicated that conversation was not sufficient and
     CCETSW in all fairness needed to have the money properly accounted for
     in an appropriate application as^mstructions wseser given in the fo£iag.Xe
     Will Twist agreed with this and though that David Mason had agreed to do
     this. He was confident that this would happen quickly.

I attach copies of Michael Stewart's letter of 9 January and of

Dear Michael Stewart

Thank you for your letter and enclosures of 9 January.  I had
heard something of your work when I visited Merseyside last
Summer and was interested to see the material you sent.  I am
passing this on to some colleagues within the Department who
might be interested in joining a meeting with you.

I will get in touch with you about dates as soon as I know my
colleagues' wishes.  It would obviously be more convenient to you
to combine a meeting with one of your visits to London for
another purpose.


Yours sincerely

                           Dear Maire,

                           Just a note to thank you very much for giving me so much
                           of your time last week - I thought it was really useful
                           (to me, anyway) .  I was delighted to hear that you had
                           retrieved my fountain pen - I use it a lot and felt sure
                           that I had lost it, which was depressing.   I will hope to
                           see you on the 9 February at the ADSS Sub Group.         I
                           enclose, in case it is of interest, a composite document
                           about CCETSW's Mental Health Programme 101, and its
                           remit.  As you will know, the programme runs to 1992, but
                           I hear there will be further money coming to cover
                           'community care’ training issues as the focus shifts a
                           little from ASW work.   I also enclose a copy of the pro­
                           forma which we shall now be using to monitor ASW
                           programmes annually.    As you know, we keep records of
                           ASWs going through the programmes in a central registry.

                            It looks as if the Manchester Consortium 60 day programme
                            provided by the R & D Group at Manchester University,
                            Dept of Psychiatry, will become a CCETSW approved Post
                            Qualifying course in the fullness of time and I am very
                            pleased about that.       I had an excellent meeting with
                                                last week re. matters various, and I am
                            cautiously     optimistic     about   internal    University
                            developments as they apply to Diploma in Social Work and
                            PQ: developments.       Negotiation  is  beginning,   though
                            mainly, I have to say, because these relationships have
                            to- be explored in relationship to partnerships to provide
                            the various Diplomas being planned in the sub region.

 Obviously it will be vital to preserve the integrity and
 quality of the psychiatric social work provision in
 hospital and in the community pre and post Griffiths, and
 the Social Work Education Centre will have a major role
 to play in this sub-region, I feel sure

 We are doing our best to assist that with appropriate
 funding and support from CCETSW to various projects
 including some Practice Teaching and the PQ courses. The
 new Diploma is following on.

 I enclose   also,  as   promised,  some  details  on the
 workshops for trainers/programme providers in the region.
 Obviously you would be welcome to come if you wished, and
 I have put an 'item' on the programme which could cover
 this briefly, following our discussion.     Hope this is
 okay.

 The 'Disaster' issue continues - and I enclose, because
 of your    interest  and involvement,  the most recent
 correspondence aimed at trying to resolve the situation.
 It needs resolution, of course, not only to 'move the
 money' but also because it will be hard to make out a
 case for any further funds for this or any other sub
 region unless we can demonstrate appropriate use and
 monitoring of the funds.

 I am very glad that CCETSW, after persuasion, has 'topped
 up' the regional £10,000 from central funds but can tell
 you that it required much pressure, when there was little
 background information to go on.

 I am copying Will Twist who is the Chair of the Inter
 Agency group in whom I have confidence in his willingness
 to provide us with an approximate framework within which
 we can account for public money.  We are sorry to be seen
 as 'petty bureaucrats' but I guess we can live with it!

 I look forward to seeing you again on the 9th and hope
 that we can maintain contact.       Thanks also for the
 'Inspection' Document - it arrived today.

    Dear

    Very many thanks indeed for sending me a copy of the Research Proposal prepared
    by                1

    It looks a very interesting project and should provide some very valuable
    material.

    I am sorry that the work will not include the organisational study, although in
    some ways perhaps this ought to have been done much sooner after the whole thing
    started in April.  I am personally fascinated by the dynamics and the inter-
    organisational problems and strengths which began and continued after the
    Hillsborough disaster.

    Do keep me in touch with any further information concerning the Research
    Proposal, particularly as you say that Rowntree have requested the research be
    broadened to include a corporative element.

    Best wishes,


    Yours sincerely

  Dear Maire,

  Thank you for your letter. It was indeed very good to see you
  too. It was nice to have a chat after such a long time.

  I appreciate your encouragement to write to Mr Utting, I will do
  this in the next 10 days or so.   It did strike me at our meeting
  that there may be lots of politics and manoeuvring going on in
  high places concerning trauma and disaster work.   I have no real
  stomach for this sort of carry on, although I recognised that
  this is part of life!   However I think it will be useful to send
  a letter to Bill Utting, simply to impress on him the importance
  of our work, and the value it seemed to have had in Hillsborough.
  I will even send him a copy of David Mason’s letter to us, in the
  month following Hillsborough.

  I would like to think that we could meet again in the not to
  distance future.   I have enjoyed our conversations together, and
  I hope that you feel free to give me a ring.    Perhaps make some
  sort of arrangement. In the meantime God Bless You, take care of
  yourself, and don*t work too hard.


  Sincerely.




                                                                                  nHlSS'U

      Dear Maire

      Please find enclosed a copy of the research proposal prepared


      I understand from        that the Rowntree Trust has agreed to
      a grant of £150,06u ror the two year study. This will not
      include the organisational study as they have requested the
      research be broadened to include a corporative element. As I
      have yet to receive written confirmation I cannot be more
      specific about the details at this stage but will keep you
      informed of developments. There will be a need as the work
      begins to look at ways of financing the development work.

      I am sure you will agree this is really good news and a fitting
      end to a difficult year.

      I hope you are well and have a restful Christmas and happy new
      year.

      Best wishes.

                             SUMMARY



The proposed research     and development study will focus on
evaluating the services    provided by the Merseyside consortium
of social    services      departments    in  response to    the
Hillsborough disaster     and identify the practice elements
required at all levels    in order to respond to such disasters
effectively.

Aims of the Project   The aims of the project are to:-

*   evaluate,    from    the  user's    perspective, the
     effectiveness of the services provided, by statutory
     and   voluntary   sectors,   in   response   to the
     Hillsborough disaster   with particular emphasis on
    Merseyside.

*   to    describe and compare the    ways    in which they
     organised services in response to the    disaster,  and
     to analyse the organisational elements   and management
     performance that aided or hindered       the effective
     delivery of services

*   organise exchange activities with those engaged in
     similar work and to identify the knowledge, skills
     and methods of work required by staff

*   devise training and organisational development
     materials appropriate for Social Services Departments
     and other welfare agencies and develop information
     packs suitable for professionals       and agencies
     requiring such information when disasters strike in
     the future.

The work proposed is in two phases over three years.      The
first phase consists of three interrelated research studies;
a User Study - examining the benefit of the services to
users;   an Organisation Study - concentrating on the
management practice in responding to a disaster; and a Staff
Care Study will identify the knowledge, skills and methods of
work required of front line staff.

The second phase, based on the research findings, will use
'practice exchange' activities in order to identify the major
social work practice and management issues learnt from this
and other disasters. It is anticipated that   this work will
produce training and development material based on research
and experience which will have major implications for social
services departments responding to disasters, also smaller
crises and, eventually, social work education and training.

Funding is sought for both phases. The research phase is
proposed to be completed in two years whilst the development
and dissemination phase would continue into a third year.

                               Research and Development
                                             Outline



Background


It    is    in    the     nature       of    disasters,      such    as    the    one     at
Hillsborough,             that    they       occur     unexpectedly,       that     their
specific         form    cannot    be predicted,          that    they    create       great
personal distress on those who survive and on the bereaved,
and also         that they place much strain                 on    the    organisations
which have to deal with the disaster immediately and those
that deal with its later consequences.                            It is also       in the
nature of such disasters that they are outside the experience
of most people.                Thus planning           to deal with them can only
provide      a    framework which,             given    individual       circumstances,
may be more or less helpful.


The ideas set out in this paper from Practice and Development
Exchange         (PADE)    at the       National       Institute     for Social         Work
stem       from     a     request       from        Merseyside      Social       Services
Departments         to     have     their      response     to    the     Hillsborough
disaster evaluated.                Crucial work is currently taking place
and    they       are     urgently       seeking       feedback     in    the    form     of
evaluation of their activities so that they can adjust their
response and make the services they offer more effective.                                 We
have therefore devised a research and development study with
this in mind


The    paper      outlines         ideas      for    research     into    the     overall
effectiveness             of     the    social       services      response       to     the
Hillsborough            disaster       and    proposals     for   development          work.


                                                1
Thi-s    will    provide        immediate            help    to    those       working          in
Merseyside and essential information to agencies involved in
the aftermath of future disasters.                       The work will be carried
out through          a partnership between the                 Institute's Research
and Practice          and    Development Exchange Units                  and    Merseyside
authorities.


The Institute's Research Unit has a long history of applied
research        in     personal          social       services.           Practice             and
Development          Exchange      (PADE)      was     established        in        1982    with
support from the Joseph Rowntree Memorial                             Trust to provide
information about innovations                       in the    field of social              care,
promote development work and the diffusion of new methods of
practice.


Exchange activities have led to the establishment of NISWIS -
the     Institute's         information        service       within     the     Institute's
library,     - a network            of    information         officers         (SSIN)          and
information providing organisations                         (SWING).      PADE has also
developed       two    major       DoH    funded      projects      -    'The       Community
Social Work Exchange'                and       'The Research            into    Practice'.
These exchanges have brought together expert practitioners,
managers        and    researchers            to     develop      new    approaches             to
practice,       to     establish          networks      throughout            the     U.K.      to
support     innovatory         practice        and     management,        and       to     create
training materials.                 There are now 21               PADE publications
including        directories             of   innovatory          projects,          training
material, descriptions of new practice, analyses and initial
evaluations of developments activities.                           Earlier this year we
published        an    account       of       work    undertaken         following             the
Hungerford murders.



Aims of the Project


The aims of the study are to:-


*     evaluate,         from       the         user's        perspective,                the
        effectiveness         of    the       services provided,               by        the
        statutory and voluntary sectors, in response to                                  the


                                                2
     Hillsborough disaster            with a particular emphasis on
     Merseyside


*    to     describe      and compare        the    ways     in    which     they
     organised services in response to the disaster,                             and
     to    analyse     the      organisational         elements           and    the
     management       performance         of       staff     that        aided    or
     hindered the effective delivery of services


*    organise    exchange       activities      with       those    engaged       in
     similar    work      and    identify      knowledge,           skills       and
     methods of work required by staff


*    devise     training        and    organisational              development
     materials appropriate for Social Services Departments
     and   other welfare         agencies      and    develop       information
     packs     suitable         for   professionals              and     agencies
     requiring such information when disasters strike                             in
     the future.


The work proposed is in two phases over three years.                                    The
first phase consists of three interrelated research studies;
the second is a development and dissemination phase.                             Funding
is sought for both phases. The research phase is proposed to
be   completed       in   two     years      whilst    the        development           and
dissemination phase would continue into the third year.



The Research Studies


The effectiveness of any social work service depends on the
skills     and methods       adopted    by     those   who        come    into    direct
contact with members             of the public             who    require        help    of
themselves or in supporting others.                    Three interrelated and
crucial factors have emerged from our discussions with senior
staff from Merseyside social services departments.


*    the abilities of staff to respond appropriately;


*    the    steps    they    took,     in     partnership          with     other


                                          3
    ■agencies, to organise services;

*      the management          and supervision given to                        front    line
       staff.


This    understanding          has       led    to      the    three       studies      proposed
namely:-         a    'User Study';            an    'Organisation Study';               and      a
'Staff Care Study'.


'User' Study.                       Much of the literature about disasters
suggests        that most          of those          involved        need       some    form     of
debriefing or counselling.                      Some,         particularly amongst              the
bereaved and survivors, may need longer term help in coming
to terms with the extraordinary experience,                                or alternatively
transforming           it    into        something            that    does       not     intrude
destructively into the person's ordinary life.


This study will describe the nature                             and scope           of the work
practitioners           have       been        engaged         in    and       are     currently
undertaking           and    evaluate          the      use    made       of    them    by,     and
benefits        to,    the    survivors         and      bereaved.             We    propose     to
analyse the           information contained               in the national               Helpline
database in terms of the problems noted and service outcomes
and interview in depth a sample of users of both the Helpline
and local counselling services.


Senior staff on Merseyside                     are keen to know why those who
could    have        used    the    services, set              up    in    response      to     the
disaster, have not done so.                     We will explore the feasibility
of tracing such people                   in order to           explore this            issue.    (A
preliminary draft outline of this study is appended).


Organisation Study.                      The Hillsborough disaster is unique
in this country in that the events unfurled in the course of
a national event - the FA Cup semi final, held in Sheffield,
between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC.                                      Thousands of
spectators at the ground saw it happen and countless others
watched it live on television.                          There is no way of tracing
all those who were             'involved'           in the tragedy.                 However,    the
majority        of     those       who   died        or narrowly          survived       and the


                                                    4
    bereaved   came        from the    Merseyside         region which            includes      a

•
mixture of metropolitan and county authorities.


One     of     the     immediate        problems          was     co-ordinating               the
multiplicity of social services, other authorities and local
politicians in order that an efficient and effective response
could be mounted for the ongoing care for the survivors, the
bereaved        and     others       affected        by     the     disaster           in     the
Merseyside region.


This study will appraise the work of the 'Inter Agency Forum'
which was set up on Merseyside to co-ordinate responses to
the disaster.               This forum now has representatives from the

various        other        social    services,        health           and    educational
authorities including that from Sheffield and Nottingham.


The study will describe how it was set up and analyse those
elements       in     the    organisation       and management             that       aided    or
hindered the effective provision of services that were seen
to be needed.           It will compare the work of the Inter Agency
Forum with the response of the two other locations from which
spectators          were    likely    to     come;   Sheffield,          the     city which
hosted       the      game,    and    Nottingham,           the    home        city    of     the
opposing side in the match.                   (A preliminary draft outline is
set out in the appendix).


Staff     Care       Study.                    As    part    of    the        management       of
services set up in response to a disaster, it is important to
understand the extent to which staff feel they were prepared
for     the work        involved      and were managerially                   supported       and
adequately           supervised        in    doing     it.        The    problem        to     be
addressed        is    whether       staff    felt    they        had    the     skills       and
training required or whether the demands                            being placed upon
them were outside their range of experience.                             Associated with
this is the extent to which various forms of supervision were
felt by staff to be sufficient.                      In addition to the training

   and    special       arrangements        set       up    by    the       social        services
^^authorities, the local British Association of Social Workers
   (BASW)      established special          supervision facilities                       for staff
   working with members of the public.


   This    study will          examine that nature               of    the    problems       dealt
   with by staff, analyse the knowledge and skills required to
   deal     with    those       problems     and       assess         the     nature       of     the
   managerial       support       and    supervision          required         and       given.    In
   essence it would adopt a practice exchange approach in order
   to     gain     this        information.          (A     preliminary             outline        is
   appended).



   Links with 'Cruse'


   We    have    been     in    contact    with       the     Disasters           Working    Party
   funded by the Department of Health, undertaken and hosted by
   Cruse.        It is anticipated that our research and development
   activities       will       complement     the         Cruse       Working      Party     which
   concentrates on the psychological and social aspects of the
   several       disasters,        which have happened                  in the       last        five
   years, and their             terms of reference include the response by
   all emergency authorities.                They will not be evaluating the
   response to the Hillsborough disaster.



   Development and Dissemination


   Reports on the study will be produced and disseminated in the
   usual way both to the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust and to
   those who participated in the research.                             However,          the major
   dissemination          effort,       in the       second      phase       of    the    project,
   will    centre upon exchange activities                        and the production               of
   information       and       training    materials          for      those      working        with
   disasters in the future.               During the course of the second and
   into the third year we intend to:-


   *      bring together practitioners                      and managers           involved
          in    other     recent    disasters         throughout            the    U.K.     to

     research        findings        emerging         from    the      Hillsborough
     studies.        Networks of such staff already exist on an
     informal     basis        with participants              offering help            and
     support.        Some of these people are also linked into
     the    Disasters        Working        Party.         Our     activities         will
     look specifically at the practice issues, that is the
     knowledge,skills and methods of work that are needed
     by    counselling          staff      working      with       members       of    the
     public.              The        findings          from         the        proposed
     organisational and support studies together with the
     experience of others elsewhere,                        will be reviewed to
     identify        the       key    elements         which        promoted          good
     counselling practice.

     base    of   relevant           information            including           training
     materials         and      descriptions           of     practice           methods
     relevant to people in the aftermath of disasters


*   establish          working            groups      on      specific           issues

     processes       to    identify record and publish the major
     lessons      to      be    learnt        for      practice         development
     including         social        work    training         and      professional
     education in this field


*   work with        practitioners           and      managers       to    write      and
     publish      examples           of    their      work,      and      to    use   the
     research        findings         and        exchange          activities          to
     identify characteristics                    of exemplary practice


*   if appropriate,            to establish a data                 base    of people

     of    training       and    organisational             consultancy          in    the
     event of future disasters.


The above work will yield a number of publications covering
both the research elements and the training and development

           to the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust on completion of the
           third year.


           It is also     intended that the           results would be shared with
           other bodies involved in disaster research,                  for example, the
           'Disaster      Prevention     and   Limitation          Unit'       at    Bradford
           University and the 'Disasters Working Party' hosted by Cruse.


           Timing


           The planned length of the research phase of the study is two
           years    from the     appointment      of a project          director;            the
    (      development and dissemination is planned to take the project
           into a third year.


           Since    the effects      of being involved           in the Hillsborough
           Disaster may continue         for some time yet,          it would be very
           advantageous     to be able to start soon.             In summary

           Staffing


           It is envisaged that a project officer together with research
           and   secretarial     assistance     will     be    required        in    order    to
           undertake      the   whole    project.        The    value     of    having       two
           researchers undertake this work lies in the speed with which
           the work needs to be accomplished                  and in the crucial need
           for support in this highly stressful field of research.                            We
           are   also   proposing       that   such     staff    need   to     experienced
           researchers in order to deal with the nature of the subject

                                USER STUDY


        Introduction

        Two main services have been set up by the Inter Agency Forum
        on Merseyside as a result of the Hillsborough disaster: a
        national telephone Helpline initially staffed with volunteer
        counsellors from social services and voluntary organisation;
        and a longer term local counselling service staffed by social
        workers.   It is hoped that a permanent regional centre will
        be established.

        The question of how far the services provided in response to
        the Hillsborough disaster met the needs of those who used
        them is of critical importance for the people caught up in
    (   the disaster.    It is, however, equally important to the
        service providers to know in what respects the resources
        allocated were effective.

        In attempting to evaluate the effectiveness and quality of
        services provided it will be important to bear in mind the
        different range of problems presented and the different
        nature of the services created and used.    For example, some
        may have used the Helpline just once and not have used it
        again, as far as can be known; others may have used the
        national Helpline to gain information about relatives who
        were at the match and later needed assistance with
        bereavement or other forms of counselling; yet others, having
        survived the disaster, may have needed help in learning to
        cope with that experience.    Furthermore the sensitivity of
        the initial contact may have had an important bearing on
        whether or not people returned for further 'counselling'.

        Aims.
(
        The aims of this study are to:-

        *   describe the nature of the problems for which the
            national telephone Helpline was used and the service
            outcomes

        *   describe from users' perspectives the nature of    the
            problems stemming from the Hillsborough disaster   and
            describe how they evaluate the services provided

        *   appraise the services provided in the light of the
            perceived needs of the users and various outcome
            measures.

        Method.

        The   study would   be conducted in two parts. Part 1 would
        analyse information on the Helpline database in terms of the
        problems noted and the outcome as far as that service was
        concerned.    The national telephone Helpline based in


                                      12
j ^ M e r s e y s i d e has a computerised record system. Initial
^^discussions with senior members of the Inter Agency Forum
    have indicated that it would be possible to gain access to
    this database for these research purposes. The counselling
     services have separate and to some extent overlapping
     records.

  Part 2 would comprise in depth interviews with a sample of
  the users of the different services that had been established
  by the Inter Agency Forum. If practicable we would also
  compare the effectiveness of these services with that of
  services received by people elswhere; for example, some of
  the bereaved came from the south of England.


  It is anticipated that, in terms of service take up, it will
  be possible to use the Helpline database as a sampling frame
  to   create four distinct groups of people and interview in
  depth up to fifty people in each category.

  *    Those who contacted the Helpline and were recommended
        for further counselling at a local level and took it
        up.

   *   Those who contacted the Helpline and were recommended
        for further counselling at a local level and did not
        take it up.

   *   Those who contacted the         Helpline and were    not
        recommended f o r :further counselling at a local level
        but sought it and took it up.

   *   Those who contacted the      Helpline and were    not
        recommended for further counselling at a local level
        and did not seek it.

  In addition, some people reached the counselling services,
  other than through the Helpline.       It may therefore be
  necessary to create a fifth group of people who used
  counselling services but did not use the Helpline.

  In terms of the sorts of people, it would seem that there
  would be three main groups of people who would make demands
  on the special services:

   *   the bereaved

   *   the survivors from the disaster site        itself (that is the
        Leppings Lane enclosure)

   *   witnesses of   the   disaster   both   at   the   ground   and   on
       television.

  There are a number of comparisons which could prove useful
  including those between users and non users of the Helpline;
  between those who used counselling services and those who
  didn't; between those who used the special services and those
  who used 'normal' services elsewhere; between the bereaved
  and both the survivors and the witnesses.
    It has also been suggested by senior staff of the Inter

    •
    Agency Forum that it would be useful to include in this stady
    a sample of people who were at the match but who did not use
    any of the services.
    contacing such people.
                             We will explore the feasibility of


    Measuring independently the outcome of contact with the
    Helpline   and   further     counselling   services  will   be
    problematic.    Not only will it be difficult to ascribe
    particular outcome to the service interventions but the
    consequences of being involved in a disaster may take some
    time to emerge.     However,      it would seem, in the first
    instance, that the following measures would be useful.
    First, whether or not there had been a 'progression' from the
    special services to hospital in patient treatment.      Second
    whether as a result of the disaster people had become
    estranged from their families of origin or generation even to
    the extent of separation or divorce; third evidence of
    continued personal disorganisation, for example, increased or
    sudden financial debt; fourth, the length of time off work or
(   indeed resignation from work; fifth, changes in the people in
    personal networks; sixth, in view of the expected youth of
    some respondents, whether respondents 'dropped out'         of
    school or college; the length of time taken off school or
    college and whether it was felt that exam results were
    adversely affected.

    The nature of these interviews, both in terms of content and
    type of people to be interviewed, require experienced staff.
    It is proposed that there should be two researchers which
    will increase the speed with which the work can be
    accomplished and who will be able to support each other
    during the course of the fieldwork.     Supervision will be
    provided by the Director of PADE and research consultancy is
    available.

    Timing.

    It is expected that this study would take one year.   It is
    envisaged that the organisational study would be undertaken
    first as necessary background to this study.     This study
    would therefore start in the first year but carry over
    somewhat into the second.

                            ORGANISATIONAL STUDY.

      Introduction
      Emergency services are by definition designed to cope with
      the immediate impact of disasters of varying magnitudes -
      that is to cope with the control, rescue and treatment and
      immediate care of those caught up in disasters. Social
      services authorities have responsibilities for the ongoing
      social care of those affected. However, the 'victims' of the
      Hillsborough disaster came from all over the Merseyside
      region and beyond.  The various authorities on Merseyside had
      to collaborate in order to create a coherent response to the
      tragedy, and to provide an efficient and effective service to
      those who needed help in coping with the disaster.

      They had no specific operational links at a metropolitan or
      regional level with each other or with other service
( ‘   authorities.  However, the day after the tragedy, a Sunday,
      what later became known as the 'Inter Agency Forum' met for
      the first time and started to plan and implement a co­
      ordinated response.

      Aims.

      The organisation study will examine work of the Inter Agency
      Forum in terms of how the social services authorities
      responded to the crisis of having a disaster on its hands
      which, while it took place in Sheffield, had consequences for
      people primarily on Merseyside, and to some extent in
      Nottingham and Sheffied.  The Inter Agency Forum is attended
      by staff not only from seven Merseyside authorities but also
      from Nottingham County and Sheffield City social services
      departments.     In examining the work of the Inter Agency
      Forum, there will be some scope for comparisons between
      authorities

      The     study aims to:-

      *     describe the process by which the 'Inter Agency
            Forum'   was  set up,  is   maintained and,  if
            appropriate, disbanded

      *     analyse the issues and problems of using inter agency
            collaboration as a means of setting up and running
            services of a longer term nature

      *     appraise the work of the 'Inter Agency Forum' in
            terms of the services it provided and the speed with
            which it was able to respond.


      Methods.

      There will be two main sources of data; the record/minutes of
      meetings concerning the 'Inter Agency Forum' (some of which
      have already been made available) and interviews with key
      actors for example those responsible for setting up and


                                      15
^^running the 'Inter Agency Forum'.

  In addition, it will also be necessary to interview those in
  the constituent agencies both officers and members in order
  to gain a perspective on the difficulties in implementing
  'decisions' made by. an ad hoc body which technically had no
  decision making powers and was not formally accountable to
  anyone.   In Sheffield and Nottingham a more limited approach
  will be pursued since staff from both those authorities have
  participated in or are still part of the Inter Agency Forum.
  This will amount in total to approximately 70 - 80
  interviews.

  The key areas of concern are likely to be:

      how the predecessor to the Inter Agency Forum' was
      set up; getting the relevant people to attend;
      operating in a context when information about what
      had happened and what to do about it was scarce;
      gaining access to appropriate advice; perceptions
      about the key issues to be dealt with; setting up,
      organising, staffing and funding of 'extra' services;
      involvement of 'youth' in the disaster; support for
      staff; issues of implementing locally 'agreements'
      made in the Inter Agency Forum;   issues of providing
      separate/specialist or integrated/generic services;
      personal coping strategies; perceived benefits
      accruing.

  Outcomes.

  There are three expected outcomes from this study

      lessons learnt from this experience which could be of
      benefit to other organisations which have to deal
      with a disaster.

      the application of the lessons learnt from close
      liaison work, during the crisis period, to the
      everyday relationships with other agencies

      the application of the need for 'special' staff
      support for those dealing with the disaster to other
      types of crisis in social services (e.g. taking
      children into care or death of a child in care)

  Timing.

  It is anticipated that this study would be completed within
  six months and would be undertaken first.

  Resources.

  As with the other studies it is anticipated that two members
  of staff would be required.

                      STAFF CARE STUDY.

Introduction
The Hillsborough disaster necessitated using social work
counselling staff from social services and voluntary
organisations from many parts of the Merseyside region on
special duties for varying lengths of time. These included
the national telephone Helpline      and the setting up of
special teams or other arrangements to deal with referrals
from the Helpline and elsewhere.   All counselling staff, no
matter how experienced, need some measure of supervision and
support to enable them to continue to respond appropriately
to the crises of others and manage complex human relations.
At the interface with clients, dealing with the consequences
of a disaster would appear to create stress amongst two sets
of staff.    First, staff who counsel those with individual
crises, and second,     team leaders and area managers who
supervise and manage.

The front line counsellors may be or perhaps may feel
themselves to be ill prepared for working with these types of
crises whilst team leaders and area managers may not know
what type of management support should be made available to
counselling staff and also the added problem of dealing with
the workload of those who have taken on the special duties.
The local BASW office has also established a confidential
supervision and support service to counselling staff.


Aims.

The aims of this study are to:-

*   analyse the nature of the 'client' problems as seen
     by staff who worked on the Helpline and other special
     local counselling services

*   analyse and appraise the nature of the    supervision
     offered to the two groups of staff

*   analyse the knowledge, skills and methods of work
     required for dealing with the 'victims' of disasters
     and those required for supervising staff in such
     tasks.


Methods.

It is intended to undertake this study by means of a series
of 'practice exchanges' in which those who participated in
the various services are brought together to exchange their
experience and practice.     The precise number of group
exchanges will not be known until more detailed information
is available about the numbers of staff who participated in
the different aspects of the special services.  However, it
is proposed that there should be the following types of
exchanges:-



                              17
    one involving social work or other staff who gave a
    front line service to 'victims' via the Helpline

*   one involving social work or other staff who gave a
     front line service to 'victims' via the longer term
     but local counselling services

*   one concerned with first line managers,  frequently
     called team leaders, who gave support to the front
     line staff

*   one concerned with the next tier of management,
     frequently called area managers, to identify the
    management practice issues of working in the context
     of a disaster: for example, managing the workloads of
     those absent on the special services; managing staff
    who may feel second class because not asked to
     undertake special duties; supervising and supporting
     the team leaders of the special services

*   one concerned with the nature of support given by
     agencies or people outside the 'home' organisation,
     for example BASW.

It is anticipated that there would have to be up to six
meetings of each group and that for some there would have be
groups in the different social services departments and other
organisations that provided special services.    For example,
whilst there might be a single 'group' concerned with
assessing the nature of the problems and skills required to
work on the Helpline, there would probably need to be several
groups to cover the different social services departments
that set up special teams to deal with the ongoing work.

Timing.

It is     expected   that this study would take   one   year.

Outcomes

The main outcomes from this study will be an understanding of
the skills training and supervision required in the face of a
disaster.   Such material could be transformed into training
material for use in the face of disasters.    In addition, on
the assumption that crises highlight general skills that
workers ought to have, then the material would become of
general interest to; social work training and education.   It
may also feed into the everyday practice of supporting
working in the face of equally acute but less general crises
- for example the death of a child in care.

Resources

It is anticipated that two members of staff will be required
both of whom would need to be experienced staff for dealing
with groups and be able to analyse material from group
settings.  The necessity for two members of staff rests on
the nature of the work to be undertaken and the need to
undertake such work quickly.

  Dear Michael


  It was good to see you recently and am pleased to hear that life is still
  treating you well.

  I promised to let you know to whom I think it might be appropriate for you to
  write relating to your experience in supporting and training Merseyside
  personnel in relation to the Hillsborough tragedy.

   Mr Utting, Chief Inspector came to Merseyside in August 1989 to meet Directors
   on Merseyside and also to meet members of the counselling teams which have been
   set up around Merseyside.         He was impressed by the similarities and differences
   between the teams approach but was particularly struck by the support and
^ ^ r a m e w o r k which had been offered to staff both in giving them some confidence in
®Hiow to operate and also in understanding the context in which they were
   operating.         This framework seemed to have agoae-from your involvement in
   Hillsborough and your presence quickly after the tragedy.

  I think I indicated to you that SSI is represented on the CRUSE working party
  and there have been some discussions concerning the role of social services
  departments and other agencies following tragedies such as Hillsborough.

  I think a letter to Bill Utting would be very helpful.  You might indicate that
  you are aware from your conversation with me that he had been to Merseyside in
  August and that he was aware of your role as a consultant soon after the tragedy
  and your role as trainer of staff and members of authorities.  You could say
  that I had suggested that he may be interested in your observations from your
  experience in Merseyside and with other authorities around the country.

  A copy of your letter to Mr Utting, if you do decide to write to him, would be
  much appreciated.

  With best wishes for 1990.

  Kind regards

  Yours sincerely

           H T T ,T   KRTRffJGH DISASTER - VISIT TO MERSEYSIEE 1 AUGUST 1989

           1.         As you will recall Mr Harrison and I accompanied Mr Utting, Chief
                       Inspector SSI, on a visit to Merseyside in August to meet with the
                       special teams established in Wirral, Sefton and Khowsley to assist
                       bereaved families and survivors of the Hillsborough football disaster;
                       the staff at the central Help Line and the long term counselling team
                       appointed in Liverpool.

           2.         I promised to let you have copies of notes I made arising from the
                      visits, these are attached.

           3.         They indicate same interesting differences as well as fundamental
                       similarities.  All teams were engaged in preventive social work and
                      members described themselves as being involved in same form of
                      preventive mental health work though teams varied in the extent to
                      which they emphasised this.

           4.         A recurring theme which emerged from discussions was the importance of
                      the disaster consultant (crisis psychology) who had provided an
                       immediate structure for action which gave members and officers same
                      confidence and direction. The early orientation training provided all
                      involved with a shared framework in which to understand and respond to
                      the situation and encouraged a co-ordinated approach. Michael Stewart's
                      influence was constantly referred to during the visit; particularly his
                      prediction of the course of reactions to the disaster over a period of
                      time of victims, helpers, officials and local politicians.

           5.         Mr Utting commented that aspects of the experience deserved systematic
                      recording and evaluation.      He has provided key personnel in the
                      Department with his comments and a brief description of the work of the
                      teams compiled from the notes he made on the day.

1 The team was housed in acccaniriodation at the back of the old Town Hall.

2 The team leader and five social workers were all well experienced and
  with mental health backgrounds (one included hospital social work and
  another CRUSE).

3 An explicit mental health approach - bereavement and grief counselling
  appeared to be adopted.

4 Initially staff were called out of district teams to set up the
  specialist team.    Firstly they dealt with a wide range of practical
  problems besetting bereaved families and survivors. The initial rush of
  referrals fell away to be followed by families and survivors returning
  with longer term problems relating to grief.

5 Seventy-one active cases.      Consideration being given to setting up
  groups.

6 Good working relationships were described with health authority staff
  and GPs.

7 Growth of tranquilisers prescribed by GPs had been noted.

8   Identified need to work with probation and police.

9 Members valued working as a team and stressed the importance of mutual
  support. Valued debriefing.

10 Concern was expressed about case loads left behind.

11 Team members referred to the importance of actually visiting
   Hillsborough to actually better understand the disaster - get the
   context.



    SEETCN

1 A team leader and three social workers operated from the top floor of an
  elderly persons home. They were ASWs and one had hospital experience.
  The team leader had selected the team himself.

2 The team leader indicated he had been quickly converted to the need for
  staff to be proactive in approach.

3 Events such as funerals, coroners courts etc provided an errtre for
  social workers and gave them credibility.

4 The team were mutually supportive, highly motivated and regarded
  themselves as being privileged to work in the way they were allowed to.

5 They were self contained - choosing not to seek support outside their
  group other than through the BASW staff line. They chose to ignore past
  records on any referrals who may have been or were currently still
  clients of the SSD.

6 A lull in referrals after the first impact was experienced.
2.7 The team were currently working with 15 bereaved families and a number
    of survivors. Two bereaved families were being supported by Liverpool
    Catholic Social Services.

2.8 Team members were losing pictorial information and videos in working with
    individuals. A personal account written by a 'client' was proving very
    helpful in assisting others to work through their feeling and to
    verbalise.

2.9 Team members highlighted the importance of visiting Hillsborough.

2.10 Team members were aware of the large number of potential 'clients'.
     Letters had been sent to many as part of a proactive approach.

2.11 40 people had been identified for further follow up work.

2.12 Two EWOs linked to the team initially to work with young people in
     school.

2.13 The team had been funded until 31 March 1990.



3.    KNOWSLEY

3.1 The team which was set up very quickly after the disaster consisted of
    four people vfrio were 'pulled out' of other posts with a co-ordinator and
    administrative support.

3.2   They were located in the staff house of an elderly persons home.

3.3    Team members saw themselvesas an integral part of the SSD and referred
      to the support they had      had from the total department including
      political support from members. The team was reviewed every six months
      re its continuation.

3.4 Team members visited all 13 bereaved families in the first week.

3.5 High 'member' interest in the Hillsborough disaster. Funerals had been
    turned into civic events - the Mayor attended them all.

3.6 Positive outreach approach adopted by the team members.

3.7   215 referrals. Team members had identified 2,000 from the area vfao had
      gone to the football match.

3.8 A public meeting was held - 80 to 100 people attended.       People stayed
    behind to talk and share experiences.

3.9 Support was being offered to a lady from Wales vfrio was feeling isolated
    and out of the supportive culture being experienced in Merseyside.

3.10 Letters had not been as effective as visits. Team members had learnt
     from Michael Stewart the need to be proactive and they had been prepared
     to keep going back to houses to visit potential 'clients'.

3.11 The importance of debriefing was stressed.

3.12 Team members identified the possibility of self help groups and also the
     potential for group work.
    *

#
        3.13 The authority had had a "drop-in" centre initially. It had not been
             very active as there was a tendency for supporters to gravitate to the
             "drop-in" centre in Liverpool nearer to Anfield.

        3.14 Some contact with other health professionals.

        3.15 Involvement not seen particularly in terms of preventative mental health
             work.

        3.16 Plans for social work members of team to be relocated back into areas,
             tap into local resources and key back into mainstream work.

        3.17 Team members favoured some inter-agency meetings of core team members
             for mutual support and learning.



        4.    LIVERPOOL

        4.1 Met the Assistant Director and four of the appointed team members of the
            post-Hillsborough team. They were operating from Johnson Street in the
            same office as the helpline having not yet moved to their new premises.

        4.2   Liverpool had adopted a different approach to other local authorities.
              Initially district teams had dealt with referrals received by the
              helpline.

        4.3   Funding had been obtained for a specially appointed team of 12 social
              workers on a permanent basis to deal with crisis work post-
              Hillsborough and other crisis work. Staff had applied for these posts
              and were appointed after interview.

        4.4   Problems in negotiating cases were being experienced with districts
              where cases were being transferred over where an ongoing commitment was
              necessary.   Team members were beginning to experience a revival of
              referrals which was the case in other local authorities.

        4.5 Team members had hospital social work backgrounds, mental health work
            and group work experience. The team wanted to get a psychologist to
            work with them, particularly to help with young people.

        4.6 The team was viewed as integrated into the department and the members
            felt it was important to avoid elitism. They wished to be a resource
            for the whole of the department. They were a highly motivated group;
            enthusiastic and well experienced. They talked about work to be done
            with families of all classes.    Counselling involved a wider group of
            individuals than many social workers had experienced in area teams.
            Hospital social workers referred to their experience of a wider range of
            clients.

        4.7 Team members reported the importance of good administrative and clerical
            back up.
4.8 Helpline

    This was now manned by volunteers.   Co-ordinated by Walton Hospital
    volunteers.   Referrals were down to 7 to 10 a day but same very
    difficult problems were emerging.

SKFl'hMBEP 1QRQ MhWI'IMG WTTH              WIRRAL SSD

1.   Purpose of meeting - to discuss Derek's views concerning training in
     relation to management of the aftermath of disasters and in relation to
     counselling.

2.          informed me that two posts had now been created in relation to
     training. One accountable to the regional training unit and a Liverpool
     post based in Cherry House.

3.   Impact of disaster

           indicated that it is important for people to understand the impact
     of a disaster on staff who were put in the position of making decisions
     and taking actions. From his experience, it was possible to delegate
     decision making quickly and for staff to make decisions and to be
     supported.   As time goes on more accountability is built in and the
     decision process becomes more complicated. He indicated it is important
     to realise the different momentum in the aftermath of disasters and in
     relation to this, staff need to be prepared for the obvious changes
     that come about both in the degree to which they will continue to be
     allowed to make decisions and enjoy autonomy and the degree to which
     they will be protected in their roles. Changes do come about and staff
     need to understand them. In this respect,          felt it was important
     that each local authority had been able to designate a member of staff
     who had the delegated authority to take decisions and to act quickly but
     also to be relieved of other responsibilities. Because he was in this
     post himself he identified with the problems of moving back into a
     previous mode where he no longer enjoyed the same degree of autonomy.
     He felt that management too needed help in moving to a different stage
     post-crisis.

4.   Role of voluntary organisations

     With hindsight        felt that the co-ordinating group had not managed
     very well the involvement of the vol orgs. They could have been brought
     in earlier and they do indeed have skills and resources which could be
     utilised at an earlier stage.      There is evidence in many teams of
     clients being transferred over to voluntary workers. It is important
     that the clients' consent is obtained.       If voluntary agencies are
     involved at an earlier stage this transfer would not then be necessary.
     Seme staff were obliged to hand over cases because of other conflicting
     demands on their time.

5.   Crisis psychology training

           felt that this was important and would recommend it for other
     agencies attempting to co-ordinate services following a disaster. It
     ensured a sense of ownership across disciplines.
6.    Debriefing

      In relation to the above caraments about the different inodes of
      operation,        felt that there should be a debriefing for senior
      managers and politicians.

7.    Specific training

      With hindsight        felt that an aspect missing in the training which
      staff had received was the context of the disaster. In this case the
      whole business of 'football'; the physiology of the disaster.        He
      referred to problems in co-ordinating with the police and difficulty in
      obtaining information. Those helping clients need to be familiar with
      the football clubs, the terraces, the Hillsborough ground, the football
      ethos in order to really help clients to work through same of their
      problems. The importance of the context of the disaster would apply in
      a different way to a different sort of disaster. People working with
      Hillsborough victims need to understand what football means to them and
      many people on Merseyside.

8.    Specialist training

      In relation to training,       Iso identified the particular modules of
      training which staff needed to be familiar with in order to provide
      areas of specialist help.    Examples of these were knowledge of the
      Coroner's court and specialist training on the impact of the death of
      young children.

9.    Nature of post-Hillsborouah training

      This had taken place in six 3 day sessions.     The representation had
      been across the local authorities. The advantage of this was that this
      was a fair system and created liaison across local authorities. The
      problems however were that it meant that only a portion of each of the
      teams were trained at the initial stages and there were problems
      initially in getting teams working together.

10.   Membership of teams

            |was not sure whether there should be constant membership of frftamg
      or whether there should be a topping up system to allow people to move
      on.     He felt that the debriefing of team members following other
      experiences and counselling was very important and very necessary. In
      his view core teams should have access to weekly or fortnightly support
      groups. Ideally there should be an external facilitator.

11.   BftSW's role

      The outside staff line operated by                 by BASW had been
      invaluable. He felt that the support for staff should be available at
      the start of a post disaster response.

12.   Training for debriefers

            felt that there should be a specialised training module for staff
      operating as debriefers for counsellors.
«
    13.   Regional unit

          It appeared that the post-Hillsborough unit would be up and running.
                was concerned that there should be links between the existing
          inter-authority co-ordinating group and the new management group. The
          need for some kind of continuity was important.

    14.   Future activity

          It was likely that other local authorities would experience disasters
          and        was in favour of there being a nominated lead Director in the
          region with seconded staff available to work across boundaries and move
          in to other local authorities to assist them in setting up a disaster
          response vising the experience gained from Hillsborough.

    15.   Role of SSI

                |was enthusiastic for SSI to have a view about the role of social
          services in co-ordinating a counselling response following disasters and
          to take a lead regionally and nationally.

                A note about the proposed staffing structure of the
                Hillsborough Regional Unit was circulated and accepted
                by the Group. It was agreed that each representative be
                                                                              All to note.

                It was agreed that more detailed consideration be given
                at a future meeting, when representatives have had the
                opportunity of reading the report and examining all the

STAFFING


Various alternatives have been considered and it is now proposed to link
functions together in order to promote - operational action on helpline
                                       - outreach work
                                       - training
                                       - staff support.


These tasks must be managed to produce a cohesive service able to respond to
changing circumstances and co-ordinated with the many other agencies and groups
who' have roles relative to the Hillsborough Disaster.

                     - Outreach Work Development Officer


The Unit Manager will also co-ordinate the staff support system currently
provided through B.A.S.W. although it is important that the staff support worker
is not in a managerial line in order to avoid staff anxiety.

There are various other tasks which require to be carried out at this senior

services.
                                          1

Other local authorities need to be 'encouraged' to provide appropriately for
disaster victims either directly or through local voluntary agencies.

There are also developments of   - the Newsletter
                                 - Drop In Centre.


The Newsletter is developing a rolo as a means of keeping people affected by
Hillsborough in touch with each other.   The production of copy and material for
the letter requires a consistent input.   The Drop In Centre planned for the
vicinity of Anfield will have a high level of control devolved to families who are

   Dear Ms.

                                   The Hillsborough Disaster

        I would like to confirm the commitment of the local authorities involved
   in providing the service response to Hillsborough to the pressing need for a
   systematic evaluative research project.   There is a requirement for this evaluation
   to be conducted by an independent agency of high standing.   It is for these reasons
   that the National Institute for Social Work was approached to undertake a study into
   the effectiveness of the response.

        The approach taken by the Institute in formulating their outline is supported
   by the Social Services Authorities and we would wish the study to begin as soon as
   possible.   I can also assure you that there is a high level of commitment to both
   service delivery and evaluation, so there would be excellent co-operation at all
   levels in Social Services Departments.

        I do hope that the Trust will feel able to support and finance this work which
   it is believed could have a major impact on the responses to disasters in the
   future.

                                              Yours sincerely,

     CRISIS PSYCHOLOGY : SOME CONSIDERATIONS IN DEVELOPING A
                         TRAINING STRATEGY.


                         "Making sense of chaos."


    The sub-title above defines the thrust of all training aimed at
helping professional workers to continue to function effectively in
crises . Although,   initially, training will address disasters and
their aftermaths, it is the case that all workers whose task involves
helping people to cope with individual crises will benefit from an
acquaintance with the principles underlying Crisis Psychology and
Crisis Intervention.eg.Some of the areas in which these principles are
regularly applied are, psychiatric crises, loss and bereavment, rape,
assault, suicide prevention -     indeed, all situations in which an
individual may encounter a disabling level of emotional distress are
amenable to this approach to helping.

CONTENT

    The approach to crisis intervention to be taught does not include a
particular therapeutic approach, nor does it espouse any particular
theoretical position regarding the fine-grained interaction between
client and worker. Some reference will be made to basic counselling
skills, including listening skills, but it will be assumed that
workers will bring with them developed skills and considerable
experience, including their own preferred style of working. The point
about Crisis Psychology is that it provides a structure within which
the worker can use their skills while also retaining a sense of
purpose and direction in the work they are doing.
    Courses will consist of a mixture of inputs, in the form of short
lectures, individual and group tasks, role-play, behavioural
rehearsal, experiential work based on these last two techniques, and
discussion and sharing of experiences in small groups. The aim of these
courses will be to provide members with new information and knowledge
for them to evaluate in order that they will incorporate what they find
relevant in their practice. Later, or "more advanced" courses may well
be constructed more on "workshop" lines in order to encourage
experienced workers to examine and order their experience.

                         ASWs.

Dear Colleagues,

Re:     STAFFLINE.

It has become plain that it will not be appropriate to simply
discontinue the Staffline Project when current commitments
expire on the 15th December.   The contacts that have been
established over the past six months are still identifying personal
needs of staff, individuals and in groups, and issues for
organisations to address.  This process should not be suspended
just as it is gathering steam.

The British Association of Social Workers recognises this and
has resolved to apply the £5,000 in its budget for the development
of a Counselling Service for Social Workers to the continuation of
the Staffline Project beyond the above date.   This, of course, is
a small proportion either of the costs of the Project to date,
which you are underwriting,or of the costs of its continuation.
Therefore, I would be grateful if you could give serious
consideration to continuing financial backing of Staffline for
a further twelve months. We are proposing to continue our
engagement of the Co-ordinator's services for a further year
at two thirds the level that applies until December (since much
of the initial outreach work and network building has now been
done), with a view to building on the experience^ gained to date
to inform the development of a service with wider terms of
reference than Hillsborough, one means of access to which would
be membership of our Association, hence the direct commitment of
our own funds.

The details of these arrangements are still being worked out and
are open to negotiations. We would be happy to discuss our
thoughts with you at a meeting. We do, however, need an early
indication on principle of your willingness to support financially
the continuing operation of Staffline in some form.

Yours sincerely,

STAFFING

Various alternatives have been considered and it is now proposed to link
functions together in order to promote — operational action on helpline
                                       — outreach work
                                       — training
                                       — staff support.


These tasks must be managed to produce a cohesive service able to respond to
changing circumstances and co-ordinated with the many other agencies and groups
who have roles relative to the Hillsborough Disaster.


HILLSBOROUGH ASSISTANCE UNIT MANAGER (P.O. 6)


The post holder will manage the work of subordinate staff
                     — Database/Helpline Manager
                     — Training Officer'
                     — Outreach Work Development Officer


The Unit Manager will also co-ordinate the staff support system currently
provided through B.A.S.W. although it is important that the staff support worker
is not in a managerial line in order to avoid staff anxiety.

There are various other tasks which require to be carried out at this senior
level:-

           Public Relations and Media Work
           Link with the Trust Fund
           Link with other Agencies
           Fund Raising
           Research/Evaluation into Disaster Response
           Links with Football Club
           Co-ordination of Core Teams work
           Development of training material for Post Qualifying Award




The Manager would provide reports to the local authority members group at regular
intervals. On a day—to—day basis he/she should be managed by a Director of Social
Services in the Region and be a member of the Management Team. The post holder
would, through the established inter-authority officers group report on progress
and development.


HELPLINE/DATABASE MANAGER (P.0.1)

The effective control of these two aspects of the Units work is crucial to its
success. The Manager will supervise — Volunteer Co-ordinator
                                        Database Co-ordinator

This Manager will also be responsible for the co-ordination of recruitment and
training volunteers who staff the telephone helpline.   Liaison with the hospital

The postholder will process requests for help and pass referrals to the relevant
core teams in authorities and track their progress for the database.

The database will co-ordinate information on requests for help and services
received/provided via Helpline, Core Teams and other social work Agencies.


TRAINING OFFICER (P.0.1)
(FUNDED BY NWASSA)
         /


This post has been filled and the training officer has been located within
Liverpool Social Services Department Training Section.

The training role will be developed to meet the changing needs of staff. The
collaborative training programme between participant agencies and the development
of training within NWASSA will be developed as a secondary role.

The developing expertize of the Core Teams will be co-ordinated by the Training
Officer as input to courses for other local authorities.


OUTREACH DEVELOPMENT OFFICER (P.0.1)


This member of staff will take lead responsibility for the development of work
outside the Unit and the Core Teams including other local authorities and specific
services.
     T                                    «
Other local authorities need to be 'encouraged' to provide appropriately for
disaster victims either directly or through local voluntary agencies.

There are also developments of   - the Newsletter
                                 — Drop In Centre.


The Newsletter is developing a role as a means of keeping people affected by
Hillsborough in touch with each other.   The production of copy and material for
the letter requires a consistent input.   The Drop In Centre planned for the
vicinity of Anfield will have a high level of control devolved to families who are
bereaved and victims.   The Outreach Development working in conjunction with these
people and local core teams will build on these developments of self help.

     operator will also be able to highlight any duplicate/parallel services.


     SENIOR CLERICAL OFFICER (SCALE 4)
     CLERK/TYPIST (SCALE 2)


     These posts accountable to the Unit Manager, will provide clerical/admin, back-up
     across the whole range of services.    The Clerk Typist will, under the direction
     of the Senior Clerical Officer, deal- with production of letters, correspondence an<
     reports.   The two workers will share responsibility for incoming telephone calls.


     CHILDREN'S WORKER (P.0.1)


     In parallel with the mainstream services to families, the Children's Worker will
     work with other organisations and agencies to promote individual and group work
     with children.   This will involve collaborative work with Education and Youth Vori
     Colleagues and may lead to a Junior Link Newsletter for children involved. There
     could be potential for sharing experiences between Merseyside and Nottinghamshire
     and development of link services.

     CRISIS PSYCHOLOGY : SOME CONSIDERATIONS IN DEVELOPING A
                         TRAINING STRATEGY.


                         "Making sense of chaos."


    The sub-title above defines the thrust of all training aimed at
helping professional workers to continue to function effectively in
crises . Although,   initially, training will address disasters and
their aftermaths, it is the case that all workers whose task involves
helping people to cope with individual crises will benefit from an
acquaintance with the principles underlying Crisis Psychology and
Crisis Intervention.eg.Some of the areas in which these principles are
regularly applied are, psychiatric crises, loss and bereavment, rape,
assault, suicide prevention -     indeed, all situations in which an
individual may encounter a disabling level of emotional distress are
amenable to this approach to helping.

CONTENT.

    The approach to crisis intervention to be taught does not include a
particular therapeutic approach, nor does it espouse any particular
theoretical position regarding the fine-grained interaction between
client and worker. Some reference will be made to basic counselling
skills, including listening skills, but it will be assumed that
workers will bring with them developed skills and considerable
experience, including their own preferred style of working. The point
about Crisis Psychology is that it provides a structure within which
the worker can use their skills while also retaining a sense of
purpose and direction in the work they are doing.
    Courses will consist of a mixture of inputs, in the form of short
lectures, individual and group tasks, role-play, behavioural
rehearsal, experiential work based on these last two techniques, and
discussion and sharing of experiences in small groups. The aim of these
courses will be to provide members with new information and knowledge
for them to evaluate in order that they will incorporate what they find
relevant in their practice. Later, or "more advanced" courses may well
be constructed more on "workshop" lines in order to encourage
experienced workers to examine and order their experience.

                    eg. Intake workers.
                         Hospital Social Workers.
                         ASWs.
                         EDT workers.

This list implies no order of priority, nor is it comprehensive.

     TTTTTfiBnRODGH OO-QRDINMTNG MKCTTNG - 13 OCTOBER 1989

     1.   I attended the above meeting and the papers connected with it are
          attached. These are self explanatory. Of particular interest is NISW's
          corartiitment to a research project and an application made to Rowntree
          Trust for funding.      The research project is a three stage project
          looking at co-ordination, team work and consumer satisfaction. Members
          of the Co-ordinating Team seem to be fairly hopeful that the research
          money would be forthcoming. Discussion with David Mason indicated his
          enthusiasm for                  from NISW who had been very helpful in
          drawing up a research proposal.                   from Khowsley had been
          particularly involved in negotiations with NISW and                  had
          also been involved.     Reference was made again to an approacn t o the
          other funding agencies referred to by Brian Harrison in his letter.
          Paddy Marley also indicated to me that the Scot Barder Research Trust
          were interested in doing same research in relation to children affected
          by Hillsborough.

     2.   It was noted that St Helens wished to be reassociated with the co­
           ordinated activity and it was agreed that meetings from henceforth
           should take place on a monthly basis, the next one being 10 November at
           9.30 am.

     3.   Wirral reported that the future of the current Team was problematic.
          The work and effectiveness of the Team was currently being evaluated.
          Although referrals were increasing there was not really enough work to
          justify sustaining a full Team. They were not as busy as other staff in
          mainstream Teams.     There was still a commitment from the IA to
          supporting Hillsborough victims but it may well be that the work would
          be integrated into the rest of the Department.

     4.   Support for the Hillsborough Unit

          Members reported that their authorities were still supporting the post
          Hillsborough Unit and Cheshire confirmed its commitment to providing
          same funding.    Nottingham were represented at the meeting and the
          representative indicated that Nottingham were prepared to contribute to
          the post Hillsborough Unit but at a lower cost than the Merseyside
          authorities.

          NB after the meeting Mr Marley from Liverpool SSD reported that he had
          attended a two day conference on 'disaster management' at Bradford.
          There had been a fair amount of support for Merseyside Directors
          contention that Central Government should make money available for SSDs
          in relation to emergencies and disaster counselling etc.      Mr Marley
          indicated that the representative from the Home Office who had spoken
          about the role of local authorities had not been received very well.
          There seemed to be growing support from Directors that Central
          Government needed to rethink its approach to providing financial support
          to local authorities.

w
            (i)   Burton Manor.

                              reported that the staff conference held at
                  Burton Manor the previous day (17th August) had been very
                  successful and had allowed the 65 staff who attended from
                  all over the country an opportunity - which had been well
                  received - to share information and their feelings and
                  experiences about the disaster and the aftermath. A number
                  of training issues and ideas had arisen, both of a general
                  nature and specifically to individual Authorities, and to
                  enable these to be addressed by the Group it was agreed
                  that             be asked to prepare a detailed note and to
                  arrange, through               for copies to be circulated to
                  Authorities in advance of consideration of the note at a
                  future meeting of this Group.

                  It was also agreed that -

                  (a)   Wilf Twist would write formally and express the thanks     W. Twist
                        of the Group for the free use of Burton Manor and its
                        facilities; and

                  (b)              would make further enquiries and ascertain
                        wnetner it would be possible for a further staff
                        conference to be held at Burton Manor before Christmas,
                        given the clear expression of support from staff for
                        additional meetings to be arranged.

                              wished to record her thanks for the assistance
                  of the Chair (Wilf Twist) and Training Officers during the
                  day's proceedings.

                  ______________ indicated that a training day for Probation
                   staff had been arranged for 1st September.

           (ii) Staff De-briefing.

                                   indicated that the question of arranging,
                  in conjunction with            |
                                                 , debriefing sessions for
                  Helpline staff would be addressed upon the return, shortly, of
                              (Liverpool) who is on annual leave.

    300.   Finance.

           The meeting noted that sill Authorities had now submitted details
           of their costs to date and their projected full year costs of
           establishing and maintaining services in response to Hillsborough.
           The details will be collated and considered further at a futUre
           meeting of the Group. It was further noted that the City
           Solicitor (Liverpool) had issued invitations for leading members
           of the core Authorities, Sheffield and Nottinghamshire County
           Councils and Nottingham City Council to attend a meeting at             All to note


                                                               ’■*■■
       Liverpool Town Hall at 2.00 p.m. on Wednesday, 6th September, to
       review progress made since the last meeting of representatives
       (on 29th April) and to consider ways of maintaining the
       co-ordinated response.

       The Group was advised of correspondence between D. Mason and the
       Football Association about the proceeds of the Charity Sheild
       Match and the possibility that a financial contribution may yet be
       forthcoming from the Association towards the costs of core
       Authorities in mounting the Hillsborough response. It was further
       noted that there was still a possibility of a contribution from
       Liverpool Football Club from its share of the proceeds of the
       F.A. Cup Final. Enquiries are also to be made to ascertain the
       intentions of Everton Football Club in this regard. Any
       developments are to be reported to the Group.

301.   Visit to California.

       Pauline Farrell informed the meeting that she had a final list of
       106 young persons for consideration for inclusion in the proposed
       visit to California and that she was now awaiting further
       information from the Ambassador in America which would enable the
       matter to be progressed.

302.   Film Footage.

       It was noted that Wilf Twist (who could not be present at the
       meeting) was to provide copies of sill the video material
       available to the core teams, including the tape of the Memorial
       Service, to Dave Whittam, Nottingham. It was further reported
       that the soundtrack on the Michael Stewart training video was
       unacceptably poor. An attempt is to be made to have the sound­
       track improved at South Mersey College, failing which an approach    P.Marley.
       will be made to Michael Stewart for a new soundtrack to be recorded.

303.   Helpline.

       There was nothing further to report on Helpline other than
       negotiations were continuing well with           and the Weilton
       Support Group for a transfer of responsibility on 1st October, 1989,
       and that until then, the E.D.T. (Liverpool) had agreed to continue
       to deal with out-of-hours and weekend ceilIs.

304.   Interlink.

       Paddy Marley confirmed that 100 copies of Interlink had been
       forwarded to Dave Whittam (Nottingham).

305.   Evaluation Work.

       It was reported that a researcher had met with Wilf Twist, David
       Mason and Bernard Walker since the last meeting of the Group and
       that he had confirmed his wish to undertake evaluation work on
       behalf of the Group. He is now drawing up the detailed proposal
       and investigating sources of finance.

306.   St. Helens.

       ____________ sought guidance from the Group about whether she should
       still endeavour to make contact with staff from St. Helens, given
       the withdrawal of St. Helens from the Inter Agency Forum. The
       view of the Group was that it would be entirely appropriate for
                    to continue to make the counselling services
                                -3 -


       available to St. Helens staff and that she may wish to consider
       approaching the Director in the first instance.

307.   Referrals.

       It was reported that the question of including on the database
       details of sill referrals dealt with in Nottingham and Sheffield
       is being pursued by

308.   Inquest.

       The Group noted an un-confirmed press report that the Inquest,
       which was scheduled to commence in Sheffield on 10th January, 1990,
       may not now commence until February.

                    informed the Group that the Sheffield team is holding
       a conference on 6th October to equip Sheffield Social Workers with
       knowledge of the proceedings of a Coroner's Inquest. Given that
       the Training Officers Group was requested at the last meeting to
       consider mounting a training exercise for staff of the core
       Authorities,              was asked to contact
       (Sheffield) to discuss whether efforts could be combined and sill
       appropriate staff be dealt with at the same time.

       The detailed arrangements for the Inquest, including the transport
       arrangements etc. for families attending, will need to be addressed W. Twist
       once W. Twist has completed his current enquiries with Sheffield.

309.   B.A.S.W. Workshop.

       It   was noted that Liverpool and Sefton had each nominated a member
       of   staff to assist                with the mounting of a workshop
       in   conjunction with B.A.S.W. to be held in York in early October
       in   relation to Hillsborough.

310.   Hillsborough Memorial Garden.

       The meeting considered the terms of a letter from Unilever seeking
       the view of the Group on whether it would be appropriate to provide
       bereaved relatives with a photograph of the Hillsborough Memorial
       Garden in Port Sunlight and if so, seeking the assistance of the
       Group with the distribution arrangements.

       It was agreed that                  would respond to the letter
       and offer to approach families on behalf of the Company and to
       forward copies of the photos to those wishing to receive them,
       request is also to be made to Unilever for additional copies to
       be made available to Authorities for general display in
       appropriate public buildings.

311.   Judicial Report.

       The Group gave brief consideration to the Lord Justice Taylor
       report and welcomed the exoneration of supporters of Liverpool
       Football Club.

312.   Benefit Payments.

                   reported that he now had the views of the Welfslre
       Benefits Advisers on the correspondence between Nicholas Scott
       and the N.A.C.A.B. regarding the effect of payments from the
       Disaster Fund to people receiving an income-related benefit. It
                                                                                         ■■■■■




                                                                          •r*
       was agreed that the views be circulated with the Minutes of
       the meeting and a copy is accordingly attached at Annex 'A' to
       these Minutes.

313.   Date of Next Meeting.

       It was agreed that the next meeting of this Group be held at
       4.00 p.m. on Friday, 1st September, 1989, in Committee Room 'C1,   All to note.

                                       Dear A. Mason,

                                       RE: Preparing a Counselling Team in tlie Event of a Disaster in
                                       Cleveland - 5th April 1990

                                       We have decided, in response to a request from concerned members
                                       of our community, to have a conference/workshop on the above.

                                       Our aim is two fold:

                                       1)        to inform about the social,                                    emotional and psychological
                                                 effects of disaster

                                                 and

                                       2)        to b e g i n to i d e n t i f y the nee ds of                                  those         who       w o u l d be
                                                 involved, both casualties and carers

                                       The conference is aimed at basic grade workers who would be
                                       actively involved such as - nurses, teachers, social workers,
                                       police and members of the voluntary organisations.

                                       The pattern of the day is to have 2 speakers, one on each topic
                                       and one in the morning and one in the afternoon.     The speakers
                                       input would be about 40 minutes and then the delegates would move
                                       into seminar groups for directed discussion.    Again one session
                                       following the first speaker, one following the second with a
                                       plenary at the end of each session.   We are fixing the number of

  Dear Sir/Madam,

  Re: Social Services and Support for the Individuals and Families affected
      by the Hillsborough D i s a s t e r ____________________________

  As you will of course be, aware, in the wake of The Hillsborough Disaster, a fund
  was set up, ultimately to be of benefit to those bereaved and/or injured in the
  course of the Disaster.

  M.W.R.R.C. are members of a forum concerned with the affects any payments from
  the Fund may have upon state benefits, services and support.which beneficiaries
  receive. Local Authority Social Service Departments are major providers of these
  benefits, services and support, some of which are means tested. Whilst I am aware
  that your Department has responded very sensitively to the individuals and families
  affected by the Disaster, I am concerned to know whether any payments from the
  Disaster Fund have, could or would affect the provision of benefits, services or
  support provided on a means tested basis.

  I would be extremely grateful if you could indicate to me what affects, if any,
  the Disaster Fund has had upon the provision to individuals/families and what
  policy decisions have been taken or are planned to be taken with regard to these
  affects.

  In anticipation of your co-operation in this matter, I thank you very much.

  Yours faithfully.        _____________

6.    Merseyside, Lancashire and Cheshire, plus contacts with Nottingham and
      Sheffield, are involved in a consortium, in the form of the Inter
      Agency Group.   This was set up in response to the Hillsborough
      disaster, to promote a uniform response and act as a forum for the
      exchange of ideas and information, and promote continued mutual
      support.

As a result of the increasing number of major disasters, and
especially in the light of the Hillsborough tragedy, there is a real
recognition amongst the regional Social Service Departments of the
need for a co-ordinated response to disaster counselling. Co­
ordination   is  necessary,  both within   departments  and  between
authorities, and needs to be ongoing.

          3. Officers of the constituent local authorities are asked to prepare
             a further report on the alternative sources of funding for this
             Unit; and

          4. Officers are further requested, as a matter of urgency, to report
             back to a further meeting of appropriate members."

    As reported at that meeting Directors of Social Services, together with
    representatives of other Agencies, set up an Inter-Agency Group to
    co-ordinate response to the disaster and to strive to attempt to achieve a
    one response situation .in that survivors received, irrespective of the
    Authority in which they lived. This group is attended either by Directors
    personally or their senior representatives and it is believed has achieved
    its goal in this respect. There is no doubt whatsoever that the exchange
    of information and experience has benefitted considerably the response
    standards that have been achieved. It has also facilitated the many
    managerial and organisational aspects which inevitably occur in such a
    major incident.

    The Group has made strenuous efforts to obtain financial supports from
    outside sources to meet the expenditure incurred. Many avenues have been
    explored including the following:

         1.    Government

         2.    E.E.C.

         3.    Football Association - including Charity Shield

         12. Pop Concert - Milton Keynes

         13. Individuals

    The results have been disappointing in that the only positive responses
    have been an offer frcm Central Council for Education in Training in
    Social Work of £20,000 towards training expenses. The most disappointing
    response, however, must be that from Central Government and Members have
    received, with a notification of the meeting, a letter received in
    response to that signed by the leaders of the "Hillsborough Authorities"
    from the Secretary of State for Social Services and it is clear that
    pursuing a course of application under the Bellwin formula would be
    fruitless.

    The requiranent to support those casualties already identified by the
    several Agencies involved is inescapable. These casualties clearly fall
    within the requirements and duties of the Social Services Act 1972 and are
    already considered by Social Services Departments to be part of their
    caseload. Each Authority has taken its own decision as to the needs for
    additional resources (staffing, etc) although it should be noted that the
    scale of the disaster is such that the level of services required is
    beyond the normal budgetting capacity of most of the Social Services
    Departments affected. It is suggested however that this aspect of
    response is best left to each Authority on an individual basis and is not
    a proper subject for discussion at this meeting.

    Members will recall however that the report they received in April frcm
    the Team led by Professor Howard Parker strongly advised the need to set
    up a "Regional Unit" to deal with three main aspects in the aftermath of
    the disaster, these were:

         i) The running and organisation of the Helpline

         ii) The provision and maintenance of a computer database, and

     iii) The organisation of research and evaluation into the efficiency of
          the response to the disaster and the work undertaken with survivors
          and casualties.


JCSAIC
     In addition it was anticipated that a Regional Unit could ensure that
     outreach work was offered to those survivors who were not immediately and
     easily picked up by a Social Services Department or another Agency.

     It had always been hoped that funding, for this Unit, at the time
     estimated to be £350,000, could have been met fran outside sources.

    The Chief Inspector, SSI, visited several of the Merseyside Authorities on
   .1st August, 1989 and met with core teams working with survivors and those
 \, affected. The opportunity was taken by Directors to advise him of the
    need for an independent evaluation.

    The Directors of Social Services are firmly of the view that the
    experience gained would be extremely valuable if it was evaluated and
    researched by an independent Agency to enable a more effective response to
    be made to future disasters. As recent events have shown there is a
    continuing need to be prepared to provide an effective response in the
    immediate aftermath of a disaster.

    With regard to helpline, understandably the demands on it have reduced
    since the first few weeks. It has to be noted, however, that it has been
    a considerable drain on resources of the Authorities and other Agencies to
    staff it on a 24 hour basis, and all the staff and volunteers are to be
    applauded for their efforts. Accordingly the Inter-Agency Group decided
    that negotiations should be opened with the Walton Support Group who
    offered, very readily, to undertake the manning of the Helpline. However
    it will still be necessary to arrange some funding on a smaller scale than
    originally envisaged to meet their expenses. Because there are several
    traumatic incidents for survivors still to be overcome (eg the West
    Midlands Police enquiry into possible criminality, and the 95 inquests due
    to commence in early 1990) the demand on Helpline may well increase and it
    is considered essential that a close oversight is maintained on its
    running.

    It is essential that the activities which are continuing intensively, to
    respond to the disaster's aftermath, are co-ordinated to ensure an even
    handed response. The experience of the last four months has demonstrated
    that if services are to meet the needs of people affected by Hillsborough
    this can only be done by the co-operation of the several Authorities which
    is extremely time consuming for senior staff and can be detrimental to the
    day to day on-going work of the Departments. It is clear that it should
    be one persons's task to concentrate exclusively on this co-ordination to
    ensure a satisfactory response of services to counteract the disasters
    effects.

    In view of the scale of the disaster there is no doubt that information
    stored on computer would be by far the most beneficial to enable service
    delivery to be effected.   Whilst basic information was recorded on
    computer frcm the outset, there is a need for this arrangement to be
    reviewed and if necessary transferred to more sophisticated equipment.
    Preliminary work has been commenced on this review.

 It will be seen frcm the above that the lack of progress in establishing
 the Regional Unit is now inhibiting further work on Hillsborough other
 than the response already being achieved by each of the Authorities, and
 the time has come for a decision to be taken. The alternatives are:-

 1)   In view of the external resources being unavailable at the present
      time, abandon all attempts to create and maintain any form of regional
      and national response to the disaster,

      or

 2)   To authorise the officers to continue to maintain a minimalist
      regional response until such tine as all possible financial avenues
      have been explored and to under-write the costs,

      or

 3)   For the Authorities to undertake to meet the costs of the
      Regional Unit themselves, (it will be necessary to agree a method of
      apportionment),

      or

 4)   An approach to be made to the Trust Fund to seek assistance in meeting
      the costs of direct services to victims provided by the Local
      Authorities.

 In order to assist Members in coming to a view as to what to recommend to
 their Authorities, the following appendices are attached:

a)    Helpline usage and costs of maintenance.

Meeting of Inter-Agency Authorities re Hillsborough


1.    I attended the above meeting on 1 September 1989.   Papers related to the
      meeting are attached. Most of the discussion at the meeting centred
       around the line to be taken at the NWASSA meeting on 6 September on the
       way the action should be presented to the members.

2.    The tone of the meeting was mixed insofar as there were some doubts
       whether the local authority members would actually produce the money
       necessary to sustain the regional unit but also there was a strong sense
       of commitment from the local authorities present to ensuring the strategy
       should continue.

              23.   HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY

              Issue for Consideration

              A report on the progress that has been made *to establish services in the
              wake of the Hillsborough tragedy on Saturday, 15th April, 1989.

              Information

              Background

              From the outset, the Authorities most affected within the North West
              Region (the care Authorities) agreed to work on a pan-Merseyside,
              pan-Agency basis, co-ordinating the establishment of immediate, short term
              assistance and planning a longer term, coherent response to events which
              will likely affect thousands of people.  The planning and provision of
              specialist and discreet services for these 'victims' on a multi-authority,
              mutli-agency basis is already well under way.

              The task of co-ordinating the response to the tragedy has been undertaken
              through regular meetings of an Inter-Agency Co-ordinating Group which
              comprises representatives of the Directors of Social Services of all five
              Merseyside Authorities, Cheshire and Lancashire, together with colleagues
              from the Mersey Regional Health Authority, the Probation Service and the
              Emergency Planning Unit of the Merseyside Fire and Civil Defence
              Authority.  The voluntary sector response is being co-ordinated through
              the Voluntary Sector Co-ordinating Committee, with access to the
              Inter-Agency Group.

              Steps were taken immediately by the Group to establish a national, 24 hour
              Helpline to enable those affected by the tragedy to make contact with
              trained and experienced counsellors able to listen and help.  In addition,
              a number of drop in and advice centres have been established, principally
              to provide easily accessible counselling services and a meeting place with
              appropriately trained support services on hand, for those who may benefit
              from sharing common experiences and needs.  The establishment of permanent
              premises for a counselling, drop-in and memorial centre is being actively
              pursued.

              In addition, the Inter-Agency Group is exploring the possibility of
              creating a Disaster Unit which would have the capacity to maintain a
              continuing 24 hour Helpline, co-ordinate and provide counselling both
              locally and nationally, manage a permanent drop-in and advice centre and
              co-ordinate voluntary effort.  The Unit would also maintain the computer
              data base which, with the assistance of Consultants, was established by
              the Inter-Agency Group very early on to deal with the mass of information
              and referrals from the Helpline and to aid the tracking of individuals.
              The Unit is also envisaged as having public relations, training, finance
              and administrative functions.

              The requirement for a major training programme of crisis intervention work
              and counselling for health authority staff, social workers, teaching staff
              and voluntary sector organisations was recognised and arrangements were




                                                -   22 -
put in hand almost immediately for presentations to be made by Michael
Stewart of the Centre for Crisis Psychology to large groups of staff.   In
addition, briefing seminars for elected members of the care Authorities
took place on 22nd April.  For 16nger term staff training purposes,
agreement has been reached for the appointment of Training Officers, one
post being funded through NWASSA, who will engage in training ventures
across the North West.

Support and de-briefing of counsellors is provided separately and
independently.  In this connection, the Inter-Agency Group accepted the
offer of BASW to co-ordinate and utilise all offers which have been
received in this direction.

The Group arranged for the production and distribution to all Authorities
affected by the tragedy of publicity material for adults (containing
advice on how to cope with a major personal crisis) and for young people
(encouraging them to talk about their feelings about what happened at
Hillsborough, and how it affected them,    their friends andfamily).

There has been liaison between the Group and the Hillsborough Disaster
Appeal Fund and working arrangements between the Authorities and the Fund
have been established. The Local Authorities have no direct
responsibility in relation to the Fund and its management.

The immediate priorities have been addressed by the Group.  It is clear
that all those people present at the match at Hillsborough, plus their
circle of family and friends, must be regarded as potential victims.   The
issue for Authorities must ultimately be the quality of life of the
survivors and those closely associated.   The nature of the service to be
provided must be regarded as preventive     mental health.

A meeting of the elected representatives of the following authorities took
place on Saturday, 29th April (after the Memorial Service attended by the
Chairman):-

     Sefton    :                          Cheshire
     Wirral                               Nottinghamshire
     Liverpool                            Nottingham City
     St. Helens                           Sheffield
     Knowsley                             Lancashire

The meeting was convened to consider a report prepared by a group of staff
chaired by Professor Howard Parker concerning the feasibility of
establishing a regional unit to marshall and organise the allocation of a
variety of resources so that help can be made available in the right place
at the right time to people affected.

That meeting resolved:

 "This meeting of leading Local Authority members of the areaswhich are
  affected by the tragicevents of the"Hillsborough   Disaster" agrees the
  following resolution:-




                              - 23 -
     1.     There is a need for long-term co-ordinated help to all the people
            affected;
                                       t



     2.     Agrees in principle the requirement for a Regional Unit to be
            established to give effect to this;

     3.     Officers of the constituent local authorities are asked to prepare a
            further report on the alternative sources of funding for this Unit;
            and

     4.     Officers are further requested, as a matter of urgency, to report
            back to a further meeting of appropriate members."

Following this meeting a letter signed by County Councillor Mrs Ellman and
other leaders of the Authorities affected was sent to the Secretaries of
State for the Environment, Health and Social Services with a copy to the
Prime Minister, seeking financial assistance in meeting the additional
costs likely to be incurred in the setting up of a regional unit
(approximately £350,000 pa). In addition a submission has been made to
the EEC. Replies are awaited.

The Lancashire Position

Set out above is an overall view of the position in the region. Here in
Lancashire, the services were alerted on the Saturday of the disaster.
The Chairman was informed immediately and has been kept informed
throughout the period and has attended meetings with members from the
other six authorities. A briefing of the party spokesmen of this
Committee took place on 20th April and subsequently the following
approvals were confirmed under the urgent business procedure:-

1)        The deployment of social work staff as determined by the Director
          of Social Services.

2)        Expenditure, at the discretion of the Director of Social Services,
          under the provisions of Section 138 of the Local Government Act 1972.

3)    The employment of temporary staff, as considered necessary by the
      Director of Social Services after consultation with the Chairman of
      the Social Services Committee.  (Approval to any necessary additional
      financial resources will be sought at the appropriate time).

An additional Social Worker for Skelmersdale has been approved on a
temporary basis to deal with the additional work falling on that team.
At the time of writing, there have been 75 referrals to 13 Area Teams in
Lancashire, 57 of these have been in West Lancashire.

This Authority has been asked to review and if necessary redesign the
database and this work is proceeding with the assistance of the County
Treasurer's Data Processing Division.  In addition a newsletter is being
produced for victims and the County Public Relations Officer's staff are
assisting with this.




                                           - 24 -
E ffe c t

It is not possible at the present time to give detailed costings of the
support so far.  It is likely, however, that much of the expenditure
incurred in assisting families will be met by the Trust Fund.  In addition
the Trustees have been asked to consider meeting some of the costs
incurred by the Authorities and a meeting between the Inter Agency Group
and the trustees is being arranged.  In addition CCETSWA have agreed to
meet the training costs incurred by the Authorities in the first few weeks
after the disaster.

It is clear that many hours have been spent on dealing with        the effects of
the disaster and records are being kept of this.  However a        significant
amount of this staff time was and is outside office hours.         It is unlikely
that staff will be able to take time off in lieu equivalent        to the
additional hours worked because of other pressures.

Decision      Required

The Committee are asked to receive the report and to endorse the
resolution passed at the meeting on the 29th April, 1989.




24.       VISIT BY THE MENTAL HEALTH ACT COMMISSION - 31ST JULY,   1989

Issue for Consideration

The nomination of representatives to attend the feedback meeting with the
Mental Health Act Commission.
      f
Information

The 1983 Mental Health Act established the Mental Health Act Commission as
a Special Health Authority to undertake a number of functions on behalf of
the Secretary of State.  One of these duties is to review the exercise of
powers relating to detained patients and to investigate complaints.  In
order to execute these duties the Commissioners undertake visits to all
hospitals registered to receive detained patients.

They also visit all Local Authority Social Services Departments who have a
statutory duty to provide Approved Social Workers to undertake assessments
under the Act; consider applications for the receipt of a person into
Guardianship and provide statutory after care. As Lancashire is such a
large authority the Commission have decided to visit each Division
separately and to give a verbal feedback to members of the Social Services
Committee together with the Director of Social Services and senior
officers.

The feedback meeting has been arranged for Monday, 31st July at 2.30 pm in
the Ballroom at East Cliff County Offices.

Decision Required

The Committee are asked to nominate representatives to attend the feedback
meeting with the Mental Health Act Commission.

POST DISASTER COUNSELLING: A POSSIBLE EVALUATION

1. . W e had a useful chat this morning about preparation for the meeting fixed
for 26 July to discuss a possible evaluation of major disaster follow-up
activity.   I said I would start the ball rolling on clarifying the issues and
I enclose a note which you and copy addressees may like to contribute to or
comment on.   I would then revise it as a contribution to the discussion at the
proposed meeting.

2.   You said SSI would consider setting out their views on the proper role of
SSDs in this context, in the light of Mr          s observation that we need
to work within a clear policy framework.

3.   We can of course postpone the meeting if necessary,

POLICY ON FOLLOW-UP OF MAJOR DISASTERS


1.       There is a need to formulate a Departmental policy line on follow-up of
major disasters, including the SSD role, particularly in relation to


         a.   Steering the working party administered by CRUSE and financed by the
         Department


         b.   Considering the possibility of sponsoring evaluative activity.


This note aims to begin the ground-clearing process.


2.       DH interests lie mainly in the role of local and health authorities and
co-ordination between them.         Wider aspects of handling civil emergencies,
including follow-up and coordination among the various services, lies with the
Home Office and the Home Secretary's Adviser shortly to be appointed.


3.       In attempting to define the SSD role we need to clarify the tasks
carried out in following up a major disaster and which of these might be
appropriate to the SSD.      A comprehensive check list could be lengthy but the
main tasks appear to be
                                                                         \
                                                                                   \

         a.   the welfare task: eg housing homeless people, food, heating,
         blankects: organising on-the-spot help


         b.   co-ordination of activity by various agencies; clarification of
         roles (possible establishment of liaison committees?)


         c.   collection and dissemination of information about people involved in

         the disaster (a common data base?)


         d.   making immediate advice and information available.     Help lines:
         information leaflets etc


         e.   after-care: counselling; preventive mental health programme for

         casual ties, families, rescue workers
 *




     f.      LA emergency plan or policy statement


     g.      training of personnel


     h.      civic response: memorial services etc


     i.      management of visits by VIPs


     j.      handling the media


     k.      appeals, trust funds.


Others may wish to add to this list.          are arguably part of SSD role, f-k
seem to be legitimate LA activities but not necessarily for the SSD.         We need
to consider at some stage whether these activities are necessary and properly
allocated.


4.   The CRUSE working party are addressing all these issues and any useful
guidance they can produce for local agencies, in consultation with Home Office
'and emergency services interests, should be welcome.      It may be worth awaiting
^he results of the working party activity before making up our minds on some
of the d'etails.


5.   The main problem for us seems to lie in determining the proper nature and
extent of the after-care role.       This is where the use of resources is
incurred, where there seems to be no limit to what effort might be expended
and where it may be easy for SSDs to lo^e      a sense of perspective and of
priorities.


6.   In broad terms there seemrto be a need to


     a.      establish criteria by which to identify people at high risk


     b.      determine the most economical methods for the actual identification
     of people at high risk
*   •'




               c.   ensure that counselling is given by people with proper
               training/experience and only where a positive need is identified.


               d.   ensure proper co-ordination between SSDs, health authorities and
               family practitioner services in arranging counselling.


         7.    There are important distinctions to be made between on-the-spot helping
         (aid and comfort); giving advice and information (help lines) and counselling.


         8.    In raising the question of evaluation we had in mind primarf''/counselling
         activities (though there may be a case for evaluating some of the other
         activities).   There may already be (Professor Parkes suggest/there is) useful
         experience to draw upon in establishing criteria by which to identify people
         at high risk and those for whom intervention may actually be harmful.     A
         useful first step might therefore be to invite Professor Parkes, and others
         whom colleagues can identify as having something to offer, to point us towards
         relevant research evidence.

            POST DISASTER COUNSELLING; A POSSIBLE EVALUATION      \ >A ^

I was interested to see your minute of 16 June.

1.          You are quite right to point out the fact that whilst great
attention is paid to those involved in mass disasters there is often
less on offer to those involved in routine personal disasters, due to
bereavement, accident or criminal activity (eg. assault or burglary).
Some personal disasters such as rape do attract some support though the
evaluation of services is sketchy.  Victims support schemes, the lead
for which is with HO, are proliferating.

2.           The whole area of prevention of mental illness is one that
we have given a lot of attention to (lead in this Division with Dr
      ~~| and hope that it may be taken further when immediate pressures
ease.  Prevention is a joint activity for both health and local
authorities and needs to be properly co-ordinated between the two.   It
is another example, like long-term care, of the impossibility of
distinguishing sharply between social care and medical care.

3-         As you rightly say, we are particularly concerned that
specialist resources in the mental health field should be directed
towards those with serious disability and not dissipated as the great
mass of human unhappiness.     f
                               T
4.         You ask how many people could be involved if the stress of
the fixed link were taken as indicating, need for specialist care.
Clearly I cannot answer that but very good research evidence shows that
of 1,000 people in the population at any one time

   a. 250 will have symptoms that a psychiatrist would not be surprised
   to have referred to him in outpatients;

   b. 230 of these 250 consult their GPs;

   c. Only 140 are recognised to have a psychological disorder;

  d. 14 are referred to secondary care services;       and

  e. 6 are admitted to hospital.
     4



A-




         Recognising this we are very ke§n to promote better diagnosis and
         treatment in primary care. Since most distressed people consult their
         family doctors it would seem to me more sensible to co-ordinate
         preventive activity and counselling through the primary care team
         instead of LAs setting up separate counselling services.

                         POLICY ON FOLLOW UP OF MAJOR DISASTERS

1.     Thank you for your minute of 30.6.89. I have discussed the issues raised
       within SSI and we agree that a ground clearing activity as in your 1(a) and
        (b) is essential in order to formulate Departmental policy on the SSD role.

2.    In your note of 30th June you distinguish between those Department of
       Health interests, which lie primarily in the role of local and health
       authorities, and the Home Office areas of responsibility.  However, there
       is a great deal of evidence that these overlap and that there need to be
       clear lines of communication and an understanding of each agency's role.
       For example, the role of the SSD in helping to identify bodies and inform
       relatives has been a difficult and unresolved area in several disasters.

3.     In this context, it is interesting to note that the Newbury Police have now
       agreed that there should be a local authority representative included in
       the police operations room in any future emergency, in order that relevant
       services can be appropriately managed and informed. This may be a
       significant breakthrough in practice for other areas to copy.

4.    The checklist in 3 will need to include the fact that the tasks and the
       role to be carried out will clearly vary enormously from disaster to
       disaster and the different kinds of disruption caused: eg to transport,
       telecommunications, roads, mobility and the risks of disease/infection eg
       accidents involving nuclear or chemical waste or pollution problems which
       need to be considered separately.

5.     Your checklist also refers to the local authority emergency plan. It would
       be useful if SSDs were represented in these and on the local authority
       Emergency Committee in order that

       (a)     appropriate communications networks are established early so that all
                the emergency services are aware of the SSD role and vice versa; also
                important

       (b)     also, in order to establish the lead service and lead officer for
                whatever delineated purpose until the focus and needs change;

6.    Your 3(c) seems to be a combination of a communications system and an
       advice function; both interact and both need to be equally efficient.

7.    Your 3(e) is the subject of a separate paper attached (on        the role of SSDs
       in post-disaster counselling).

8.    The classification you suggest seems reasonable:   a-e are       clearly relevant
       social services activities or coordinating functions; f-h       will probably

                                         -   1   -


J D0 7 /C PB/ 21
    ,#
i

           imply some kind of SSD input, to the extent that they overlap into a-e, in
           terms of i-j, there is probably much that can be learned about appropriate
           involvement from local authorities with experience here.

     9.    With regard to the Cruse working party, there is some evidence that other
            organisations, agencies and individuals would like to give evidence on
            their experience of disasters: eg the Department of Psychiatry at the
            Middlesex Hospital and others engaged in practice and research in this area
            and feel excluded!

     10.   With regard to your paragraph 5 et seq. the attached paper addressed some
           of the issues.

     11.   The techniques described in your 6(a) and (b) and increasingly (c) are
            already fairly generally used, (d) "Proper co-ordination between SSDs,
            health authorities and family practitioner services in arranging
            counselling" is probably more problematical as are most issues involving
            co-ordination and cooperation.

     12.   On para 7, there are also some clear ideas emerging from the Working Party
           and elsewhere that very different approaches and structures are needed in
           the first 24 hours, the first week, after the first three months, the next
           three months and then dealing with the anniversary and its concomitant
           reactions.

     13.   However, I would like to have more detailed information about what happened
           in different disasters with regard to the services you describe in para 7.
           Such work should be carefully coordinated, with good links between the
           different sections and a common data base.

     14.   Social services also seem to have a critical role in dealing with the
           offers of help (sometimes thousands of them as in Hillsborough) which have
           sometimes together with inappropriate media demands disrupted and destroyed
           much needed communication networks.

     15.   I agree with Dr Reed's comment of 13th July in paragraph 1 of his minute.
           There is clearly a great deal of research and evaluative work being carried
           out at the Middlesex by Professor Rosser for the ESRC and the Mental Health
           Foundation.

     16.   There is apparently a paper coming out this month on who should do what in
           disaster management produced by the above Middlesex Hospital research team,
           who have worked closely with Camden SSD and London Regional Transport after
           King's Cross.

     17.   There is also to be a UK Disaster Research Meeting in October or November
           of this year and apparently also a symposium in September on the same
           subject at the British Psychological Society's Conference in Cardiff.

     18.   Professor Rosser's team are also undertaking research on the differential
           experience of individual survivors of traumatic events compared with those
           involved in mass disasters and hope to have some useful comments on this
           very soon.

THE ROLE OF SSDS IN POST DISASTER COPNSELLING

1.      Until relatively recently, the SSD role has been seen as giving practical
        help, like providing rest centres and catering services (as in Kent's past
        emergency plan) with little or no recognition of the SSDs role in coping
        with the trauma and distress following loss, shock and bereavement.

STAFFING

2.      However, since 1985 SSDs have been increasingly involved in providing
        appropriate support services, similar to the work carried out on
        bereavement counselling and loss in hospital social work departments,
        victim support schemes and other post-trauma counselling activities.  SSDs
        will also need to prepare and train their own staff appropriately and make
        contact with hospital and other emergency plans and be prepared to
        co-ordinate the activities of voluntary organisations. Alternatively the
        SSD may decide to delegate this work elsewhere and keep a list of trained
        counsellors available who would be prepared to help in an emergency.

SCREENING

3.      There will also need to be an acknowledgement of the time-consuming task of
        screening, then refusing or accepting help from volunteers without knowing
        anything about their credentials, and doing this appropriately. Many
        'helpers' are also vulnerable people.  There are often overwhelming numbers
        of these.

FUNDS

4.      There also needs to be consideration to giving funds to those in immediate
        need since fund money is rarely available immediately and normal local
        authority funds do not seem to be available or appropriate. Other
        important considerations for the SSD are the need to support workers, the
        need to train (often on the spot) and equally, the need to remove those for
        whom work is not appropriate.

INTER-DISCIPLINARY WORKING

5.      There are also a number of issues involving the potential rivalry of
        different groups of workers and the different priorities and conventions of
        voluntary organisations and other statutory departments. There is also a
        need for education and training on the need to share and appreciate other
        skills and the scope for assessment and inter-disciplinary work.

EVALUATION AND RESEARCH

6.       Another current question is how to evaluate the effectiveness of the work
         without invading privacy (apart from the problems of acquiring the funds
         which often inhibit the start of such work).

7.      Research on post disaster counselling work seems   to be voluminous. Clearly
         studies of systematic evaluation and follow up of good quality are
         expensive, time-consuming and consequently rare.  However, the consensus
         seems to be that, on the whole, it is a positive, valued and beneficial
         activity. There is a large US, Australian and European literature.

8.      Hungerford workers now regret that the work done   there was not evaluated
         and feel that more of the work should have been more pro-active,
         particularly in meeting the needs of bereaved children. They also feel
         that an opportunity for learning has now been missed.   Grampian SWD
         (Piper Alpha) on the other hand, feels that its assertive policy of
         contacting all families as soon as possible and actively offering help
         either directly or via other SSDs has been vindicated by the results.

9.       The evaluation of the work of the Stress Clinic at the Middlesex Hospital
         together with the report of the Camden Team working with the King's Cross
         families should be useful in this context.

AFTER-CARE AND RESOURCES

10.     The funding of the SSD's work in this area is clearly problematical and
         seems to be illustrative.  For example, the post-disaster counselling work
         in Camden was given a 4-month budget of £20,000. This also involved
         liaison and follow up work with 20/30 local authorities. The Support Team
         leader applied for funds from LRT, the NUR and the Disaster Fund and was,
         fortunately, able to continue, particularly since much of the demand for
         help emerged after the four month period.

11.     The evidence that SSDs may need to limit the investment of their resources
         and staff in the after-care role seems to exist largely in the context of
         people becoming over committed in terms of their work. However, it cannot
         be denied that there are a great many, extremely important tasks to be
         undertaken with some urgency and the fact that the ordinary day-to-day work
         also needs to be done by someone. There are clearly resource implications
        here which have not been addressed.

12.     Far from being keen to engage in this work, there is some evidence that
        many social workers strongly resist it, particularly its out-reach aspects
        and feel that it may not be an appropriate and maybe an intrusive and
         insensitive activity. There is evidence from the North-West that workers
        were very reluctant to contact survivors or the bereaved and others
         involved without a specific request for their involvement, despite evidence
        from many sources that work carried out at an early stage is extremely
        helpful.

13.     After-care also might need to be organised in different stages and in
        different geographical areas.  For example in Kent (Zeebrugge) 70 of
        the 191 deaths and 66 of the 353 survivors were local people.  There are


                                         -   2 -

J D 0 7 / C PB / 25
       clearly examples of practice to build on here as in Enniskillen, Lockerbie,
       for appropriate and sensitive referral to other agencies. There are, of
       course, also examples of fairly insensitive practices which need to be
       avoided.

14.   Resources are needed for the special tasks undertaken and for those who
       coordinate and manage and support those carrying them out. In addition,
       there need to be identifiable locations for the work and relevant and
       accessible publicity material.

.15. The role of self help groups and other informal networks might also be
      useful in both the short term and longer-term context.

ADMINISTRATION

16.   Those in charge need to understand the needs of the different workers and
       have agreed and shared systems of deployment, handover and administration.

17.   SSD workers will also need to develop less complex recording systems and
       operate these in conjunction with other users and service providers.

COMMUNICATION

18.   SSDs will also need to communicate with involved schools, parents and
       others about the identification of vulnerable groups and to explain the
       needs of those on the periphery of disasters as well as those most
       obviously damaged by the event.

19.   Social services involvement in supporting people through inquests,
       inquiries and litigation will also need to be addressed.

POST DISASTER OCXJNEfl^T.T.TNC;   A POSSIBLE EVMUAJICN

1.    Thank you for sending a copy of Mr       s paper and your own responses.
      Together they mate a very valuable contribution to the debate which is
      currently taking place and needs to continue.

2.    One or two comments on your paper:

      2.1   I agree with your comment 9 in paper on policy "policy on follow-up
            of major disasters" - there are people around feeling excluded from
            making a valuable contribution to the current CRUSE Working Party
            deliberations.

      2.2   There are opportunities for some very useful action research.     I
            can only refer to Merseyside from personal experience but there are
            various models now in existence of Post Disaster teams working in
            similar and different ways.

      2.3   I think the nature of the disaster is significant and its location.
            One has to be familiar with the importance of football in
            Liverpool and the nature of Merseyside to understand the nature of
            the response. The authorities have been described as "going over
            the top". Their reaction needs to be set in context. I think Mr
                  Is paragraph 5 is relevant here. Also your paragraph 12 in
            the Policy paper.    Timing - and the nature of the service at
            various times is relevant.

3.    To turn to your paper on Post Disaster Counselling:

      3.1   Staffing I suppose one could argue that the co-ordinating role
            relating to the staffing could be delegated to a department other
            than the LA SSD.    Much co-ordination went on in Merseyside and
            liaison with the voluntary sector.    It would have been difficult
            for the voluntary sector to operate in the key role taken initially
            by the SSDs.

      3.2   Screening The compilation and screening of offers of help was very
            time consuming, onerous and very responsible. I agree with your
            comments in your para 3.

      3.3   Funds On the spot money was needed but this needs to be set in a
            policy framework. Disaster funds are problematic.

      3.4   Support for staff Essential.

      3.5   Inter-disciplinary working   Merseyside authorities were keen to
            utilise other professionals and work together. An area for clear
          thinking and delegation initially and ongoing work.

    3.6   Evaluation and Research There must be lots of "lessons" around
          already.    The Merseyside authorities aided by Michael Stewart
           (Crisis Psychology), have attempted to learn from these.       In
          relation to models of intervention Prof Howard Parker (Manchester
          University) was keen to explore the importance of natural networks
          and networking as a means of supporting those "at risk" following
          disasters as opposed to providing a direct counselling service for
          all "at risk" - even supposing one could identify the "at risk"
          group.

    3.7   After Care and Resources I agree, one needs to draw a distinction
          between resources at the time and soon after the disaster to

          questionable, there is much to be done and it is resource

1.   Thank you very much for sending me a copy of your notes on the visit to
     Merseyside on 1 August 1989.

2.   It was interesting to see set out the differences and similarities in
      the teams which the Merseyside authorities have set up.

3.   I have discovered subsequently that the visit had perhaps not
      unnaturally caused anxiety amongst team members not least of v M c h was
      the Knowsley team. You may recall we were a little concerned about the
      team leader.

4.   I shall retain contact with David Mason on developments in relation to
      the continued operation of the post Hillsborough strategy and associated
      research and keep you informed of any developments.

Dear David

I know you have already received a letter from Mr Utting following his visit
to Merseyside on 1 August 1989 .

I want to add my thanks to you and the other Merseyside Directors for their
help and support on the day. Thanks too, of course, to the team members who
really gave a very good account of themselves. I appreciate that this must
have aroused some anxiety for some but I was very impressed with the
enthusiasm and commitment which was evidenced in the conversations we had
with members of all the teams we met. I have copied this letter to Pauline
Farrell, particularly to thank her for the excellent lunch and for providing
an opportunity for Bill to meet informally with Directors and hear first hand
of the co-operative effort in Merseyside.

I was talking the other day to a Liverpool supporter, an ex-Liverpudlian, who
now lives.in Blackburn.     He commented that he was able very easily to
identify with the Merseyside response but indicated that he felt other parts
of the country may well find it difficult to envisage such a corporate
response. There is something special about Merseyside.

It is my intention to write up my impressions of the teams we visited and I
will let you have a copy of the notes.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely

         Dear Mrs Gibson

         re: DISASTER PLANNING : THE NEED FOR TRAINING

         I enclose a first rough draft of some of my thoughts on the above
         which you mightfind useful due to the tragic disaster in London
         last weekend.


         Yours sincerely




         DEREK EVANS
         Assistant Director
         Child and Family Division
DISASTER PLANNING : THE NEED FOR TRAINING

The following are some of my thoughts which I have put down as a
result of my experience in the post Hillsborough Disaster
Planning Group.

It is important to recognise from the very beginning that
disasters have a completely different aetology than any other
social work subject.  It should never be assumed that social
workers who are CQSW qualified and have had bereavement
counselling, are specifically equipped to deal with disasters.

The group had the advice of the Centre in Crisis Psychology which
to date has proved correct in its predictions. With their advice
one of the early decisions which had to be made was in the
definition of who is the victim.   The conclusion reached, which
again in retrospect has been proved correct, is that everybody
present at a disaster is a victim.   This includes the deceased,
the injured, and the spectators.   It is interesting to note that
we have discovered other victims of disasters in terms of
spectators.  There have been people who have watched the match on
T.V. and who have been deeply affected, they have been affected
either because they had close friends or relatives at the match
or they had been in near or actual disasters previously.The
disasters do not have to be of an exact parallel nature i.e.
football match, but simply being in presence where numbers of
people have been killed, brings to light again all their own
feelings and emotions.  In addition to the above, one includes
friends and relatives of people who have been killed or seriously
injured or who are living with people who have been affected,
then the number becomes enormous and certainly in the tens of
thousands. A bye product of trying to deal with a disaster is
that of the attitude of colleagues and fellow professionals who
are not directly involved. We were warned of professional
jealousy with the more strong emotion as to why all the fuss.
Indeed there is a case to be put forward when counselling is not
provided for victims of motorway disasters, child sex abuse or
individuals who die in trauma situations. This element has to be
taken into recognition in planning as the battle for resources
when the momentum slips from disaster, to crisis, to normal
management over a short period of time necessitates negotiation
and consultation.

This movement in management styles is quite marked.   In the first
week when emotions are high and the politicians goodwill is
strong, then things can be achieved that would seem to be
unacceptable in normal times.  Training, therefore, has an
important part to play in, firstly, tinderstanding a disaster and,
secondly, in providing therapeutic counselling service for the
victims of a disaster.
Training should be provided very rapidly, if possible within the
first 48 hours for the Managers and Decision Makers within the
organisations involved.   This training is an awareness training
of what structure a disaster consists of. The impact of the BBC
films previously shown at the Bradford fire were important in
that they were followed up with images of the macho heroes some
months or years after becoming victims of the event.   It is this
detailed affect which is difficult for Managers who tend to be
divorced from eyeball contact with clients to understand and
comprehend.   Training should be provided on a multi agency,
multidisciplinary basis in order to form a common understanding
by senior personnal as to what the disaster constitutes. Without
this common understanding it will be impossible to provide a
common approach.   It is inevitable that some of the agencies will
draw out of providing input into whatever is being planned for
the disaster.   Quite rightly there will be other priorities which
once the hot fish of disaster has faded will call upon scarce
resources. Without a preliminary agreed approach which can only
be made on the back of awareness training, then this fallout rate
will be far sooner than later. If a multidisciplinary team holds
together for three to four months, then it has achieved wonders.
It is important from the onset to try and include in this
understanding training, the Police, the Ambulance Service and
Fire Service. This was one of the failings in the Hillsborough
training.   One of the other failures was to treat the voluntary
agencies as a separate identity in providing both awareness and
practitioner training.   They also should be included from the
very beginning and be taken on board in ownership of the
disaster. On reflection there may be value in providing some form
of follow up training, say, one month post D Day for senior
managers. This will help to keep the Core Team identity and the
momentum going and to plan for the break down of the disaster
planning. It comes as a surprise and a great disappointment to
some of the agencies when ultimately the service which has been
provided to the victims of the disaster are incorporated into the
normal functioning of departments. This subject, to my knowledge,
has not been debated before and could be valuable in any follow
up research undertaken in any of the previous major disasters.
In summary, the value for training for managers provides an
understanding of the very nature of a disaster and brings about a
comradeship and togetherness to like minded people in a crisis
situation.

The second and equally important aspect of training is that for
the personnel involved in providing a direct service to victims
of a disaster.  The Merseyside Group paid for the services of the
Centre in Crisis Psychology and brought in a 3-day training
course, coupled with a 1-day follow up or de-briefing day. The
contents of the 3-day course are readily available and are
coupled as an appendices to this report. Michael Stewart’s
method is of working with small groups of practitioners - 8 to 12
on a very personal and emotional basis. He exposes them to
emotions of a disaster in order that they can, not only help a
victim, but also and equally important understand their own
emotions in dealing with them.  The benefit of such a 3-day
experience can really only be felt by people who have been on his
course. My only note of caution is that their success rests upon
the capabilities of the person who is leading the group. Michael
Stewart is very good at communicating, especially to Social
Workers. If the same ’course’ was run by thers i.e. an
inexperienced Training Officer, then there is a danger that it
could be counter productive.  Everybody who went on these courses
were already qualified and experienced Social Workers, some of
whom have been bereavement counsellors in voluntary organisations
i.e. CRUSE but they still benefitted from Michael Stewart’s
experience. The original intention of the 1-day follow up was to
give individual staff who are becoming immersed in disaster
counselling the opportunities for debriefing.  If no formal
debriefing sessions have been put into practice following a
disaster, then this addition to the training is essential.
Merseyside at a very early stage decided to form its own de
briefing networks and these have proved invaluable to staff
concerned. In addition to the localised debriefing methods (i.e.
Wirral has a clinical psychologist and a child psychiatrist).
BASW have provided an umbrella service to all agencies concerned.
There needs to be specialised training targetted at the staff
responsible for debriefing and supporting the practitioners in
the field. This course would include charts of what the
practitioners have undertaken on their 3-day course but also
needs to concentrate on the effects of such work and how it
effects individuals assisting others. Again, the comment of why
only for Hillsborough victims and Support Teams will be heard,
and although this is true, it does not negate the need for such
Support Teams and their training.

It is very easy to under estimate the need for training,
particularly for senior staff of the agencies concerned. There
will be objections from such agencies to become involved either
on a ’we are not really involved’ basis or ’we have already
provided training for this’, or ’we shall be looking after our
o w n ’. One of the side issues which has come to light is the
machoism approach by the male dominated agencies such as the
Police, Fire Service, Ambulance Service and even the Military.
Although the military did not have a direct involvement at
Hillsborough, we have learned that a unit of soldiers had
attended the match as spectators and had found it almost
impossible to receive help as this would damage their image
within their institution. The same to a lesser degree goes for
the Police, Fire and Ambulance Services.
V




    The normal peacetime disaster planning quite rightly has an
    element of training but the very fact that senior staff go
    through ’exercises’ is in itself a training experience. This,
    however, cannot replace the immediate on the spot tailored
    training that has to be provided following a disaster. I would
    certainly recommend that on day 1 and hour 1, a senior person
    from one of the involved agencies is to be identified as the
    person responsible for creating the training and to be freed up
    from other duties relating to the disaster and if possibloe, also
    from the day to day requirements of their own agency. It is sad
    that each group of agencies that meet following a disaster have
    to reinvent the wheel. Merseyside were extremely fortunate in
    drawing from the experiences of the Centre in Crisis Psychology
    and without their guidance would have spent and lost valuable
    weeks in thrashing around.  I wwlrt sngge^t that thft Social Work
    Inspectorate identify key personnel, such as David Mason, who
    could be brought in as advisors to other groups within hours of a
    disaster happening. The alternative would be to formally make
    links with the Centre in Crisis Psychology even up to a retainer
    basis.There even may be room for a combination of the above.
    Training is not cheap and the £20,000 approximtely, spent by the
    authorities, is an underestimate of the real training expenses
    incurred. Most of the authorities concerned also had inhouse
    training out of their own budgets in addition to the above. There
    is a danger that if training is discussed after the first
    enthusiasm and commitment by the politicians and others, then
    there will not be any cohesive approach. The injection of monies
    from CCETSW are pump priming monies for training and is a very
    useful mechanism and gets across the difficulties of some
    authorities who may be faced with very real financial problems.

        HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER: VISIT TO MERSEYSIDE
        1 AUGUST 1989

        I visited the special teams established in the Wirral,               Sefton,
        Liverpool and Knowsley to assist bereaved families and               survivors
        of the Hillsborough football disaster.  I lunched with               a number
        of Directors and senior officials, including the Chief               Probation
        Officer for Merseyside.

        2. A more detailed account of my personal impressions is
        attached for those who are interested. Salient features are:

                   2.1 The units were brought into existence as an important
                   part of the overall response of each local authority to a
                   local disaster.

                   2.2 The importance of the operation was reflected by the
                   allocation of additional resources.  The continuing need for
                   each unit is scrutinised periodically.

                   2.3 There are interesting differences between each unit as
                   well as fundamental similarities. All are engaged in
                   preventive social work corresponding to secondary or tertiary
                   prevention in the health model.

                   2.4 Organisation of the social services response was
                   facilitated by two strokes of good fortune:

                        -   the attendance of significant actors a few days
                            earlier at a regional gathering on disaster
                            planning,

                   and, more significantly,

                        -   the immediate availability of a Disaster Consultant,
                            Mr Michael Stewart, who provided immediately a
                            structure for action within which both members and
                            officials felt confident. His influence was
 DH (SSI)                   constantly referred to during the visit: in
                            particular, the support acquired from his accurate
0 8 AUG 1989                initial prediction of the course of reactions to the
  iH E T & v s *
                            disaster over time.
c   i




            2.5   The Directors have worked together well.

            2.6 Aspects of the experience deserve systematic recording
            and evaluation.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER: VISIT TO MERSEYSIDE
1 AUGUST 1989

The Wirral

Housed in the old Town Hall in elegant Hamilton Square. A team
leader and five social workers, all very experienced and all with
mental health backgrounds (one including hospital experience and
another voluntary work in CRUSE). Theirs is an explicit
preventive mental health approach, undertaking main stream
bereavement and grief-counselling in the context of a high
profile disaster.

2. Established at once by being called out of district teams,
they dealt immediately with the wide range of practical problems
besetting bereaved families and survivors. The rush of referrals
then fell away, to be followed by family and survivors returning
with classical symptoms.  They have 71 active cases with a
further 20 awaiting the establishment of group-counselling. Nine
of the cases are bereaved families, with substantial numbers
involved.

3. The shared mental health background gave a strongly marked
and integrated approach to preventive work.  Inter-professional
collaboration (with GPs, CPNs, EWOs, college counsellors and
youth workers) was obviously well developed.  They supported the
network and each other. They referred to the literature and to
Mr Stewart.

4. The concentration of work, as much as its nature, placed
pressure on the team. They were mutually supportive. Anxieties
were the mental health work they had left and the fact that
continued support for the unit was to be reviewed in October.
They point to the likely effect of inquests, the publication of
the report and the anniversary of the disaster as triggering
further referrals.

5. I was impressed by the Assistant Director (Jim Black) and by
the Team Leader (I            .

Sefton

6. A team leader and three social workers operate from the top
floor of an old people's home on the seafronti  Three of them are
approved social workers and one is a PSW with hospital
experience, but they are not operating with the strong mental
health culture of the Wirral Group. This shows through the lower
level of their contact with other agencies and the generally
pragmatic approach they have to the work. There is a strong team
identity, to the extent that they operate almost completely
detached from SSD operations - to the extent of not sharing
records.

                              1
7. Early work was dominated by important practical issues
affecting bereaved families.  Dealing successfully with these was
useful in establishing credibility. Referrals fell off after the
hectic activity of the first week but showed a revival after six
weeks as survivors and others reported, or were referred with,
relationship and employment problems, heavy drinking, aggression,
anxiety and depression.  Fifteen families are currently worked
with (including numerous individuals) and 24 survivors.  They
have a further 40 referred to them yet to be followed up. The
morale of the group was good, members showing a sense of being
privileged to do this work.  They referred to Michael Stewart's
help, to the literature and to learning on the job. They were
making extensive use of visual effects, including videos, and of
written accounts in working with people.

8.   Lunch with Directors.

This was a useful discussion.  Directors and CPO were concerned
to press the need for some structured evaluation of what had gone
on and to seek pointers about how to do it and how to raise money
for it. I agree that aspects of the experience deserve study.
An administrative case study could deal with the organisational
issues. A description of what had gone one would be useful
professionally.  But they needed to identify researchable issues
if they wished to encourage research. Ascertaining the
effectiveness of intervention, for example, would require
scientific enquiry over a period of time. They should identify
their areas of interest and be prepared to approach them
differentially.  Securing the interest of reputable researchers
would be necessary in order to produce supportable proposals and
tap research funds. The topic did not figure in current DH
research priorities but this did not preclude application to the
Department.

9.   Liverpool.

Liverpool had a completely different approach.   District social
work teams had dealt with initial referrals.   The authority had
decided to recruit a specially appointed team (two leaders and 12
social workers) on permanent appointments, who will move to other
jobs when the team's work is done.  It started work four weeks
ago and was still only just over half-strength.

10. This was in time to receive the revival of referrals that had
occurred, as in the other authorities, after the first few weeks.
Work that needed long-term commitment was also being transferred
from the districts.  Characteristics problems presented by
referrals included child management, disturbed behaviour and
excessive drinking.

11. Staff had applied for posts and had been appointed after
interview.  They were highly motivated and again included some
with hospital backgrounds and experience of working with both
mental health and traumatic injuries. One worker was seconded
from the Children's Society.  In discussion they stressed the
importance of good administrative and clerical backup and
reported difficulties of establishing a data base without the
assistance of IT. I was impressed by the Assistant Director,
Carole Wilkinson, and by one of the Team Leaders,

                              2
12. Help Line was situated in the same large and noisy room at
SSD HQ. Manned by volunteers, the level of referrals was now
down to 7-10 per day.

13. Knowslev.

This was a team of six located in the staff house of an old
people's home. The team was brought into being at once. Only
two of the original members remain, but all six will be staying
for the foreseeable future. They saw themselves as an integrated
part of their SSD and paid tribute to the total Departmental
effort that had sustained them.

14. They decided at the outset to visit all 13 bereaved families
and had done so within four days of the disaster.  They made 60
to 80 visits in the first two weeks and have pursued a policy of
positive outreach by visiting and repeat visiting of all
referrals. Main professional methods appear to be bereavement
and grief-counselling.

15. Knowsley assisted with arrangements for training sessions
for Merseyside staff and they too, referred to Michael Stewart as
a helpful influence.   Some of them were experiencing personal
stress and were using an external consultant for de-briefing.
Knowsley and Sefton referred to the helpfulness of the BASW
Staffline member who also appeared to be functioning as a
consultant.   Social workers in the team were still arranging to
spend time in their parent areas and there was a proposal to re­
locate them there, with them coming together regularly with their
co-ordinator.   They described client symptoms familiar to the
other authorities and spoke particularly of the effects of the
tragedy upon children. They have made a written record of early
experience and reported to Social Services Committee.

Dear David


I write to thank you for enabling me to visit you and your
colleagues on 1 August.  It was professionally stimulating, and
most valuable for me to hear directly from the staff involved
about their work with families bereaved by the Hillsborough
disaster and with some of the survivors.

I am writing in similar terms to all four of the Directors of the
Departments I visited, since I encountered everywhere a ’high
degree of professional commitment, application and skill to the
tasks undertaken.  I should be grateful if you would convey my
thanks to your colleagues for the time and attention they gave me
and for sharing their experience so generously.                                                          ,!!

My thanks to Miss Farrell for the arrangements for lunch and for
the useful discussion about evaluation.  I shall put the whole
day to good use.

Best wishes.


Y<yn$s sincerely

VISIT BY MR UTTING ON 12 JULY 1989

1.   David Mason rang on Thursday (29 June) to say that NALGO industrial action
     had been confirmed for Wednesday, 12 July and that the arrangements made
     for WBU's visit would have to be cancelled.  He suggested that a further
     visit could be arranged for any time after 20 July.

2.   Contacted WBU who was concerned anyway that British Rail   arelikely    to be
      on strike on that day.

3.   The only date he has available between 20 July andhis annual    leave is
      1 August.  He has provisionally blocked this in his diary and intends to
      travel up to Liverpool the previous evening.  I contacted the Directors'
     secretaries in Wirral, Sefton, Liverpool and Knowsley and each has
     pencilled in the visit for 1 August.   I said you will be finalising
     details on your return from leave.

4.   The hotel booking for Tuesday, 11 July has been cancelled and a
     provisional one made for Monday, 31 July.

5.   I trust these actions meet with your approval.

Dear David

PO R T HTT.T R R n R fT O T TTNTT


      has recently written to you following his enquiries to the Paul Hamlyn
Trust and the Mental Health Foundation.       I note the possible delay in
receiving any response from Mental Health Foundation until the Autumn. It
occurred to me that the Mental Health Foundation might well be interested in
funding some action research which might be a means of paying for part of the
proposed post Hillsborough Unit with research attached. It's a possibility.

I will keep you informed about any further information I get from London
though I will be on leave for about 10 days.

With kind regards
Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Mason

TTTTTRBOROriGH DISASTER

Thank you for arranging the programme for 12 July.              I am sure it will be a
valuable day.

I undertook to make enquiries about the possibility of obtaining funding for
the review of the current services.

M    r   p    f    Paul Hamlyn Trust, Sussex House, 12 Upper Mall, London W6
9TA, said that one of the Trust's current interests is innovative work in
education in Merseyside, but that its terms of reference were sufficiently
broad to consider an application. The Trustees will meet again in five or
six weeks' time and an application stressing the community education content
of the work might be considered, although it is a very long shot.

Mis                   Projects Officer of the Mental Health Foundation, 8
Hallam Street, London WIN 6EH, was more encouraging. What you require is
certainly within the terms of reference of the Trust. Before considering an
application they would wish to be satisfied' that all statutory avenues for
funding had been pursued, but she felt sure that the Trustees would consider
very sympathetically a funding application. Unfortunately, the agenda for
the July meeting is full and it could not be considered until the autumn
meeting which would probably be held in October.                   imderstood
the urgency of this funding request, but is unable to bring the consideration
forward.

I referred you also to the Carnegie Trust and you undertook to make enquiries
direct.

I hope that the above information will be of scone help.

Yours sincerely

         strike!). The social workers would very Much like to meet you and a
         full day has been planned as follows:

              9.00   am    -10.30 am   in the Wirral

    2.   If you would need to get away before 5.30pm the programme can be
         truncated.

People and organisations react very differently to traumatic
 events, while most,; in time, will cope w ith the emotional
  upheaval. Many will have great difficulty readjusting to
                 normal life after a crisis.
The Centre for Crisis Psychology exists to help people and
   organisations in this critical readjustm ent period. We
    encourage self evaluation and self awareness of the
psychological affects of traumatic experience. Emphasising
 and supporting the individual's natural resilience is often
crucial to the successful m anagem ent of the psychological
             after affects of such an experience.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

We spoke about my visiting Merseyside and I identified 11 or
12 July as possibilities.  I am willing to travel the night
before (or at crack of dawn) in order to provide a fairly full
day.

2. I should be more interested in getting to the content of the
work being done and talking to some of the people doing it than
in the managerial and organisational arrangements, but I must
obviously pay due regard to the latter.  I look forward to
hearing further from you.

1.      I had a conversation with Judy Downey concerning progress in London
        in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster etc, she had no further
        information to give me than what we already had. She was not sure whether
        Howard Parker had already put in a two page bid for money for research.
        As far as she was concerned nobody was writing any paper from SSI point of
        view in relation to evaluating counselling etc.

2   .   She suggested a conversation with   ____________ concerning research in
        order to identify what the possibilities were of any money.


Conversation with Howard Parker


1.      I met Professor Parker at another meeting and he enquired about the
        situation relating to the Hillsborough Unit etc. This was the day on
        which the letter had gone from Secretary of        State, so I advised him of the
        outcome.   He was disappointed but felt that there was little point in
        attempting to do research if there was no ongoing unit. He was however
        very keen to write up the process to date and was prepared to take time in
        August to do this but would want some money for this piece of work as he
        would expect to engage someone to assist him with it. I promised to bear
        this in mind if this became a possibility although I indicated that I did
        not know where the money might come from.


14 June 1989


1.      Conversation with David Mason who indicated that exploration of the Belwyn
        Rules seemed to rule out possibility of funding for the Hillsborough Unit
        being made available through D of E. David Mason was still pursuing with
        Keva Coombes the possibility of the citycouncil underwriting the costs of
        the Hillsborough Unit and there were discussions going on with
                    to see what chances there were of some interest from the
        Disaster Fund being made available to support the continued existence of
         the Hillsborough Unit. He was intending also to have a meeting with
                         in Merseyside Task Force to assist in putting together the
        application to D of E for funding.

2.      He had already started to do some work on pruning down the cost and nature
        of the Hillsborough Unit to see to what extent it could continue to be
        sustained through Liverpool funding. He confirmed that unfortunately
        other Directors were pulling out, notably St Helens.

3.      I suggested to him that maybe in a revised post Hillsborough Unit which
        had a research element built in given that bodies may be more interested
        in a research component rather than funding the actual unit might be
        possible to reconsider which bit of the unit could be incorporating into
        action research. David Mason was quite taken with this idea.
           David still continues to be committed to trying to ensure continued
           existence of a unit and fulfilling the commitment made to the victims of
           Hillsborough.

FILE NOTE


HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

1.   On 8 June I spoke to Mr Utting about his proposed visit to
     Liverpool.    I ascertained 11 & 12 July as possible dates.
     He would propose to travel up the evening before in order to
     have a full day in Liverpool.   He is particularly interested
     to  meet    Merseyside  staff who    are  involved  in grief
     counselling.     Does not want to do too much travelling,
     would prefer 2 or 3 substantial visits.         He would, of
     course,   be   prepared  to meet Directors,    if they were
     interested to meet him.     I undertook to confirm the dates
     with David Mason and discuss a possible programme.

2.   I updated him on the proposed review of the LA's response to
     date.   He thought that would be a very useful thing to do
     and when asked if he could suggest people who might help
     with this suggested NISW.       Although they would normally
     charge, they may be prepared to do it for a nominal fee
     because of their interest in stress work with social work
     staff.   He also suggested                  late of Sheffield
     University, who has recently retired and also
     from Sheffield.      As for funding from the research, he
     confirmed   that   Mental   H eal th Foundation might   be  a
     possibility and gave me the name of the Projects Officer,
     r                I and the address:
     (he is actually a trustee). He also mentioned the Carnegie
     Trust and I asked whether the Hamlyn Trust, with whom he had
     had recent contact, might be worth approaching, and he
     agreed that this would be worth pursuing.

     Later at the ADSS meeting spoke to David Mason, both 11 & 12
     July are possible for him and he will consult with others
     and get back to me.        He was very grateful     for the
     suggestions of NISW and                  (who he knows from
     FSU days) and the possible runaing sources.   I undertook to
     approach the Mental Health Foundation and the Hamlyn Trust.

FILE NOTE

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - REQUEST FOR REVIEW OF CURRENT OPERATIONS

1.   I spoke to David Mason at Maire Gibson's request on 5 June.
     He confirmed the request for advice on whether SSI or Cruse
     should be requested to take part in an evaluation in their
     current services for Hillsborough victims.  He said that his
     approach to SSI was in the nature of a courtesy request but
     he really believed that it would be more appropriate for
     Cruse to take this on, possibly with SSI help.   I said that
     I thought there might be difficulties in SSI undertaking an
     evaluation, even if we had the resources to do it.    I said
     it might be helpful to get a departmental view on whether
     the Disasters Working Group might be involved in the review
     and I would make enquiries and get back to him.

2.   I subsequently spoke to C Hey     and arranged to see her    on 6
      June.

3.   On 6 June spoke to C Hey who     had not been able to do more
     than have a look at her file.    She undertook to discuss with
                  who is still leading the departmental response
     to Hillsborough,   and who is the administrator for the
     Disasters Working Group.      Unfortunately, P Hall was off
     sick and J Downey on leave so she would not be able to make
     contact with them.

4.   On 7 June Carolyn rang to say that although
     appeared more sympathetic to the service b e i n g p r o v i d e d
     post-Hillsborough he did not feel      it was appropriate for
     the DWG to be involved in the proposed review since it was
     not set up to undertake this sort      of operation.    He had
     intended to co-ordinate a meeting to discuss within the
     Department how to review the post-Hillsborough situation
     and possibly work up a research brief.     This would be part
     of the Department's concern to evaluate local authorities'
     reaction to crises.  As this left me somewhat unclear as how
     to respond to David M ason's request she agreed that I should
     speak to             to ask whether the DWG would welcome a
     request for advice as to who might evaluate the current
     services.

5.                        J
     Spoke t o ____________ he did appear to be more understanding
     of Merseyside Authority's response but was still seeking
     evidence of the value of post-trauma counselling.     He said
     that the DWG would not be able to handle a request for
     advice about the evaluation, but of course the Merseyside
     authorities were free to approach Cruse.
6.   He   confirmed  his   intention   to assemble   a paper,   for
      consideration by a departmental meeting, identifying such
      research as there was, with a view to considering a research
     proposal on the response of local authorities to the
     Hillsborough disaster.    He would ensure that Region received
      a copy of the paper and an invitation to the meeting.   Later
      spoke to D Mason, told him that the DWG could not be helpful
     but that it was open to him to approach Cruse.      I told him
     that SSI had considered very carefully whether they had the
      resources   to   assist with    the  review  and  regretfully
      concluded that we hadn't.

7.   I advised him that I understood the letter had gone from the
      Secretary of State to Keva Coombes on 1 June and that a copy
     was being faxed through to me.

8.   Later I read over to D Mason the content of the Secretary of
      State's letter.    I suggested that it invited Merseyside
      authorities to quantify the total additional     expenditure
     which had resulted from the Hillsborough disaster, including
     the co-ordinated service proposal, to establish whether this
     was in excess of a penny rate and might therefore be subject
     to additional funding.   He asked whether expenditure from a
     number of authorities might by lumped together if handled
     by, say, Liverpool, in order that the penny rate product
     might be most favourably exceeded.   I advised that he should
     talk to                  l
                              o f Merseyside Task Force about how
     the presentation of the costing should be made

Dear Bill,

H ills b o r o u g h

Thank you for your letter              which I                havepassed on           to my staff and I amsure
they will appreciate your              writing.

I think we have all learnt a number of lessons from Hillsborough on the
importance of providing a co-ordinated approach both from statutory and
voluntary agencies. I think the important issue was to act quickly in
order provide this co-ordinated approach and this has certainly been of
benefit to those people affected by the disaster.

The Emergency Team which we set up in Sefton, has been very effective,
particularly as members   of the Teamwere able to visit     some of the
bereaved families on the Sunday night after the disaster on the Saturday,
and this contact has proved to be of enormous value, particularly to the
bereaved families.

As you know, it is diffcultl to bring together statutory agencies but much
more difficult to bring together voluntary organisations, and it was
interesting to note at a training day that we held yesterday for the whole
of Merseyside, that there was such a united response. I suppose that we
also feel a sense of achievement in that Loval Government has been able to
respond both quickly and effectively.! !

David Mason and I are hopeful that we will be able to raise funds for a
Regional Unit although we do appreciate it is a very diffcult task in the
light of the demands of other priorities.

Thank you for your good wishes.

Yours sincerel

  Thank you for your letter of 6 May about additional financial
  support for direct service provision and for the Regional Unit you
  propose to establish to provide and co-ordinate continuing care in
  the aftermath of the Hillsborough tragedy. You also wrote to
  John Moore, Secretary of State for Social Security and to
  Nicholas Ridley Secretary of State for the Environment.   Please
  accept this as a reply to all three letters.

  The Department’s Social Services Inspectorate have kept me informed
  of the action taken by the local social services departments
  together in the wake of the tragedy and I know that the Chief
  Inspector has written personally to all the Social Services
  Directors in appreciation of the remarkable efforts made by them and
  their staff.

  The precise response to a tra^e^y of this sort needs to be decided
  on the spot, on the basis of a careful examination of needs. My
  Department has no power to make additional resources available to -
  local authorities for this purpose. However, I understand from
  Nicholas Ridley, Secretary of State for Environment, that under a
  model scheme designed to deal with extra-ordinary costs arising from
  emergencies (the Bellwin Scheme), the Government has provided
  special financial assistance to local authorities in certain
  ci rcumstances.

  The Bellwin Scheme was drawn up after discussions with the Local                                         v-
  Authority Associations and provide for assistance towards the
  immediate and additional costs of dealing with an emergency once
  expenditure exceeds a threshold beyond which local authorities would
  normally be expected to budget for. In the case of the last us*e of
  the Scheme, following the Great Storm of 1987, that threshold was
  (for Counties and Metropolitan Districts) set at the exclusive
  product of a l.Op rate.

B.

If you consider that you have a case for assistance of this kind,
Nicholas Ridley is prepared to consider a detailed and fully costed
application (though at first sight it looks as if the level of
expenditure needed would be substantially below the likely threshold
for the authorities involved).  I know that he will keep me informed
of events if you do decide to pursue this possibility.

The Government has, of course, as you mention/ already made a
contribution of £500/000 to the Disaster Fund to help those most
closely affected by the Disaster

HTTTfiBaRanGH DISASTER

1.   We have ceased sending bulletins down to London concerning the activity
     in the North West relating to the above, although the local authorities
     still meet on a weekly basis to review progress.

2.   I have not copied this note to anyone else in the Department as I am not
     sure who still retains an interest.

3.   The last meeting I attended of the co-ordinating group was on 26 May
      1989. I am attaching a copy of the notes I made after the meeting which
     reflect the sense of concern and anxiety that the aspirations of the
     Mersey authorities may not be realised.       Whilst this anxiety was
     expressed there continued to be a very strong commitment that a number
     of local authorities would do all in their power to ensure the delivery
     of a quality service to families and victims affected by Hillsborough.

4.   I am also copying to you a report which was prepared by a group of
     officers to review the current services being provided post-
     Hillsborough. This is an honest appraisal of the current co-ordination.
     It was discussed at the meeting I attended on 26 May and highlighted the
     problems of maintaining a co-ordinated response across local authorities
     in the absence of separate and additional staff to provide the co­
     ordination on a full time basis.     The issues raised were also those
     which Michael Stewart, the consultant, had indicated would be present in
     any post-crisis situation.

5.   I believe Brian Harrison has spoken to you about an approach I had on
     5 June 1989 from David Mason, Director of Social Services for Liverpool,
     following the meeting of local authority representatives on Friday 2
     June 1989.    Basically, members of this meeting had confirmed the
     problems of running a service new, the demand was falling off for help
     and initial goodwill was running out in seme quarters.      There was a
     strong feeling that it was important to replace the rather creaking
     service now with a substantive long term service. The feeling of the
     group however, was that an inspection of the current services was much
     needed in order to identify problems in a more rigorous manner and to
     help to define a ’quality service*. Mr Mason1s request was for a joint
     SSI/CRUSE working party inspection.
6.   The Merseyside representatives had identified the need to split the
     inspection into three parts:-

     a)   an evaluation of the helpline and outreach work;

     b)   an evaluation of the computer (database); and

     c)   an evaluation of the public relations approach adopted by the
          Merseyside authorities.

7.   Help from SSI was requested in relation to an evaluation of the
     counselling services (helpline and outreach work).

8.   David Mason had already made contact with Mr Nuttall at CRUSE and I
     understand he is a member of the Disasters Working Party (DWP). David
     Mason has also spoken to the chair of the EWP, and there seems to be an
      interest in evaluating the activities on Mersey as the information would
     be of value to the EWP.

9.   I believe Mr Harrison has indicated the response from this region and
     the possible difficulties for SSI to be involved in the evaluation of a
     piece of work which is currently seeking Government funding. I haven11
     really thought this one through but, in any case, we would have
     difficulties, I think, in this region providing a member of an
     inspection team at short notice.     It may be that SSI as a body may
     welcome however, the opportunity to form part of an inspection team
     which can obtain first hand experience of post-disaster activity.

10. I hope the above information and the background papers will assist you
    in any further deliberations as it may well be that the next contact
    from the Merseyside Directors may come in relation to a request from
    them to CRUSE or the EWP to take part in an evaluation of their current
    services for Hillsborough victims.

      Note for file                                     Date: 5 June 1989

      P H O T H T T .T fiB P R m C T T n rS A S T R R
      iocftL jgrnmrry c d k m t o i a t i n g meeting - 26 m a y 1989

      1.      I attended the meeting of the above to find some degree of low spirits
              amongst Directors, which whilst they recognised was understandable and
              had been predicted by Michael Stewart, they still found difficult.
              There was also an acknowledgement that some SSDs were drawing back and
              politicians were unlikely to give the same degree of support they had
              done some weeks earlier.         Basically, there was a feeling that
              Hillsborough, was yesterday's news.

      2.      In particular, St Helens were drawing attention to this very issue and
              the representative from St Helens was indicating that he was having
              problems in justifying his continued attendance at the meetings.

      3.       Directors, Mr Mason and Miss Farrell accepted this, although it was
               clear that their commitment was still more than from other local
               authorities. Lancashire to some extent identified with this issue but
               seemed still to be striving to ensure political support.

      4.      Reference was made to the meeting with Howard Parker to review the
              progress to date. It was acknowledged that there needed to be a quality
              assurance model to look at each aspect of the continuing service. The
              group which, had met to discuss quality assurance, still felt that the
              agreed suggestion for a long term unit was appropriate. There was also
              a feeling that any plan for the future must ensure a local response.
              There had been problems identified in the use of the data base using the
               1Zeebrugee1 package.     It was now felt that this package was
              inappropriate. It was agreed there was a need for a group of officers
              to address the current issues. Seme of the procedures were creaking and
              falling apart. In relation to the computer package, it was acknowledged
              that some IAs were using other computer packages and there was ~no
              guarantee whatsoever that information was being fed from any local
              databases onto the main package in Liverpool.        Mr Will Twist from
              Lancashire indicated it mi^it be possible to get some help in relation
              to canpatibility of programmes. Great concern was expressed an how to
              guarantee a quality service in future given the withdrawal of certain
              aspects of the service. Commitments and promises had been given to the
              general public that ongoing help would be available.

              It was also acknowledged that other local authorities outside Merseyside
              were not passing on information to the central information base and
              David Mason was going to take this up again with             to raise it
              through ADSS.

      5.      There was some discussion about the possibility of another meeting with
              politicians, the timing of this was felt to be important.
6 .   Reference was made to a BBC documentary an Hillsborough in which the i a s
      m y play a part. Officers of the IAs are still of the opinion that the
      involvement of the IAs in their counselling support role received very
      little recognition.

7.    Problem of central funding was still a big issue and members present
      were really quite distressed and irritated that there had been no
      response from London. They queried whether letters had actually got
      through to ministers and the EM. The question was raised as to whether
      the organisation currently could be sustained until funding appeared, if
      at all. Given that there might be no possibility of funding for the
      planned unit, what aspects of the current system could be maintained.

8.    A suggestion was made that members might go back to their politicians
      and remind them that they had supported the original strategy and staff
      had ensured the services were running but at what cost to staff and what
      was the next step.

9.    There was a strong feeling that there was a need for a central co­
      ordinator and it was recognised that already there was slippage within
      staffing and systems. This was regarded as high priority.

10. Reference was made to the fact the IAs had already put in a great amount
    of money, half a million (£) expenditure in Liverpool. Is political
    will still there?

11. It was finally agreed there should be some short term contingency plan
    for at least 3 months and that IAs need to discuss internally an action
    plan for service in the next 3 months. Reference was made as to whether
    in fact this should or should not be shared with politicians.

12. There was to be a meeting with NWASSA on 16 June 1989 which might be a
    possible arena to share Directors's dilemmas.

13. It was decided that Directors would meet again and their representatives
    at 2.00pm on the following Friday (2.6.89) having had discussions back
    in local authorities to identify weaknesses and to come up with views
    about how to proceed. It was agreed that at this stage no politicians
    would be involved.

14. Burton Manor had been offered for use of staff on 16,17 and 18 August.
    It was agreed this should be made available for staff who had been
    manning the help lines and providing a direct service to clients. It
    was agreed that Derek Evans should negotiate some plan for the use of
    Burton Manor on those days.

15.   Derek Evans frcan Wirral referred to the psychotherapy and family therapy
      which was taking place with some families in relation to the
      Hillsborough tragedy and wondered whether in fact there was any video
      material from the BBC available to help in training purposes and as part
      of the therapeutic work with families. There was scene doubts expressed
      about the wisdom of this although it was agreed that an approach should
      be made to the BBC to find out what could be made available, if
      anything.
Comment

    A rather dispirited meeting although staff recognised the "phase of
    lull" which Michael Stewart had identified.     There were strong views
    expressed about the failure of the government to respond and the feeling
    that local politicians m y in fact use this to further disassociate
    themselves from central government. It could in fact became politically
    difficult.   I tried to indicate the problems in relation to funding,
    setting precedents etc. There was a lot of aggression about money which
    had gone from central government direct to the disaster fund and the
    money which was going to the CRUSE working party. I was informed that
    Mr Utting had phoned David Mason and that he had agreed to come and
    visit Mersey region to talk with staff about the developments. He had
    also indicated that there was no way this should be associated with a
    premise of money from central government.

    Dear Catherine


    Thank you for your letter of 24 May.  I was pleased to have this
    additional information directly from you and I have had a further
    word by telephone with David Mason since you wrote.

    I quite understand that the action needed creates problems of
    priorities and resources for you. The authorities concerned have
    written to the Secretary of State about this, and I ought not to
    anticipate his reply by commenting myself at this stage!

    Best wishes.


    Yours sincerely

   Chief Inspector,
   Social Services Inspectorate,
   Department of Health,
   Richmond House,
   79 Whitehall,
   LONDON,
   SW1A 2NS

   Dear Bill,

   Many thanks for your kind letter of May 10th. The follow up to the Hillsborough
   disaster has been very stressful for all of the Merseyside Councils and has fallen
   particularly heavily on Social Services though I must acknowledge that our fellow
   Departments, the Health Authority and the Voluntary Agencies have helped and
   encouraged all of us.

   Our staff in Knowsley, both those directly involved and those covering the normal
   services, have been superb. The Departmental Management Group led by my Deputy,
   David Rimer, and heavily supported by the Chairman of Social Services,
   Cllr. George Howard, deserve particular praise in organising the initial response
   to the disaster while I was on leave in the States.

  However, our concern now in common with other authorities in Merseyside, is how to
  keep the necessary support services going for the bereaved, for survivors and for
  others affected, for what appears from the evidence of other disasters to be a
  period of 2-3 years at least. In Knowsley we have identified at least 120 cases
  where support will be needed in the longer term and we are still receiving regular
  referrals from the Merseyside Hillsborough Helpline and direct from sources in the
  Borough. Our Council has, despite being in the middle of a long term strategy to
  reduce its expenditure, allowed us to increase our establishment to try and keep
  up with the in-house work but we, with all the other authorities involved, are
  deeply concerned about the funding needed for the cross-Merseyside follow up
  work. As you are probably aware David Mason, who has provided a magnificent lead
  to Merseyside post Hillsborough planning, is now working on finding funds for this
  very necessary follow up task. The report of the Inter-Agency Planning Group by
  Professor Howard Parker from Manchester University proposed a regional unit to
  supply:-




                                                                                   /contd..

Mr. W.B. utting
Social Services Inspectorate                                 24th May 1989




      an ongoing helpline;
      co-ordination of counselling help to deal with referrals within the region
      and from across the country and make sure help is available when and where
      required;
      a database to match needs and resources as well as to provide essential
      monitoring of use of services;
      a public relations and information function;
      a centre for staff training and support;
      a quality control and assurance role to ensure that services for bereaved
      people, survivors and others affected across the region are of comparable
      accessibility and quality.

I'm sure that you will already have been made aware of the difficulties for the
Merseyside authorities in finding finance for this work. Any help that you could
offer in suggesting paths for funding and in supporting applications for funding
would be a considerable encouragement to a somewhat "battle-weary" but still
active and together group of Social Services Departments.

Yours sincerely,




Catherine Briscoe

I attach a copy of Mr Mason's response to my letter of 10 May.

2. I should be pleased to spend a day in Liverpool - other
things being equal - because I have strong professional interest
in bereavement and grief counselling.  I have told Mr Mason that
I could visit only if this was regarded as not bearing on the
application for cash! Do you and colleagues concur?

  Dear Bill,


       Thank you very much for your letter of the 10th, which I received on
  Friday. I did try to call you back on Monday, but was advised that you were
  not well. I hope you are soon restored to health.

       I realise that colleagues in the North West Region have been keeping
  you advised of our work, and have been pleased to receive their support
  and sound advice. Your congratulations are most welcome, and I will ensure
  that they are conveyed to staff here in Liverpool.

       Our speed of response andreaction to the tragedy has been possible
  because of the tremendous effort that has been made by colleagues throughout
  the Department and the other agencies. It has not been a Liverpool venture,
  but a collaborative piece of work involving other Local Authority Departments,
  the voluntary sector, as well as colleagues in Health and Probation.

       1 am sure it would be much appreciated, if you felt able, to visit
  Merseyside to see for yourself the work that is being done or, alternatively,
  if one of your Civil Service colleagues from the Centre was able to do
  this. There has been a recognition by many groups of the effort of staff,
  and the support we have received has been excellent. Acknowledgement by
  the Inspectorate and the Department of Health would, in this context, I
  feel, be helpful.

      Again, many thanks for your letter, and the personal message.


                                  Yours sincerely,



                           DIRECTOR OF SOCIAI^JSERVICBS.

     o
    194.   Trust Fund.

           It was reported that at a meeting of the Trustees held on 24th May
           it had been agreed that -

           (a)   thanks be passed to Social Services Departments for dealing with
                 claims for hardship/special needs;
           (b)   arrangements continue for Social Services Departments to make
                 interim hardship payments, restricted from now to £150 per family -
                 payments in excess to be verified fiJ'&t with the Trustees;         All to note
           (c)   lump sum payments of an unspecified amount will be made within
                 7 days to the next of kin of the deceased and to the families
                 of those hospitalised on 21st April;
           (d)   funeral expenses be paid by the Fund.


           It was alpo reported that an approach had been made on 22nd May to
           the Fund to establish whether Fund monies could be directed towards
           the costs of a permanent drop-in centre, a regional assistance unit,
           staff support and a ‘Hillsborough Newsletter’, but that a response
           had not, as yet, been forthcoming.

           It was agreed that the information provided by the Trustees from the
           meeting on 24th May be noted and the concern of the Group about the
           decision to deal only at this stage with the families of the deceased
           and those hospitalised on 21st April be conveyed to the Trustees,
           given that a need exists to deal expeditiously with at least some of
           those injured who do not satisfy the criteria of being hospitalised on
           21st April.

           All authorities are requested to submit to the Fund for payment               All to not
           claims arising from the making of immediate hardship payments.

   195.    B.A.S.W. Staffline.

           It was agreed that consideration of the B.A.S.W, request for funding
           be deferred until the next meeting of this Group, when a detailed             C.Wilkinec
           breakdown of the request should be available,— —

   196.    Finance.

           A note was circulated detailing the various organisations/individuals
           which have been approached for financial assistance and David Mason
           outlined the responses received to date. A response has not yet been
           forthcoming from the Government or the E»E.C» Goodwill has been
           displayed by a number of organisations which may materialise into offers
           of financial assistance for services. David Mason undertook to keep
           the Group informed of developments. David Mason also reported that
           although not confirmed, it was possible that a grant of £20,000 would
           be made by C.C.E.T.S.V., which could be utilised to finance the cost
           of training courses.

           A discussion ensued about whether the Regional Unit would better
           attract funding it it were a voluntary body, distanced from local

    HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY - SECRETARY OF STATE'S CORRESPONDENCE


    1.   In the absence of Mrs Hall, I am co-ordinating the response for SSI to your
         minute and papers of 18th May.

    2.   I have discussed your draft response to the Merseyside authorities with SSI
         col 1eagues.

    3.   Clearly, if this Department does not have any power to make additional
         resources available, we must refer them to the Department which does.

    4.   However, we think it would be helpful if the money contributed by
          government to the National Disaster Fund could in future be targetted to
          the provision of the necessary additional services needed to relieve
          individual distress, which will subsequently be funded by local authorities
          and other agencies.

    5.   SSI are convinced of the value of a central co-ordinating and monitoring
         role in a disaster affecting so many local authorities and that this is an
         appropriate use of resources. The proposed work would complement that
         undertaken by the Disasters Working Party.

    6.   It is important that the service provision and the lessons to be learned
         from co-ordination on such a scale are not lost.

    7.   We are particularly concerned that resources provided in emergency
         circumstances are not at the cost of essential on going provision to often
         vulnerable clients.

       A note about the position of the Trust Fund concerning the purchase
       of tieckets and payment of expenses for bereaved families attending
       the F.A. Cup Final was circulated. Essentially, the Fund has agreed
       to reimburse travel and subsistence to each of the 500 ticket holders
       up to £50 per person as judged necessary by each Social Services
       Department involved. The Fund has not agreed to purchase the 300
       non-complimentary tickets, a decision received by this meeting with
       surprise and regret.

       Authorities are requested to make direct application to the Fund for       All to note
       the reimbursement of any monies disbursed by them.

180.   Staff.

                   circulated a note about the possibility of establishing
       meetings of Team Leaders/Co-ordinators involved in specialist work in
       each Authority following the Hillsborough disaster. The purpose of
       such a forum could be —

       (i )     to test out and share ideas;
       (ii)     to keep informed of regional perspective;
       (iii)    to raise issues from different angles;
       (iv)     to receive information from the Inter Agency Group for
                discussion;
       (v)      to pass ideas to the Inter Agency Group for discussion; and
       (vi)     to break down feelings of isolation and marginalisation.

       The feeling of the meeting was that this Group should set up the
       opportunity for a Forum of Team Leaders/Co-ordinators to meet on a
       regional basis and thereafter, be further involved only to the
       extent that the Forum consider it essential. It was agreed that
               would contact                (Liverpool Social Services
       Department) about arranging an initial meeting at Cherry House of
       representatives from core teams on the basis of two places per
       Authority, including Sheffield and Nottingham.

181.   B.A.S.W.

       Carol Wilkinson reported a request from B.A.S.W. for funding up to
       £30,000 to cover the cost of Staffline and the cost of a 6 month
       contract for the Co-ordinator (commencing on 1st June) including
       secretarial support, expenses, on-costs etc. It was agreed that Carole
       Wilkinson be asked to discuss this matter further with B.A.S.W. and
       submit the request, in writing, to the next meeting of this Group for      Carole
       consideration, such request to include a complete breakdown of the         Wilkinson.
       overall figure.

       Arising from its consideration of this matter, it was agreed that
       Paddy Marley should approach the Trust Fund to raise whether the Fund      Paddy
       is intending to contribute towards the cost, specifically, of -            Marley.

       (i)      the debriefing service;
       (ii)     the drop-in centre; and
       (iii)    the proposed Regional Support Unit,

       with a view to a meeting between    the Fund and representatives of this
       Group.
                                     - 2 -



          It was also agreed that all Authorities should now submit to the Trust       All to not
          Fund details of hardship payments made by them for reimbursement.

182   .   Disaster Fund — Benefit Implications.

          A paper was circulated - reproduced as Annex 'A' to these Minutes -
          outlining the current position and the legislation available to deal         All to not
          with the enhancement of housing benefit. Authorities are requested
          to refer the paper to their Welfare Benefits Advisors for

          The meeting noted that as yet, a response has not been received from
          Government/E.E.C. to the requests of this Group for financial
          assistance.

184.      Offers of Help.

          It was agreed that in the absence of any firm proposals relating to the
          response to the various offers of help, consideration of the matter be
          again deferred until the next meeting of this Group, by which time it
          is envisaged that Pauline Farrell will have some feedback from the
                                                                                       Pauline

          through the various offers. A view was expressed that local off ers
          of help should be picked up as appropriate by Authorities locally but
          it was agreed to postpone any decision until the next meeting.

AN OUTLINE OF THE CURRENT POSITION AND THE LEGISLATION AVAILABLE TO DEAL
WITH ENHANCEMENT OF HOUSING BENEFIT.

In cases where a capital payment has been made from the Disaster Fund,
housing benefit payments would be reduced once capital reached £3,000 and
totally suspended when capital reached £8,000.  This is because of the
"notional income" rule whereby capital over £3,000 is treated as producing
a weekly "notional income" of £1.00 for every £250.00 (or part thereof) of
capital held above £3,000. For e.g. a claimant with capital of £5,200.
would be deemed to possess a "notional income" of £9.00 per week and
housing benefit would be reduced by £7.65 per week.

There is^legislation which allows enhancement of housing benefit in certain
circumstances.  It could operate to increase housing benefit entitlement in
those cases where the capital and income rules have reduced entitlement.

It cannot be used to award housing benefit where the rule has extinguished
entitlement to housing benefit.  Therefore anyone who has received a
payment from the Disaster Fund and is still eligible for housing benefit
could be awarded the same rebate they were receiving prior to any Disaster
Fund payment which altered that assessment. The regulation which could be
applied is outlined below.

(1) Regulation 69 Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987

    69 (8) "The appropriate authority may, if a claimant’s circumstances
are exceptional, increase the weekly amount of any housing benefit to be
paid in his case, but only when such an increase is in respect of costs
which are eligible housing costs under part III."

This paragraph gives the authority power to treat a claimant as entitled to
more weekly Housing Benefit than he is due under the rest of this
regulation and Part VIII if his circumstances are exceptional.

Total expenditure by the authority under this paragraph is limited by
Section 28 (9) to 0.1Z of the authority’s expenditure on benefits under the
statutory scheme. Housing Benefit Review Boards are not covered by this
restraint. (N.B. Reg. 83 (2)). The council could influence the exercise of
this discretion by laying down its own guidelines and directives in the
exercise of this regulation.  The first hurdle to overcome in considering
the enabling effect of Reg.69 is that an increase in Housing Benefit may
only be made to cover costs which are ’eligible’ for Housing Benefit.

Reg. 8 states that Housing Benefit shall be payable in respect of the
payments specified in regulations 9 (1) and 10(1). Reg. 9(1) states "The
payments in respect of which Housing Benefit is payable in the form of a
rate rebate are the payments by way of rates in respect of the dwelling
which a person occupies as his home." This regulation makes it quite clear
that ’eligible’ housing costs (for rates) means the whole of the rates
bill.  (i.e. not 80Z of the rates).
♦ ’   »   t


                                                           - 2 -



               Reg. 69 can therefore be applied to award extra Housing Benefit up to the
               total cost of a person’s rate bill and is not limited to the 80Z rate as
               contained in the definition of maximum Housing Benefit payable.

               Reg. 10 outlines the payments in respect of which Housing Benefit is
               payable in the form of a rent rebate and provides that certain charges are
               ineligible housing costs i.e. those not connected with the provision of
               adequate accommodation.  This means that Reg. 69 cannot be used to award
               extra Housing Benefit for ineligible service charges - such as fuel, meals
               or leisure items.

               The second hurdle to overcome is in the consideration of whether a
               claimant’s circumstances are exceptional. This means that each claimant
               must be considered individually, although I would submit that the
               exceptib'nal circumstances could be expected to be similar in each case.

               The claimant does not need to request additional Housing Benefit before it
               can be awarded. An authority may choose to award additional benefits on
               the facts before it.

               There is no definition of ’exceptional’ in the Act or Regulations nor is
               there any restriction on what exceptional circumstances the authority can
               take into account. The exceptional circumstances need not relate to
               housing or housing need or even hardship.

               It could be reasonably argued that the case for enhancing Housing Benefit
               payments to those affected by the Hillsborough tragedy are justified on two
               counts.   Firstly that the generosity of the public in creating the Disaster
               Fund should not be used to compensate the cost to the authority in
               benefits.   Secondly that interim payments from the Fund are intended to
               meet very ’special needs’ and should not be directed from this purpose to
               pay increased housing costs resulting from a loss of housing benefit.

                (2) Operating a Local Scheme         '

               The cost of a local scheme is not limited to the permitted total of Housing
               Benefit granted in the year, but it is also not eligible for Housing
               Benefit subsidy.

               The only improvement the local authority are presently permitted is to
               disregard war disablement pensioners or war widow’s pensions in whole or in
               part.

              . However, the Act also gives the Secretary or State power to provide for
                local schemes in other ways but only to the extent that the cost does not
                exceed the ’permitted total’ i.e. (0.1Z) - This power has not been
                exercised, but could be requested.

               A local scheme could provide another way of disregarding income and capital
               payments from the Disaster Fund.

     Liverpool.


     Dear Mr. Reddingtop,

          I have been asked by the Co-ordinating Committee                      of Local Authorities
     to approach you with a view to establishing the views                      of the Trustees on
     whether finance from the Trust Fund could be directed                      towards a number of
     projects which are being planned to assist the people                      affected by the
     Hillsborough disaster. These are as follows:-

      1.    Permanent Drop-in Centre.

      As you know, we have operated a drpp-in facility for relatives and friends
      of those affected by the disaster at the Vernon Sangster Sports Club. It is
      clear that there will be a continuing need for such a drop-in facility for
      many years to come and it has been decided, therefore, that we should erect a
      permanent drop-in centre, probably in the Anfield area, which would enable
      relatives and friends to meet and discuss common problems together, with a
      facility for a social work presence when required. For this unit to achieve
      and maintain credibility it is felt that the centre should not be run by any
      one local authority, but would be managed by a management committee of victims
      of the Hillsborough disaster. Obviously they will require assistance in the
      form of staff to run the centre on an operational basis, but the decisions on
      how the centre should be operated would be made by the management committee.
      We are endeavouring to obtain finance from other sources for this facility
      but in the event of that not being successful, I should be grateful if you
      would indicate whether the Trust Fund could be of assistance. The estimated
      cost of such a centre, excluding site and site works, would be in the order
      of £58,000. The staffing costs have yet to be determined.

      2.     Regional Unit.

      A working party of senior staff drawn from statutory and voluntary agencies
      in the region have examined the potential for the creation of a regional
      assistance unit to undertake the longer term work associated with the disaster.


When calling or telephoning please ask for:                                          continued...... /
Such a unit would provide for the continuance of the Helpline;
counselling; specialised work; database and staff training and support.
The need for such a unit has been underlined by experiences in other
tragedies. It is felt that this support unit would be required for a
minimum period of 2 years and would have staff who would operate the
Helplinejrun an efficient database; oversee the pattern of services to
enable resources to be used effectively; ensure that Districts provide
systematic support and training for all staff; develop clear channels
of communication and form partnerships with all relevant Authorities
and non-statutory agencies in the region; set up monitoring,evaluation
and performance review systems. The initial costing for such a unit would
indicate that it will require £340,000 p.a. for a period of 2 - 3 years.

3.   Staff Support.

As you will imagine, the affect on Local Authority and other agency staff
who have been deeply involved in counselling during and following the
disaster has been considerable, particularly in regard to key workers who
will be continuing their involvement with the victims. There is.an on-going-
need for staff support. The British Association cf Social Workers has
organised an immediate response by arranging for staff to be seconded to
the area, but in the longer term it is anticipated that there will be a need
for such a facility for six months and the estimated cost of establishing
such a resource, including office accommodation and support services, has
been given as £30,000.

4.   Newsletter.

Arising from the establishment of a permanent drop-in Centre, the experience
of other disasters indicate that there is a need for a communication link
with victims and following the 'Herald of Free Enterprise' tragedy a
newsletter was produced which enables victims to keep in contact with each
other and ‘express their feelings in written form. It is hoped that such a
newsletter could be developed from the permanent drop-in centre and given
the experience of the 'Herald Link' newsletter, the cost of production of
each issue is about £800. The frequency of issue is obviously one that
needs further examination.


     As I have previously indicated, attempts are being made to obtain
financing from other sources towards these projects, but it would be
helpful if you could obtain an indication as to whether the Trust Fund would
be in the position to make monies available, especially as all the projects
are specifically dedicated to the casualties of the disaster and are not
projects which would normally be the responsibility of a Local Authority.



                                     Yours sincerely,

Dear

May I, on behalf of the Liverpool branch of the National Union of
Journalists, offer our condolences to you and your family, on your
tragic loss at the Hillsborough disaster.

Our trade union, which belongs to the Trades Union Congress, represents
the majority of journalists working for the press, TV, and radio in this
country.  Our branch has been horrified by some of the coverage given by
certain sections of the press, to this terrible event.

Reports have circulated that bereaved families were harassed by sections
of the press.   It has also been said that some families were approached
by reporters from national news papers, pretending to be social workers
from the Liverpool City^Council, or reporters from the Liverpool Daily
Post and Echo.   We do not wish to revive bitter memories for you, but if
you wish to complain you can.   If these things are true, we as a trade
union would like to deal with such people through our unions'
disciplinary procedure.   If you have evidence of these things, and would
like to complain, please write to us. In particular you should look for
clues of the identity of the journalists concerned.   For example,  did
you tell something of a personal nature to someone who you believed to
be a social worker, that appeared in a national newspaper?
Enclosed with this letter is a copy of our professional code of conduct.
I would like to draw your attention to the first six sections, and in
particular number six.   If you feel that any reporter, or photographer
has gone against this code of conduct, in particular where it concerns
your family, please write to me.   If we think that you have got a case
we will take this up through our unions diciplinary procedures, on your
behalf.

The Liverpool branch of the HUJ has decided to co-operate with any of
the enquiries into Hillsborough that is to examine the role of the media
in these events.   If you wish any of your complaints against the press
to be submitted to any of these enquiries please let me know.   If not
your privacy will be protected.   Ve hope that you appreciate that the
vast majority of journalists attempt to maintain the highest
professional and ethical standards in their work.   They try to report
events accurately, and without bias. For this reason we hope that you
use your opportunity to complain.   This letter is being sent to you via
the Liverpool City Council.   Ve do not know your home address, because
we want to preserve your privacy if you do not wish to respond,   Ve
share your sorrow.
Yours sincerely,

Sue Hesk.   < Branch Secretary.)

JUDICIAL INQUIRY.

Information has been received from Detective Chief Inspector
Williams that Lord Justice Taylor has agreed to two television
companies producing documentaries regarding the Hillsborough Disaster
to carry out "fly on the wall" type filming at the Inquiry.

Details of the documentaries are as follows

     1)   Yorkshire Television - interviews with injured people,
          relatives, police etc. covering all aspects of the disaster.

     2)   Birmingham Regional Television - specific to West Midlands
          Police involvement in the Inquiry.


Neither documentary will be shown on television until after the
conclusion of Lord Justice Taylor1s Inquiry. It is important to note
that the police will be speaking to people involved in the Hillsborough
Disaster to explain that the documentaries are being made and will
not pressure anyone to allow filming of interviews etc.

It is advisable that information regarding these documentaries are
passed to Helpline and Core Teams in case there is any reaction to
police contact.

INTRQBUfiTIQH
       The Hillsborough disaster and its aftermath continues to have a profound
and traumatic effect on many people. The immediate response of all agencies
was admirable. It cut through many of the traditional methods of working both
w ithin and between agencies and enabled a sensitive ’crisis s e r v i c e ’ to bs
delivered remarkably well.

       It was recognized in the After Hillsborough Report that this emergency
response could not and would not be sustained. Statutory agencies 1n
particular ’r e- no r m a l i z e ’ and other pressures and priorities roll back into
place. Thus it was recommended that a regional coordinating structure which
included some ’i n de p en de n t’ staff and funding would be required to assure
clarity of purpose and sustain a high quality service over the next couple of
years.

      This short paper notes that warning signs are now appearing which
suggest that the continued lack of a Regional Unit will inevitably lead to a
less effective overall service for Hillsborough victims. It is also felt
important that we ^11 look beyond Hillsborough and recocnlie that given
further disasters will occur the Hillsborough response needs to be monitored
and evaluated and the lessons learnt in the N.W. disseminated nationally.


EMERGING PROBLEMS
       The staff, particularly in Liverpool, who have been organizing central
services such as the Helpline and the Database have worked remarkably hard in
extremely difficult circumstances. What is becoming clear however is that
’effort' will not necessarily translate into effective service if the
principles, framework and tools are ill thought out or inappropriate. Some
ex amples of the problems which are emerging in the absence of a coordinating
structure are:

(I) Database

      A lthough beginning to produce some useful output from over a thousand
entries, the programme (used in the Zeebrugge follow up) is not ideal and will
not be able to provide the appropriate i n f o r m a t i on service. It has not befcn
possible to implement the recommendations made 1n the After Hillsborough
Report and in the absence of a coordinated corporate approach it 1s clear that
many hundred of referrals and cases are not being forwarded to the Database.
Moreover ma ny voluntary agencies are not referring to the Database at all.
Referrals w h ic h are being received often do not contain vital information.
All this dysfunctionin g 1s perfectly predictable and Is not the fault cf
individual staff. It is the product of the non-implementation of a corporate
strategy.

(II) Helpline
      This line was a great success during the initial crisis phase following
Hillsborough. However its use is dropping off rapidly. Its ro'e nec-ds
rethinking and then relaunching with a new central number, Again 1t is
unlikely that this can occur 1n the absence of a Regional Unit.

(111) Communication and PR

      There are numerous examples of poor communication particularly between
statutory and voluntary services. ’C o m p e t i t i o n ’ between agencies is apparent
and evidence that some families are being over visited because of
uncoordi na t ed responses between agencies 1s now emerging.

          In relation to PR the present reactive response, warned against in Aft er
Hi 1 I s b o r o u a h . means that media Interest 1n Hillsborough tas waned. Thus the
Impression begin gained is that the problem is over. This is not true as the
evidence produced by the Database and local agencies demonstrates.
U nfortunately images and Impressions influence resourcing and a self
fulfilling prophecy emerges - no Regional Unit - no proactive approach to PR -
  no media interest - no lasting problem - no need for a Regional Unit.
                     t               * * * * * * * *

      The problem as we see 1t is that six weeks after Hillsborough there is
still no clarity of purpose about the 'second p h a s e ’ response and no real
structure to ensure quality and equity of service. This situation is bound to
continue without regional coordination and sufficient staff whose primary task
is to manage and motivate the overall response.


THE WAY FORWARD
      The need for regional coordination and support via a Regional Assistance
Unit remains. Indeed on the evidence of the past montn the r ^       a r.ions ‘.n
the After Hillsborough Report seem even more pertinent.

       We recommend the setting      up   of the Re g io nsLi^sistauisJj;i 1'
       without further d e l a y .
      Even in the absence of such a Unit, at this time, there
immediate Improvements which could be made by the lead autho: n*i*-s wr.*on. wouic
pave the way for the Unit.
            in particular we recommend that a small number o f .senior..staff.tfh&fce
primary task 1s to coordinate services and prevent further,             1.ifiSX3
seconded or employed without d e l a y . This core group could report to the lead
a u t h o r i t i e s ’ coordinating committee.
Immediate tasks for this core te am could include rethinking the r.atur-a*
functions and capacities of the Helpline and Database, improving corawnl cat len
and PR and setting up quality assurance systems based on clear s u t m a s t s of
philosophy, alms and objectives. In the absence of a Regional approach
further tasks would include setting up monitoring systerr.s to on.;.,rs objectives
are being met and introducing evaluation and ’f e e d b ac k’ from ‘co ns umers’ about
the utility and effectiveness of the service.

            CONCLUSIONS

                  The Immediate responses to Hillsborough were magnificent and brought,
            great credit to communities and their leaders throughout the rssion. Th&
            crisis phase 1n which this all took place 1s now over, In practice this alec
            means that for the ’unaffected* Hillsborough 1s.also over. Unfortunately fcr
            the thousands of ’v i c t i m s ’ both known and still hidden thsrs are s-svsra* more-
            stages to endure. The evidence from agencies throughout the region and from
            the Database 1s clear - there are many hundreds of people seeking help and
            showing the predicted post-disaster symptoms. Out of the H*. 11 sb&rcu$h
            disaster came an opportunity for local authorities and agencies and others
            across the region to work together on behalf of and with the cos’P.unity.
            Whilst much goodwill remains the delay 1n crucial decision m^kin^ shout &
            regionally coordinated approach 1s increasingly likely to seriously undermine
            the quality of service for the victims of Hillsborough. Tne warning signs are
            already appearing.

            NATIONAL FUNDING FOLLOWING MAJOR DISASTERS

1.   Questions have been raised following recent disasters as to
whether national funding can be provided to local authorities to
cope with additional burdens. You have recently had a meeting
with administrators to explore this in relation to the
Hillsborough disaster.

2.   I attach a copy of the reply sent by    ___________ |to the
London Borough of Hillingdon following a similar request for
funding. You will see that ’the Bellwin Scheme' has been used
twice but only as far as I can tell for capital projects.

3.    I am copying this to other ACIs for information.

additional demands on service budgets as a result of major disasters.


You will of course appreciate that the basic position is that responsibility for
dealing with emergencies rests with local authorities, who have powers to spend
money for such purposes under s138 of the Local Government Act 1972.            And
local authorities normally include an amount- in their budgets in respect of such

contingencies.


Under a model scheme designed to deal with extra-ordinary costs arising from
emergencies, known as "the Bellwin Scheme”, the Government can provide special
financial assistance to local authorities in certain circumstances.            These are
whpre, as a consequence of an emergency, authorities would otherwise incur an
undue financial burden - that is ei       nditure -^bove and beyond a threshold
which represents what they might n >rma':ly be expected to budget for - in
carrying out immediate works to safeguard life and property or prevent suffering
or severe inconvenience to affected communities.


The scheme has been used only tv/ice; following the emergencies created by the
severe weather during the winter of 1 9 8 6 / c 7 and the storm of 1 9 c 7 .   Should you
require any further information on the scheme I can cnly advise that you refer
to John Sumner at tiie Department of the Environment.


You may be interested to know that this Lepnrtment is currently sponsoring a
joint local authority/voluntary organization working party to consider what
recent tragedies can teach social services departments and other local agencies
involved in coping with the social and psychological effects of major disasters
on victims and their relations.        A copy of a recent Press Release is attached.


I hope you will find this helpful.

Social Services Department : Response to Peacetime Bnergencies


At a recent meeting, the Social Services Oomnittee considered a report on Peacetime Emergency
Planning. There was general recognition of the need and the capacity to respond in practical
terms to the immediate after-effects of a major disaster by the provision of welfare services,
food, clothing and acccnmodation.

However, the report highlighted the longer-term highly skilled work needed with individuals
directly involved in a disaster and with their relations. Sadly, there have been many recent
examples, and follow-up work in respect of the Zeebrugge Ferry and the Bradford City Football
Club indicates the devastating psychological and emotional effect these events have had even
upon the ’heroes’ and their relatives.

It was concluded by the Social Services Oocrmittee that too little attention had been paid in
Government analysis of peacetime emergency planning of the real cost to Social Services
Departments in

i)              ensuring that sufficient staff are properly trained to provide the level of
                counselling and other support needed by all affected by a disaster

and

ii)             providing care and counselling over what could well be considerable periods
                of time to anticipate and minimise the harmflil effects of the experience for
                the individuals and their families.

Such a service has to be locally based and accessible, and it seems only reasonable that the

all the participating local authority areas it will also be necessary to take urgent^
action to strengthen staffing in order to directly help individuals and their few-A
according to the scale of the problems which they sure facing. As jet these costs
have not been fully assesfsed but when aggregated are unlikely    to be less than £1fiii.*.
per year, spread across the North lest. * The Government we hope would wish to bemm-"-’
of this and may consider making resources available to assist     in direct service
provision as well as the establishment of the Regional Unit.

     It is, of course, appreciated that Government has already donated £b00,00u ion*»«:.
the national Disaster Fund.   This fund has quite properly focussed its attention on
the relief of individual hardship a nd •will provide financial help directly to victims,
but will not do away with the need fi>r other help of a non-financial kine no ue

   16,                   it can be seen that the services along the continuum
                  reflect particular post disaster tins phases , the possible
                  j i.toi v‘nl modes or mode 1s of service provision and the
                  possible locations where services are received.      Many of the
                  services are best left at the local level where resources
                  are fami 1iar and can easily be adjusted i n response to
                  changes in need.

             The services outlined below will need to be 1 inked to

20.           This service currently operates on a 24 hour day, 7_day
        week basis and is staffed by officers of the Social Services
        Departments and a variety of other organisations.     Given the
        nationwide 1catchment' of potential users of the service it
        will be cost-efficient to retain this centralised service at
        its current level for a period of weeks to come and will
        ensur'd1 ft ready access point for assistance while medium to
        longer term arrangements are effected.     It is envisaged that
        the Helpline will become a national ’one number' service run
        by the regional unit with calls then referred to local
        services as appropriate,

21,        . Whilst counselling will usually be offered very
        ‘locally’ it will be necessary to ensure that individuals
        are referred to the most appropriate agency; that their
        needs are met, and the services are monitored.  In addition

      there will be people needing h e l p from outside the ‘region*

                                          referrals made. This will
      require a team of 4 headed by a team leader.

22,        It is important that r e f e r r a l s to and from statutory
      agencies across the country are properly co-ordinated.
      T        i a n u m b e r of voluntary agencies on Merseyside and
      in the region for whom counselling is already the major, or
      a significant part of their work; these should be used
      wherever possible. These include COMPASS, Personal Social
      Services, C . of E# Board of Social Responsibility {through
      the clergy and national organisations with local bases, such
      as Cruse). The regional unit would aim to co-ordinate
      •iffrn’w    _> ind from these agencivs where appropriate.

      D r o p - i n Centre

23,        The AnfieId Advice Centre has already allowed a large
      number of ‘survivors’ to describe and share their experience
      of being at Hillsborough.  It has offered other services as
      well, It is likely that this Centre will continue via
      funding from other sources. However, because of fhe^
      symbolic importance of Anfield we recommend that it is used
      as a referral point for Helpline on Match Days- We believe
      that many new referrals will be obtained on Match Days.

      OUTREACH ASP CO-ORDINATION

24,           Whilst the majority of people affected by Hillsborough
      reside within or just outside the Merseyside region it is
      'known that a significant number reside elsewhere. This
      problem was found by Kent following the Zeebrugge disaster
      where survivors and others lived long distances from the
      centre of help. An "away" Team was established to initiate
      and provide assistance outside the Dover area,     Zeebrugge
      also demonstrated that many people required specialist help
      f r o m Counsellors, Psychologists and Psychiatrists etc., and
      that a mechanism was needed to co-ordinate their services.
      Thus problems were tooth identified and met by the Kant
      "away" Team,

25.        Unlike Zeebrugge, however, the identity and location of
      people of iccted 'by "Hillsborough" are l>ixqo j v u; Ks'own.

      therefore, to establish the equivalent of the Kent "away"

      country.   Basic tasks will be toi-

esfeablishing a regional unit in order to marahaXI and
organise the allocation of a variety of resources so. that
help can be made available in the right place at the right
time to people affected by the "Hillsborough'1 disaster.   In
this context "Region" is the seven local authorities.

METHOD M O FORMAT

     A working party of senior staff, drawn from statutory
and voluntary agencies in the region was established to
report on the potential for an Assistance Unit built upon
the service structure created after "Hillsborough". The
group was chaired by Howard Parker, Professor in Social Work
at the University of Manchester.

     The report uses the experience gained from the disaster
at "Hillsborough*1 and other recent tragedies, and sets out
recommendations for dealing with the organisational,
information and co-ordination issues which have arisen.
Specifically, this consists off a synopsis of the Key
elements required to operate a service which is responsive
to need and has an outreach capability, including the
provision of a helpline, counselling, specialised work,
database, staff training/support and public relations. All
of these elements are included within the broad aim as
stated above, and the role of the unit as perceived by the
group.

INTRODUCTION

     The events at "Hillsborough", Sheffield, on 15th Apri1
1989, are a graphic illustration of the extensive damage to
personal well-being which can be precipitated by the trauma
of a major disaster. This applies to those directly
involved, through injury or bereavement, their helpers,
onlookers, and people suffering shock due to publicity or
association with similar events. The effects are often
long-term and can have a profound impact upon family life
and on individual ability to cope with everyday living.

     ''Hillsborough” is the latest in a tragic line of
disasters. Manchester Airport, Bradford, Piper Alpha,
Zeebrugge, Kegworth, Clapham arid Lockerbie have all
illustrated how a major unexpected disaster affects the
lives of ordinary people and the agencies which must provide
them with assistance,   We have learnt a great deal from
these earlier tragedies, particularly how large scale
disasters produce trauma and grief much further and deeper
than common sense would expect.




HLAAAB
(>,           Following the disaster, there was a rapid mobilisation
      of resour.' ,, :*         a variety of authorities, and '
      ricjr;,-statutory agencies.      It became apparent from the outset#
      that a mechanism was necessary to ensure that these
      resources were properly co-ordinated to reach people and
            . i * s iv, need in the mo-              ive a m3 speedy manner*
      Drawing from the experience of those involved in the
      response to e , ' i                   , and from the current
      situation, it is con-:              et-.serrfcxal that an infrastructure
                i', ! „■ hed which can consolidate the effort currently
      under way, and de^v1'ou and adapt it to meet the changing
      needs of the region for a minimum period o f two years.

      BACKGROUND       '

           The services and resources avs.,i\c,“lc. i£>T' assistance
      are, in the main, already in place though not "tl .-<*ys on the
      scale required, These services are provided by a
      multiplicity of organisations. They must respond to those
      who have asked for help, but also reach out to those who
      have not come forward spontaneously» It is important that
      services are available quickly, are easily acc^rf'tole,
      approachable and able to deal with a whole range o f
      emotional and practical needs♦ Some of these needs will be
      immediate, some short-term, some of a more permanent nature
      and in many cases needs will remain hidden for months, Qt
      even years.
                                           f
           Localised services, well publicised, are of: course,
      most important but these should be seen in the context of a
      regional network of centrally co-ordinated resources,   In
      addition, regional co-ordination cars mobilise resources in
      particular areas which would perhaps be overwhelmed by
      demand, if left to cope alone.

      liKely to provide the greatest t tox”.oi 1 ity in the use of
      resources;   such flexibility will be necessary given tne
      difficulty of identifying the extent and type of need, and
      ensuring that deployment of resources is appropriate and
      adequately monitored.

      Philosophy

13,        it is important to ensure that the service response
      meets with an overall philosophy agreed by the participating
      agencies.

              For the consumer this will mean that;

      (i )     There are clear avenues for seehirig help (locally and
               regionally).

      (ii)      The response to their requests will he quick and
                appropriate.

             1,   Provide a c e n t r a l telephone line, e.g. an 0800
                  (freephone) number;
             2,   Provide an assessment and referral service# whereby
                  people are re-referred to Local Advice Services:

                   regioni

             4,   Provide ovc •<'-igh'  the different elements of
                  specialist services,, e.g. psychologists etc.

             5,   Identify key events and anniversaries which may effect
                   individuals and consequently service provision (e.g.
                   Inquests, future football g a m e s ) „

                  Thus the differing needs of people will be identified
             and the appropriate resources matched up to meet those
             needs;  this will avoid duplication of effort and create a
             more efficient use of resources.

             DATABASE REQUIREMENTS

    26,           The unit will require a database capable of recording
             information fed through to the 'helpline’, ’drop.in' centres
             and other source points. , The majority of contacts will be
             within two broad categories, i.e. either requesting
\            assistance or offering help.   Currently the 'Hillsborough
    _      - Helpline' has separate systems dealing with these two
             elements. At present, nearly 3,600 offers of help have been
             received from a variety of sources, including over 600
             through the 'Hillsborough Helpline'.,. About 1,650 requests
             for help have been received nationally# the majority of
             these being through the 'Hillsborough Helpline'. Wi t h _this
             level of activity occuring, it is clear that an effective
             database Is essential to matching needs for assistance with
             the wide range of resources available.

     27,          In respect of referrals for help* a manual database was
             established as a record of callers, pending the setting up
             of the computerised system.  It is suggested t h a t this be
             retained and maintained as a back up in case of problems
             with the system.

     28,           Information which is useful for the database# includes
             basic details s u c h as names, addresses, lor.esl authority of
             origin, referral to district and agency, 'general
             practitioners, significant dates, (birthdays/ anniversaries
             etc).   Each person has an individual reference number, and
             iherf is a facility for a group reference for people linked
             together -

      £ 1' z axp Ing and Support

     The need for on-going and carefully targetted training
has been demonstrated via earlier dise:<.-.era - Clearly such
training can and has already been 1bought in' from external
sources.  So far this specialist training has been
provided for local authority w o r k e r s . The regional unit
would hope to adopt a policy of 'training the trainers' and
thus by using expertise within the region attempt to reduce
training costs.

     It is absolutely clear that those managing and working
in post-disaster situations found the work very stressful.
They need access to regular de-briefing and *talking out *
sessions, Whilst for some workers this will in part be
provided in their own agencies there is a need for an
independent service which all helpers, whether paid or
voluntary staff, can u se.s The regional unit would aim to
ensure these support systems were in place and make
arrangements to co-ordinate offers of this 'care for the
carers * {e.g. by 8ASW and the Psychology Service), The unit
could also respond, in confidence, to direct requests from,
staff anywhere in the region,

PUBLIC RELATI ONS

      "Public relations" is an important and basic element in
the success or failure of any venture. This is complex and
requires skilled and sensitive handling if its potential is
to toe realised.  It needs to be regarded as an explicit
task, and as part of the management and objectives of the
unit,   it can best be organised within the framework of a
public relations strategy*

       Such a strategy will acknowledge that!-

(i)     Interest in the disaster will be subject to
        fluctuation.  For example?  funerals, inquests#
        litigation, football matches, anniveff :sry of the
        disaster etc.  Forward planning for the impact of
        these events is required.




HLAAAB
c      *




           (ii) Public Relations is heavily dependent on hard, factual
                 and accurate information about the worK Of the unit.
                 T h e r e w i . i l , therefore, need to toe direct links between
                 the management and the public relations functions of
                 tli« unit.

           (i ii > Media interest can sometimes be aggressive and
                   ti»e-consuming. This can be wasteful at best and
                   damaging at worst. Thus contact with the media needs
                   to V.   k    : y uVmnelled  and regulated separating
                   local and re";onal issues.

.13,            it is suggested that Public relations can best be
           under I •kuti sy the Head of the Unit along with substantial
           support from the Management Committee.

           COS TINGS

34.             Since "Hillsborough" is a national disaster, it is
           recommended that strenuous efforts are made to obtain the
           funding of the Unit from central government, the EEC and.
           other sources.  Costs are estimated at around £350,000 per
           year   for two years.  This may be generous or alternatively
           additional resources may need to be added o n .

35,             The advantages of co-ordinating all helping responses
           seem clear*  It is believed that a Regional Unit would# in
           the long run, be cost effective and more importantly would
           introduce a whole series, of supports and checks which would
           mean a better service for those who need it# including the
           carers.

Thank you for your letter of § May about additional financial support Cor
airnct service provision un# for the Begioa&l Bait you propose to establish fca
provide aai eo-ordinate continuing care in the aftermath of the Hillsborough
tragedy.

The Department ' s Soe-t . '<< rvices Inspectorate have kept roe informed o f tim
actlt a        b j the local social services depsruve^ts together in the wa^fe of
the tragedy and I knew that the Chief Inspector has written personally to all
the Social Services Dirjfetora to eosfratmlat* them and their staff on their
wost impressive response. By this letter I would like to express my own
appreciations, fee tli® n&fiiifieeiit respoase toy all the Social Services
departments involved.

I am afraid however that on matters of funding my Department has so power to
make additional resources av&jjfable. I understand from Picliolmp Kidley,
Secretary of State for Environment* that uiifier a model scheme designed to deal
with extra-ordinary coats arising from emergencies (The Belinda Scheme)^ 4f»
Government cam provide special financial assistance to local authorities in
certain circumstances.

The Bellwin Scheme was drawn up after discussions with the Local Authority
Associations and provides for assistance towards the immediate and additional
costs of dealing with an emergency once expenditure exceeds a threshold beyond
which local authorities would normally be expected to budget for. The scheme
has been used twice to date; following the emergencies created by the severe
weather during the winter of 1986/S? and the a t o m of 1987.

If you consider that you have a case for assistance of this kind, 1 understand
from Kleholas S M I e y that he is prepared to consider a detailed and fully
costed application. I know that fa© will keep me informed of events»

                         (Soinernet) addressed the meeting about the work
          undertaken in contacting core groups of staff in all Authorities -
          with apologies to Cheshire which has yet to be contacted - and the
          warm response of the groups. She Indicated that the staff have all
          expressed tributes and a caring concern for those managing the
          response to the crisis. The particular characteristic of core groups
          has been staff tiredness, wanting *time-out• and a wish to share
          experiences with other core groups. Without raising expectations
          too high, the possibility of a "training away day' utilising
          available accommodation in Somerset had been mentioned. The potential
          was also there to involve non-social work staff who may benefit from
          sharing their joint experiences, together with the families of social
          workers.
                     reported that arrangements had already been made for a
          group of co-ordinators to have a few days break shortly, to enable
          them to share their experiences of the tragedy« Leaflets were being
          rewritten in more appropriate language. In addition, a contract ie
          expected to be completed soon for the services of an Individual to
          manage and co-ordinate Staffline, but that a short delay of about
          2 weeks is anticipated before that person can take up the duties of the
          post. 8.A.S.W. undertook to advise Authorities on 1Sth May of the
          arrangements that will operate during thia 2 week period.

          In thanking B.A.S.tf.» it was agreed that -

          (a)    Derek Evans would produce a paper for consideration by this
                 Group on 19th May on the feasibility of proceeding with the

NOTE FOR REGIONAL FILE

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER

1    David Mason rang me on 11 May to see if there was any
      reaction to the letters which had gone to DOE, DH and copies
      to the Prime Minister.   I told him that we had copied the
      letter to Officials within the Department in order that they
      could be alerted to the need for advice.    I explained that
     we had been involved in a meeting within the Department and
      that consideration was being given to the request for
      funding and for money for research.  From this he gathered
      and was encouraged that the application was being taken
      seriously.

2.   I said that it seemed to me there were 3 elements to their
      funding   requirements, the first was money to cover the
      immediate expenditure resulting from the crisis.     DOE had
      indicated to us, as they had to him, that local authorities
      were expected to provide a contingency the equivalent of the
      product of a penny rate to cover civil emergencies.   Unless
      the expenditure in the days following Hillsborough was in
      excess of this there would be no claim for additional
      funding sustainable.

3.   The second requirement was the funding for 2 years of the
      Regional Unit Proposal.     Application had been made to a
      number of private firms to assist with the funding of this
      as well as the application to central government.

4.   The third element was funding for research.        This was
      separate from the other two and would come from a different
      source,   notably from DH rather than DOE if any central
      Government funding were possible.

5.   David Mason said that the authorities were working hard on
      trying to identify the total cost of dealing with the
      immediate crisis and would make them available as soon as
      possible.     There was a difficulty in listing possible
      contributions from private industry because the negotiations
      were in many cases vague and were generally dependent on a
      partnership with central government. He would, however, try
      to list all the applications that had been made and the
      current state of negotiations.  On the third element I told
      him that Howard Parker had been asked to produce a 2 page
      statement    of  the   research  requirements   for initial
      consideration by the Department.

6.   Discussion with P Hall

     Phoebe enquired how the meeting with                     had
     gone and I told her.   She said it was important that he was
     convinced of the value of the research since he was very
     influential as Secretary of the RLG.
                                                    \




7.   She also wondered whether funding for the training element
     of the Regional Unit Proposal could come from TSP either in
     the form of a special allocation or to use some of the
     funds not taken up.    She suggests a discussion with
            about this.

Dear David


My colleagues m the North West Region of the Inspectorate have
kept me informed of the action taken by local social services
departments together in the wake of the Hillsborough football
disaster.  I congratulate you and the staff of the Department on
the effective work undertaken to provide counselling and other
support services to the bereaved families and others distressed
by the tragedy.

I was greatly impressed by the speed of the social services
reaction and by the commitment to continue to help and support
people through a possibly protracted period of mourning.  The
direct work involved is difficult and demanding.  But others not
directly involved have also contributed by providing cover to
enable the normal work of the Department to continue.  In that
very important sense, this is truly a department-wide effort,
fully m keeping with the spirit and achievements of social
services work after earlier tragedies.

X have written in similar terms to other Directors concerned.
I add my personal congratulations on the outstanding leadership
demonstrated in your own response to the disaster, and on the
managerial effort involved in co-ordinating statutory and
voluntary effort.


Best wishes.

2.    Summary of discussion

2.1 Mr           indicated to SSI that he had held a meeting with Miss
    Farrell and Mr Mason at their request to discuss their proposal for a
    post Hillsborough co-ordinated service. He confirmed the advice he had
    given them which was to write to the Secretary of State for Health
    copied to the Director of State for the Department of the Environment.
    Efe had advised slightly different letters to the Department of the
    Environment related to the fact that D of E had some interest in
    relation to the possibility of funding local expenditure which was over
    and above that set aside in contingency (product of a penny rate).

2.2   It was agreed that Until this letter, which had been agreed should be
      approved by all the political leaders in Merseyside, was received that
      nothing else could be done. It was agreed that SSI and MTF should keep
      each other informed in relation to any future progress.

HTT .TCTP3QUGH DISASTER

Date - 5 May 1989

Meeting with J Downey in relation to CRUSE working party

1.   Mrs Downey had attended at least one of these meetings which were held
     on a regular basis chaired by the Chief Executive for Berkshire with a
     responsibility for distilling the wisdom frcrn the recent disasterswhich,
     had affected SSDs and trying to write up same collective information.
     Mrs Downey had now been told she most attend meetings on a regular basis
     but the meetings were also attended by                    from CS1. It
     would appear that Section 64 money was made available for this working
     group. There were same plans to appoint a research assistant to do a
     literature search and gather information in relation to research.

2.   Meeting with                    - he referred to the CRUSE working party
     and gave similar information to that above. We discussed the submission
     from Liverpool and funding for a regional unit to support the post
     Hillsborough helping services. Discussed the involvement of Merseyside
     Task Force
             yjp (D of E). It would appearQ..that
                                              &n- ^there was a| fund which had
     been set/through the D of E, the BeBbin1 Fund and it seemed to be
     possible that this fund jjdght be a source, although
     seemed rather doubtful, f \uj-o                                   -r s

3.   Perusal of other papers from other local authorities seemed to indicate
     that no other local authority had acquired any money for services.

4.   Research -|                seemed more interested in the possibility of
     a research project linked to the Merseyside response particularly if the
     unit were to be taking a proactive response. The research would have-
     hopefully test out( vdiether proactive counselling approach had any
     effect on psychology impact of disasters.     It was agreed MJG should
     alert Howard Parker to put in a two page submission outlining the nature
     of his proposed research copied to                    and J Downey. No
     costings would be required at that stage.

5.   SSI indicated that no promises were being given to anyone that any money
     would be forthcoming, either from D of E or Dept of Health.

                   HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER

 l-  I am replying to your minute of the 25th of April in which
 you questioned the "forum" referred to in Mrs Gibson's minute of
 the 2 0th of April. The forum is the group assembled to put
 together the paper on SSI's response to SSDs in Crises.
 Mr Pearson has been assembling the drafts the last one of which
 was discussed at the senior management meeting.  Roy Pearson has
 revised this paper to be discussed with Mr Halliday at the next
 senior management meeting.

 2 . The crises paper is concerned with ongoing difficulties
 experienced by SSDs such as the Cleveland problems, the financial
 problem of Liverpool and Brent etc.  It makes only scant
 reference to disasters such as Hillsborough, Hungerford etc.

3. Mrs Downey is dealing with the Hillsborough problems in
conjunction with Martin H arrison (CS1). I understand that
Brian Harrison is meeting,                  :o discuss whether any
financial support can be given in the Hillsborough case.

                                                the need to update

whether anymore fundamental review of the procedures is
necessary.

    142.   Future Meetings.

           It was agreed that future meetings of this Group be held at
           4.00 p.m. on Fridays of each week and be chaired by Wilf Twist.

    143.   Disaster Fund-Social Security Implications.

           A note of a meeting of 3rd May of Welfare Benefit Advisors of
           the core Authorities about the effect of payments from the
           Disaster Fund on means tested social security benefits (requested
           by this Group at its meeting on 28th April) was circulated. A
           copy of the note, together with a related extract from Hansard, is
           reproduced as Appendix 'A' to these Minutes.

           The note contains three detailed questions which it is suggested
           could be put to the Minister and it was agreed that they be
           raised by Paddy Marley, utilising the offer of assistance from the
           National Association of C.A.B.s. If necessary, the matter can          Paddy Marley
           also be pursued through the A.D.S.S. Anti-Poverty Group.

           The note also contains four associated recommendations and it was
           agreed that -

           (a)   recommendation 1 be referred to the Chief Financial Officer
                 of each of the core Authorities for consideration and in order
                 to ensure a consistent response, those Officers be requested     All to note
                 to act in consultation with each other; and

           (b)   the remaining recommendations be referred to the Trust Fund      Paddy Marley
                 Manager for consideration.

    144.   Finance.

           The meeting reiterated its request of 2nd May to all Authorities
           to each provide a rough estimate of the cost of providing direct
           local services associated with the Hillsborough tragedy, in order
                                                                                  All to note.
           to establish the validity of the Elm figure which had been used,
           on behalf of the Group, in discussions with the Merseyside Task
           Force and others.
           The meeting noted that the dispatch of letters on behalf of the
           core Authorities to the Government and the E.E.C. for financial
           assistance was imminent. David Mason referred to a number of
           other approaches for funds which were being made to a variety of
           sources and undertook to prepare, for a future meeting, a schedule
           of all the avenues being explored.

    145.   Offers of Help.

           It was agreed that a letter of 5th May to this Group from
                    about offers of help be considered at the next meeting
           of this Group. Carole Wilkinson raised the feasibility of
           producing a newsletter for families and victims of Hillsborough and
                                                                                  Carole
           it was agreed that this also be considered at the next meeting of
                                                                                  Wilkinson.
           the Group and in the meantime,              be requested to prepare
           and submit a draft of the sort of document envisaged.

    146.   Reimbursements to Staff.

           Pauline Farrell reported that Personnel Officers at Sefton had
           raised a query over the detailed recommendations of this Group
           about reimbursements to staff. In order that all Authorities
                                                                                  Pauline
           proceed in this matter in a consistent manner, and bearing in
                                                                                  Farrell.
           mind that the proposals have now been agreed by a   the other
                                          -2 -


*          Authorities involved, it was the hope of the Group that any
           difficulties could be resolved, possibly through further discussions
           between the Personnel Officers of Sefton and, for example, Liverpool.

    147.   Training Sessions for G.P.s.

           A suggestion was made to the M.R.H.A. that it may wish, before taking
           action to cancel its training sessions with Michael Stewart during
           May, to contact some of the large employers in the region (i.e. Fords,
           Vauxhall, Giro, Post Office etc...) to establish whether they may be
           interested in utilising these training sessions for their own staff.

    148.   F.A. Cup Semi-Final.

           It was reported that arrangements had been made for some social work
           cover to be provided by Trafford D.C. during the replay of the F.A.
           Cup Semi-Final at Old Trafford, Manchester, on 7th May. A leafleting
           exercise, similar to that undertaken at the recent Liverpool v Everton
           match, was not now to be proceeded with.

    149.   Planning Group.

           David Mason reported that following the request of this meeting of
           2nd May, Professor Howard Parker had agreed to undertake further work
           on behalf of the group on quality assurance. It was suggested that a
           small body of two or three members of this group should meet with
           Professor Parker during the next week to begin to identify terms of
           reference for a further planning exercise. Recommendations could then
           be brought back to this group and thereafter, to Directors of Social
           Services. It was agreed that -

           (a)   this Group be represented at the meetings with Professor
                 Parker by -

                 (i)                     Knowsley;
                                                                                      Mr.
                 (ii)               [Sefton;
                 (iii)                  Cheshire;
                 (iv)                    Probation; and
                 (v)     a representative of the voluntary sector (name to be
                         obtained through Pauline Farrell); and

           (b)   meetings be arranged and serviced by the Merseyside Probation
                 Service.

    150.   Leaflets.

           It was agreed that —

           (a)   copies of the crisis leaflet 'Coping After Hillsborough' be
                 made available (from the remaining balance of approximately 4,000)   P.Marley
                 to the M.R.H.A. for distribution to appropriate Hospitals within
                 the Mersey and the North West Regions; and

           (b)   in view of the continuing demand for the leaflet, a further
                 25,000 copies be put on order.                                       P.Marley.

           It was also noted that a further 10,000 copies of the young persons
           leaflet are currently being printed.

    151.   Disaster Fund.

           Paddy Marley reported that he was aware, in Liverpool, that approaches
                              -3 -


       were being made by social workers, on behalf of families,
       direct to the Disaster Fund and he expressed concern that
       Authorities could be drawn into decisions relating to the assessment
       of claims etc..., contrary to the clearly stated intention of this
       group not to become involved. The issue of the role of social
       workers acting as advocates for clients was also discussed.

       Following a full discussion it was agreed, and all Authorities are
       asked to note, that social workers should feel unencumbered to
       assist families and individuals in the preparation of claims to the    All to note
       Fund but that no contact should be made with the Fund on behalf of
       claimants. Authorities may wish to consider nominating an officer
       able to answer detailed queries from social workers about the Fund,
       such nominated officer being in turn able to refer direct to
       Paddy Marley (the Group's Liaison Officer with the Fund) for advice
       or assistance oa any particular problems.

       It was also agreed that as the Trust Fund is now in the process of
       contacting by letter tne next of kin of those who died in the
       tragedy, Social Services Departments may consider it appropriate
       to arrange for social work contact to be made with the families
       involved. In this connection, a definitive list of the deceased
       and next of kin was circulated. Given the information contained
       in the list, particularly some of the necessary comments, all
       Authorities are requested to ensure confidentiality. A copy has
       been made available to the Trust Fund Manager.

       Authorities are a«ked to arrange for any funeral bills in their
       possession to be forwarded as soon as possible to Paddy Marley,
       and not direct to the Fund.

152.   Training Officers.

       A detailed note of a meeting of North West Principal Training
       Officers of 3rd May about the training of Training Officers and
       the arrangements for the recruitment of Training Officers - Crisis
       Psychology, was circulated. Whilst authorities are unlikely to
       be able to be of direct assistance it was agreed that the matter of
       training Training Officers could be discussed further with
       Michael Stewart and              to establish whether any suitable     David Mason
       arrangements could be agreed. So far as the appointment of the
       Training Officers is concerned, it was noted that the appointment
       procedure for the post funded by Liverpool would have to be in
       accordance with the rules governing Liverpool Council appointments
       and that N.W.A.S.S.A. would need to be consulted on what
       arrangements it wished to follow for the post funded by tha.tr
       Association.

153.   Staffline.

       A supply of the Staffline leaflet was distributed to the core
       Authorities.

154.   'The Informer'.

       A copy of the Liverpool Social Services Department's in-house
       journal 'The Informer',dealing with the Hillsborough disaster
       and the aftermath, was circulated for information.

155.   Helpline Database.

       Authorities are now asked to submit t o [ L i v e r p o o l            M l to note
       Social Services Department) copies of referrals dealt with by them,
                               -4-

#          for imputting onto the Helpline database.

    156.   Staff Rota for the Helpline.

                         the new Helpline co-ordinator, is arranging for a
           Helpline rota covering a one month period to be drawn up, so that
           regular staffing slots can be given to the various Authorities and
           agencies. In noting this information, it was agreed that the
           midnight - 7.00 a.m. shift be reduced to two people, to reflect
           demand.

    157.   St. Helens Counselling Team.

           It was noted that the St. Helens Counselling Team is continuing
           but that from next week, the Team is to be dispersed and not
           located as one unit. Existing methods of communication remain the
           same.

    158.   Secondments of Staff.

           The meeting noted that following the recent Jobs Forum, it was
           unlikely that mainstream establishment vacancies could be filled
           before July/August 1989. The possibility of securing secondments
           from other Authorities/Agencies to assist over the next 3 months
           in the difficult staffing problems thrown up by the Hillsborough
           disaster was raised by Bernard Walker and it was agreed that in an
           endeavour to obtain secondments to cover mainstream work -

           (a)   David Mason would raise the issue with the A.D.S.S; and        David Mason

           (b)   Pauline Farrell would pursue the matter with the voluntary     Pauline
                 sector.                                                        Farrell.

Convened in order to address and clarify the effect of payment from the
Hillsborough Disaster Fund on means tested social security benefits.
The group considered the letter of 27th April, 1989 from Nicholas Scott
to Tony Banks in which Mr Scott stated that "those receiving income-related
benefits could have those affected but that depends on how the money is
paid and how much..."

It was agreed that this meant payments from the fund would not attract any
special disregards and would be assessed within the framework of current
regulations.  Briefly this would have the effect of reducing entitlement to
Income Support and Housing Benefit for any regular weekly payment from the
fund over £5 per week on a £1 for £1 basis.  If any capital payments were
made entitlement to Income Support and Housing Benefit would be affected
once capital reached £3,000 and totally suspended when capital reached
£6,000 or £8,000 respectively.  Irregular payments would be disregarded to
the extent of £250 in any 52 week period.

Suggested questions for the Directors' group to put to the Minister.

1.   In view of the spirit in which the public of the nation gave
     to the Hillsborough Disaster Fund we request that the Minister
     for Social Security introduce an amended regulation to the
     effect that all payments from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund
     which under existing legislation fall to be taken into account
     be disregarded.

     Precedent for this is monies from the McFarland Trust.  Also
     related to sentence contained in                 question
     "I seek a cold blooded assurance from the Minister tonight that
     the generosity of the nation will not be used to compensate the
     cost to the government in benefits".

2.   Alternatively, the Secretary of State should be urged to accept
     a delay in the application of the normal rules on capital.   The
     effect of which would be that all payments from the Hillsborough
     Disaster Fund (or any other such fund as the Secretary of State
     may consider appropriate) which fall to be taken into account, be
     disregarded, for an appropriate.period, a suggested minimum of
     2 years with powers to extend this period.
     The Justification of this is that stopping Social Security
     benefits (by which we mean the means-tested benefits) will
     be a source of distress and anger for the victims and their
     relatives if it is an action directly associated with 'interim
     payments from the Trust Fund.  It could also lead to the
     diversion of payments to meet 'special needs' to ordinary day
     to day living expenses as a consequence.

3.   The Secretary of State should also be urged to undertake a
     sympathetic revision of the guidance.for Adjudication Officers
     on notional capital and deprivation of capital.   Any such
     revised guidance should be made available to the Trust Fund,
     beneficiaries of the Fund and their advisors.   This measure
     would not require amending legislation but would take the form
     of a circular issued by the Chief Adjudication Officer to D.S.S
     officers.

Associated Recommendations

1.   That Local Authorities consider effects of Disaster Fund
     monies on their own means-tested provisions,
     i.e. Education Welfare Payments
          Services under C.S.D.P. Act
          Payments of Housing Benefit

2.   To seek clarification of the advice that officers of D.S.S.
     have given to administrators of the Fund and obtain comments
     on the same from a welfare benefits advisor.

3.   That statistics of the circumstances of the individual
     beneficiaries of the fund be gathered to ascertain if the
     effect on benefits is a marginal or a major issue.

4.   The Trust Fund should avoid describing any advance or interim
     payments as payments to meet day to day living expenses.
     Instead some terms such as 'special expenses’ might be safer
     or 'special needs'.

                            Hillsborough Tragedy

     Since Hillsborough seven Local Authorities in Merseyside, plus Cheshire
and Lancashire, together with Mersey Regional Health Authority, Merseyside
Probation Service and numerous voluntary organisations have been providing a
co-ordinated response.   On Saturday last, the 29th April, the Leaders of these
seven local authorities and the Leaders of Nottinghamshire and Sheffield Councils
met to consider a joint approach to the provision of services which will continue
to be necessary for several years to come.

     The attached report, prepared under the independent Chairmanship of the
Professor of Social Work at Manchester University, was agreed in principle. The
report recommends the establishment of a Regional Unit to provide a core of common
services, including:—

      i)     A Helpline to receive calls from anywhere day and night;
      ii)    The Co-ordination of counselling services both within and outside
              the nine local authorities provided by voluntary as well as
              statutory agencies;

      iii)   A Database capable of dealing with all requests for assistance and
             offers of help;

      iv)    A continuing training and staff support programme                     in this previously
              unfamiliar area of work;

      v)     The management of media contacts and publicity.


     It was agreed to reconvene the meeting following exploration of all possible
sources of funding.   Recognizing that services will need to extend beyond these
nine local authorities and be available nationally on a scale not previously
experienced by an authority or group of authorities, our first but not only approach
for funding is addressed to Government.   Further work is being undertaken to
approach private industry, charitable bodies and E.E.C.    Already the local social
services authorities in the North West have agreed to jointly sponsor an additional
training officer.

                                                                            /cont'd

      The Department, we anticipate, would wish to be associated with this
 initiative and through Government may be able to make finance available to fund the
 Regional Unit at a cost of £350,000 per year for a period of three years. Within
 all the participating local authority areas it will also be necessary to take urgent
 action to strengthen staffing in order to directly help individuals and their families
 according to the scale of the problems which they are facing. As yet these costs
 have not been fully assessed but when aggregated are unlikely   to be less than £1milli-
 per year, spread across the North West.   The Government we hope would wish to beawar
 of this and may consider making resources available to assist   in direct service
 provision as well as the establishment of the Regional Unit.

      It is, of course, appreciated that Government has already donated £500,000 toward
 the National Disaster Fund.   This fund has quite properly focussed its attention on
 the relief of individual hardship and will provide financial help directly to victims,
 but will not do away with the need for other help of a non-financial kind to be
 provided.

      Given the nature and extent of these services this letter has been copied to
 the Secretary of State for Environment and the Secretary of State for Social Security,
 and also for information to officers in other agencies.

      In view of the importance of the issues involved a copy has been forwarded to
 the Prime Minister so that she, personally, can be aware of the state of service
 development and needs.

      An early decision on financial support would be most appreciated as it is
 anticipated other potential sources of finance will await the response of Government
 before making a commitment.

                                                    Yours sincerely,

    Dear Monsieur

                                               Hillsborough Tragedy

     It was agreed to reconvene the meeting following exploration of all
possible sources of funding.   Recognizing that services will need to extend
beyond these local authorities and be available on a scale not previously
experienced by authority or group of authorities, our first approach for funding
has been addressed to the British Government.   While it is anticipated that the
British Government will wish to provide financial support it is envisaged that the
European Community will also want to assist, and be identified with this initiative.
Football is the national sport of many member nations and it is understood that the
Community has been associated with work following other disasters.

     The five Merseyside Local Authorities have already demonstrated to the
Community    their common approach to the promotion of the Merseyside Integrated
Development Organisation.   This work following the disaster in Hillsborough
(Sheffield) includes these authorities plus the contiguous Counties of Cheshire
and Lancashire and has now been extended further to include the two localities of
Sheffield and Nottingham.

      Assistance is being sought from our own Government towards the financing of
the Regional Unit (referred to in the attached report) for three years at an annual
cost of £350,000.    Financial help from the European Community is also sought
because of the scale of the disaster and the number of people affected.    Other
alternatives are also being pursued including private industry sponsorship,
charitable bodies and assistance from football organisations.    Within all the
participating local authorities it will also be necessary to strengthen staffing
in order to directly help individuals and their families according to the scale of
the problems which they are facing.    As yet these costs have not been fully
assessed, but when aggregated are unlikely to be less than £1 million per year.
The Community, we hope, would wish to be aware of this and may consider making
resources available to assist in direct service provision as well as the Regional
Unit.

     It is, of course, appreciated that the British Government has already donated
£500,000 towards the National Disaster Appeal Fund.   According to reports in the
British Press the European Community is also considering making a contribution of
£250,000.   This Fund has, quite properly, focussed its attention on the relief of
individual hardship and will provide financial help directly to victims, but will
not do away with the need for other help of a non—financial nature to be provided.

British Government and the Community before   making a commitment. It is also

to avoid any delay I would, of course, be prepared to provide any additional
detail and meet you for discussions at your earliest convenience.   Alternatively
you may feel it appropriate to visit Merseyside in order to see the situation for
yourself. This could be arranged without either delay or difficulty.

           3. a) Counselling Offers

         We are aware that currently some Voluntary Organisations, As well as Local Authority staff, are
         proving a Counselling service.
         when the ‘core team’ comes on stream, a further extention will occur.
         It is assumed that a strategy for counselling services will incorporate a mechanism for drawing in
         the diverse offers being made and will identify training and support needs. As it is incumbent on
         the authority to provide self organised support services(i.e counselling) the initial offers will need
         to be filtered. Those offers deemed to be unacceptable in these circumstances could be diverted into
         other voluntary / community projects and groups and could thus make a positive contribution in
         strengthening our communities.
         If all offers are followed up individually and personally then current resources would be over­
         whelmed.

     b') Accommodation

    Offers of accommodation were taken up at the time they were required and were thus not subject to
    any vetting (due to the time scale of events). Letters of thanks cannot be forwarded until informa­
    tion of usage is collected. Such offers are diminishing due the fall of demand.

     c) Holidays

    Many offers, countrywide have been received. Whilst many offers were made altruistically and in
    good faith, the authority cannot afford to offer unvetted resource to unreliable individuals.
    Where a cottage/flat/caravan has been offered the following needs to be assessed. 1) safety/security
    of property 2) size and location 3) transport and accessibility 4) catering arrangements(if any)
    6) times available 7) expectations of usage 8) single or ongoing offer.
    Where a room in a house is offered, unless the offers have been vetted in some other way,(e,g foster
    parents/childminders etc) in addition to the above, some personal vetting will be required.
    Finally, a decision will be needed as to whom will be eligible to take up offers and what, if any,
    additional expenses will be made available (e,g travelling, food etc).

    Childminding Offers

    Registered Childminders undertaking childminding or babysitting would not be problematic but
    those who aren’t could not be allocated work. The demand, current and ongoing (for respite) needs
    assessing.
    Those interested could be encouraged to register, hopefully.
    Some demographic gaps in provision could be fitted. It must be acknowledged that the staff
    responsible for registration are under pressure from ordinary work.

    Transport

    Whilst there will be expected peaks and troughs for this service we would envisage that the proce­
    dure for vetting volunteer drivers will be an asset in providing stress-free transport, door to door.
    As well as the need for screening, there are budgetary implications.
    Many offers of transport, to and from Sheffield were taken up in the early days *where possible,
    thank you letters should be sent out

    Other Offers

    Whilst there are a number of tangible offers from the City Council and other Local Authority
    employees, there are a high number of vague or unsubstantiated offers - those need to be followed
    through.
    A high degree of communication and co-ordination will be necessary to ensure that all offers are
    assessed by the same principle and are dealt with in ways that are compatible with other strategies
    in force.
    Given the need to respond effectively and quickly our initial estimate is that two full time staff
    work for a period of no less than six months and that admin / clerical support is also provided.

    Some of the tasks outlined have been completed by the Voluntary Resource Unit and where staff
    time allows, are ongoing.
    Clerical work is being continued by Willie Gardner who was originally employed to work for the
    Co-ordinator-Voluntary Organisations on a temporary six month contract as a clerical oficer.
    However as we have been loaned an Apple Macintosh Desktop Publishing System, this officer who
    had recently completed a 16 week computer programming course is now processing data from the
    offers of help.
    Additionally an unpaid (and unemployed ) volunteei                   vith training in Desk Top
    Publishing has been producing necessary programmes including this report
    Examples of leaflets, Brochures, memo’s, reports, bulletins, are attached including a mock up of a
    Linkline newsletter and the offeres of help print out

Dear Bob,

                                  Hillsborough

     Further to our discussion during the Inter Agency Management Meeting an
area of possible assistance was identified which I would be grateful if you could
raise at the Executive.

     Everyone recognizes the support and commitment of colleagues which has
already been given, e.g. Relief Staff for Helpline, Staff Counsellors, NWASSA
funding for training officer.   The need for redeployment of staff into Hillsborough
Services, particularly on-going work with families is now beginning to take its toll
in several departments.   Advertising has been used and potential applicants are also
being followed up after the jobs forum.   There would appear to be a shortfall of
social workers for the next three months minimum, at a time which coincides with
annual leave.

     Our position in the areas most affected by Hillsborough is a reflection of a
problem experienced by many departments at this time of the year. We were, however,
wondering if any department(s) could second staff to temporarily cover vacancies in
district offices and hospitals while recruitment proceeds. These could be either
Local Authority staff or social workers who work as locums.

     Each department would, of course, cover all the salary costs and expenses if
anyone could assist.

     Many, many thanks for your help and support .

Dear Mr Mason

Thank you for your letter dated April 27 1989 XiHiappreciate that at the
moment you are very busy dealing with offers concerning the Hillsborough
disaster, and I would have no wish to involve.>you in anything that would
take up more of your time, however I think that you may have misunderstood
my original intention for telephoning you so I will explain exactly what
I meant on the telephone.   On the day that I called I had received a ~
telephone call from a colleague of yours from Ellesmere Port Social Services
and he explained to me that two people had been to him for Counselling,
he explained to me that after their initial sadness had eased they began
to feel a need to pass their statements on to somebody else who might be
able to help get their side of the story over at any official or public
Inquiry, he further explained that he had heard of our organisation
but had no idea how to    contact us in order to get any statements from the
two people concerened.     He suggested that I get in touch with yourselves
and explain what we are doing which is collecting as many statements as
possible from anybody at all who was there and who feels that they
might have relevant information.

The reason we are doing this is because we are now legally representing
the supporters at the official Inquiry which will be headed by Lord Justice
Taylor.  It was not our intention to set ourselves up as some kind of
ooposing agency to yourselves as we have neither the resources or the
manpower available forsuch an operation.   So once again  just to make our
own position very clear, all we were trying to do was to pass on our
address so that jlf any of your clients wanted to make a statement to
someone who they felt could possibly represent them you could make them aware
of our existance.   If however this would be felt unsuitable then
please accept my apologies.


Yours sincerely

                             Hillsborough Tragedy

     Since Hillsborough seven Local Authorities in Merseyside, plus Cheshire
and Lancashire, together with Mersey Regional Health Authority, Merseyside
Probation Service and numerous voluntary organisations have been providing a
co-ordinated response.   On Saturday last, the 29th April, the Leaders of these
seven local authorities and the Leaders of Nottinghamshire and Sheffield Councils
met to consider a joint approach to the provision of services which will continue
to be necessary for several years to come.

     The attached report, prepared under the independent Chairmanship of the
Professor of Social Work at Manchester University, was agreed in. principle. The
report recommends the establishment of a Regional Unit to provide a core of common
services, including:-

      i)     A Helpline to receive calls from anywhere day and night;
      ii)    The Co-ordination of counselling services both within and outside
              the nine local authorities provided by voluntary as well as
              statutory agencies;

      iii)    A Database capable of dealing with all requests for assistance and
              offers of help;

      iv)    A continuing training and staff support programme                    in this previously
              unfamiliar area of work;

      v)     The management of media contacts and publicity.


     It was agreed to reconvene the meeting following exploration of all possible
sources of funding.   Recognizing that services will need to extend beyond these
nine local authorities and be available nationally on a scale not previously
experienced by an authority or group of authorities, our first but not only approach
for funding is addressed to Government.   Further work is being undertaken to
approach private industry, charitable bodies and E.E.C.    Already the local social
services authorities in the North West have agreed to jointly sponsor an additional
training officer.

                                                                       /cont'd

 /continued.




     The Department, we anticipate, would wish to be associated with this
initiative and through Government may be able to make finance available to fund the
Regional Unit at a cost of £350,000 per year for a period of three years. Within
all the participating local authority areas it will also be necessary to take urgent
action to strengthen staffing in order to directly help individuals and their families,
according to the scale of the problems which they are facing. As yet these costs
have not been fully assessed but when aggregated are unlikely   to be less than £1 millioi
per year, spread across the North West.   The Government we hope would wish to be aware
of this and may consider making resources available to assist   in direct service
provision as well as the establishment of the Regional Unit.

      It is, of course, appreciated that Government has already donated £500,000 towards
 the National Disaster Fund.   This fund has quite properly focussed its attention on
 the relief of individual hardship and will provide financial help directly to victims,
 but will not do away with the need for other help of a non-financial kind to be
 provided.

      Given the nature and extent of these services this letter has been copied to
 the Secretary of State for Environment and the Secretary of State for Social Security,
 and also for information to officers in other agencies.

      In view of the importance of the issues involved a copy has been forwarded to
 the Prime Minister so that she, personally, can be aware of the state of service
 development and needs.

      An early decision on financial support would be most appreciated as it is
 anticipated other potential sources of finance will await the response of Government
 before making a commitment.

                                        Yours sincerely.

HLAAAB
AIM

     To consider the feasibility including costings of
establishing a regional unit in order to marshall and
organise the allocation of a variety of resources so. that
help can be made available in the right place at the right
time to people affected by the "Hillsborough" disaster.    In
this context "Region” is the seven local authorities.

METHOD AND FORMAT

     A working party of senior staff, drawn from statutory
and voluntary agencies in the region was established to
report on the potential for an Assistance Unit built upon
the service structure created after "Hillsborough". The
group was chaired by Howard Parker, Professor in Social Work
at the University of Manchester.

     The report uses the experience gained from the disaster
at "Hillsborough" and other recent tragedies, and sets out
recommendations for dealing with the organisational,
information and co-ordination issues which have arisen.
Specifically, this consists off a synopsis of the key
elements required to operate a service which is responsive
to need and has an outreach capability, including the
provision of a helpline, counselling, specialised work,
database, staff training/support and public relations.  All
of these elements are included within the broad aim as
stated above, and the role of the unit as perceived by the
group.

INTRODUCTION

     The events at "Hillsborough", Sheffield, on 15th April
1989, are a graphic illustration of the extensive damage to
personal well-being which can be precipitated by the trauma
of a major disaster.  This applies to those directly
involved, through injury or bereavement, their helpers,
onlookers, and people suffering shock due to publicity or
association with similar events. The effects are often
long-term and can have a profound impact upon family life
and on individual ability to cope with everyday living.

     "Hillsborough" is the latest in a tragic line of
disasters.  Manchester Airport, Bradford, Piper Alpha,
Zeebrugge, Kegworth, Clapham and Lockerbie have all
illustrated how a major unexpected disaster affects the
lives of ordinary people and the agencies which must provide
them with assistance.  We have learnt a great deal from
these earlier tragedies, particularly how large scale
disasters produce trauma and grief much further and deeper
than common sense would expect.




HLAAAB
     Following the disaster, there was a rapid mobilisation
of resources from a variety of authorities, and
non-statutory agencies.  It became apparent from the outset,
that a mechanism was necessary to ensure that these
resources were properly co-ordinated to reach people and
families in need in the most effective and speedy manner.
Drawing from the experience of those involved in the
response to earlier disasters, and from the current
situation, it is considered essential that an infrastructure
is established which can consolidate the effort currently
under way, and develop and adapt it to meet the changing
needs of the region for a minimum period of two years.

BACKGROUND

     The services and resources available for assistance
are, in the main, already in place though not always on the
scale required.  These services are provided by a
multiplicity of organisations.  They must respond to those
who have asked for help, but also reach out to those who
have not come forward spontaneously.  It is important that
services are available quickly, are easily accessible,
approachable and able to deal with a whole range of
emotional and practical needs.  Some of these needs will be
immediate, some short-term, some of a more permanent nature
and in many cases needs will remain hidden for months, or
even years.

     Localised services, well publicised, are of course,
most important but these should be seen in the context of a
regional network of centrally co-ordinated resources.  In
addition, regional co-ordination can mobilise resources in
particular areas which would perhaps be overwhelmed by
demand, if left to cope alone.

KEY CO-ORDINATION FUNCTIONS REQUIRED ARE:-

(i)      Receipt and analysis of all requests for help both
          locally and nationally to ensure a co-ordinated
          response is made;

(ii)     provision of an outreach service to track those who
          need help, but who have not yet come forward;

(iii) promote quality assurance of services, through
       monitoring and review;

(iv)     establishment of criteria for staff training and
          support patterns which are common across the region;

(v)      advise on the public relations function;




HLAAAB
      (vi)     guidance and assistance in the establishment of
               appropriate local databases which are compatible with
               the central system, to ensure speedy, reliable and
               accurate information;

      (vii)    promotion of liaison and co-operation between all
               relevant agencies in the region}

      (viii) review action already taken in other regions (e.g.
             Sheffield, Nottinghamshire).

      COUNSELLING SERVICES - CONTINUING REQUIREMENTS

10.        It is clear from the information from previous
      disasters that continued access to practical and counselling
      services is required by some victims for a considerable time
      after the event.   It cannot be assumed that individuals
      needing help will be requesting or needing it now and
      arrangements must be made to ensure that help is accessible
      and readily available in the medium and long-term.

11.        The extent of future service requirements is difficult
      to predict though some indications of the range of problems
      presented, the location of people needing help and the form
      of help they require should be available when data collected
      so far, has been analysed.  Some patterns of service
      requirements will be discernible and inform the detailed
      planning of provision.

12.        Meanwhile it is possible to identify in broad terms the
      kinds of services that will be needed and the ways in which
      they may be provided.    A co-ordinated mix of centralised and
      local services from the statutory and voluntary sector is
      likely to provide the greatest flexibility in the use of
      resources;   such flexibility will be necessary given the
      difficulty of identifying the extent and type of need, and
      ensuring that deployment of resources is appropriate and
      adequately monitored.

      Philosophy

13.        It is important to ensure that the service response
      meets with an overall philosophy agreed by the participating
      agencies.

              For the consumer this will mean that:

      (i)      There are clear avenues for seeking help (locally and
               regionally).

      (ii)      The response to their requests will be quick and
                appropriate.




      HLAAAB
f               (iii)       Help is easily accessible (i.e. help is not
                            dependent upon where people live).

                (iv)        Help should be non-labelling and non-stigmatising.

                     For the participating agencies this will mean that
                services:

                (i)         Should be well co-ordinated andconsistent.

                (ii)        Should be quality assured.

                (iii)       Cost effective.

                (iv)        Keep the consumer as the primary                         consideration.

      14.             Inaddition, the agencies will need to contribute to
                the wider body of knowledge that can be drawn upon-in the
                event of further disasters.   Funds to mount an evaluation of
                the response to this disaster are being sought
                independently.   The feedback from such research could be
                invaluable regionally and nationally in emergency planning.


                Specific Service Requirements

      15.              Theprovision of services as a response to disaster can
                be considered along a continuum with practical help at one
                end and long-term counselling at the other.   Figure 1
                attempts to show this continuum in more detail.

      16.            It can be seen that the services along the continuum
                reflect particular post disaster time phases, the possible
                different modes or models of service provision and the
                possible locations where services are received.  Many of the
                services are best left at the local level where resources
                are familiar and can easily be adjusted in response to
                changes in need.




                HLAAAB
17.        However, some can be provided more effectively at a
      Regional level, e.g.  Helpline, central information.  In
      addition, some services can best be monitored, evaluated and
      co-ordinated at a regional level.  A 'network' of specialist
      skills can be developed by a regional unit.

18.        The Inter-Agency Planning Group recommends that a
      co-ordinating body, known as the ‘'Hillsborough Support Unit"
      be established for a minimum period of two years.   The Unit
      should have an executive officer, and support staff?
      operate the central Helpline?   set up an efficient database;
      oversee the pattern of services to enable resources to be
      used effectively?   see that districts provide systematic
      support and training for all staff?   develop clear channels
      of communication and form partnerships with all relevant
      authorities and non-statutory agencies in the region?   set
      up monitoring, evaluation and performance review systems.

19.        The lead authorities responsible for the Unit could be
      represented through a Committee comprising local authority
      members and officers' representatives of Mersey Regional
      Health Authority, Merseyside Probation Service, Voluntary
      Organisations, and the Disaster Trust Fund.               ’

      Suggested 'Regional Services'

           The services outlined below will need to be linked to
      each other through the proposed Regional Unit.

      HELPLINE

20.        This service currently operates on a 24 hour day, 7 day
      week basis and is staffed by officers of the Social Services
      Departments and a variety of other organisations.   Given the
      nationwide 'catchment' of potential users of the service it
      will be cost-efficient to retain this centralised service at
      its current level for a period of weeks to come and will
      ensure a ready access point for assistance while medium to
      longer term arrangements are effected.   It is envisaged that
      the Helpline will become a national 'one number' service run
      by the regional unit with calls then referred to local
      services as appropriate.

      Co-ordination of Counselling Services

21.        Whilst counselling will usually be offered very
      'locally' it will be necessary to ensure that individuals
      are referred to the most appropriate agency? that their
      needs are met, and the services are monitored.   In addition




      HLAAAB
      there will be people needing help from outside the 'region'
      whose needs must be assessed and referrals made.  This will
      require a team of 4 headed by a team leader.

22.        It is important that referrals to and from statutory
      agencies across the country are properly co-ordinated.
      There are a number of voluntary agencies on Merseyside and
      in the region for whom counselling is already the major, or
      a significant part of their work; these should be used
      wherever possible.  These include COMPASS, Personal Social
      Services, C. of E. Board of Social Responsibility (through
      the clergy and national organisations with local bases, such
      as Cruse).  The regional unit would aim to co-ordinate
      referrals to and from these agencies where appropriate.

      Drop-in Centre

23.         The Anfield Advice Centre has already allowed a large
      number of 'survivors' to describe and share their experience
      of being at Hillsborough.   It has offered other services as
      well.   It is likely that this Centre will continue via
      funding from other sources. However, because of the
      symbolic importance of Anfield we recommend that it is used
      as a referral point for Helpline on Match Days. We believe
      that many new referrals will be obtained on Match Days.

      OUTREACH AND CO-ORDINATION

24.        Whilst the majority of people affected by Hillsborough
      reside within or just outside the Merseyside region it is
      known that a significant number reside elsewhere.  This
      problem was found by Kent following the Zeebrugge disaster
      where survivors and others lived long distances from the
      centre of help. An "away" Team was established to initiate
      and provide assistance outside the Dover area.  Zeebrugge
      also demonstrated that many people required specialist help
      from Counsellors, Psychologists and Psychiatrists etc., and
      that a mechanism was needed to co-ordinate their services.
      Thus problems were both identified and met by the Kent
      "away" Team.

25.        Unlike Zeebrugge, however, the identity and location of
      people affected by "Hillsborough" are largely unknown.
      Whilst this is a handicap, there is sufficient justification
      to reach out to those in potential need.  There is a need,
      therefore, to establish the equivalent of the Kent "away"
      Team but with the limited role of referring those from
      outside the region to appropriate services across the
      country.  Basic tasks will be to:-




      HLAAAB
      1.   Provide a central telephone.line, e.g. an 0800
           (freephone) number;

      2.   Provide an assessment and referral service, whereby
           people are re-referred to Local Advice Services;

      3.   Co-ordinate referrals both from within and without the
           region;

      4.   Provide oversight of the different elements of
           specialist services, e.g. psychologists etc.

      5.   Identify key events and anniversaries which may effect
           individuals and consequently service provision (e.g.
           Inquests, future football games).

           Thus the differing needs of people will be identified
      and the appropriate resources matched up to meet those
      needs:  this will avoid duplication of effort and create a
      more efficient use of resources.

      DATABASE REQUIREMENTS

26.        The unit will require a database capable of recording
      information fed through to t h e ■'helpline', 'drop.in' centres
      and other source points. The majority of contacts will be
      within two broad categories, i.e. either requesting
      assistance or offering help. Currently the 'Hillsborough
      Helpline' has separate systems dealing with these two
      elements.  At present, nearly 3,600 offers of help have been
      received from a variety of sources, including over 600
      through the 'Hillsborough Helpline'. About 1,650 requests
      for help have been received nationally, the majority of
      these being through the 'Hillsborough Helpline'. With this
      level of activity occuring, it is clear that an effective
      database is essential to matching needs for assistance with
      the wide range of resources available.

27.        In respect of referrals for help, a manual database was
      established as a record of callers, pending the setting up
      of the computerised system.  It is suggested that this be
      retained and maintained as a back up in case of problems
      with the system.

28.         Information which is useful for the database, includes
      basic details such as names, addresses, local authority of
      origin, referral to district and agency, general
      practitioners, significant dates, (birthdays, anniversaries
      etc).   Each person has an individual reference number, and
      there is a facility for a group reference for people linked
      together.




      HLAAAB
29.        Staffing levels, which are currently based upon staff
      seconded from other duties should be formalised as soon as
      possible.  Minimum staffing is expected to require a systems
      manager, two operators, and full-time clerical support.
      Once the system is up to date close links should be
      maintained with the 'Helpline', and other agencies involved
      in collating or investigating data.

      Staff Training and Support

30.        The need for on-going and carefully targetted training
      has been demonstrated via earlier disasters.  Clearly such
      training can and has already been 'bought in' from external
      sources.  So far this specialist training has been
      provided for local authority workers. The regional unit
      would hope to adopt a policy of 'training the trainers' and
      thus by using expertise within the region attempt to reduce
      training costs.

31.        It is absolutely clear that those managing and working
      in post-disaster situations found the work very stressful.
      They need access to regular de-briefing and 'talking out'
      sessions. Whilst for some workers this will in part be
      provided in their own agencies there is a need for an
      independent service which all helpers, whether paid or
      voluntary staff, can use. The regional unit would aim to
      ensure these support systems were in place and make
      arrangements to co-ordinate offers of this 'care for the
      carers' (e.g. by BASW and the Psychology Service).  The unit
      could also respond, in confidence, to direct requests from
      staff anywhere in the region.

      PUBLIC RELATIONS

32.         "Public relations" is an important and basic element in
      the success or failure of any venture.   This is complex and
      requires skilled and sensitive handling if its potential is
      to be realised.   It needs to be regarded as an explicit
      task, and as part of the management and objectives of the
      unit.   It can best be organised within the framework of a
      public relations strategy.

            Such a strategy will acknowledge that:-

      (i)   Interest in the disaster will be subject to
            fluctuation.  For example:  funerals, inquests,
            litigation, football matches, anniversary of the
            disaster etc. Forward planning for the impact of
            these events is required.




      HLAAAB
(ii)      Public Relations is heavily dependent on hard, factual
          and accurate information about the work of the unit.
          There will, therefore, need to be direct links between
          the management and the public relations functions of
          the unit.

(iii) Media interest can sometimes be aggressive and
      time-consuming.  This can be wasteful at best and
      damaging at worst. Thus contact with the media needs
      to be carefully channelled and regulated separating
      local and regional issues.

     It is suggested that Public relations can best be
undertaken by the Head of the Unit along with substantial
support from the Management Committee.

COSTINGS

     Since "Hillsborough" is a national disaster, it is
recommended that strenuous efforts are made to obtain the
funding of the Unit from central government, the EEC and
other sources. Costs are estimated at around £350,000 per
year for two years.  This may be generous or alternatively
additional resources may need to be added on.

CONCLUSION

     The advantages of co-ordinating all helping responses
seem clear.  It is believed that a Regional Unit would, in
the long run, be cost effective and more importantly would
introduce a whole series, of supports and checks which would
mean a better service for those who need it, including the
carers.

1.  I am replying to your minute of the 25th of April in which
you questioned the "forum" referred to in Mrs Gibson's minute of
the 20th of April.  The forum is the group assembled to put
together the paper on SSI's response to SSDs in Crises.
Mr Pearson has been assembling the drafts the last one of which
was discussed at the senior management meeting. Roy Pearson has
revised this paper to be discussed with Mr          at the next
senior management meeting.

2. The crises paper is concerned with ongoing difficulties
experienced by SSDs such as the Cleveland problems, the financial
problem of Liverpool and Brent etc.  It makes only scant
reference to disasters such as Hillsborough, Hungerford etc.

3. Mrs Downey is dealing with the Hillsborough problems in
conjunction with                 (CS1) .. I understand that
Brian Harrison is meeting                  to discuss whether any
financial support can be given in the Hillsborough case.
Meanwhile, I am discussing with_____________ the need to update
the current civil emergencies arrangements and to consider
whether anymore fundamental review of the procedures is
necessary.

Dear Mr Harrison

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Thank you for your letter and enclosures of 24 April,   I was asked to
attend a meeting earlier this week with the Directors of Social
Services of Liverpool and Sefton.  They informed me of the proposal to
set up a special regional unit and I attach a copy of the paper they
have prepared on the subject.      The annual cost is estimated at
£350,000.    They also indicated that they would be approaching
Government for assistance on the additional costs incurred by the
individual social service departments in assisting and counselling
those affected by the disaster.

As far as the special regional unit was concerned I told them that in
the first instance they should approach your Secretary of State. This
was not straightforward buck passing but only your Department [within
Government] can appraise the value and necessity of such a unit.  Who
pays comes later!   As far as assistance to individual local authori­
ties is concerned I said that they should enumerate precisely what
their extra costs amounted to before making a direct claim to
Government. I saw no reason why they should not at this stage inform
our respective Secretaries of State that they intended lodging such a
claim.

Perhaps we could discuss this further when we meet on Monday next.

Yours sincerely
           A F T E R     H I L L S B O R O U G H

HLAAAB
     AIM

1.        To consider the feasibility including costings of
     establishing a regional unit in order to marshall and
     organise the allocation of a variety of resources so that
     help can be made available in the right place at the right
     time to people affected by the "Hillsborough" disaster.   In
     this context "Region" is the seven local authorities.

     METHOD AND FORMAT

2.        A working party of senior staff, drawn from statutory
     and voluntary agencies in the region was established to
     report on the potential for an Assistance Unit built upon
     the service structure created after "Hillsborough".  The
     group was chaired by Howard Parker, Professor in Social Work
     at the University of Manchester.

3.        The report uses the experience gained from the disaster
     at "Hillsborough" and other recent tragedies, and sets out
     recommendations for dealing with the organisational,
     information and co-ordination issues which have arisen.
     Specifically, this consists off a synopsis of the key
     elements required to operate a service which is responsive
     to need and has an outreach capability, including the
     provision of a helpline, counselling, specialised work,
     database, staff training/support and public relations.   All
     of these elements are included within the broad aim as
     stated above, and the role of the unit as perceived by the
     group.

     INTRODUCTION

4.        The events at "Hillsborough", Sheffield, on 15th April
     1989, are a graphic illustration of the extensive damage to
     personal well-being which can be precipitated by the trauma
     of a major disaster.  This applies to those directly
     involved, through injury or bereavement, their helpers,
     onlookers, and people suffering shock due to publicity or
     association with similar events.  The effects are often
     long-term and can have a profound impact upon family life
     and on individual ability to cope with everyday living.

5.        "Hillsborough" is the latest in a tragic line of
     disasters.  Manchester Airport, Bradford, Piper Alpha,
     Zeebrugge, Kegworth, Clapham and Lockerbie have all
     illustrated how a major unexpected disaster affects the
     lives of ordinary people and the agencies which must provide
     them with assistance.  We have learnt a great deal from
     these earlier tragedies, particularly how large scale
     disasters produce trauma and grief much further and deeper
     than common sense would expect.




     HLAAAB
      Following the disasters there was a rapid mobilisation
of resources from a variety of authorities, and
non-s t a t u t o r y agencies. It became apparent from the outset,
that a m e chanism was necessary to ensure that these
resources were p r o perly co-ordinated to reach people and
families in need in the most effective and speedy manner.
Drawing from the experience of those involved in the
response to earlier disasters, and from the current
situation, it is considered essential that an infrastructure
is e stablished which can consolidate the effort currently
under way, and develop and adapt it to meet the changing
needs of the region for a minimum period of two years.

BACKG R O U N D

        The services and resources available for assistance
are, in the main, already in place though not always on the
scale required.           These services are provided by a
mul t i p l i c i t y of organisations.  They must respond to those
w h o have asked for help, but also reach out to those who
have not come forward spontaneously.           It is important that
services are available quickly, are easily accessible,
approachable and able to deal with a whole range of
emotional and practical needs.           Some of these needs will be
immediate, some short-term, some of a more permanent nature
and in man y cases needs will remain hi d d e n for months, or
even years.

     L ocalised services, well publicised, are of course,
most important but these should be seen in the context of a
regional network of centrally co-ordinated resources.    In
addition, regional co-ordination can mobilise resources in
particular areas which would perhaps be overwhelmed by
demand, if left to cope alone.

K E Y CO -OR D I N A T I O N FUNCTIONS REQUIRED ARE:-

(i)       Receipt and analysis of all requests for hel p both
          locally and nationally to ensure a co-ordinated
          response is made;

(ii)      provision of an outreach service to track those who
          need help, but who have not yet come forward;

(iii)     promote quality assurance of services,        through
          monitoring and review;

(iv)       establishment of criteria for staff training and
           support patterns which are common across the region;

(v)        advise on the public relations function;




HLAAAB
J




          (v i )    guidance and assistance in the establishment of
                    appropriate local databases which are compatible with
                    the central system, to ensure speedy, reliable and
                    accurate information?

          (vii)     promotion of liaison and co-operation between all
                    relevant agencies in the region;

          (viii) review action already taken in other regions (e.g.
                 Sheffield, Nottinghamshire).

          COUNSELLING SERVICES - CONTINUING REQUIREMENTS

    10.        It is clear from the information from previous
          disasters that continued access to practical and counselling
          services is required by some victims for a considerable time
          after the event.   It cannot be assumed that individuals
          needing help will be requesting or needing it now and
          arrangements must be made to ensure that help is accessible
          and readily available in the medium and long-term.

    11.        The extent of future service requirements is difficult
          to predict though some indications of the range of problems
          presented, the location of people needing help and the form
          of help they require should be available when data collected
          so far, has been analysed.   Some patterns of service
          requirements will be discernible and inform the detailed
          planning of provision.

    12.        Meanwhile it is possible to identify in broad terms the
          kinds of services that will be needed and the ways in which
          they may be provided. A co-ordinated mix of centralised and
          local services from the statutory and voluntary sector is
          likely to provide the greatest flexibility in the use of
          resources;   such flexibility will be necessary given the
          difficulty of identifying the extent and type of need, and
          ensuring that deployment of resources is appropriate and
          adequately monitored.

          Philosophy

    13.        It is important to ensure that the service response
          meets with an overall philosophy agreed by the participating
          agencies.

                   For the consumer this will mean that:

          (i)       There are clear avenues for seeking help (locally and
                    regionally).

          (ii)       The response to their requests will be quick and
                     appropr iate.




          H LAAAB
a




                (iii)     fie:ip is easily accessible (i ,e, help is not
                           dependent upon where people live).

                (i v )     Help should be non-labelling and non-stigmatising.

                     For the participatin g agencies this will mean that
                services:

                (i)       Should be well co-ordinated and consistent.

                (ii)      Should be quality assured.

                (iii)     Cost effective.

                (iv)      Keep the consumer as the primary consideration.

     14.             In addition, the agencies will need to contribute to
                the wider body of knowledge that can be drawn upon in the
                event of further disasters.  Funds to mount an evaluation of
                the response to this disaster are being sought
                independently. The feedback from such research could be
                invaluable regionally and nationally in emergency planning.


                Specific Service Requirements

      15.            The provision of services as a response to disaster can
                be considered along a continuum with practical help at one
                end and long-term counselling at the other.  Figure 1
                attempts to show this continuum in more detail.

      16.            It can be seen that the services along the continuum
                reflect particular post disaster time phases, the possible
                different modes or models of service provision and the
                possible locations where services are received.  Many of the
                services are best left at the local level where resources
                are familiar and can easily be adjusted in response to
                changes in need.




                HLAAAB

    17.        However, some can be provided more effectively at a
          Regional level,. e»g, He.lpl.ine, central information.  In
          addition, some services can best be monitored, evaluated and
          co-ordinated at a regional level.    A 'network* of specialist
          skills can be developed by a regional unit.

    18.         The Inter-Agency Planning Group recommends that a
          co-ordinating body, known as the "Hillsborough Support Unitw
          b e established for a minimum period of two years. The Unit
          should have an executive officer, and support staff;
          operate the central Helpline;    set up an efficient database?
          oversee the pattern of services to enable resources to be
          used effectively;    see that districts provide systematic"
          support and training for all staff?    develop clear channels
          of communication and form partnerships with all relevant
          authorities and non-statutory agencies in the region?    set
          up monitoring, evaluation and performance review systems.

    19.        The lead authorities responsible for the Unit could be
          represented through a Committee comprising local authority
          members and officers' representatives of Mersey Regional
          Health Authority, Merseyside Probation Service, Voluntary
          Organisations, and the Disaster Trust Fund.

          Suggested 'Regional Services'

               The services outlined below will need to be linked to
          each other through the proposed Regional Unit.

          HELPLINE

    20.       This service currently operates on a 24 hour day, 7 day
          week basis and is staffed by officers of the Social Services
          Departments and a variety of other organisations. Given the
          nationwide 'catchment' of potential users of the service it
          will be cost-efficient to retain this centralised service at
          its current level for a period of weeks to come and will
          ensure a ready access point for assistance while medium to
          longer term arrangements are effected.  It is envisaged that
          the Helpline will become a national 'one number' service run
          by the regional unit with calls then referred to local
          services as appropriate.

          Co-ordination of Counselling Services

    21.       Whilst counselling will usually be offered very
          'locally' it will be necessary to ensure that individuals
          are referred to the most appropriate agency? that their
          needs are met, and the services are monitored.  In addition




           HLAAAB
      there will be people needing help from outside the 'region'
      whose needs must be assessed and referrals made.  This will
      require a team of 4 headed by a team leader.

22.        It is important that referrals to and from statutory
      agencies across the country are properly co-ordinated.
      There are a number of voluntary agencies on Merseyside and
      in the region for whom counselling is already the major, or
      a significant part of their work; these should be used
      wherever possible.   These include COMPASS, Personal Social
      Services, C. of E. Board of Social Responsibility (through
      the clergy and national organisations with local bases, such
      as Cruse).  The regional unit would aim to co-ordinate
      referrals to and from these agencies where appropriate.

      Drop-in Centre

23.        The Anfield Advice Centre has already allowed a large
      number of 'survivors' to describe and share their experience
      of being at Hillsborough.   It has offered other services as
      well.   It is likely that this Centre will continue via
      funding from other sources.   However, because of the
      symbolic importance of Anfield we recommend that it is used
      as a referral point for Helpline on Match Days. We believe
      that many new referrals will be obtained on Match Days.

      OUTREACH AND CO-ORDINATION

24.        Whilst the majority of people affected by Hillsborough
      reside within or just outside the Merseyside region it is
      known that a significant number reside elsewhere. This
      problem was found by Kent following the Zeebrugge disaster
      where survivors and others lived long distances from the
      centre of help. An "away" Team was established to initiate
      and provide assistance outside the Dover area.   Zeebrugge
      also demonstrated that many people required specialist help
      from Counsellors, Psychologists and Psychiatrists etc., and
      that a mechanism was needed to co-ordinate their services.
      Thus problems were both identified and met by the Kent
      "away" Team.

25.        Unlike Zeebrugge, however, the identity and location of
      people affected by "Hillsborough" are largely unknown.
      Whilst this is a handicap, there is sufficient justification
      to reach out to those in potential need. There is a need,
      therefore, to establish the equivalent of the Kent "away"
      Team but with the limited role of referring those from
      outside the region to appropriate services across the
      country.   Basic tasks will be to:-




      HLAAAB
»

          1.   Provide a central telephone line, e.g. an 0800
               (freephone) number?

          2.   Provide an assessment and referral service, whereby
               people are re-referred to Local Advice Services;

          3.   Co-ordinate referrals both from within and without the
               region?

          4.   Provide oversight of the different elements of
               specialist services, e.g. psychologists etc.

          5.   Identify key events and anniversaries which may effect
               individuals and consequently service provision (e.g.
               Inquests, future football games).

                Thus the differing needs of people will be identified
          and the appropriate resources matched up to meet those
          needs.*  this will avoid duplication of effort and create a
          more efficient use of resources.

          DATABASE REQUIREMENTS

    26.        The unit will require a database capable of recording
          information fed through to the 'helpline', 'drop.in' centres
          and other source points.  The majority of contacts will be
          within two broad categories, i.e. either requesting
          assistance or offering help.  Currently the 'Hillsborough
          Helpline' has separate systems dealing with these two
          elements.  At present, nearly 3,600 offers of help have been
          received from a variety of sources, including over 600
          through the 'Hillsborough Helpline'.   About 1,650 requests
          for help have been received nationally, the majority of
          these being through the 'Hillsborough Helpline'.   With this
          level of activity occuring, it is clear that an effective
          database is essential to matching needs for assistance with
          the wide range of resources available.

    27.        In respect of referrals for help, a manual database was
          established as a record of callers, pending the setting up
          of the computerised system.  It is suggested that this be
          retained and maintained as a back up in case of problems
          with the system.

    28.         Information which is useful for the database, includes
          basic details such as names, addresses, local authority of
          origin, referral to district and agency, general
          practitioners, significant dates, (birthdays, anniversaries
          etc).   Each person has an individual reference number, and
          there is a facility for a group reference for people linked
          together.

    29.        Staffing levels, which are currently based upon staff
          seconded from other duties should be formalised as soon as
          possible.  Minimum staffing is expected to require a systems
          manager, two operators, and full-time clerical support.
          Once the system is up to date close links should be
          maintained with the 'Helpline', and other agencies involved
          in collating or investigating data.

          Staff Training and Support

    30.        The need for on-going and carefully targetted training
          has been demonstrated via earlier disasters. Clearly such
          training can and has already been 'bought in' from external
          sources.  So far this specialist training has been
          provided for local authority workers. The regional unit
          would hope to adopt a policy of 'training the trainers' and
          thus by using expertise within the region attempt to reduce
          training costs.

    31.        It is absolutely clear that those managing and working
          in post-disaster situations found the work very stressful.
          They need access to regular de-briefing and 'talking out'
          sessions. Whilst for some workers this will in part be
          provided in their own agencies there is a need for an
          independent service which all helpers, whether paid or
          voluntary staff, can use. The regional unit would aim to
          ensure these support systems were in place and make
          arrangements to co-ordinate offers of this 'care for the
          carers' (e.g. by BASW and the Psychology Service). The unit
          could also respond, in confidence, to direct requests from
          staff anywhere in the region.

          PUBLIC RELATIONS

    32.         "Public relations" is an important and basic element in
          the success or failure of any venture. This is complex and
          requires skilled and sensitive handling if its potential is
          to be realised.   It needs to be regarded as an explicit
          task, and as part of the management and objectives of the
          unit.   It can best be organised within the framework of a
          public relations strategy.

                Such a strategy will acknowledge that:-

          (i)      Interest in the disaster will be subject to
                   fluctuation.  For example:  funerals, inquests,
                   litigation, football matches, anniversary of the
                   disaster etc.  Forward planning for the impact of
                   these events is required.




          HLAAAB
 #fc




       (ii)   Public Relations, is heavily           on 'hard, factual
              and accurate infcLRiation about the work of the unit.
              There will, therefore# need to be direct links between
              the management and the public relations functions of
              the unit.

       (iii) Media interest can sometimes be aggressive and
             time-consuming.  This can be wasteful at best and
             damaging at worst.  Thus contact with the media needs
             to be carefully channelled and regulated separating
             local and regional issues.

33.         It is suggested that Public relations can best be
       undertaken by the Head of the Unit along with substantial
       support from the Management Committee.

       COSTINGS

34.         Since "Hillsborough" is a national disaster, it is
       recommended that strenuous efforts are made to obtain the
       funding of the Unit from central government, the EEC and
       other sources.  Costs are estimated at around £350,000 per
       year for two years.  This may be generous or alternatively
       additional resources may need to be added on.

       CONCLUSION

35.         The advantages of co-ordinating all helping responses
       seem clear.  It is believed that a Regional Unit would, in
       the long run, be cost effective and more importantly would
       introduce a whole series, of supports and checks which would
       mean a better service for those who need it, including the
       carers.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


1.   Thank you very much indeed for the information you sent me in relation to
      the Ml disaster.  I appreciate the detail you sent.

2a   I agree with you that we ought to have some mechanism in SSI to gather
     together the lessons we are learning from such disasters.   I am currently
     trying to find out more about the working party chaired by CRUISE which is
     being funded by the Department of Health.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


1.   A memorial service at the Anglican Cathedral in Liverpool was well
      received and appears to have been appreciated.

2.   There continues regretably to be some sadness that a member of the Royal
      Family has not made contact with the helping agencies.  The visit of the
      Prince of Wales was to the Anfield Stadium. Normal business is beginning
      to resume in Merseyside though there is still considerable activity
      relating to Hillsborough and the aftermath.

3.   The five Merseyside authorities and Lancashire and Cheshire are recruiting
     more social work staff to fill gaps left by staff involved in ongoing work
     with families affected by the disaster and Liverpool city council have
      advertised for an additional Assistant Director (Operations) to assume
      responsibility for some aspects of management in order to free others to
      continue with Hillsborough ’w o rk ’.

4.   The training programme continues and NWASSA (North West Association of
      Social Services Authorities) has agreed to fund a training officer to
      assume responsibility for ongoing training after the consultant (Michael
      Stuart of Centre for Crisis Psychology) has left the area. There is to be
     a 'training for trainers' strategy.   I enclose a copy of the report to
      NWASSA (Appendix 1).

5.   The working party set up to formulate recommendations for a co-ordination
      strategy relating to the delivery of helping services has reported.  This
     was accepted by the local politicians of all local authorities concerned
      (copy attached Appendix 2) - costings to follow.

6.   The problem now is one of funding the proposed strategy.  Directors of
     Liverpool and Sefton Social Services Departments met with a representative
     of Merseyside Task Force (D of E) which I understand was helpful relating
     to the process re possible funding. Mr Harrison and I had briefed
     Merseyside Task Force in advance of the meeting and we are to meet Mr
     Morrison from Merseyside Task Force on 8 May.
•
    7.   Merseyside Task Force has advised a letter should go to Secretary of State
          for the Department of Health copied to Nicholas Ridley; John Moore and Mrs
          Thatcher requesting funding. This has been prepared and will be signed by
          the politicians in Liverpool.  An approach is also being made to the EEC.

    8.   It would appear that £50,000 has been promised from private industry   to
          fund a memorial drop-in centre in Liverpool.

    9.   Mr Mason, Director of Liverpool SSD is keen to link with the D of H
          sponsored joint working group on disaster follow-up and counselling. He
          intends to contact Tony Allen - Chief Executive of Berkshire County
          Council who I understand chairs the working party.  (NB This must be the
          forum I heard about.  Sorry for the confusion caused!)

    10   A request is likely to be made for research following Hillsborough.
          Howard Parker;, Professor of Social Work at Manchester University would be
          keen to undertake this and has asked me to make enquiries about the
          possibility of funding from the Department.   Professor Parker is already
          known to David Mellor because of earlier research relating to drugs
          misuse.   Professor Parker has attempted a literature search on articles
          and research on "disasters” and has outlined to me the nature of the
          research he would wish to recommend.   It appears to me to be very
          relevant.

          REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL SERVICES FOR LIVERPOOL




                         THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER



PURPOSE

1.   To inform members of the services provided on a regional basis by
     North West Social Services Authorities to the victims of the
     Hillsborough disaster on 15th April 1989. Additionally to seek
     financial support from N.W.A.S.S.A. for all publicity material and
     staff training initiatives that can be made available across the
     region. Finally to seek continuing support for the involved seven
     Authorities to providing a long term service to victims.

INTRODUCTION

2.   Members will require no introduction to the scale of the disaster
     that occurred at Hillsborough.   Whilst immediate priority has been
     afforded to the bereaved families and the casualties; it is clear
     that all those people attending, playing and officiating in the foot­
     ball match, plus their circle of family and friends must be regarded
     as victims.   The issue for the Authorities must ultimately be the
     quality of life of the survivors and those closely associated. The
     nature of the service needed must be regarded as preventive mental
     health.

3.   The epicentre of the tragedy will probably be revealed, when accurate
     data emerges, as being Merseyside with adjoining parts of Lancashire
     and Cheshire. However, the facts already available and the nature of
     the support for Liverpool F.C. dictate the Hillsborough disaster be
     regarded as a national disaster. The response to the needs of the
     victims must therefore also be viewed in that context.

4.   It is for that reason that the seven Directors of Social Services
     whose departments are involved, with the full support of their Councils,
     have adopted a joint approach to the issues.   The services provided
     across the region include a 24 hour Helpline, a co-ordinated approach
     to counselling, a number of drop-in and advice centres and a co-ordinated
     voluntary effort.   A similar approach has been taken to information,
     publicity, public and press relations, database, training, finance and
     administration.

5.   To date finance has been made available.   However, members should be
     aware that effectively the services provided have been achieved through
     a combination of secondments, staff goodwill, free arrangements and
     reorientation of priorities. Such arrangements cannot continue and it
     is the intention of the seven Authorities, together with the Mersey
     Regional Health Authority, the Probation Service and the Voluntary
     Sector to work towards permanence.
ROLE OF N.W.A.S.S.A.

6.   It was realised soon after the disaster by both the seven Directors
     and the Professional Adviser to N.V.A.S.S.A. that the whole region
     would be affected in a number of ways. Firstly, that the members and
     officers of the Authorities most directly impacted on would require
     the support of regional colleagues.    The initiative of the Chair of
     N.W.A.S.S.A. and               .n this direction are much appreciated.
     Secondly, that any publication produced as a consequence of the disaster
     could benefit the services across the region.    The Chair of N.W.A.S.S.A.
     (through his Professional Adviser) has already authorised the publica­
     tion of "Coping after Hillsborough" (copy attached).    Authority is now
     sought for further relevant publications (posters and leaflets) to be
     similarly regionally published (list is attached).    Thirdly, training
     directed at crisis intervention work and counselling could valuably be
     provided across member Authorities.    Those seven Authorities involved
     have already directly commissioned immediate staff and member training
     through a retained consultant.    For the longer term staff training
     needs it is suggested that N.W.A.S.S.A. should consider funding a
     Training Officer. If such an officer were recruited soon that person
     themselves could receive training from the consultant and continue with
     ongoing work.

CONCLUSION

7.   The seven Directors wish to acknowledge support already received from
     N.W.A.S.S.A. in meeting the needs of the victims of Hillsborough.
     This report seeks further long term support and highlights publication
     and training as areas where specific resources are requested and where
     regional benefit could be derived.

RECOMMENDED

8.   That the North West Association of Social Services Authorities:—

       i)     Note the contents of this report and recognise the long term
              support needs of the seven Authorities most directly involved
              and convert such support into appropriate practical assistance.

      ii)     Confirm the funding of the publication "Coping after Hillsborough"
              and authorise that the leaflet "Were you at the Match?", posters
              for schools and "Advice on How to Cope with a Crisis" be
              similarly published.

     iii)     Fund a Training Officer post (approximate cost £18,000 with
              on costs) to be based at an appropriate agency.

ATTACHED

      i)      Copy of "Coping after Hillsborough",

     ii)      List of publications with approximate cost per 1,000.

                                         HILLSBOROUGH PUBLICITY


               The following publicity material has been produced for people
               needing help following the Hillsborough tragedy.

               1.     "Coping after Hillsborough".   Leaflet for adults containing
                      advice on how to cope with a major personal crisis. Based
                      on a leaflet by the Prince Henry's Hospital (Australia) and
                      used after the Bradford City, Piper Alpha and Zeebrugge
                      disasters. The leaflet has been adapted for our use, and
                      the language simplified.   Carries Helpline number.   25,000
                      printed so far.   Cost per 1,000 - £37.00.

               2.    "Were you at the Match?"   Leaflet for use with young people,
                      encouraging them to talk about their feelings about what
                     happened at Hillsborough, and how it affected them, their
                      friends and families. Carries Helpline number and details
                     of Drop In Centre. 30,000 printed. Cost per 1,000 — £26.66..

               3.    Poster for Schools, in same style as "Were you at the Match?"
                     leaflet, carrying Helpline number.   1,000 printed.   Cost
                     per 1,000 - £150.

     To consider the feasibility including costings of
establishing a regional unit in order to marshall and
organise the allocation of a variety of resources so that
help can be made available in the right place at the right
time to people affected by the "Hillsborough" disaster.   In
this context "Region" is the seven local authorities.

METHOD AND FORMAT

     A working party of senior staff, drawn from statutory
and voluntary agencies in the region was established to
report on the potential for an Assistance Unit built upon
the service structure created after "Hillsborough". The
group was chaired by Howard Parker, Professor in Social Work
at the University of Manchester,

      The report uses the experience gained from the disaster
at ‘’Hillsborough" and other recent tragedies, and sets out
recommendations for dealing with the organisational,
information and co-ordination issues which have arisen.
Specifically, this consists off a synopsis of the key
elements required to operate a service which is responsive
to need and has an outreach capability, including the
provision of a helpline, counselling, specialised work,
database, staff training/support and public relations. All
of these elements are included within the broad aim as
stated above, and the role of the unit as perceived by the
group.

INTRODUCTION

     The events at "Hillsborough", Sheffield, on 15th April
1989, are a graphic illustration of the extensive damage to
personal well-being which can be precipitated by the trauma
of a major disaster. This applies to those directly
involved, through injury or bereavement, their helpers,
onlookers, and people suffering shock due to publicity or
association with similar events. The effects are often
long-term and can have a profound impact upon family lif^
and on individual ability to cope with everyday living.

     "Hillsborough" is the latest in a tragic line of
disasters. Manchester Airport, Bradford, Piper Alpha,
Zeebrugge, Kegworth, Clapham and Lockerbie have all
illustrated how a major unexpected disaster affects the
lives of ordinary people and the agencies which must provide
them with assistance. We have learnt a great deal from
these earlier tragedies, particularly how large scale
disasters produce trauma and grief much further and deeper
than common sense would expect.

(vi)     guidance and assistance in the establishment of
         appropriate local databases which are compatible with
         the central system, to ensure speedy, reliable and
         accurate information?

(vii)    promotion of liaison and co-operation between all
         relevant agencies in the region;

(viii) review action already taken in other regions (e.g.
       Sheffield, Nottinghamshire).

COUNSELLING SERVICES - CONTINUING REQUIREMENTS

     It is clear from the information from previous
disasters that continued access to practical and counselling
services is required by some victims for a considerable time
after the event,  It cannot be assumed that individuals
needing help will be requesting or needing it now and
arrangements must be made to ensure that help is accessible
and readily available in the medium and long-term.

     The extent of future service requirements is difficult
to predict though some indications of the range of problems
presented, the location of people needing help and the form
of help they require should be available when data collected
so far, has been analysed.  Some patterns of service
requirements will be discernible and inform the detailed
planning of provision.

     Meanwhile it is possible to identify in broad terms the
kinds of services that will be needed and the ways in which
they may be provided.  A co-ordinated mix of centralised and
local services from the statutory and voluntary sector is
likely to provide the greatest flexibility in the use of
resources;  such flexibility will be necessary given the
difficulty of identifying the extent and type of need, and
ensuring that deployment of resources is appropriate and
adequately monitored.

Philosophy

     It is important to ensure that the service response
meets with an overall philosophy agreed by the participating
agencies.

        For the consumer this will mean that:

(i)       There are clear avenues for seeking help (locally and
          regionally).

(ii)     The response to their requests will be quick and
         appropriate.




HLAAAB
17.           However, some can be provided more effectively at a
         Regional level, e.g.  Helpline, central information.  In
         addition, some services can best be monitored, evaluated and
         co-ordinated at a regional level. A ’network' of specialist
         skills can be developed by a regional unit.

18.           The Inter-Agency Planning Group recommends that a
         co-ordinating body, known as the "Hillsborough Support Unit**
         be established for a minimum period of two years. The Unit~
         should have an executive officer, and support staff;
         operate the central Helpline;  set up an efficient database;
         oversee the pattern of services to enable resources to be
         used eTfictively?  see that districts provide systematic
         support and training for all staff? develop clear channels
         of communication and form partnerships with all relevant
         authorities and non-statutory agencies in the region?  set
         up monitoring, evaluation and performance review systems.

19.           The lead authorities responsible for the Unit could be
         represented through a Committee comprising local authority
         members and officers' representatives of Mersey Regional
         Health Authority, Merseyside Probation Service, Voluntary
         Organisations, and the Disaster Trust Fund.

         Suggested 'Regional Services*

              The services outlined below will need to be linked to
         each other through the proposed Regional Unit.

         HELPLINE

20   .        This service currently operates on a 24 hour day, 7 day
         week basis and is staffed by officers of the Social Services
         Departments and a variety of other organisations. Given the
         nationwide 'catchment' of potential users of the service it
         will be cost-efficient to retain this centralised service at
         its current level for a period of weeks to come and will
         ensure a ready access point for assistance while medium to
         longer term arrangements are effected.  It is envisaged that
         the Helpline will become a national 'one number' service run
         by the regional unit with calls then referred to local
         services as appropriate.

         Co-ordination of Counselling Services

21.           Whilst counselling will usually be offered very
         'locally' it will be necessary to ensure that individuals
         are referred to the most appropriate agency; that their
         needs are met, and the services are monitored.  In addition




         HLAAAB
      1.   Provide a central telephone line, e.g. an 0800
           (freephone) number;

      2.   Provide an assessment and referral service, whereby
            people are re-referred to Local Advice Services;

      3.   Co-ordinate referrals both from within and without the
            region?

      4.   Provide oversight of the different elements of
            specialist services, e.g. psychologists etc.

      5.   Identify key events and anniversaries which may effect
            individuals and consequently service provision (e.g.
            Inquests, future football games).

           Thus the differing needs of people will be identified
      and the appropriate resources matched up to meet those
      needs?  this will avoid duplication of effort and create a
      more efficient use of resources.

      DATABASE REQUIREMENTS

26.        The unit will require a database capable of recording
      information fed through to the ‘helpline*, ‘drop.in' centres
      and other source points. The majority of contacts will be
      within two broad categories, i.e. either requesting
      assistance or offering help. Currently the 'Hillsborough
      Helpline' has separate systems dealing with these two
      elements. At present, nearly 3,600 offers of help have been
      received from a variety of sources, including over 600
      through the 'Hillsborough Helpline*.   About 1,650 requests
      for help have been received nationally, the majority of
      these being through the 'Hillsborough Helpline'. With this
      level of activity occuring, it is clear that an effective
      database is essential to matching needs for assistance with
      the wide range of resources available.

27.        In respect of referrals for help, a manual database was
      established as a record of callers, pending the setting up
      of the computerised system'. It is suggested that this be
      retained and maintained as a back up in case of problems
      with the system.

28.         Information which is useful for the database, includes
      basic details such as names, addresses, local authority of
      origin, referral to district and agency, general
      practitioners, significant dates, (birthdays, anniversaries
      etc).   Each person has an individual reference number, and
      there is a facility for a group reference for people linked
      together.




      HLAAAB
(ii)     Public Relations is heavily dependent on hard, factual
         and accurate information about the work of the unit.
         There will, therefore, need to be direct links between
         the management and the public relations functions of
         the unit.

(iii) Media interest can sometimes be aggressive and
      time-consuming. This can be wasteful at best and
      damaging at worst. Thus contact with the media needs
      to be carefully channelled and regulated separating
      local and regional issues.

     It is suggested that Public relations can best be
undertaken by the Head of the Unit along with substantial
support from the Management Committee.

COSTIMGS

     Since "Hillsborough" is a national disaster, it is
recommended that strenuous efforts are made to obtain the
funding of the Unit from central government, the EEC and
other sources. Costs are estimated at around £350,000 per
year for two years. This may be generous or alternatively
additional resources may need to be added on.

CONCLUSION

     The advantages of co-ordinating all helping responses
seem clear.  It is believed that a Regional Unit would, in
the long run, be cost effective and more importantly would
introduce a whole series, of supports and checks which would
mean a better service for those who need it, including the
carers.

         (c)   no objection would be raised to Authorities reproducing the
               leaflet in the local free press etc.

64.      Education Training Programme.

         Derek Evans agreed to clarify with Michael Stewart a suggestion that                D. Evans/
         the Voluntary Sector Training Day scheduled for 22nd May had been                   P.Farrell.
         cancelled, and to contact Pauline Farrell prior to the meeting of the
         Voluntary Sector Co-ordinating Committee on 25th April.    _
                                                                                     V- V*
65.      Staff Counselling.

         It was agreed that the Director and Pauline Farrell would make further              D.Mason/

66   .   Helpline.

         Carole Wilkinson circulated a new rota to take account of the level of
         demand on the helpline and that she had received three offers for a
         new co-ordinator, which were being evaluated. It was agreed that one of
         the person's offering to co-ordinate the Helpline could be utilised                 C.Wilkinson
         instead to compile a detailed picture and overview of all calls received
         on the Helpline. It was also agreed that Pauline Farrell should
         accept the offer of f             to organise a group of retired
                                                                                             P.Farrell.

67.      Computers.

         The need for all agencies computers to be compatible was again
         stressed and it was agreed that Ken Johnson should forward to all
         agencies a note of the equipment in use in Liverpool Social Services.
         The Director undertook to contact the Managing Director of Royal Life
                                                                                             D.Mason.
         regarding the availability of any surplus equipment.

68   .   Permanent Accommodation - Drop In Centre.

         The Director informed the meeting about an expression of interest
         from a national construction company to provide a purpose-built
         drop in Centre, and undertook to keep the meeting informed of any
         progress.

69.      Training Video.

         It was agreed that the acquisition of the Crisis Psychology training                All to note
         video be considered further at this meeting on 26th April and all
         Authorities be asked to report to the meeting their intentions.

70.      Kwik—Save Vouchers.

         The Kwik—Save vouchers were circulated to the Authorities on the
         basis of bereavements per Local Authority area. Paddy Marley reported
                                 -2 -



      that he had reached agreement with Kwik-Save that the vouchers
      could be put to use as a resource and distributed as individual
      Authorities wished.

71.   Arrangements for Visits.

      The Director circulated a note about links he hoped to establish             All to no
      with the Directors and staff of Sheffield and Nottingham Social
      Services Departments. The following suggested programme for
      activities associated with this was agreed, viz:-

                                  HELPLINE UPDATE

CO-ORDINATOR
I met with               - (ex.) Cheshire
                         -ex. Volunteer Co-ordinator
                         - Lancs. (Admin.)

on Tuesday, 25th April, 1989, to discuss how they might assist Helpline.
I have arranged to meet again with              who I think will
take on the rotas.

John Knight, I think, will offer other help and does have skills we
can use.

               is likely to offer help with clerical and admin, support
generally.

ROTAS

Further reductions are to be made to staffing and for out of hours
shifts, 3 people will be sufficient. It is still essential to
have 5 per shift for 9-1 p.m. and 1-5 p.m.

There is work for them in telephoning out referrals and other calls.
Given the Bank Holiday, I have drawn up Tuesday arid Wednesday rotas
for next week. The plan is when the new person takes over to do some
longer term planning. I apologise in advance for the short-term solution
once more and hope you can bear with me. We are hopeful of producing
a rota up to 13th May very shortly.

Mr. R. J. Lewis,
Secretary,
Association of Directors of
   Social Services,
Social services Division,
Town Hall,
Stockport, SKI 3XE.




Dear Bob,

     Just a note to follow up my letter of 18th April 1989 to all
Director colleagues. The offers of help and support have continued to
be forthcoming. I think I have managed to thank everybody personally,
but if there has been an oversight I hope people will understand the
reasons.

     The Department is now beginning to pursue some of the offers with a
view to accepting them. I ask you to assist me with maintaining contact
with colleagues and "oil the wheels" as we seek particular assistance.
Obviously we are hoping to draw on the resources within the North West
region; however, the Hillsborough tragedy has to be considered as a
national disaster and responded to also in that context.

     The Merseyside Authorities, Lancashire, Cheshire, the Regional
Health Authority, the Probation Service and many voluntary organisations
and individuals are working jointly in the response.    We are jointly
exploring the possibility of creating a Disaster Unit within, but separate
from, the Social Services Department, based in Liverpool.    It is envis­
aged that this would have a capacity to maintain a continuing 24 hour
helpline, co-ordinate and provide counselling both locally and nationally,
manage a drop-in and advice centre at Airfield, co-ordinate voluntary effort,
and maintain a computerised database to aid the tracking of individuals.
Additionally, the Unit could have public relations, training and finance
and administration functions.   Support and debriefing of counsellors
should be provided separately and independently.    BASW have generously
offered to co-ordinate and utilise all the offers of assistance that
have been received in this direction.


                                                                /contd..
     What I would want you and colleagues to be aware of* is that all
the aspects of the "Disaster Unit" described overleaf are currently being
provided from within the existing capacities of the agencies committed
to the joint arrangements.    None of us quite know how but all of these
services are very much operational at the moment with the exception of
finance.   Whilst, to date, money and resources have been available,
effectively this is being achieved through a combination of secondments,
staff goodwill and changing priorities plus instant decisions on spending.
Such arrangements cannot continue and it is the intention of the agencies,
to work towards permanence.

     For your specific information currently:   Wirral SSD are co­
ordinating training; Sefton SSD the voluntary organisations and Liverpool
SSD the database (with the assistance of Kent SSD) public relations and
general co-ordination.   All agencies are staffing the '*HelplineM.
Knowsley are managing transport and have hosted the four large-scale
training presentations as well as supporting the Liverpool public
relations effort which is itself massive.

     I      would be grateful if you would keep colleagues informed. I will
undertake to keep you up to date, and will give you a ring.   You could
share this letter with the professional press but I would appreciate no
comment to media other than that.   Handling the press has been a night­
mare to date.

     Thank you once again for your support and assistance.

                            Yours sincerely,




                       Director of Social Services

           The victims and survivors of Hillsborough came from many areas
      but most were from Merseyside, Lancashire and Cheshire.   The five Local
      Authorities of Merseyside, together with the two neighbouring County
      Authorities.have therefore adopted a joint approach to Helpline and
      counselling services, Advice and Drop-in Centres, information, publicity,
      public and press relations, finance and administration.

           Of course the full impact of the disaster on individual Local
      Authorities cannot yet be fully gauged, and their responses will become
      clear only as the problems present more clearly.   Some staffing needs,
      however, are already clear.

                As part of a regional initiative Liverpool Social Services
           Department is recruiting Training Officers to specialise in crisis
           psychology.

                The postholders will be engaged in training ventures across the
           North West; equipping the workforces in a number of agencies to
           cope both as helpers and as victims.

           Successful candidates will have a C.C.E.T.S.W. recognised qualification
           and may well have more specialised training or experience related to
           working in crisis situations.   Training will be made available to
           appointees.   In the first instance these posts will be subject to a
           one year fixed term contract (secondment arrangements may be nego­
           tiable for existing employees of North West local authorities).

     Lancashire, Sefton and Liverpool are all eager to recruit
experienced social workers to replace those who have been seconded into
Hillsborough Units.   In most cases appointments will be permanent with
the need to accept relocation within Authorities as and when Hillsborough
Units are wound down.   Further information and details of vacancies

                                            25th APRIL 1989

                        REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL SERVICES FOR LIVERPOOL




                                      THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER



              PURPOSE

              1.   To inform members of the services provided on a regional basis by
                   North West Social Services Authorities to the victims of the
                   Hillsborough disaster on 15th April 1989. Additionally to seek
                   financial support from N.W.A.S.S.A. for all publicity material and
                   staff training initiatives that can be made available across the
                   region. Finally to seek continuing support for the involved seven
                   Authorities to providing a long term service to victims.

              INTRODUCTION

              2.   Members will require no introduction to the scale of the disaster
                   that occurred at Hillsborough.   Whilst immediate priority has been
                   afforded to the bereaved families and the casualties; it is clear
                   that all those people attending, playing and officiating in the foot­
                   ball match, plus their circle of family and friends must be regarded
                   as victims.   The issue for the Authorities must ultimately be the
                   quality of life of the survivors and those closely associated. The
                   nature of the service needed must be regarded as preventive mental
                   health.

              3.   The epicentre of the tragedy will probably be revealed, when accurate
                   data emerges, as being Merseyside with adjoining parts of Lancashire
 Jbc-J-            and Cheshire.   However, the facts already available and the nature of
      rf^ O        the support for Liverpool F.C. dictate the Hillsborough disaster be
too                regarded as a national disaster. The response to the needs of the
                   victims must therefore also be viewed in that context.

              4.   It is for that reason that the seven Directors of Social Services
                   whose departments are involved, with the full support of their Councils,
                   have adopted a joint approach to the issues.   The services provided
                   across the region include a 24 hour Helpline, a co-ordinated approach
                   to counselling, a number of drop—in and advice centres and a co-ordinated
                   voluntary effort.   A similar approach has been taken to information,
                   publicity, public and press relations, database, training, finance and
                   administration.

              5.   To date finance has been made available.   However, members should be
                   aware that effectively the services provided have been achieved through
                   a combination of secondments, staff goodwill, free arrangements and
                   reorientation of priorities. Such arrangements cannot continue and it
                   is the intention of the seven Authorities, together with the Mersey
                   Regional Health Authority, the Probation Service and the Voluntary
                   Sector to work towards permanence.

ROLE OF N.W.A.S.S.A.

6.   It was realised soon after the disaster by both the seven Directors
     and the Professional Adviser to N.W.A.S.S.A. that the whole region
     would be affected in a number of ways. Firstly, that the members and
     officers of the Authorities most directly impacted on would require
     the support of regional colleagues.   The initiative of the Chair of
     N.W.A.S.S.A. and Ram Ramadhan in this direction are much appreciated.
     Secondly, that any publication produced as a consequence of the disaster
     could benefit the services across the region.   The Chair of N.W.A.S.S.A.
     (through his Professional Adviser) has already authorised the publica­
     tion of "Coping after Hillsborough" (copy attached).   Authority is now
     sought for further relevant publications (posters and leaflets) to be
     similarly regionally published (list is attached).   Thirdly, training
     directed at crisis intervention work and counselling could valuably be
     provided across member Authorities.   Those seven Authorities involved
     have already directly commissioned immediate staff and member training
     through a retained consultant.   For the longer term staff training
     needs it is suggested that N.W.A.S.S.A. should consider funding a
     Training Officer. If such an officer were recruited soon that person
     themselves could receive training from the consultant and continue with
     ongoing work.

CONCLUSION

7.   The seven Directors wish to acknowledge support already received from
     N.W.A.S.S.A. in meeting the needs of the victims of Hillsborough.
     This report seeks further long term support and highlights publication
     and training as areas where specific resources are requested and where
     regional benefit could be derived.

RECOMMENDED

8.   That the North West Association of Social Services Authorities:-

       i)     Note the contents of this report and recognise the long term
              support needs of the seven Authorities most directly involved
              and convert such support into appropriate practical assistance.

      ii)     Confirm the funding of the publication "Coping after Hillsborough"
              and authorise that the leaflet "Were you at the Match?", posters
              for schools and "Advice on How to Cope with a Crisis" be
              similarly published.

     iii)     Fund a Training Officer post (approximate cost £18,000 with
              on costs) to be based at an appropriate agency.

ATTACHED

9.    i)      Copy of "Coping after Hillsborough".

     ii)      List of publications with approximate cost per 1,000.

               The following publicity material has been produced for people

                      used after the Bradford City, Piper Alpha and Zeebrugge
                      disasters. The leaflet has been adapted for our use, and

                               HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

        Staff Meeting, Department of Psychiatry, Royal Liverpool Hospital


Staff were invited at short notice to discuss the implications for the work
of the Department of the disaster at Hillsborough, Sheffield, involving
Liverpool Football Club supporters.

Staff were informed of the action that had been taken. Responsibility for
co-ordinating the response to the disaster was being undertaken by Liverpool
Social Services Department. However, it was emphasised by visiting experts
from other disaster areas that there will be widespread implications for
the whole of Merseyside, indeed other regions; that very large numbers of
people may be effected, possibly a lar^ge proportion of those attending the
match, and that problems may surface for up to 3-4 years, if the Bradford
City experience is any guide. The problem in previous diasters was excesssive
zeal in the early phase, sometimes resulting in multiple visits to grieving
or distressed families. The central co-ordinating policy of Liverpool Social
Services aims to prevent this occuring.

After discussion it was considered that the following tasks were required
of this Department:

1   Co-ordination of Psychiatric SerciKe efforts within Liverpool and between
    Liverpool and other districts, and the gaining of information from experts
    in disaster situations. Dr        [has undertaken this responsibility.

2   Secondary Counselling of front line counsellors involved in fact to face
    (or telephone) contact with bereaved and distressed people, Organisation
    of this secondary counselling will be undertaken by Dr         and


3   Professional Advice to other organisations involved would be undertaken,
    when requested, by Professor

4   Medico-legal Assessment of people involved should be separate from their
    treatment and care. To this end a panel of Psychiatrists likely to be
    involved in assessment for compensation, will be set up. Consultants
    agreed to forgo fees which will be pooled into a fund for further research
    in this area. It is envisaged that a panel of Psychiatrists will be
    involved in formulating criteria for assessment and that legal reports
    may be jointly signed by the panel rather than by individual Psychiatrists
    to add weight and authority to these legal reports. Co-ordination of
    legal assessments will be undertaken by Dr Philpott.

    Joint Co-ordination both within the Mersey Regional Health Authority and
    between Health Authorities and Social Services initiatives will be undertaken
    by M r |        [
                    who has general responsibility overall for planning the
    response of the Department to this disaster.

6   Further Action For the time being the case presentation at 12.30 pm
    on Mondays in the Department of Psychiatry will be replaced by further
    discussions of the Department's response to this tragedy. Those interested
    and willing to provide some practical support should attend at 12.30
    - 2.00 each Monday. The need for continuing weekly lunch time,meetings
    will be made on a week to week basis and poster Ifopj^the^j^XsB'orough disaster

                  HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL


                    STATEMENT BY THE TRUSTEES



Our first wish is to express our heartfelt sympathy to all those
who were injured or bereaved, in the terrible disaster at
Hillsborough on Saturday last.

As trustees of the appeal we consider our overriding priority is
 to give speedy and practical effect to the widespread feelings of
.sympathy and support which are manifest in the many donations
.which have been reaching the fund even before the formal
 inception.  By last night £660,000 had been received in the Bank
 accounts set up in the three cities, and this was apart from the
 promised contribution of £500,000 from the Government and £25,000
 from each of the three cities.   The trustees are aware that many
more donations have already been pledged and that many fund
 raising activities are underway.

Immediate payments to relieve hardship have been made during this
week through the Social Service Departments of the Local
Authorities, and the trustees have agreed that they should take
responsibility for these, and will continue to meet these
immediate payments.  In particular, we have agreed to pay, if
requested, all funeral expenses. ‘ Again the process of dealing
with this has already been initiated by the Local Authorities and
we shall take these oh board.

As tp distribution of the bulk of the Fund, we have been
fortunate in having had the benefit of advice from those who ran
the Bradford Fire Disaster Fund so successfully. This has
enabled us at our first meeting this afternoon to take a number
of decisions on the principles which will guide our actions.
They are

1.   that we should pay out to the victims or their families
     as quickly as possible

2.   that as hardships have not been suffered equally, this
     should be reflected in the distribution policy

     made distributions nor how much any individual or
     category of persons had received

4.   that we should pay out lump sums rather than
     reqular income payments

5.   that we as trustees will not be able to meet all of the
     beneficiaries and therefore we should not meet any of
     them

6.   that the costs of administration should be kept to the
     minimum.


Apart from the immediate payments already referred to, it is our
hope and intention that we can make an initial payment to those
bereaved and to the injured within four weeks. Clearly we are
not aware of all those who have been injured and we would ask
anyone who considers that they may have a claim on the Fund to
write to the Trust Fund Manager, Hillsborough Disaster Appeal,
P 0 Box 220, Liverpool, L69 2PN.

Finally, we should like to express our sincere thanks to all
those who have already sent donations - many of which are
anonymous.

Individual acknowledgements will not be sent by the trustees
unless specifically requested.  The trustees are most grateful to
the many organisations, large and small, local, national and
international who are proposing to raise further funds for this
appeal.

                         - DISASTER -
                         - APPEAL —


                          PRESS STATEMENT



Following a meeting held in Liverpool on 17th April 1989 under
the auspices of Liverpool City Council and Liverpool Football
Club and attended by representatives of Sheffield City Council,
Nottinghamshire County Council and Nottingham City Council and
consultations with the Metropolitan Boroughs of Knowsley, St.
Helens, Sefton and Wirral, Trustees were appointed for the Fund
which is to help those injured or bereaved in the terrible
disaster at Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield on Saturday,
15th April 1989 and their families and dependants.

The Trustees   of the Fund are a past President of the Liverpool
Law Society,   the Chairman of the Liverpool Stock Exchange, the
President of   Sheffield Chamber of Commerce and the Chief
Executive of   Nottingham City Council.

It is anticipated that within the next few days the Trustees will
execute a Deed containing the detailed declaration of trust and
the administrative provisions regulating the Appeal Fund.

Donations may be made at any bank or building society for credit
to the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund at Barclays Bank, City
Office, Water Street, Liverpool L69 2EX Account Number 20565555,
sorting code 20-51-01, or at the Co-operative Bank, 84/86 West
Street, Sheffield Si 3EX Account Number 50000005, sorting code
08-90-75.

The Trustees will have a discretion how and to what extend to
benefit individuals and to determine who are to be regarded as
potential beneficiaries.

It has been decided to establish the Appeal as a discretionary
trust fund for the injured or bereaved and their families and
dependants rather than as a charity but the Trustees will hold on
separate trusts any part of the fund which they in their
discretion decide is not immediately required for the direct
benefit of the victims of the disaster and their relatives and
dependants.  Such separate trusts will be available to serve
community needs in ways which commemorate both the disaster and
the generosity of those who respond to this appeal;  but the most
urgent purpose of the appeal is to benefit the victims of the
disaster and their dependants.



Continued/
It is hoped that the Trustees will be able to make an early
distribution. As soon as the Deed has been executed a copy will
be available at the principal office of each of the Local
Authorities referred to above. Anyone who has contributed to the
appeal before reading this announcement may, if he or she feels
that it does not meet the purposes for which he or she has made a
contribution, apply to have the contribution refunded. Any such
application should be made to The Trustees at 290 India
Buildings, Liverpool L2 ONH (Ref. DHM) not later than 28th April
1989, after which date all contributions made will be irrevocably
part of the Appeal Fund.

The Trustees are confident that this Appeal does reflect the
generous and widespread public reaction to this terrible
disaster.

A further Statement will be issued in due course outlining the
procedures for persons wishing to make claims on the Fund.




Issued by the Trustees of The Hillsborough Appeal




Note   The formal signing of the Trust Deed will take place at
       the Town Hall, Liverpool at 4.30 p.m. on Friday,
       21st April.  This will be preceded by a Press
       briefing at 4.00 p.m.

LINKS WITH SHEFFIELD SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT




1.   Neil Kay is keen for a meeting later this week to look at collaboration
     between Sheffield and the seven authorities participating in work on
     Hillsborough.    I have tentatively suggested to him that we do this on
     Friday.   I would seek agreement from the Group for time to be made available
     for a joint meeting between this group and the Sheffield group.


2.   Briefing and visits to Service Centres so that Sheffield staff are aware
     of our action.


3.   Meeting between Neil Kay and Directors to review the position, to which I
     hope we may also be able to invite David White, Director of Social Services
     Nottinghamshire.


     The Chair of Sheffield Social Services Committee has already met the Chair
     of Liverpool Social Services Committee and I understand that the Chairs may
     also be getting together on Friday.


     I offer this as information given the views and attitude of some
     Politicians with whom we are working.

Dear Mr. Mason


Re: Hillsborough Disaster

Further to my telephone call to your office today, I have been asked by Brian
Edwards, our Regional General Manager, to express our admiration and thanks
for the tremendous contribution made by Social Workers following on the
Disaster.  I know that the work with patients, their friends and families will
continue for many months to come, but we just wanted to let you know how much
we appreciate all you have done.

I hesitate to add to your burdens at the present time but would like toinvite
you to contribute to the de-briefing process we are undertaking here at
Region.  Sadly we have not yet finished work on the de-briefing following on
the East Midlands Airport air crash, in undertaking that task we have found it
very helpful to have a written contribution from the Social Service
Departments involved to include in our report to the Department of Health and
to our Regional Health Authority; any recommendations which could contribute
to future emergency planning would be particularly valuable.

We will be making an immediate response to the Department by 26th April, if
you wanted to include any comment a phone call to my office (ext. 240) on
Monday or Tuesday would suffice.  We will be sending a written reply on 3rd
May 1989 and would be glad to include your comments in that report.

Again many thanks.

Yours sincerely,




Social Services Adviser.

    The meeting between Authorities and the Kent people
    responsible for the computer system will be set up as
    soon as possible.       A note concerning helpline calls
    being put into a database was circulated.

31. LMC/GP

    A note on the MRHA Senior Managers Training Day was
    circulated.   It was agreed that all enquiries requesting

                                                                           Note

33. Schools/Training Programme

    It was agreed that the establishment of educational                    D. Mason

                                - 2 -


    Ed Murphy to staff     the Helpline   for the Bank Holiday
    weekend.    The MRHA will approachNurses with experience
    of bereavement counselling etc, for assistance. An approach
    to   the Association of Directors       Social Services for
    assistance had been warmly received at a meeting today.
    The Director asked Authorities to consider whether any
    one of them could offer to second a person to take over
    the Helpline organisation role currently being undertaken
    by   Carole Wilkinson.     The Director then referred to
    his discussions with                 (Childline) which has
    resulted in an offer for a small group to travel to
    London on 24th April to gain experience of their expertise
    in this type of forward planning.       It was agreed that
    the offer be accepted and the group comprise Carole
    Wilkinson and the person seconded to co-ordinate this
    task in the future.      The meeting noted that a helpline
    telephone number for the West Lancs/Skelmersdale area
    had not been established, contrary to a suggestion that
    Radio Merseyside had possibly broadcast a number this
    morning.

36. Training

    Clarification was given that the elected members training
    seminar on 22nd April would be in two separate sessions.
    The training programme for social workers had been finalised
    and the module that was to take place over the Bank
    Holiday weekend is now to take place on 5th, 6th and
    7th June.    Two sessions on 22nd May have been arranged
    for the Voluntary Sector.      Arrangements have been made
    for members of the voluntary sector co-ordinating group
    to attend a seminar on 21st April (instead of in May).

37. Large North West Employers

    It was agreed that contact be made with the Merseyside              D. Mason
    Chamber of Commerce to pursue the establishment of counselling
    services for   workforce members affected by the    tragedy.
    It was also    agreed that the Chamber     be requested to
    make contact in this respect with other Chambers in
    both Lancashire and Cheshire.

38. Offers of Help

               is to provide a micro computer and  work in
    conjunction with the voluntary sector to establish a
    small group,  based in Johnson Street to sift   through
    offers of help and assistance received on the Helpline.

    The offer of the British Association of Social Workers              All to Note

40. Consultation

    It   was   agreed   that   all   Authorities   should   undertake
*   *   ♦



                                             - 3 -


                on-going   consultation     with their members'    trades union
                representatives     about   decisions concerning   the tragedy.

            41. Telephone Numbers

                The meeting reiterated the agreement that for the present         All to Note
                no other contact telephone numbers should be made available
                other than the Helpline numbers.

            42. Press

                The meeting noted the Director's statement to the press
                about the coverage of the tragedy by sections of the
                popular press and the decision to return bodies without
                clothing or personal effects.  An agreement had apparently
                been reached between television companies that funerals
                and other events would not be covered by more than one
                television   crew   (excepting  Memorial   Services  etc).
                The meeting endorsed the decision that if persons are
                invited to television/radio stations to recount their
                experiences,  support staff will be despatched to the
                station, whether invited or not, for counselling purposes.

            43. Voluntary Sector Co-ordinating Committee

                Pauline Farrell reported that the Co-ordinating Committee
                is scheduled to hold its next meeting on 25th April
                and that the detailed arrangments would be confirmed
                shortly.

            44. N.W.A.S.S.A.

                The Director reported that an Emergency Meeting of N.W.A.S.S.A.
                was to be held on 25th April at 11.30 a.m. in Huyton    to
                consider requests that it funds all publicity material
                and the Training Officer post, to be attached to the
                Regional Training Unit.      A request for other funding
                to be made available is also to be considered at the
                meeting.

     To consider the feasibility including costings of
establishing a regional unit in order to marshall and
organise the allocation of a variety of resources so that
help can be made available in the right place at the right
time to people affected by the "Hillsborough" disaster.   In
this context "Region" is the seven local authorities.

METHOD AND FORMAT

     A working party of senior staff, drawn from statutory
and voluntary agencies in the region was established to
report on the potential for an Assistance Unit built upon
the service structure created after "Hillsborough".  The
group was chaired by Howard Parker, Professor in Social Work
at the University of Manchester.

     The report uses the experience gained from the disaster
at "Hillsborough" and other recent tragedies, and sets out
recommendations for dealing with the organisational,
information and co-ordination issues which have arisen.
Specifically, this consists off a synopsis of the key
elements required to operate a service which is responsive
to need and has an outreach capability, including the
provision of a helpline, counselling, specialised work,
database, staff training/support and public relations.  All
of these elements are included within the broad aim as
stated above, and the role of the unit as perceived by the
group.

INTRODUCTION

     The events at "Hillsborough", Sheffield, on 15th April
1989, are a graphic illustration of the extensive damage to
personal well-being which can be precipitated by the trauma
of a major disaster.  This applies to those directly
involved, through injury or bereavement, their helpers,
onlookers, and people suffering shock due to publicity or
association with similar events.  The effects are often
long-term and can have a profound impact upon family life
and on individual ability to cope with everyday living.

     "Hillsborough" is the latest in a tragic line of
disasters.  Manchester Airport, Bradford, Piper Alpha,
Zeebrugge, Kegworth, Clapham and Lockerbie have all
illustrated how a major unexpected disaster affects the
lives of ordinary people and the agencies which must provide
them with assistance.  We have learnt a great deal from
these earlier tragedies, particularly how large scale
disasters produce trauma and grief much further and deeper
than common sense would expect.

                  appropriate local databases which are compatible with
                  the central system, to ensure speedy, reliable and
                  accurate information;

         (vii)    promotion of liaison and co-operation between all
                  relevant agencies in the regionJ

         (viii) review action already taken in other regions (e.g.
                Sheffield, Nottinghamshire).

         COUNSELLING SERVICES - CONTINUING REQUIREMENTS

10   .        It is clear from the information from previous
         disasters that continued access to practical and counselling
         services is required by some victims for a considerable time
         after the event.  It cannot be assumed that individuals
         needing help will be requesting or needing it now and
         arrangements must be made to ensure that help is accessible
         and readily available in the medium and long-term.

11   .        The extent of future service requirements is difficult
         to predict though some indications of the range of problems
         presented, the location of people needing help and the form
         of help they require should be available when data collected
         so far, has been analysed.  Some patterns of service
         requirements will be discernible and inform the detailed
         planning of provision.

12   .        Meanwhile it is possible to identify in broad terms the
         kinds of services that will be needed and the ways in which
         they may be provided.  A co-ordinated mix of centralised and
         local services from the statutory and voluntary sector is
         likely to provide the greatest flexibility in the use of
         resources;  such flexibility will be necessary given the
         difficulty of identifying the extent and type of need, and
         ensuring that deployment of resources is appropriate and
         a dequately monitored.

         Philosophy

13.           It is important to ensure that the service response
         meets with an overall philosophy agreed by the participating
         agencies.

                 For the consumer this will mean that:

         (i)       There are clear avenues for seeking help (locally and
                   regionally).

         (ii)      The response to their requests will be quick and
                   appropriate.




         HLAAAB
     However, some can be provided more effectively at a
Regional level, e.g.  Helpline, central information.  In
addition, some services can best be monitored, evaluated and
co-ordinated at a regional level.  A 'network' of specialist
skills can be developed by a regional unit.

     The Inter-Agency Planning Group recommends that a
co-ordinating body, known as the "Hillsborough Support U n i t 1*
be established for a minimum period of two years.  The Unit~
should have an executive officer/ and support staff;
operate the central Helpline;  set up an efficient database;
oversee the pattern of services to enable resources to be
used effectively;  see that districts provide systematic
support and training for all staff;  develop clear channels
of communication and form partnerships with all relevant
authorities and non-statutory agencies in the region; "set
up monitoring, evaluation and performance review systems.

     The lead authorities responsible for the Unit could be
represented through a Committee comprising local authority
members and officers* representatives of Mersey Regional
Health Authority, Merseyside Probation Service, Voluntary
Organisations, and the Disaster Trust Fund.

Suggested ’Regional Services'

     The services outlined below will need to be linked to
each other through the proposed Regional Unit.

HELPLINE

     This service currently operates on a 24 hour day, 7 day
week basis and is staffed by officers of the Social Services
Departments and a variety of other organisations.  Given the
nationwide 'catchment' of potential users of the service it
will be cost-efficient to retain this centralised service at
its current level for a period of weeks to come and will
ensure a ready access point for assistance while medium to
longer term arrangements are effected.  It is envisaged that
the Helpline will become a national 'one number' service run
by the regional unit with calls then referred to local
services as appropriate.

Co-ordination of Counselling Services

     Whilst counselling will usually be offered very
'locally' it will be necessary to ensure that individuals
are referred to the most appropriate agency; that their
needs are met, and the services are monitored.  In addition




HLAAAB
1.   Provide a central telephone line, e.g. an 0800
     (freephone) number;

2.   Provide an assessment and referral service, whereby
     people are re-referred to Local Advice Services;

3.   Co-ordinate referrals both from within and without the
     region;

4.   Provide oversight of the different elements of
     specialist services, e.g. psychologists etc.

5.   Identify key events and anniversaries which may effect
     individuals and consequently service provision (e.g.
     Inquests, future football games).

     Thus the differing needs of people will be identified
and the appropriate resources matched up to meet those
needs:  this will avoid duplication of effort and create a
more efficient use of resources.

DATABASE REQUIREMENTS

     The unit will require a database capable of recording
information fed through to the 'helpline', 'drop.in' centres
and other source points.  The majority of contacts will be
within two broad categories, i.e. either requesting
assistance or offering help.  Currently the 'Hillsborough
Helpline' has separate systems dealing with these two
elements.  At present, nearly 3,600 offers of help have been
received from a variety of sources, including over 600
through the 'Hillsborough Helpline'.   About 1,650 requests
for help have been received nationally, the majority of
these being through the 'Hillsborough Helpline'.   With this
level of activity occuring, it is clear that an effective
database is essential to matching needs for assistance with
the wide range of resources available.

     In respect of referrals for help, a manual database was
established as a record of callers, pending the setting up
of the computerised system'. It is suggested that this be
retained and maintained as a back up in case of problems
with the system.

      Information which is useful for the database, includes
basic details such as names, addresses, local authority of
origin, referral to district and agency, general
practitioners, significant dates, (birthdays, anniversaries
etc).   Each person has an individual reference number, and
there is a facility for a group reference for people linked
together.




HLAAAB
(ii)   Public Relations is heavily dependent on hard, factual
       and accurate information about the work of the unit.
       There will, therefore, need to be direct links between
       the management and the public relations functions of
       the unit.

(iii) Media interest can sometimes be aggressive and
      time-consuming.  This can be wasteful at best and
      damaging at worst.  Thus contact with the media needs
      to be carefully channelled and regulated separating
      local and regional issues.

     It is suggested that Public relations can best be
undertaken by the Head of the Unit along with substantial
support from the Management Committee.

COSTINGS

     Since "Hillsborough" is a national disaster, it is
recommended that strenuous efforts are made to obtain the
funding of the Unit from central government, the EEC and
other sources.  Costs are estimated at around £350,000 per
year for two years.  This may be generous or alternatively
additional resources may need to be added on.

CONCLUSION

     The advantages of co-ordinating all helping responses
seem clear.  It is believed that a Regional Unit would, in
the long run, be cost effective and more importantly would
introduce a whole series, of supports and checks which would
mean a better service for those who need it, including the
carers.

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER

I spoke with you about my writing to Directors of Social Services
in Merseyside along the lines suggested by Mr B D Harrison in his
minute to me of 27 April.

2.  I am happy to do this but need to know that it will not
conflict with any other actions or communications by Ministers or
senior officials.

3.  There are seven social services departments involved.  I
attach a draft of a letter to the Director of Social Services for
Liverpool, who has been most heavily engaged.  I will scale this
down for the others.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


      As regards Sandwell's contribution,                           took seven social
      workers, trained in disaster counselling, up to Liverpool on 24.4.89 to
      set up a counselling service for staff.             This is a BASW initiative,
      instigated by Serge Paul in his capacity as Chairman, to be co-ordinated
      by                    who chairs the BASW group on counselling.   This service is
      s c h e d u l e d t o run for six months, but the Sandwell social workers will
      only try for two weeks to set the service up.               According to        ,
      Liverpool D S S , David Mason, was very appreciative of this offer of
      support, because of the well attested need for support systems outside
      line management.

      On the basis of her training,       |sets great store by Michael Stewart
      (formerly Bradford SSD), now of Centre for Crisis Psychology who is
      currently  spearheading  the training    in Liverpool, David Mason is
      apparently pressing to set up a national disaster team, but Michael is
      cautioning of the need to co-ordinate initiatives in this direction;
      Cruse, Bradford and now Liverpool.   From her brief visit to Liverpool,
      she was aware of the rivalries and jealousies that have surfaced in the
      wake of the disaster, despite the fact of the Merseyside co-ordinating
      group, now meeting every other day.

      In terms of Maire Gibson's memo,             could not          offer   any   other
      suggestions of reference points for Professor Parker.

    NOTE FOR FILE


    HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
    TRAWL OF SSDs FOR EXPERIENCE OF OVERTIME PAYMENTS

    1.   Requested information from Y & H Region                 re   Bradford
         experience. See minute from J Kennedy.

    2.   Requested    information   from      East      M i d lands   Region re
         Nottingham and Leicester.                               rang with the
         following information.     T h e r e s p o n s e o T the authorities
         reflected    their management        style and the morate- and
         relationships within the authorities. Nottingham in a quiet
         and civilised way decided it was appropriate to offer 3
         extra days leave during the current leave year.               There was
         agreement by members, management and unions.               It was given
         to all staff in the hospital social work department, those
         who were involved in the tragedy and those who covered for
         their absent colleagues.     Everybody was content with that
         arrangement. 3 Leicester, where moral is low and there is
         much bickering and unhappiness, no staff considered seeking
         monitory payment.   However, the police began bragging about
         the overtime and the extra holidays they would be financing
         as a result.   The SSD therefore attempted to be consistent^

         ^They could not pay an hourly rate of overtime but suggested
          an honorarium of £250 per head.     This was tabled at the
          Social Services Committee and there was a split on party
          political lines, Labour and Alliance for this proposal, the
          Tory response "insult to the dead” wrong to pay social
         workers when other public and voluntary organisations had
          offered voluntary help.    The matter was referred to the
          Personnel Committee and the compromise was a £100 honorarium
          to be offered. All staff were very aggrieved by the outcome
          and insisted that negotiations should be started to cover
          any future need for emergency action.        The honorarium
         payments were made to social workers, senior social workers
          and principal assistants, both for the current disaster and
          any future need.   It was agreed that at divisional manager
          level or above no payment was appropriate on the grounds
         that it was the expectation of people in this position to
         work the hours that were necessary to do the job.

    4.   Christine understood Kent had followed the same approach as
         Nottingham.   The Nottingham offer was made to staff as a
         token of the Department’s recognition of their help.

NOTE FOR REGIONAL FILE



LIVERPOOL F.C. DISASTER   (25 APRIL 1989)


1.    Received telephone call from Brian Harrison (ACI, North Western Region).
      Liverpool authorities interested to know Bradford's experience, after the
      fire, if payment for staff overtime had become an issue. No claims so far
      in Liverpool; everything being done on a voluntary basis to date, but the
      authorities wanted to be prepared.

2.    Spoke to I             He said the issue had not really come up in Bradford,
      flost work had been done by part-timers who were simply paid for extra hours
      worked (after the initial rush when massive numbers of homes were worked
      without any reward). Full-time staff were able to claim TOIL as for normal
      duties. He did mention that Leicestershire had approached him at the time
      of the 111 crash because staff had raised the possibility of extra payment
      because of the unusual or additional nature of their duties,
      advised that his line had been that this fell within the normal
      requirements for qualified social workers.

3.    Relayed this information to Mr Harrison.

Since the Hillsborough Disaster on Saturday 15th April the vork load
for Social Workers and other professional colleagues has increased
enormously. Many of you will have had direct or indirect experience
of the trauma caused by this disaster and many of you will have
counselled and will continue to counsel people who have been touched
by this tragedy.

Both the British Association of Social Workers and your colleagues up
and down the country beeame aware 'that this work is demanding of yourselves
and you in turn may want the opportunity to talk to someone.

Consequently STAFFLINE has been set up which will provide a confidential
service to yourselves by Social Workers trained in staff support from
outside the immediate area. Initially it has been set up with the
direction of Simon Cole CSS Dip.Coun. from the Royal School for the Blind,
Leatherhead and assisting him will be seven Social Workers from Sandwell
Social Services. The latter have been trained as members of a
departmental support group.

STAFFLINE will initially be open weekdays from 11.00.a.m. - 7.00.p.m. with
an answering machine outside of these hours. Arrangements can be made to
see you by appointment at one of the counselling centres and there will
also be an opportunity -to meet STAFFLINE Staff at the HELPLINE and
ADVICE Centres at the end of key shifts.

Please do not hesitate to use STAFFLINE if things get difficult;   it is there
to help you.

1.   You agreed it would be appropriate for you to write to the
     Directors of the 7 Merseyside authorities who have co­
     ordinated so effectively the services to offer support to
     the bereaved families, those involved in the tragedy and
     those affected by it.

2.   The Directors involved are:

     Mr  David Mason,     Liverpool  (Liverpool Social Services
     Department, 26 Hatton Garden, Liverpool L3 2AW). He has co­
     ordinated all the services and has shown outstanding
     leadership and a full appreciation of the scale .and
     implications of the disaster.     He has co-ordinated with
     great effect the range of statutory and voluntary services
     and created an organisation which can handle the 1600 calls
     to the Helpline and the 3600 offers of help to date.

     Pauline Farrell, Sefton (Sefton Social Services Department,
     Burlington House, Crosby Road North, Liverpool L22 OPF) has
     been a reliable and supportive colleague who has taken
     responsibility  for co-ordinating the support from the
     voluntary sector (over 70 organisations).

     Other directors:

     David Rickard, Wirral
     Wirral Social Services Department, Social Services Centre,
     Cleveland Street, Birkenhead, Merseyside L43 6BL.

     Tom Foster, Lancashire
     Lancashire Social Services Department, Council Offices
     Park Hotel, East Cliff County Offices, Preston, Lancs

     Tim Brown, Director of Personal Services, St Helens
     St Helens Personal Services Department, Century House,
     Hardshaw Street, St Helens, Merseyside WA10 1RN

     Neil Singleton, Cheshire
     Cheshire Social Services Department, Commerce House,
     Hunter Street, Chester CHI 1SR

             Miss Catherine Briscoe, Knowsley
             Knowsley Social Services Department, Council Offices,
             Archway Road, Huyton, Liverpool L36 9UX - kept in touch
             although on holiday in US.


       3.    All have made staff available to undertake specific tasks
             and attend the regular Inter-Agency co-ordinating meetings
             (daily last week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday this week).

       4.    The staff of all Departments have been unstinting in their
             help and support, either directly involved or providing back
                 |        ;                                  -■
             up for normal work.

       5.    There is s&me feeling that less recognition has been
             forthcoming - for the work in Merseyside which is co­
             ordinating a national service and there have been adverse
             comments oh the fact that no Government Minister has visited
             the area to commend and acknowledge the remarkable way in
             which Service! have be&n organised and provided by the 7
             social services authorities working jointly together with
             Probation, the’ health authorities and the voluntary sector.

                       After a full and detailed discussion, it was noted that -

                        (a)        the cost of the Unit had been estimated at approximately
                                   £340,000 per annum which could be shared between Authorities,
                                   based on population and impact of the disaster, somewhere
                                   between the range of £40-60,000 each. This cost assumes one
                                   Authority acting as host(for secretarial e t c ,   support),
                                   although such costs~~could well be absorbed within the overall
                                   figure if necessary;      I.

                        (b)        the Unit had an anticipated life span of 2 years which could
                                   be trimmed or added to based upon experience;

                        (c)        the view that the Unit provide an independent counselling
                                   service had the support of this i&eetxng;


                        (d)            further consideration is to be given to the manner in which
                                       the presentation >« to be made to the meeting of Politicians
                                       on 29th April, and the alternative options for funding -

                                       and Civil Defence Authority etc. - is to be considered further
                                       at the meetin^xof Directors of Social Services on 28th April:

                            (ej        the appointment of a Researcher could be pursued as a &epar&*e
                                       application for funding; and

                            (f)        the,droD-in centre could be funded independently but on
                                       match days, the centre be utilised as a Regional resource,
                                       funded by the Unit,

HILLSBOROUGH   FOOTBALL   DISASTER


1.    I have circulated you minute of 21 April, but d<v not think that the West
       Midlands has suffered any major disaster recently.     Consequently it is
       unlikely that we will be able to provide you with any helpful namfes or
       information.  I am aware that some staff have been trained to deal with the
       aftermath of disasters but that is about the sum total of the relevant
       information known to me-   If colleagues come up with anything else, I will
      write to you again.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


1.    Spoke to Mr Utting about the need for funding.   I was able to assure him
       that CS were in the picture about this and he reaffirmed that it was
       likely to be DOE who could respond.

2.    I expressed the concern of Merseyside that there had not been any visit
      by a member of the Government to Merseyside.   I asked if he would be
      prepared to ring David Mason to express his appreciation at the efforts
      which were being made.   He felt that it would be more appropriate to
      write and he had in fact been thinking of doing this. He asked for a
      list of people to whom letters should be sent and any briefing on
       content. He asked for the minute to be copied to Division and
               RL who is co-ordinating the briefing for Ministers.

                                                                              /

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


1.     After trying for some days to make contact with I              Head of
       Merseyside Task Force, I spoke to his deputy M   r   |  I    briefed him
       on the actions taken by the Merseyside authorities and the fact that
       there would be an application for central funding to cover the very
       substantial costs.  I advised him that the authorities are currently
       costing the services being provided and would be in a position to give us
       details by early in the week beginning 2 May. He was not at all sure how
       his department would respond but hoped that funding might be possible
       through RSG adjustment.  He would put some enquiries underway.

2.    I expressed concern that there had been no central Government visit to
      Merseyside following the disaster.   He drew attention to the fact that
       there would be a Government presence at the memorial service.  I said
      that would not substitute for the need for Government Ministers to be /
      associated with, and identifying with the Mersey people and the services
      which were being organised to support them.   This he acknowledged.

3.    We arranged to meet at 5.00pm on 8 May in Warwickgate House when
      hopefully we should have a copy of the costings estimate and he will have
      got some reaction to his soundings about funding.   He undertook to keep
      David Bradley informed.

    fc ? s r     HERE was the horror to surpass all other         The major public inquiry that is
                 sporting horrors — death in slow motion       promised — the Home Secretary will
                 as football supporters were crushed           announce details to MPs today — must
n                against metal fencing or suffocated           concentrate on ways of extirpating the
                 beneath a tidal wave of bodies. The           hooligan element from the game. There
                 carnage was recorded by unblinking TV         must be a divorce absolute between
                 cameras, witnessed by horrified spec­         soccer and violence. U ntil th is is
                 tators only yards away from the catas­        achieved, no membership schemes, no
                 trophe and seen at first hand by              dismantling of fences and no review of
                 distraught police officers who tugged         policing methods will succeed in mini­
                 uselessly at fencing with their bare          mising the hazards attendant upon
                 hands. Rarely has a major disaster            watching football matches.
                 revealed itself with such measured and           This is not to call forlornly for great
                 unhurried venom.                              changes in human nature. Rather, it is to
                   Never again must we witness such            demand fundamental changes in the
                 heart-breaking tragedy. Promises of this      way the football industry conducts
                kind have been made before: after the          itself and changes in the game’s self-per-
                Ibrox disaster in 1971, after the Bradford     ception. No more should the soccer clubs
                Ore and the Heysel riot in 1985. Then as      be permitted to display their wares in
                now, grief was scored with anger that          such shabby and sordid surroundings.
                such an innocuous pastime as watching         No more should supporters be treated at
                a game of football could lead to              best as cattle and at worst as rabid
                numerous deaths and injuries. This time       dogs.
                the promises must be honoured. Too
                many victims have been sacrificed to              Police attitudes must also change. The
                this uncaring sport, too many lives           present methods for dealing with large
                ruined beyond recall. “Never again”           soccer crowds have evolved in response
                must become a sacred pledge to which          to the hooligan problem. Yet who can
                governments, officials, football, clubs,      doubt that by insisting on segregation in
                players and supporters are comprehensi­       and around grounds, by herding fans
                vely committed.                               into metal cages, by force-marching

Describes   the problems encountered by duty social workers in trying
to access    the appropriate DHSS officer out of office hours.      The
author   describes   how volunteer DHSS officers can be found, and ways
of   helping various clients out of their problems when a DHSS officer
cannot   be  located.   He argues  for better relationships and better
organisation between social workers and DHSS officers, and suggests
that   it might    be simpler  for  the DHSS   to pay social workers to
provide an out of hours service for them.

pl9-21.

Examines   the work of    the Birmingham emergency fostering team which
was  set up nearly ten years ago and now has the exclusive use of two
foster   homes.  Looks at   the administrative advantages of having a
foster   home available at all     times,  and discusses the pressures
placed on    foster parents who,    in one of the homes, have cared for
over   100 children   in less than 18 months.  The views of two of them
are presented.

P71-84.

There   has   been a significant shift in the populations seeking social
services.    Recent budget cutbacks are creating new service populations
such as     the homeless,   hungry,  and ex-mental patients, whose daily
survial   is at    risk. Presently, social services are not organized or
funded   to meet the needs of these populations. Therefore, an array of
new and     independent services need to be created which are capable of
addressing    the desperate circumstances of these citizens.    Cites 13

The  Leeds  Emergency Duty Team were included in a series of visits to
'Out   of  hours'    arrangements by Social    Services Departments    in
Yorkshire  and Humberside     (9 out of 11 authorities).   In Leeds, the
EDT   provided    a    valuable and valued    service.  It was   clearly
understood  that    their  function was   to provide emergency cover to
supplement  the mainstream and was not intended to be a full 24-hour
service.   Improvements     were being considered    to provide   better
technological   assistance,   monitoring and supervision, but retaining
the    existing     flexibility   of   response.   [Author   absstract].

wardens'    duties;   changes of occupancy;     wardens'  equipment   and
uniforms;   establishments   and conditions of service; shift patterns;
operations;   review of systems used by authorities taking part in the
survey;   and  response of other     services when called    upon   in an
emergency   by wardens.    Appendices include a tenant's handbook issued
by the Borough of Sunderland.

The   p sy cho lo gic al    effects of disaster are examined with reference to
the     loss     of    the    Herald   of   Free   Enterprise     at    Zeebrugge.     The

This      art icl e    describes     an    initiative      formulated     by    Bradfo rd         Social
Se rvi ce s    as    a   response     to     the   Bradford    fire    disaster, and research
w h i ch    shows       that     victims       of     disasters    often     suffer        long      term
emo tio na l      and      psycholog ica l       disturbance.      The      Bradf ord         football
s ta di um     fire      provid ed      a     real     example    of   this.      A     need      for    a
pre ve nt at iv e      strategy      was      developed,     wher eby   the     social        servic es
could       offer       help    and   advice      in a     supportive     manner.         The     scheme
offer ed      immediate      help,    rather      than   waiti ng for help to be requested.
    Thi s   has     not    absorbed     more     resources,    as    the offer of help was in
some      cases     alone    sufficient.       Social    worke rs    provi ded      a     var ie ty    of
help,       support        and    counselling.         Victims    requested       to      meet     other
peo ple     in    similar      circumstances,        which   resulted     in    the for mation of
two       berea vem ent      groups.       It    was   found   that    bereaved         families       of
chi ld re n     suffered        the   most,      and   required    long     term      help.       Social
service       staff     at   hospital      casualty     depart men ts   were      involved at the
outset,        as      they    were   in     immediate     contact    with     victims.         V ar iou s
support        schemes,        like     those      provided     by    the    Link       Centre,       are
described.          Leaflets      and      a     telephone    hotline     p ro vi ded      ad di ti on al
information.         The    scheme's      success     depended    upon    good      c o m mu ni ca ti on s
and       support       betwe en    the    welfare     groups.    Four    re ce mm end at ion s       for

After     the     Bradford      City   football     stand    fire   in 1985 many of the
su rvivors      and    relatives      of    victims   were    reluctant    to accept the
stigma      as so cia te d   wit h turning to the social services department for
help.     This article marks the ending of one means by which such people
were     able     to share their ex periences and seek a form of a ss ist an ce -
the    news let te r      'City   Link'. The idea for the newsletter came from a
social        worker,      but   the   two    social    workers    on  the   (anonymous)
ed ito ri al      board      were    outnumb ere d   by   10   survivors.    The  author
des cr i be s   the    feelings of the editors that the new sletter had served
its    pur pos e    and     the   ending     of  it was a positive one as survivors
emer ged      from    a period as 'disaster victims' to resume a normal life.
He   goes      on to suggest that elements of the 'City Link' project could
be   a    model     for other forms of p ar tn ers hip between pro fe ss io na ls and
their     clie nts     :    (i)   the    pr ofessionals have certa in key knowledge;
(ii)     they     have access to key resources; (iii) the clients know their
own      needs      best;       and    (iv)     they     have     personal    resources.

After     the      capsize    of     the    'Herald    of Free Enterprise' Kent Social
Servic es      Dep artment       set    up the    Herald Assis tan ce Unit. The author
des cr i be s    the    work     of    the 'away team'      with survivors and bereav ed
pe opl e    throughout       the     country.     In   the   case   of  survivors of the
disaster,        a   letter was sent enclosing a leaflet 'Coping with a major
crisis'.       Ad op tin g a 'proactive' approach, the team then sent a second
letter      to     survivors      an nouncing     the date that a visit would be made
un les s    the     survivor      replied     that    no   visit   was  wanted. With the
bereaved,        much    of    the    team's    work     arose   from  the   pr ese nc e of
re lat iv es     at    the   inquests       which    were   held seven months after the
disaster.        The    article      ends by de scribing the arr an gem ent s the team
made     for     their     own emotional      support.       An   outside cons ul tan t was
bro ugh t     in    to   assist      the    team when it came to the end of its work
three         weeks        after        the     annive rsa ry      of    the     disaster.

The    author,          who   writes      from experience after the Bradford football

right       of    privacy;      the  requirement   for   'debriefing'    of    support
workers;       the    recog nit ion   that the emotional effects of the disaster
on    sur vivors      are    likely   to  last   a  long   time;   the tendency for
su rvi vo r s    to wi t hd ra w into isolation; the benefit which survivors can
de riv e    from    sharing experiences, after an initial rel uctance to join

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

In a quick response to your note of 21 April, I am enclosing a copy of
the minute prepared by Bill  Riddell on the Nottingham end of this
disaster.  Clearly one of the issues is to get in place fairly rapid
co-ordination of the agencies, particularly where more than one
authority is involved.

In terms of lessons learned from other disasters, a more recent
incident in this region was of course the Ml air crash.  Social work
support was organised very quickly, both at the East Midlands Airport
and at the 3 major hospitals receiving casualties.

I enclose a helpful summary on the Ml disaster prepared by Brian
Waller, Director of Social Services for Leicestershire.

It is fair to say that SSI is still learning from these events and
perhaps it would be helpful if some of the existing material could be
brought together under one of the Core Groups - General Policy appears
to be the best candidate.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - NOTTINGHAM HELPLINE

Nottinghamshire SSD in conjunction with Nottingham Forest Football Club set up a
helpline on the Wednesday morning following the tragedy to take both telephone
calls and personal calls at the ground.   The social work team headed by David
Witham, Group Principal Social Worker at the Queens Medical Centre is based in
one of the executive suites at the Nottingham Forest City Ground and is avail­
able from 9.00am - 8.00pm.

The working day is split into three shifts with three social workers an each
shift and good administrative support.   The helpline will remain open through­
out the weekend and there will be a review of the situation on Monday as to
whether there is a need to continue the service or to what degree.   From
Wednesday morning to Friday afternoon the helpline had received over 200 tele­
phone calls or personal calls and social workers have served to filter many
referrals through a well organised network in conjunction with the independent
sector, so that counselling services are available through the Nottingham
Counselling Centre, Relate and the Samaritans.

David Witham headed up the. social work support service following the Ml/Keaworth
air disaster and the experience from that disaster has given knowledge of what
not to do and what works.    The counselling service and helpline in this situa­
tion is much different from the airline disaster but just as there were intense
states of distress, one week to the minute after the air crash so the team is
standing by in readiness for people having a reaction on Saturday afternoon
shortly after the 3.00pm kick off.    On Sunday night at 6.30pm in one of the
city centre churches there is a memorial service when a dozen people, many of
whom are connected by the chaplaincy at the QMC will be in attendance to assist
anyone in distress.   Over 2,000 copies of the standard major disaster leaflet
which has been personalised and individualised for the present situation have
been distributed so far.

Since David Witham personally knows the two group hospital principal social
workers in the Sheffield hospitals he made early contact with them to share with
them the experiences of social work teams and helpers following the Kegworth
disaster.   He is aware that           Ls coordinating a similar exercise from
the Children's Hospital in Liverpool but there has not been any formal link up
between Sheffield, Nottingham and Liverpool.    David believes that it will be
important for the three coordinators to get together to share lessons learned,
just as the coordinators from Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and
Northern Ireland did following the air disaster on the Ml.    He is very much
aware of how the helpers easily become consumed by the emotions of the people
who were helped at Kegworth but acknowledges that the brunt of that heavy
emotion is more located in Liverpool, to a lesser degree at Sheffield and ■
perhaps even less in Nottingham.

   Dear Brian,

   Ml AIR CRASH

   I thought you would be interested in what had happened in Leicester­
   shire since the air accident on 8th January.

   To inform my members I have had a report prepared and I enclose a
   copy of this for your information. There has been relatively little
   national media interest despite our press releases. I suspect that
   this may be partly because no Leicestershire people were injured or
   killed and our work is not as on-going as in some other disasters and
   partly because of the many competing stories as to the cause of the
   accident. The Committee report makes it clear I hope that social
   work involvement was very considerable indeed and extended over a
   relatively long period of time.

   I hope this is helpful - please let me know if we need to discuss
   further.

   Best wishes.

   Yours sincerely,




   BRIAN WALLER

Leicestershire Social Services Department social workers are working with
relatives and survivors of the crash to help them start the long process
of coping with the emotional trauma of the accident.

Since the early hours of the 9th January, social work teams at East
Midlands Airport and at Leicester Royal. Infirmary have been providing a
round the clock service to counsel and.support relatives and survivors.
Working closely with the Police and hospital and airport staff more than
30 experienced social workers have been giving help and advice to many
of the relatives who have travelled to Leicestershire to identify the
dead or to see survivors in hospital. The job, itself stressful, has
involved giving.advice on a range of practical matters as well as providing
skilled counselling to people in extreme emotional crisis. Where
immediate financial help is needed the Chairman of the County Council has
agreed that social workers can assist in any way necessary.

Social Services Director,      Brian Waller, says

       'The departments social workers are providing an extremely
       valuable service to .relatives faced with the most harrowing        ■■
       of situations. I hope that through this skilled counselling
       relatives and other people who have asked for help might be
       able to cope better with overwhelming personal stress.1

As details are released about the deceased, social workers^ will link
up with Social Services Departments in other parts of the country so
that continuing help can be offered to relatives and survivors on return
to their homes.

Note: Experience from other tragedies has shown that without support
      and counselling survivors and relatives can be severely
      psychologically damaged and the Social Services Department is
      trying to ensure that any such damage is minimised.

                     REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL SERVICES

                              East Midlands Air Crash


Introduction

1.   Members will all have been shocked and deeply saddened by the air crash
     which occurred on the M1 near Kegworth on Sunday 8th January. Forty four
     people lost their lives and 80 received injuries, many of which are very
     serious. On these occasions the emergency services — fire, police,
     ambulance and medical units - all perform with remarkable speed,
     efficiency and care. Their intervention cannot be overestimated and
     everyone rightly acclaims their expertise and commitment. What is less
     well known is the part played by the staff from this Department in such
     disasters and this brief report offers some indication of the nature of
     help provided by social workers when tragedies occur, together with an
     outline (Appendix 'A') of our involvement from the time the M1 disaster
     happened.

Coping with crises

2.   The experience of people faced with terrible events is always personal
     and deeply disturbing but those involved either as casualties, relatives,
     witnesses or other local people can be helped by being given time and an
     opportunity to talk about their feelings; their fears; their anxieties;
     their sense of helplessness; their guilt and their anger.

3.   Social work in these circumstances is unobtrusive, it shares the pain and
      offers quiet listening and reassurance. This helps to overcome the
      enormous shock, the numbness and extreme stress experienced by people
      involved and begins the "healing" process. Repressing emotions and
      denying the effects of the event can lead to future psychological and
     physical problems.    Relief is found through emotional support and the
      simple explanation that their thoughts and feelings are not abnormal and
      that others have reacted in the same way in similar circumstances..

4.   Social work counselling is becoming increasingly recognised as a valuable
     part in the process of helping people to come to terms with major
      crises. However, whilst counselling is the most important skill required
     on these occasions it is not the only form of support provided by social
     workers. They also offer assistance in practical ways by maintaining
      links with friends and relatives, by arranging transport, by liaising-
     with other services and by organising volunteers and other forms of
      support.  People also need help in confronting the horrible reality of
     their experience and social workers can assist in this process by
     arranging for attendance at funerals, accompanying people who wish to
     visit the scene, helping to gather together belongings and preparing
     people who may need to identify severely injured or dead relatives and
     friends.
                                          2


5.      These supports are of most importance during the initial period of great
        distress following the event but continued counselling and more prolonged
        practical help will often be required. Following up individual problems
        ensures that local networks of support are established and that
        advice/guidance is given on how to return to "normal" - without raising
        expectations that the experience will be wholly forgotten. Sometimes
        many weeks or months pass before the shock finally emerges and local
        access to help is yet another facility which must be readily available to
        those most heavily affected.

After the event

6.      During both the initial period and then in relation to more prolonged
        requirements, highest priority is given to the needs of'the people most
        directly affected and the level of stress on social workers must be
        acknowledged. In the normal course of their work social workers are
        responsible for dealing with personal distress and serious social
        problems but immediate involvement in major tragedies draws heavily on
        the reserves of staff and stress levels reach extraordinary proportions.
        Whilst remaining calm and reassuring staff will be helping people in
        utter despair. The effects of this type of work are cumulative and
        should be recognised and acknowledged in a positive way by immediate
        colleagues (many of whom will have been covering during the crisis and
        endeavouring to cope with the backlog of normal day to day work), senior
        managers and others. The commitment of these staff cannot be taken for
        granted and, some time after the event, some social workers will need
        independent advice as well as an opportunity to discuss their experiences
        through "de-briefing" and other forms of group discussions. Whilst they
        will steadily return to normal work the Department, as a whole, must be
        prepared not only to learn from their experiences in preparation for
        possible future disasters but also be alert for signs that personal help
        may be needed.

Summary

7.      This report is not intended to over-emphasise the part played by social
        workers in the M1 air crash.  It is nevertheless important that their
        contribution be understood and acknowledged. Appendix 'A' attached
        illustrates in very brief terms the growing level of involvement of staff
        from the Department during the days following the disaster. This process
        is continuing and messages of gratitude and praise received from
        individuals and agencies reflect appropriate credit on the tireless way
        in which social workers and other staff from this Department responded.

Equal Opportunities Implications

8.      None.

Recommendation

9.      That the report be received.

Background papers

None.

                       Outline of Social Services involvement




Jan. 8th    Immediately following the announcement of the crash, at about 10
             p.m. liaison was established between the Department's Emergency
            Team, Divisional Managers for Leics. North West, Health Service and
             Senior Managers.  Police HQ were contacted and provided with
             information on the availability of help. Liaison was also
             established with North West Leics. District Council and the Social
            Work Department at Leicester Royal Infirmary opened in response to
             the needs of casualties, relatives and friends already arriving at
             the hospital.

     9th    At 6 a.m. Leicestershire Police requested social work assistance at
             East Midland Airport and the Department's Emergency Social Work
     a.m.   Team immediately attended the scene to work alongside other
             emergency services. Help was needed in interviewing relatives who
            were required to identify the deceased. During the morning further
             social work staff from Leics. North West Division and the Health
             Care Division joined the Team already working at Castle Donington.

              Throughout this period liaison was maintained between the
              Divisional Managers and social workers based at the scene and at
              Leicester Royal Infirmary (those being admitted to the hospital
              being described as generally very severely injured being the last
              to be evacuated from the wreckage).  In support of the staff
            • dealing directly with casualties other staff stepped in to cover
              their normal day to day work.

             At an urgent meeting at 9.30 a.m.involving the Director, Deputy
             Director and two Divisional Managers further arrangements were
             made, with the Divisional Manager for Leics. North West being asked
             to co-ordinate the overall response. By mid-morning social workers
             at East Midlands were increased to cope with the arrival of more
             relatives - help being concentrated on counselling, emotional
             support and practical assistance to the relatives of people killed
             or seriously injured.

     p.m.    Twenty four hour social work cover was introduced at the Airport,
             at Leicester Royal Infirmary and the Holiday Inn in Leicester
             (where relatives were being accommodated by British Midland
             Airways). Clear lines of contact and liaison were now operating
             between British Midland Airways, other local authorities, the
             police, other airport staff and voluntary workers.  It. also became
             necessary for additional social work staff to be diverted within
             the Health Care Division to Leicester Royal Infirmary.

             After this period of intense activity, police requested further
             assistance from hospital social work staff to co-ordinate contacts
             for the next of kin in different parts of the country and as
             scheduled flights from Northern Ireland continued to arrive.
                                    '2



        The levels of support required increased rapidly during the 9th and
        arrangements were put in hand for social workers to work on a shift
        system around the clock. This released staff to maintain contact
        with both relatives and airport staff. It was also decided at this
        time that social work availability would be maintained at the
        Holiday Inn whilst relatives accommodated there required help.  By
        the evening of the 9th a total of 23 staff had been made available
        at Castle Donington (being drawn from Leics. North West Division,
        Health Care Division and Leics. South West Division).

        From 6 p.m. onwards meetings took place at the Airport and
        Leicester Royal Infirmary involving the Divisional Managers with a
        view to establishing arrangements for the following day. Major
        difficulties during this evening began to arise for social workers
        trying to help relatives of people not yet traced (less than 50% of
        the deceased had been identified). All relatives were notified of
        the availability of help and very good liaison was maintained
        between social workers at East Midlands and Leicester Royal
        Infirmary. Throughout the evening more relatives began to arrive
        and staffing was increased in order to cope with requests for help.

10th    At 5 a.m. a review of efforts made so far was undertaken and proper
        reporting and recording arrangements made to facilitate links
eL.m.   between all in-patients and relatives. By 9 a.m. interviews with
        media repesentatives had also been carried out by Divisional
        Managers.

p.m.    Every relative who had requested help had been interviewed and a
        social worker attached to them on an individual basis. By this
        time close contact had also been established between social work
        co-ordinators in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Northern Ireland.
        The Director of Social Services had visited staff at the Airport
        and further review and inter-agency co-ordinating meetings had been
        carried out.  Preliminary consideration now being given to the
        needs of staff for de-briefing and assistance following their work
        in view of the emotional strain involved.

11th    A review of the day's arrangements and plans was established by 8
        a.m. in response to police procedures which allowed for the viewing
a.m.    of bodies.  Social workers assisted in this process and also made
        arrangements for relatives to visit the crash site accompanied by
        clergy and volunteers (this process was repeated on following days).

p.m.    Later on during the 11th the first of the bodies were released to
        relatives following the usual inquest procedure. Requests were
        received by residents of Kegworth for social work help and plans
        drawn up to make social workers available at specific times in
        Kegworth for residents to attend as needed.

12th    Again, after an early start a review of existing arrangements was
        carried out at Leicester Royal Infirmary by hospital managers
        (great appreciation of the Social Services response being voiced).
        The reinforcement of social work involvement in future emergency
        plans was considered to be essential.
                                     3


p.m.     By midday arrangements had been made to meet Social Services staff
         arriving from Northern Ireland with a view to co-ordinating their
         work with relatives now beginning to return home.  A formal
         four-way meeting to maintain collaboration was set up to ensure
         that all appropriate follow up facilities were offered to those
         affected by the disaster on their return home.  By the end of this
         day additional arrangements had been made for relatives from
         Leicester to visit the scene (with transport and flowers being
         organised by social work staff).




 Thus, by Friday 13th January over 100 relatives or friends had sought
 social work help at East Midlands Airport, many of these being in
 residence at the Airport Hotel for three and four days where they were
 seen regularly by social work staff.  Although the operational activities
 at East Midlands Airport gradually began to decline a presence was
 maintained and will be continued as long as social work support is
 needed.  Turning to the Health Care Division, 25 staff provided
 counselling to approximately 90 relatives and directly to 10 patients in
 Leicester Royal Infirmary.  Others remain too ill to receive counselling'
 and given that some patients will remain in hospital for prolonged
 periods of time plans are now being established to ensure that support is
 maintained whilst, as far as possible, work returns to normal within the
 Divisions.

Dear

KH1LLSB0R0PGH FOOTBALL DISASTER

Further to our conversation I enclose as promised internal briefing notes on the
social services response to the personal tragedies resulting from the
Hillsborough disaster.

I look forward to briefing you more fully and discussing the central
Government’s response when we meet at 5.00pm on Monday, 8 May.

Yours sincerely

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL STADIUM DISASTER

PERMANENT PREMISES FOR A COUNSELLING, DROP-IN AND MEMORIAL CENTRE




INTRODUCTION

The number and the nature of the referrals for counselling and other
services that has been generated through the "Helpline", Drop-In Centre
and through the mainstream service, since the disaster, indicates
a very significant demand for skilled post-trauma counselling over
the next one to two years and perhaps longer.

The response to the opening of the Anfield ground, to the Drop-In
Centre, and to the bus service for those wishing to re-visit the Hillsborough
Ground, indicates the need for, and the benefits of, an opportunity
for those affected by the disaster to share many of their common experiences.

In considering how best to provide for the future it is important
to note that many of those traumatically affected by the consequences
of the disaster are not themselves fans.

A number of factors suggest that much of the counselling and support
work generated by the disaster should in future be co-ordinated from,
and in part operate from, premises that have an independent identity
associated to "Hillsborough" and which are located close to the Liverpool
Football Club and Anfield Park.      It seems appropriate also that such
a Centre be close to the Liverpool Supporters Club and to the Vernon
Sangster Sports Centre in which the Drop-In Centre was first based
and from which the Sheffield Hospital bus shuttle, and the Hillsborough
Ground bus, ran.   It should continue to provide an informal, comfortable
and quiet meeting place for those who will benefit from a sharing
of common experience.

There are several sites around the Anfield Park football ground principal
car park, in Stanley Park, which have excellent access and meet all
requirements.  The quality of modular construction building now available
is such that a building with appropriate dignity and ambience, having
a life expectancy from two years to "permanent", could be fully operational
within ten to twelve weeks of commissioning. The sites under consideration
all lend themselves to simple landscape screening with shrubbery or
memorial garden so that ease of access may be combined with a degree
of privacy.   Should such a Centre be established the name would remain
to be determined.     For the purpose of this note it is referred to
as "The Hillsborough Centre".

There follow notes on:-

Purpose
Accommodation Requirements
Commissioning
Management
Staffing
Costs

Purpose

The purpose of the Hillsborough Centre would be:-
 1




                                         -   2   -


(1) To provide a drop-in centre and meeting place, with support services
       on hand, for those who may benefit from sharing common    experiences
       and needs.

(2) To continue to receive and/or co-ordinate new applications for
    assistance arising from the disaster and ensure integration into
    the data-base for response and follow up.

(3)     To provide a centre from which a case co-ordination and de-briefing
       service could operate to support a Care Fieldwork Team and, by
       request, any Key Worker concerned in post-disaster work.

(4) To offer a small Memorial rest room.

Note

It is not proposed that future applications for help that are associated
with Hillsborough would be referred to the Centre, although that option
would be available where appropriate, but that the Centre would assume
responsibility for logging and co-ordinating longer term work and
provide a common reference point for de-briefing and support services
for Key Workers.    It would nevertheless retain its own staff, whether
provided on a seconded basis or not, and would maintain an open referral
service during the day.

There seems little doubt that the needs currently identified would
help keep such a Centre fully occupied for two years or more. Thereafter
it seems probable that a more enduring role may have evolved that
will on the one hand continue to meet long term Hillsborough needs,
of which there will be a significant number, and on the other hand
have developed a more general related brief relating perhaps to sports
casualties.

Accommodation

The building should afford dignity, security and medium to long-term
durability. A single storey pitched roof building of modular construction,
fully accessible to the disabled, is envisaged.      It should be close
to parking facilities, and to the locations referred to above.         It
should be well signed posted and accessible, yet provide a degree
of privacy from, the car park and the Stanley Park playing field.
This may be achieved by fencing and planting, and the area could include
a small memorial garden.

    Total 2,000 square feet excluding toilets and circulation space.

    Commissioning and implementation schedule

    The small gymnasium in which the present Drop In Centre is operating
    was fully booked by local schools and youth organisations at the time
    it was made available to counselling services, and it is desirable
    to free it as early as possible.

    The Merseyside Youth Association have indicated that they would respond
    favourably to a request for an extension beyond the currently agreed
    for release date of May 7th, but clearly there would be an advantage
    in early relocation of the Drop-In service if that can be achieved.

    It is necessary to ensure however that the location of the Drop-In
    Centre is not radically changed as it is now established in the publics
    mind.

    Enquiries have suggested that a number of modular building specialists
    would be prepared to supply the quality of building needed.       Some
    would be prepared to supply immediately usable portakabin type units
    to be situated beside the Vernon Sangster whilst the more permanent
    building is completed.

    If the proposed scheme is approved and the necessary planning permissions
    expedited the following schedule appears feasible.

    (1) Relocate present Drop-In Centre staff to temporary cabin by 1.5.89.

    (2) Open permanent Hillsborough Drop-In Centre by 21.7.89.

    Management

    Temporary arrangements are under consideration for the Liverpool Social
    Services Department to continue to manage the Drop-In Centre in the
    short-term and for this to continue to be staffed by a Core Group
     workers from Liverpool Social Services Department and voluntary organisations
    notably Victim Support and Barnardos.       In the longer term it would
    be desirable for the Centre to be staffed jointly by relevant Authorities,
    Probation staff and volunteers and be managed by a Hillsborough Victims/
    Survivors Management Committee.
    Staffing

    PHASE 1

*   Staffing requirements are likely to alter with time.     In the immediate
    future they are anticipated to continue as now. That is:-

    Manager of Day Centre seconded more or less full time.

    Co-ordinators (Casework Services) six operating on a rota basis.
                                      - 4 -

Staff   Counsellors   *   Approximately   30    per   day;   that   is     six   for   each
of four three hour shifts, with an additional four at the peak 12.00
to 3:00 p.m. period covering hospital and ground visiting.

♦The attempt has been made to ensure that both the Casework Co-ordinators
and four out of six of every "shift" of social work counsellors are
skilled and experienced in beareavement counselling.

Staff De-briefing Service -        should      be   independent     and,    at   present,
constantly available on site.

PHASE 2

Once the level of activity in the Drop-In Centre subsides and the
Sheffield trips terminate it seems probable that the Drop In Centre
would be adequately staffed by the identified group of 14 or so Core
Team workers which will by then be in place, working on a rota basis,
with the help of a reduced number of volunteers.

The need for the Case Co-ordination will              remain,     though possibly        on
a slightly reduced basis.

The need for the De-briefing service will remain but can perhaps begin
to operate on a more planned basis and extend to all Key Workers the
majority fo whom will not be operating from the Hillsborough Centre.

PHASE 3

Difficult to predict.      Staffing requirements would need review in
terms of needs in the areas of (1) Case Co-ordination of post disaster
work on Merseyside and (2) the provision of an appropriate de-briefing
service.    It is anticipated that the De—briefing Service would be
that approved at the Inter Agency Forum for Merseyside.

Capital Cost

Provisional estimates suggest that the Permanent Hillsborough Drop
In Centre could be on site, with services, for Approximately £50,000,
by 21.7.89. This excludes the cost of landscaping and temporary portakabin
provision for the intervening weeks.
■


                                THE HILLSBOROUGH DROP-IN CENTRE


    1. Evidence suggests the need for both a Drop-In Centre and a post-trauma
          counselling service for a minimum of two years.

    2.   The Centre shpuld be near the Liverpool Football Ground, the Liverpool
          SuppcrtensClub and the present location of the Drop-In Service at
          the Vernon Sangster which is established in the public's mind.

    3.   The Centre should be identified with 'Hillsborough', yet have an
          independent identity. It is important to note that not all who
         have been traumatised by the disaster are themselves 'fans'.

    4.   PURPOSE

          (a) To continue to provide Drop-In facility for those who may gain
          from the sharing of experience.

          (b) To provide a counselling and advice service in association
          with the Drop-In Centre.

           (c) In the longer term, to provide a Centre from which post disaster
           work may be co-ordinated and reviewed and where a de-briefing and
         . support service for all Key Workers may be based. The Centre
           would almost certainly be kept fully occupied for 2 years.

          (d) In the much longer term it seems probable that in addition
          to serving the very long term needs of Hillsborough, a more general
          related function may evolve. This could be personal needs relating
          to sporting accidents generally for example.

    5.    The accommodation schedule would be:-

             1   x   Managers Office                                    (1)
             1   x   Administrative Office                              (2)
             1   x   Social Work/Counsellors/Solicitor's Office         (4) (Work Stations)
             1   x   Kitchenette
             1   x   Drop-In Lounge                          (2< Lounge/60 Stacking)
                                                             (20
             3   x   Interview Rooms                            V-   2 x (2)
             1   x   Toilets                                         1 x (4)
             1   x   Memorial Rest Room                                 (8)
             1   x   Store

    6.    A durable, dignified and aesthetically acceptable building could
          be 'on site' in an appropriate area of Stanley Park by 21.7.89.
          at a cost of approximately £55,000 discounting fencing or landscape
          planting.

      HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - MERSEYSIDE RESPONSE

      1.   Activity on Merseyside continues and indeed is escalating.    The effects
            of the disaster are spreading and being revealed in schools, in industry
            and amongst staff of the Merseyside authorities, particularly Liverpool
           who are providing moist of the front line support.    Support for victims
            is being provided through the help line, through the Supporters Club at
           Anfield Football Club and at a drop in advice centre.

      2.   The Merseyside response continues in a fairly co-ordinated way and help
            is now being received from other local authorities. Cheshire and West
            Lancashire are very much involved.

      3.   The help line is being well used.

      4.   A data base is set up with advice from Kent.     There are problems in
            coping with all the information, extra help has been sought.  Separate
            information is hopefully being kept on offers of help in order to link
           up victims with potential sources of support etc.     Good co-operation
           with the RHA concerning data so far.

      5.   Some tensions are arising between the local authorities because of local
           politicians wanting to maintain a high profile and to be seen to be
            doing things.   There was a particular problem over a promise from the
            leader of Liverpool City Council that the City Council would pay for all
            funeral expenses.   Problems of recouping this money from the disaster
            fund are being explored.

      6.   Awareness workshops are well underway.        Health authority,    middle
           mangers, senior managers and politicians.       Three day workshops for
           counsellors (social workers) taking place soon.   Plans for a longer term
            strategy are being drawn u p .

      7.   Special meeting of NWASSA called for Tuesday 25 April to discuss
           disaster and make a request for the funding for a training co-ordinator
           attached to the regional training unit.

      8.   Leaflets for general public are being produced.
9.    Distress in   children   in   schools   now   a problem.   A   leaflet has   been
      produced.

10.   An attempt is being made to co-ordinate training for teachers etc on a
      Merseyside basis.

11.   Staff offering help to victims are themselves in need of support and
      attempts are being made to set up a comprehensive debriefing and support
      service for them.   Psychologists through the RHA have offered help and
      are being trained.   BASW have offered to co-ordinate the offers being
      received to undertake support for counsellors.

12.   Voluntary sector meetings continue and seem to be co-ordinated well.
      Attempts are now being made to constructively use their offers of help.


13.   Concern about the welfare of staff at the Liverpool Football Club,
      particularly players who are heavily involved with families etc. They
      are only youngsters themselves and very vulnerable.

14.   A planning group has been set up.        Chaired by Howard Parker from
      Manchester University, formerly a lecturer at Liverpool University.   The
       intention is to devise a co-ordinated long term strategy.    This should
       lead to some costings of the nature of the longer term strategy.  He has
      been seconded for 2h days a week over the next three we eks .

15.   Effects of the disaster are being felt in local firms, absenteeism etc.
      There are plans to liaise with Chambers of Commerce in relation to
      possible training and support.

    1.   Merseyside authorities have formed a planning           group   to   devise     a long
          term strategy in response to the above.

    2.   This is to    be   chaired   by   Professor    Howard    Parker      of    Manchester
         University.

    3.   He and I have some reservations about the preliminary thoughts which are
          around concerning the nature of such a strategy and the level of
          staffing required.  We acknowledge however that this arises really from
          our ignorance of any existing literature on this subject.    Information
          received to date relates to psychological impact but it has been hard to
          obtain any 'hard data' on levels of staffing and nature of services
          required.

    4.   There have been a number of disasters recently, as we know only too
         well, and there must be considerable experience around and other local
          authorities actively considering this issue or involved already in a
          longer term response.

    5.   I would be grateful to receive:-

         a)   any reports available,       particularly   if   they    can be      shared with
              Professor Parker.

         b)   names of people with whom Professor Parker could make contact.

    6.   Information, however brief, would be much appreciated                     as   soon   as
         possible.   Names of people would be particularly useful.

    7.   If I am not available please pass them to my secretary Mrs

    HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER
    DISASTER PLANNING/AFTERMATH ETC


    1.   Merseyside authorities are attempting to plan a long term strategy to
          cope with the aftermath of the Hillsborough football disaster.   This
          relates to 'out reach' counselling services in particular.

    2.   There seems to be little information or research relating to models of
          service, levels of counselling support, take up of help, nature of
          services required etc.

    3.   Could you let me have a bibliography of what articles/research there are
          available in relation to the above.

    4.   A fairly speedy response to this request would be greatly appreciated.

         -   All requests for help received by the Helpline will be put onto a database.

         -   An initial referral is completed by the Helpline Team. As part of the
             routine admin, procedure in processing that form, it is passed through the
             computer input team.

         -   The information from the form is transferred onto one of the attached
             forms which is used by the computer operators for input.

         -   Where a referral has been                        passed by Helpline to another Authority or agency,
             that initial information                         and disposal will already be held on the database.
             What will be required is                         an update referral to be returned to the Helpline
             which sets out the action                        taken subsequently in response to the initial
             referral.

DISASTER AT HILLSS3R006HFOOTBALL STADIUM: SHEFFIELD 15 APRIL 1989

1.   I (H) may wish to be aware of the local authority Social Service
Departments' response to this disaster.  Information on activities has been
supplied via the Department's Regional Social Services Inspectorate who have
kept in close touch with the events.

Sheffield

2.   There appears to have been a very good immediate response from Sheffield
SSD and neighbouring S Yorkshire SSDs to this disaster. A large number of
social workers volunteered their services and formed crisis intervention teams
at 3 places (Hallamshire Hospital, City General Hospital and at a specially
formed crisis contact centre in Sheffield).

3.   The teams worked all through Saturday night and were able to ensure that
an individual social worker and clergyman was available to every bereaved
family.  The contact centre continued its work until 11pm on Sunday 16th.
Work then continued at the local Divisional Office in Sheffield.  Meetings
were arranged with representatives from Liverpool SSD who travelled to
Sheffield on Saturday evening and inevitably the emphasis on continuing
counselling and follow up care moved from Sheffield to Liverpool.  There
appear to be no fatalaties concerning people from Sheffield but some
counselling work may continue to be necessaiy.
4.   Mr Neil Kay, Director of Social Services for Sheffield, praised the way
his staff and social work staff from other local authorities had responded to
the situtation. A team of social workers from Doncaster had relieved the
pressure on hard-pressed Sheffield staff and social workers from Barnsley,
Thameside and Liverpool had all been involved in Sheffield.  Some who had been
visiting the area just called in and spontaneously offered their services.

Liverpool

5.   Mr David Mason, Director of Social Services for Liverpool travelled to
Sheffield on Saturday evening along with a team of social workers who were
skilled bereavement counsellors from Alder Hey Hospital.   Meetings with
Sheffield SSD took place and a help line was established I in Liverpooll which
was manned by a team of Liverpool social workers.  It was recognised early on
that a fully coordinated response involving the social services departments of
all the adjacent Merseyside local authorities as well as health authorities
would be required and an impressive degree of co-ordination and organization
emerged in Liverpool on Sunday.  Plans were made for local authorities to
prepare a team for outreach work on a longer term basis including necessary
training for the staff involved.

    6.   The responses by the local authority social services departments involved
    will be considered by the Joint Working Party currently looking into the
    follow-up to major disasters and being administered by CRUSE Bereavement Care.

 THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

 The latest information we have on the local health authority'8
 response to the disaster is as follows:

 RH A Inquiry

 2.   Trent Regional Health Authority is to hold its own inquiry
 into the way the emergency was handled by the local health
 service, as is the practice in any major disaster of this kind.
 Preliminary indications are that the emergency medical services
 coped extremely well in the circumstances. Full emergency teams,
 in many cases supported by off-duty staff, were on hand and we
 are not aware of any significant difficulties in providing
 effective medical care once the casualties were brought into
 hospital.

 Hospital Treatment

 3.   176 casualties were taken to the two hospitals - the
 Northern General and the Royal Hallamshire     - of whom 80 were
 admitted. A further eleven were found to be dead on arrival at
 the Northern General; one person died on the ward at the Royal
 Hallamshire. As at 9.30 this morning, a total of 44 casualties
 were still in hospital, 18 of them in intensive care. More people
 are expected to be discharged today.

 awhnlance services

U J.   Before the kick off one ambulance was stationed inside the
  ground and one outside.     I am told that this is standard
  procedure for this sort of event.

 5.   The ambulance response fell mainly on the South Yorkshire
 Ambulance Service, later supported by those from West Yorkshire,
 Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. Ten ambulances were on the scene
 within 17 minutes of receiving the call. What is still uncertain
 at this stage is how quickly the ambulances were able actually
 to get inside the ground and how effectively they were able to
deal with the casualties once they had done so.    These will be
issues for the Inquiry.

Social Services

6.   All the reports suggest that there has been excellent social
services back up for the victims' families and the injured with
the Liverpool and Sheffield local authorities working in close
cooperation supported by other agencies.
Home Secretary's Stat.t»ment

7.   We have been in touch with the Home Office throughout the
weekend and have contributed factual material to the statement
the Home Secretary is to make this afternoon (draft text
attached).

8.    The Home Secretary's statement refers to his request for
immediate factual reports from the various local services
involved.    I have agreed with Home Office that this should
include reports from the hospital and ambulance services and have
asked the RHA to provide Ministers with them by the end of next
week.

With   permission*     Mr   Speaker#   I should     like ? o ^ m S S e   o
statement about the disaster at the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club ground at Hillsborough on Saturday. Everyone
has been horrified by this incredible tragedy in which 94
lost their lives and S s ^ w e r e injured.

Shortly after the start of the match there was a surge of
spectators on the Leppings Lane terrace which crushed many at
the front ogainst the safety barrier.             This accounted for
most of the deaths and injuries.


The match was due to start at 3 p.m. To help ensure orderly
access* the gates of the ground were opened at 12 noon.  At
2.30 p.m. most of the Nottingham fans were in the ground# but
many of the Liverpool supporters were still arriving. It was
clear to the police officers in chorge that there was ample
capacity still to be filled in some ports of the enclosure
                                          t
allocated to Liverpool.

At about 2.45 o.m. there was a large crowd of Liverpcrol
supDorters at the turnstiles in Leopings Lane behind the West
Stand. There was difficulty in coping with the pressure on
the turnstiles and the police used loudhailers to urge the
crowd to be patient.                                -

At about 2.50 p.m. more Liverpool supporters arrived and the
numbers in front of the turnstiles increased.           Some
supporters started to climb the walls and turnstiles and
those at the front of the crowd were under considerable
pressure from those behind.
                       i



The senior police officer present considered that there was a
possible danger to the lives of the spectators at the front
of the crowd. In order to relieve the pressure he arranged
for an exit gate near the turnstiles to be opened to let a
section of the crowd through. * The relationship of that
oction to the disaster on the terrace shortly afterwords is
                                                        *

The Hillsborough Disaster

1. I have seen                  s minute setting out the latest
information on t:ie response to the disaster in the Trent Region..
Ministers may wish also to be aware of action taken in Mersey
Region which may be summarised as follows :

     i) steps have been taken via FPC Chairmen to ensure that all
     GPs in the Region are aware of the services available to
     victims/families ;

     ii) arrangements have been made for Consultant medical staff
     to attend a seminar later in the week by their counterparts
     in Bradford on how to handle the aftermath of the disaster;

     iii) Liverpool Social Services Department is coordinating
     the names of all victims and Mersey RHA has agreed to meet
     part of the cost of the computer software to be used ;

     iv) Mersey RHA has             offered   Trent   RHA      material   and/or
     manpower support ;

     v) any additional staffing that may be required in Liverpool
     hospitals will be covered by loans from other Districts
     within Mersey Region.

2. Clearly it is early days and the size of the task that will
face Mersey Region is not yet clear. It is reassuring, however,
to know that the necessary groundwork has been prepared and to
learn of excellent cooperation between all the relevant agencies.

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER

Conversation with David Mason     Director   of   Social   Services,
Liverpool on 20 April 1989.

1.   After sharing some personal reactions David Mason said how
     impressed he was with the response of his own authority.
     There was no attempt by members to score political points
     and unlike in some neighboring authorities the leaders of
     the Labour and Social Democrats had sent a joint letter to
     their staff thanking them for their response. The City
     Council had suspended the requirement for officers to seek
     approval for expenditure related to the crisis and the
     Council Chairman had expressed surprise when David had felt
     it necessary to ask for approval to spend £200,000 on
     staffing. He quoted a number of other examples.

2.   His purpose in ringing me was to underline the need for
      additional funding to finance the very expensive operation
     which    Liverpool   are co-ordinating on behalf of the
     Merseyside authorities.   I explained to him the efforts we
     were making and the response - that the department had not
      funded any of the previous disasters and that an approach
      should be made DOE.

3.   I explained to David that one of     the early requirements
     would be some notion of the sums of money involved, whether
      they were hundreds of thousands or  millions.   He said his
      staff were engaged in a costing exercise at the moment and
     he would expect to be able to provide such figures by 2 May.

4.   He asked whether a co-ordinated application should be made
      or whether individual authorities should make their own.  I
      said that I felt that it would underline the co-operative
     venture if Liverpool were able to make the approach to DOE
     behalf of the Mersey authorities.    I acknowledged to David
     that the service which he was co-ordinating was not merely a
     Merseyside service but was in part a national service and we
     would do our best to support his request for additional
      funding.

5.   After further discussion with Maire Gibson it was agreed
     that    she would    advise David to  register with DOE
      immediately in general terms the forthcoming request for
      additional funding.

HTTJSBQRCOSH FOOTBALL DISASTER

1.   I have sent two briefings to you an the above and will continue to keep
      you informed.

2.   I have been impressed by the pan-Merseyside approach and the tremendous
      ccanmitment to a corporate co-ordinated approach.

3.   Liverpool City Council has clearly taken the lead, but the Director has
      sought ways of giving other Merseyside Directors full responsibility for
      aspects of the co-ordination.

4.   Offers of help and good will are quite remarkable.    One hopes it will
      continue.

5.   The viiole operation is clearly costing the Liverpool City Council a
      great deal of money. I knew not where the Council will find the money.

6.   The Director of Social Services asked if central government was in a
      position to make any money available as they were co-ordinating a
      response to a national disaster (copy of letter attachedft Services in
      the form of setting up a data base, consultancy help, drop in centres,
      transport, staff costs (enormous), printing, catering for additional
      staff are only a few of the many additional calls on expenditure for the
      City Council. Members will not hear of an approach to the disaster fund
      for financial help towards services as this money is seen to be money
      for the families of the bereaved etc.         They are aware that the
      government has pledged £500,000 to the disaster fund but that this
      cannot go towards services.     Additional, and unexpected costs have
      fallen on other Merseyside authorities, to a lesser extent in the short
     term, but certainly over the long term.

7.   The leader of Liverpool City council has indicated that the cost of any
     funerals throughout the country will be met by the Council.    Officers
     are new sorting out the legalities of this and anticipate claiming back
     frcm the disaster fund. Other Merseyside authorities have been given
     instructions by members to ensure there is no short term financial
     hardship for any family. Again SSI has urged action in relation to
     legal niceties.   This kind of response is a typical one frcm local
     politicians.

8.   Mr Harrison has raised the question of central disaster funding with HQ
     and we understand advice frcm CS3 is that an approach should be made to
     the Department of the Environment.
9.    There have new been a large number of disasters vtfiich have drawn heavily
      on SSD resources.    Liverpool is trying very hard to learn frcm the
      experiences of others and to provide a credible, co-ordinated and
      sensitive long term approach in association with the other Merseyside
      authorities. There are difficulties and no doubt they will continue. I
      will attempt to keep you briefed.         Is the possibility of same
      centralised funding to support SSDs in their role a possible issue for
      consideration?

10.   Between us, members of SSI must have quite a lot of experience, it has
      certainly been a "rapid" learning experience for me as the liaison SSI
      for Liverpool.    Roy Pearson indicated that there was a forum for
      discussing such issues of vfaich you are a part. If it would be helpful,
      I would certainly be happy to put together same of the issues which have
      emerged from Merseyside so far.

11. We have advised Liverpool to approach D of E tut if you have any other
    advice, this would be gratefully appreciated.

1.   Update.

     The Director gave an update on the current situation.

     (a)   The Help—Line was now re—positioned in the Johnson Street Day        Action.
           Centre and was operating very efficiently. He stressed the
           complicating factor of Knowsley's separate Help—Line in view of
           the agreement of all Local  Authorities that     there would be one j C.W.
           uniform Help—Line facility. The staff were       operating on four hour    i
           shifts and a rota had been  established up to 1.00     a.m. on Wednesday,!
           which included staff from other Local Authorities. Lancashire       j
           County Council offered to staff a shift and Ms. Carole Wilkinson    j
           agreed to incorporate this in the rota.                             I

      (b) A Press Office had now been established in the Conference            ‘
          Room at Hatton Garden, staffed by 3 Press Officers. A FAX            :
          line had been installed, the number of which is 051—225—3916.

      (c) A Drop-in Centre has been established at the Vernon Sangster
          Sports Centre, telephone no. 0860241064/5, and this would be open    ;
          from 9.00 a.m. to 9.00 p.m. It was reported that Drop-in Centres
          had also been established in Wirral, Skelmersdale and Ormskirk.
     (d)    Computer Data Base.

            A computer data base is being established with
            assistance from some Consultants. The Team Leader
            for the Herald of Free Enterprise Disaster had
            provided information and were proposing to use
            referral forms designed at that time for imputting
            data in due course. Copies of these will be
            distributed as soon as possible.

     (e)    Publicity

            A leaflet based on the Herald of Free Enterprise
            Disaster leaflet is being compiled by the Press Office
            staff and it will be made available in due course.


     (f)    Funeral Bills.                                                        j
                                                                              f
            The Director informed the meeting that the Leader                 ;
            of Liverpool City Council had stated that all funeral
            bills in connection with the disaster would initially be          j
            handled by Liverpool City Council to ensure that                  j
            families didnot have financial worries when funerals
            were being arranged. It was also reported that Liverpool          j
            City Council would be waiving any interment fees normally         I
            payable to the Council. It was agreed that the Director           j
            would request Liverpool Politicians to consult with the           j
            Leaders of the other Authorities on this aspect.                  j

     (g)    Death List.                                                   j
                                                                          i
            It   was reported that the death list had now been made       j
            public and there were 94 names, with a possible 95th.         I
            It was agreed that the list would be given to the             i
            Probation Service who would check if any of the individuals   j
            were known to that Service. When that information is          ‘
            received it is to be despatched to the other Authorities      •
            so that they are aware of the involvement of the Probation    )
            Service.
                                                                          i



Training.                                                                 j

Derek Evans, Wirral Social Services, informed the meeting that
training had   been discussed and he requested that each Authority      j
identify two   representatives and a Training Officer to attend the
meeting at Cherry House at 11.00 a.m. on Tuesday, 18th April.
The first session of training would involve the middle managers, i.e. I
operating supervisors, and that would take place on Thursday, 20th
April.   On Friday, 21st April, there would be a session for senior    j
managers, and on Saturday, 22nd April, there would be a training       i
session for elected Members, which would be held at Liverpool
Town Hall from 10.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. For each of the Thursday and j
Friday sessions it was expected that each Authority would identify
14 representatives who would be available to attend and nominations
should be given to Derek Evans at the meeting at 11.00 a.m. on
Tuesday morning.                                                      i

Following on from these days there would be a series of training    '
sessions for helpers'— the dates, times and venues to be confirmed.
It was established that political commitment had been given to the
cost of this training programme. It was also confirmed that one day
would be allocated for the voluntary organisations for training.

Voluntary Organisations.

Pauline Farrell, Sefton, reported back on a meeting which had been
held of the voluntary organisations. She confirmed that there was
considerable commitment and goodwill and a willingness to be
involved.   All the necessary information had been passed to
            L.C.V.S., who was co-ordinating the voluntary approach.
It was agreed that a training day for voluntary organisations would
be on 22nd May. A co-ordinating committee was being established
which would be meeting as soon as possible, and on which representation
from Lancashire and" Cheshire would be included. It was also anticipated
this committee may pick up and co-ordinate individual offers of help.

Sheffield — Feedback.

Carole Wilkinson, Liverpool, reported the feedback from Liverpool
staff who had returned from Sheffield. Those feelings included
anger towards the police and Hillsborough officials and also feelings
of disgust at the arrangements for mortuary facilities. The Sheffield
emergency operation was now beginning to wind down. It was anticipated
that post-mortems would be held today and inquests would take place
on Tuesday and Wednesday. It was agreed that we try and establish
which of the deceased were being dealt with by the Coroners,on which
days, and it was also agreed that we would endeavour to contact the
Coroners about possible transport arrangements.

Somebody you know may have died or been hurt at Hillsborough^ /your
experience was a-very personal one but we hope that this leaflet will help
you to understand how other people have reacted in similar situations. It
will also show you how you can help yourself to begin to recover.

EVERYONE FEELS THESE THINGS.

FEAR                     -   of   damage to ourselves and those we love
                         -   of   being left alone
                         -   of   breaking down
                         -   of   something similar happening again

HELPLESSNESS             -   What can you do in the face of such a   tragedy.

GRIEF                    -   for death, injury and loss

GUILT                    -   for being alive, for not being hurt

SHAME                    -   for seeming helpless or emotional

ANGER                    -   at what has happened and at who allowed it to happen
                         -   WHY ME?

MEMORIES                 -   of people you knew and loved

HOPE                         for the future

Everyone has these feelings.     They are especially powerful when people have died
in circumstances like those / k t Hillsborough.  And even stronger when you depended
on the person who has died„ 7 t f your relationship was going through a bad patch
or if you had other problems already .rt^>

Letting these feelings come out is part of the natural healing process.    It
doesn't mean- you will lose your self control, but if you try to stop them
coming out you could end up feeling even worse.   Crying will help you to cope,
too.

PHYSICAL AND MENTAL FEELINGS

Even if you haven't felt these emotions, your body might react to the crisis.
This can even happen months later.

Some common problems are tiredness, sleeplessness, bad dreams, loss, of memory or
concentration, dizziness, palpitations, shaking, difficulty in breathing,
choking in throat and chest, nausea, diahorrea, muscular tension, which may
lead to headaches, backaches, or neckaches, dragging in the womb, menstrual
disorders, change in sexual interest.

FAMILY AND FRIENDS

You might make new friends as a result of the tragedy.   But it can also p u t o*
 strain on existing relationships. You might feel you're   not getting enough

MAKING YOUITTEELINGS EASIER TO BEAR

NUMBNESS               - Your mind might not be able to take everything in at
                          once.  At first you might feel numb, and t h e t r a g i c
                          events may even seem unreal.   People sometimes wrongly
                          see this numbness as either "being strong" or even
                          "not caring".

ACTIVITY               - It's best to keep active, helping others might help you.
                          But don't overdo it - it could detract from the help you
                          need for yourself.

REALITY                   We have to come to terms with the reality of a tragedy
                          such as Hillsborough.  Going to the funeral, going to
                          where it happened, will help you to do this.

TALKING IT OVER           Gradually you will need to talk and think about your
                          experiences. You'll probably dream about them too.
                          Children may want to draw about this event, or even
                          play games about it.

SUPPORT                   You'll need other peoples physical and emotional help.
                          Don't reject it. It can help to talk to others who
                          have had similar experiences.

PRIVACY                   Sometimes you will just need to be alone, or with your
                          family and friends.

But remember, overactivity, or letting your feelings remain numb, will delay
your recovery.  The pain of the wound will lead to healing.  You may even come
out of this wiser and stronger.

THINGS TO D O .........AND NOT TO DO

DON'T                 bottle up your feelings.   Make sure you express your emotions.

DON'T                 ovoid talking about what happend.    Think about what happened    o.*A
                       talk it over with others.

DON'T                 expect the memories to vanish - they will stay with you for
                       a long time.

These are things you should try to do:

*       Let your children share your feelings and express their own.     They may be
        feeling much the same as you.

*   Take time to rest, and be with friends

*   Tell friends, family, or counsellors how you feel.

*   As you begin to recover, .keep your life as normal aspossible.

*   Send the children back to school. Let them carry on as normally as possible.
And a special warning. Accidents are more common when people are under stress.
Be especially careful when driving; be more careful around the home.     This
might sound unlikely, but it is important.

WHEN TO SEEK HELP

Family and friends may help you all they can.  But you may feel the need for
extra help. We can offer this, but only if you ask.

You should ask for help if:

*   You feel you can't handle your deep feelings.

*   You feel you aren't getting back together over a   period of time.

*   You continue to feel tense, confused, empty or exhausted.

*   You have nightmares and can't sleep.

*   You've no-one to share your   feelings with.

*   Your relationships suffer, or you develop sexual problems.

*   You have accidents,.

*   You drink, smoke, or take drugs to excess.

*   Your work suffers.

*   Others close to you are not   recovering.

Even if you're helping others, you could become emotionally and physicaly
exhausted.

Don't hesitate to seek help.  No problem is too big or small for us to    help
you deal with.  Everyone needs help - it is nothing to be ashamed of.     Anything
you say will be totally confidential.

FINALLY REMEMBER - You're the same person you were before this tragedy.     There
is a light at the end of the tunnel.  HELP IS AVAILABLE.

   Dear Colleague,

                                  HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY

        May I first take this opportunity to thank those many people who have rung
   and offered practical help and support.   I apologise if you have not received a
   response from either myself or the Department.   You will realise that the
   situation can best be described as overwhelming.   Many many people are offering
   help which we are trying currently to collate and organise.   The staff of all
   Departments in the Authorities most affected have been wonderful.

        On Sunday, 16th April, we met initially as a Group of Merseyside Authorities
   with our colleagues from the Health Service and Police to try to ensure that from
   the beginning we developed a multi-authority, multi-agency co-ordinated approach.
   The number of authorities affected appears to grow day by day and as well as
   Merseyside Districts other North West Authorities have also joined this co-ordinating
   group.   I will up-date you on this shortly.

        Our first approach was to establish a 'Help      Line1 for survivors and ourinitial
   work has concentrated on trying to ensure that immediate help is available to all
   those people who are bereaved or have relatives seriously injured in hospital. We
   do, however, realise that this is only the first phase of a long term service. We
   have sought to advise Departments of individuals who are affected in their area and
   will continue to do so.You will, of course, realise from    the Press that although
   the majority of the dead and injured are from Mersey Region there are people
   affected in areas all over the United Kingdom. It would be most helpful if
   Departments could advise us of actions that they have taken as a result of our
   information so that we can record this.

        It has been agreed by everyone involved that Liverpool will act as the
   co-ordinating and lead authority so all communication should be via this Department.

        I realise that Departments have many other pressures, but would ask for your
   co-operation and support in making contact with people who are referred. We have
   very quickly realised how much people value the help that is offered and, at the same
   time, find it exceedingly difficult to come forward and ask for our assistance. I
   anticipate that we shall, from the Unit that will be established, be offering some
   support in the longer term to people who we establish were spectators and survivors
   of the tragedy.   I will try to keep colleagues informed as we proceed.   Again,
   many thanks for all the help that has been offered.
                                    Yours sincerely,

When calling or telephoning please ask for Director of Social Services.

 Dear Brian,

                                 Re: Hillsborough Tragedy

      I hope, via Maire, that you have been kept in touch with the progress that
 has been made to establish services in the wake of the Hillsborough Tragedy on
 Saturday.   The Authorities most affected within the North West Region have agreed
 to work on a multi-authority basis to establish both short-term assistance and a
 long-term unit to provide support and assistance to survivors.

      At present we have not got a clear idea of the scale of this operation and
 currently our services are being provided through the voluntary efforts of staff
 who are manning 'Help Line' and 'Out Reach' services taking on additional work and
 have generally provided every assistance.

      As we begin to formulate a strategy for dealing with the long-term consequences,
 which are likely to affect thousands of people, we will, of necessity, be developing
 specialist and discreet services for them on a multi-authority, multi-agency basis.

      My purpose in writing to you, as well as ensuring that you are in touch with
 events on behalf of the Department, is to enquire if we can anticipate any financial
 support for this additional and significant expenditure.    From reports in the Press
 it would appear that the Government has made a commitment to provide assistance through
 the Fund* but that is money which will, I assume, be directly available to the
 victims and is not for the development of local services.    I would appreciate any
 help that you can give and in trying to put together both our short term response and
 our long term strategy early decisions will have to be made and I would appreciate an
 early response to this request so that we can advise all the authorities of the
 resource base upon which we are planning services.    I look forward to hearing from
 you and would thank you particularly for the help and support given by Maire over the
 last few days.
                                      Yours sincerely,



                                      Director of Social Services.

UVERPOOL FOOTBALL SUmJKTKHS DISASTER
REPORT UP TO 4.POEM MONDAY 17 AEKEL

1.   I attended a meeting at 4.00pm on Monday 17 April called for briefing
     senior representatives of the Merseyside local authorities.

2.   It was represented by all local authorities in Merseyside together with
     representatives frcm West Lancashire.

3.   Mr Mason reported that life in Liverpool was dominated by the disaster
      and particularly time consuming and onerous had been dealing with the
     press.    It had been necessary to have three press officers in the
     building. Help was offered by the press officer from the KHA who was
     present at the meeting and this clearly was going to be useful. The
      City Council had a policy of maximum publicity of activity and were
      keying into all the local papers and news stations. Press releases were
      going to be published on a regular basis and SSI is to go on the mailing
      list.

4.   He reported that the help line was active and running and had begun to
     be very busy that day. Other assistance was required in manning this
      and further offers frcm local authorities were made.

5.   It is reported that the meeting with "members" of the constituent
     Merseyside authorities had supported a pan-Merseyside approach and
     maximum co-ordination. The exemption to this, sadly, had been Khowsley
     who appeared to have acted unilaterally in setting up its Khcwsley help
     line and advertising a counselling and professional social work
     service.   This had been against the advice of the meeting on Sunday
     which had stressed the need not to advertise a counselling and
     professional social work service but to offer a help line initially as
     appropriate. The leader of Liverpool City Council was to intervene with
     the Knowsley members.

6.   Training                                  i

     It was noted that the politicians had been committed to the training
     package which was then discussed in some detail.      There was to be a
     meeting at social services training section the following morning for
     two representatives frcm each of the local authorities together with the
     training officer to plan further the detail of the programmes. There
     were to be four one and a quarter hour presentations to groups of health
     officials, senior managers, middle managers and politicians on April
     19/20/21 and 22. The KHA were very committed to this approach and the
     probation department had also sought involvement.      That evening the
      consultant working with Liverpool was to attend with representatives of
      the KHA to meet Family Practitioner Committees and it was planned to
      arrange training for GPs. Six 3 day training workshops were being set
      up - 24-26 April, 27-29 April, 15-17 May, 18-20 May and 29-31 May and
      1-3 June to train social workers for a longer tern post trauma
      counselling role.   Each with a one day follow-up.     Seven Merseyside
      authorities, including West Lancs, were to nominate a pair of potential
      counsellors to each workshop, thus providing workshops with 14 in each.
      The politicians had agreed to fund the package but no venues had yet
      been fixed for the three-day events.

7.    Voluntary sector

      Pauline Farrell had met a large turn-out from the voluntary
      organisations. There was a great deal of goodwill and of ccanrmtment to
      working together.      There had been some slight resentment from
      organisations such as CRUSE and CCMPASS who argued that they already had
      skilled counsellors, to the notion that additional training was
      required.    It had been left that LCVS wculd draw together a co­
      ordinating group from the large range of voluntary sector
      representatives to meet on a regular basis with Miss Farrell and
      representatives frcm other local authorities, including the health
      authority.

8.    Lists of the dead and next of kin had been finally received frcm the
      police, 93 people have been identified, one had not yet been identified
      and there was a suggestion that there was an additional dead supporter
      from Wigan although this had not been confirmed. Liverpool City Council
      had advised all the other SSDs up and down the country.

9.    Approach to counselling

      The approach to offering help to families was reaffirmed as being a
      personal approach with an offer of help. The point was made that seme
      probation officers had already made contact with families known to them
      and there was also discussion about the involvement of GPs.       It was
      agreed that the representative frcm the probation service should check
      out nation-wide the involvement of probation officers with bereaved or
      traumatised families to provide information for the national data-base.
      It was also agreed there should be seme co-ordination with GPs and if
      named social workers could be given to GPs it was felt that this would
      aid co-operation.    The point was again made that practical help and
      immediate bereavement counselling would be needed in the first place but
      the staff from the SSDs would be trained up for longer term
      psychological support.

10.   Sheffield

      Staff from Liverpool SSD had continued a presence in Sheffield and had
      picked up a great deal of anger and resentment towards the police and
      the Hillsborough officials. There had also been considerable disquiet
      concerning the lack of adequate facilities for the injured and families
      of the bereaved. Suggestion was that families had felt they were being
      processed and were not really being adequately supported. There was a
      great field of activity but it was unco-ondinated. The information from
      Neil Kay was that the Sheffield end was winding down although a long
      -t-gynm task force was to be set up.   Social workers in hospitals were
      continuing contact with the injured in hospitals and would pass
       information over.
11.   Inquests

      Inquests were being held an Tuesday and Wednesday. The information was
      that these would be brief presentations likely to be adjourned. Bodies
      would be released within a few days. There had been negotiations with
      the coroners court to try and set up decent holding facilities for
      relatives who it was expected would wish to travel to Sheffield. There
      had been innumerable offers of transport and the problem for Liverpool
      was co-ordinating these. It was agreed that the central help line would
      be available to assist local authorities who might have difficulties
      getting transport for families.

12.   The leader of the council has made a commitment to waiving fees for
      internment and it was hoped that similar arrangements would be available
      for residents in all the adjoining districts eg Cheshire. It was agreed
      that the members frcm Liverpool City Council would need to liaise with
      their fellow members in Cheshire. The chairman of the council had also
      indicated that no family should be expected to pay for burial no matter
      what part of the country they lived in. The City Council had arranged a
      meeting with funeral directors to ensure that an adequate service could
      be provided.

13. Visits to Hillsborough

      There had been a great deal of toing and froing frcm Hillsborough with
      coaches of Liverpudlians going over to Sheffield. It transpired that
      many were just going for the ride and there would be greater efforts to
      co-ordinate with the Liverpool supporters club to ensure that this
      service was not being abused.

14.   Help line

      This had now been transferred to Johnstone Street with staff working on
      a four hourly shift basis. On all the shifts, staff from Liverpool City
      Council were acting as collators and team leaders. Ccmputer advice had
      been received from Kent.     A team leader from Kent and a computer
      consultant was setting up the 'Herald' package. Information was being
      collected, staff were being trained on hew to use the system and
      referral forms were going to be vised. The KHA premised to contribute
      towards the cost. There was already seme discussion about compatibility
      of information being kept through the health system and matters relating
      to confidentiality of computerised information and safeguards concerning
      access. People were reassured that this matter was being attended to.

15.   Publicity

      Mr Mason indicated that there was a press release following the meeting
      with the voluntary organisations and a press release following the
      meeting with the politicians and there was to be a further meeting with
      the press.   International television had been involved and there had
      been innumerable visits from the press all day.

16.   There had been offers of publicity from various firms and offers for
      information to be available free in newspapers. Press officers could be
      contacted 225 3925.

17.   Tri-Formation leaflets - staff were working on some information leaflets
      similar to the ones produced following the Herald disaster. NWftSSA had
      agreed to cover the cost of these.
18. Secretariat

    There was some discussion about the tremendous amount of co-ordination
    secretarial and admin work being undertaken by Liverpool and suggestion
    made that a temporary secretary be appointed to deal with seme of the
    activity.   The local authorities and the region agreed to negotiate
    between them the funding for such a post.

DISASTER AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL STADIUM, SHEFFIELD
SATURDAY - 15 APRIL 1989

1, There would appear to have been a very good, immediate response fran
   Sheffield SSD and neighbouring South Yorkshire SSDs to this disaster. A
   high number of social workers volunteered their services and formed
   crisis intervention teams at 3 places: namely at the Hallamhire
   Hospital, the City General Hospital and at a specially formed crisis
   contact centre in Sheffield.
2. The teams worked all though the Saturday night and on Sunday morning
   Mr Gilroy (ACI) heard fran Neil Kay, the Director of Social Services in
   Sheffield, that during the night they had been able to make sure that an
    individual social worker and clergyman was available to every bereaved
    family. It is understood that out of 94 bodies 20 were still unaccoun­
    ted for on Sunday rooming and that around 70 people were still in
   hospital including 18 in intensive care. (By first thing Monday morning
    it is understood from Neil Kay and media reports that nearly all of the
   bodies have been accounted for, 56 people are still in hospital
    including 17 in intensive care).
3. Mr Gilroy has linked with Brian Harrison {ACI, North Western Region) as
    the emphasis in matters is now likely to shift from Sheffield to
    Liverpool. It is understood that Mr D Mason, Director of Social
   Services, Liverpool,/had travelled to Sheffield on Saturday night and t
   had briefed himself dn the situation* Mrs Gibson (SSI, North West) was
    to attend a crisis meeting in Liverpool on Sunday morning with the
   Director and his senior staff to decide on an action plan re services
    there.                _                         -          _
      9 30 AM - MONDAY           -           ~ “ -                 -
4, I spoke to Neil Kay to get an update on the situation. He informed me
   that they had continued with their provisions throughout Sunday. Early
   on Sunday evening he had allowed his tired social work staff to go home
   and a team of social workers from Doncaster had relieved them until
   11 pm when they had shut the contact centre down* They were now picking
   up further work at the local Divisional Office in Sheffield, A further
   meeting with Liverpool SSD representatives was being held this morning.

5. Neil Kay praised the way his staff and social work staff frcca other
    local authorities had responded to the situation. He knew for instance
    that as well as the team from Doncaster, social workers frcsn Derbyshire,
    Barnsley, Tharnesside and Liverpool had been involved in Sheffield. Some
    who had been visiting the area just called in and spontaneously offered
    their services.
6. As far as Neil Kay knew there were no fatalities concerning people frcm
   Sheffield.
7. I trust Mrs Hall and Mr Pearson will inform Division re these matters.

   information regarding matters in Sheffield:

Note for regional file


1.   16 April 1989 - telephone call from Brian Harrison indicating that he
     had a telephone call from David Gilroy who had been present in Sheffield
     following the football disaster at the Sheffield stadium. David Mason
     had been present at sane stage and it was said that all families who had
     been bereaved had been offered help by a Sheffield social worker.
     Offers of help were flooding in and there was concern about co­
     ordination.

2.   I telephoned Liverpool SSD duty team and was advised that there was to
     be a Merseyside planning meeting at 11 o'clock that day.

3.   I attended the meeting which apart from one or two "members" from Wirral
     there was officer representations from major voluntary organisations
     such as the Salvation Arat/, Catholic Social Services and the four local
     authorities in addition to Liverpool. Cheshire were not represented at
     this meeting. I was informed that offers of help were flooding in and
     social workers from all the neighbouring authorities were offering
     their services.

4.   A team of social workers, mainly from Alder Hey had gone to Sheffield
     the previous night to try and offer help to Merseyside families. There
     had been very little information available about the victims and David
     Mason described graphically the problems for relatives with this dearth
     of information concerning the casualties.

5.   The meeting had been called to work out a response to the situation and
     present were Michael Stewart and                    from the Centre for
     Crisis Psychology. I had also been informed that an offer of help had
     been received from the member of staff who had co-ordinated the Bradford
     disaster response.    The two consultants from the Centre for Crisis
     Psychology had come     that morning and were offering their help free.
     Their input to the meeting was first rate.

6.   We were informed there was as yet no composite list of people.
     Superintendent Pauline Clare from Southport had been nominated by the
     police authorities to liaise with the Sheffield police.      She arrived
     later during the morning and was given a base from which to operate. In
     fact information concerning the dead and casualties had still not been
     received by 6.00pm that evening although it was heard that information
     on 24 positively identified had been prepared by fax and was being
     brought along to SSD.

7.   The representatives were there to discuss setting       a help line and
     more particularly a counselling service. The point was made there were
     three particular and separate groups of victims who would need help.
     The families of the bereaved, the families of/and persons themselves who
     had been injured seriously or even less seriously and all the people who
     had been involved in the situation, potentially 20,000. Reference was
     made to co-ordinate information about potential victims in order to
     offer a counselling service. There was some discussion about providing
     computer information and there was clearly same expertise available
     here.
11.   Damers

      Danger of bad feelings getting exaggerated. The problems of interagency
      rivalry both inside agencies and between agencies.      The problems of
      voyeurism.   The consultants pointed out the importance of recognising
      rivalry within and between agencies and also the isolation of staff who
      are still involved in ongoing counselling to victims. After a while
      their own colleagues begin to resent their involvement with a small case
      load.   Need for protection and support for these staff over a long
      period.

12.   Crisis theory

      Consultants went on to discuss the nature of the help required and the
      fact that initially relatives do not hear information, the projection
      and the displacement of angry feelings etc. Crisis theory applies. A
      debriefing of staff and the importance of staff being trained and being
      supported. Notion of newsletter being made available and the importance
      of self help groups.




13.   Decisions made by the Merseyside group

13.1 There was commitment to working together and having a Merseyside
     response based on Liverpool help line which was set up with 11 lines-
     telephone number 051 225 3413/14.       Consultants provided emergency
     training for the first and second teams to man the help line. It was
     agreed that the phones should be manned for 24 hours from a central
     number and reference was made to this having been continued for a year
     in Kent.   Local authorities agreed to provide cover for this 24 hour
     help line after Liverpool's initial manning of it.

13.2 It was recognised the as important to link in with the football d u b and
     the supporters club. Private line 051 263 1760. It was understood they
     were being inundated by enquiries etc and there were plans to have a
     drop in centre there.

13.3 Liverpool were planning a drop in centre and were trying to identify
     locations for this.     It was hoped to do this in association with
     Liverpool supporters club but this did not transpire.

13.4 Practical problems

      Reference was made to the need to respond requests for help in relation
      to practical problems and not to too quickly offer counselling when
      practical problems were the main issue. There were lots of offers of
      practical help, transport etc etc.

13.5 Political co-ordination at member level was deemed as potentially
     problematic particularly if Liverpool was being seen to take a lead.
     The officers were committed to a Merseyside approach but recognised the
     need to work closely with members who would want to be seen to be making
     their own particular response to the problem.

13.6 Need for feedback into a central system was recognised.
13.7 Each local authority agreed to identify a team of people in each local
      authority to deal with referrals and to undertake the personal outreach
      work. These teams would need to be trained.

                 was there representing the DHA and he had agreed to liaise
      with Region and thought he would probably be asked to co-ordinate the
      health authority response.    It was agreed that each local authority
      needed a central emergency number.

14.   The meetincr with middle managers

      I went into a meeting with middle managers to brief them with the AD
      Fieldwork following the meeting with the two consultants and senior
      managers.   Their commitment to helping was incredible and there were
      innumerable offers of help from voluntary agencies including Compass,
      (counselling agency)

15.   Central information

      As information was received and telephone numbers set up, the names of
      key people and telephone numbers were placed on a central board in
      Liverpool SSD. Another team of social workers went to Sheffield.

16.   EHA involvement

      Rory Duff indicated to me that he had discussions with RHA and there was
      to be a briefing meeting with representatives from all the districts the
      following day. He was keen to be involved in the co-ordinated response
      and wished also to plug into training. He recognised the importance of
      letting the help line know of information relating to survivors who barf
      been transferred over to Liverpool hospitals. Already information was
      being received in Sefton about people presenting at hospitals.


17.   5.00pm meeting

17.1 Representatives from the local authority had reconvened again. There
     had been a number of press meetings and the next one was planned for
     Monday lunch time on April 17 1989. The single route in through the
     help line had been set up and the press had been informed that help
     would be available no matter how trivial the request was. Nine social
     workers had been to Sheffield.     Liverpool would staff the help line
     until lunch time 17 April.    Carole Wilkinson was to co-ordinate help
     from other local authorities to staff the help line. Miss Farrell at
     Sefton was nominated to co-ordinate the input from voluntary
     organisations. It was agreed that meetings would be held in Liverpool
     and other SSD representatives would attend. In this way David hoped to
     share the involvement of the Merseyside Directors to prevent "members"
     feeling that this was a Liverpool takeover.
17.2 Active visiting

    Once again it was stressed that there would need to be visiting to
    families.   This needed to be clearly co-ordinated and required an
    administrative process to co-ordinate it.

17.3 Training

    There was discussion about the need for training and the two consultants
    talked about packages they had set up for the Piper Alpha disaster and
    the Clapham train disaster.     It was agreed that some training co­
    ordination plan should be worked up using the two consultants and David
    Evans from Wirral was nominated to discuss a package with a view to
    presentation to the next meeting of the local authorities. My help was
    specifically sought in relation to this.
18.   TRAINING PACKAGE

18.1 Agreed as a possible training package need for four one day events - one
     for senior managers ?20 April, one for health managers ?19 April, one
     for politicians on Saturday of that week 22 April and one for middle
     managers on 21st April. It was also felt a multi-disciplinary training
     day would be useful and the need for a newsletter and daily briefing.

18.2 Local authorities seemed to be wanting courses to train their staff and
     we finally decided to suggest 6 groups for 12 staff but with mixed
     groups of staff from the local authorities so that there was no pecking
     order in relation to which local authority received their training in
     advance of another. NB - already information being received indicated
     that the dead were certainly not all from Liverpool.

18.3 It was also suggested by myself that Directors may wish to offer
     additional places to neighbouring authorities. Already Wigan had been
     identified as a neighbouring local authority with lots of Liverpool
     supporters. Dates were agreed for potential three day courses. Two in
     the week 24-28 April two courses in the week 15-20 May, two courses in
     the week 29 May to 3 June. Consultants charge £500 per day. I urged
     the need for liaising closely with training officers and the consultant
     indicated he would be happy to run a course in conjunction with a
     training officer although, the training officer would need to be well
     briefed and prepared.

18.4 The consultant shared the nature of the training which seemed to be
     quite intensive over a three day period but of high calibre. Cost of
     the training for eacih local authority worked out at about £12,000 for
     each local authorities (6) and this did not take into account the
     possibility of residential courses which would clearly increase the
     cost.   At that stage of the discussion no venue was identified for
     training.

18.5 It was agreed that the training package be presented to the Merseyside
     Directors at the meeting on Monday 17 April at 4.00pm. Again I was
     specifically asked to alert Directors to this and perhaps to raise it at
     ADSS meeting on 20 April 1989. NB - may be useful to raise with the
     Department the possibility of financial assistance for training.

19.   Information on victims

      As at Sunday evening 16 April 1989 94 people were reported dead, 47 were
      injured and still in hospital, 24 people had been positively identified
      and most of them were from Merseyside. It had been indicated £5,000,000
      was to be donated to the appeal fund from central Government. £100,000
      had been promised by Liverpool PC.

FOOTBALL DISASTER. PTT.TfifinRfTTiff. SHEFFTFTD

1.   The Director of Liverpool Social Services Department and leader of
      Council went to Sheffield on Saturday 15 April with a team of social
     workers who were skilled bereavement counsellors from Alder Hey
     Hospital.

2.   IXiring Saturday there lots of offers of help of a practical nature
     including transport from all manner of sources.

3.   Sunday 16 April offers of help continued and Merseyside social workers
     presented themselves at Liverpool SSD to offer help.

4.   One of the principal difficulties on the Sunday was lack of information
     about victims and those injured and problems in Sheffield of co­
     ordinating activity and information.

5.   There was an additional problem of telephone lines being jammed.

6.   The 11.00am meeting on 16 April was held for representatives of the
     Merseyside local authorities.    Senior management from the Merseyside
     authorities came to this meeting and there were a number of
     representatives from other voluntary organisations and also some
      "members" of local authorities.

7.   Help line was set up - 051 225 3413/14 with 11 lines. This was manned
     by a team of Liverpool social workers who had had brief training from
     the two consultants from the Centre for Crisis Psychology who had come
     up early that morning to provide their advice and assistance free.
     Their input was invaluable in quickly acquainting members of the group
     to the implications of the kind of services required.

8.   The other local authorities agreed to assist in manning the 'help line'
     after the initial two days.

9.   Directors quickly committed themselves to buying in consultancy help and
      acknowledged the need for a long term approach to the aftermath of the
     disaster.

10. The Directors wanted a co-ordinated approach but reference was made also
    to the political dimension and the possibility of '•members11 wishing to
    take same unilateral action in their individual authorities.
t
    11.   There were plans for a drop in centre in Liverpool.           Some local
          authorities had already planned this in their own areas and reference
          was made to the need to co-ordinate activity and information.

    12.   The need to liaise with the football supporters club was acknowledged.

    13.   Each local authority then went away for discussion with their own staff
          and managers.

    14. Hie representatives reconvened later that afternoon. Each had set up a
        central telephone number in their own local authority for the help line
        to pass on referrals to and to receive local requests for help or
        information.

    15.   On the Sunday afternoon social work volunteers from the Merseyside local
          authorities had a brief induction from the two consultancy staff to
          equip them for the task that faced them.

    16.   It was agreed that local authorities would consolidate a team to be
          trained for outreach work on a longer term basis.

    17. Information about the dead was not available centrally and had only been
        made available through informal and external sources and not through the
        police.

    18. Superintendent Pauline Clare, based in Southport, had been nominated by
        the police to liaise with Sheffield police in order to provide
         information about the victims. Regrettably by the end of the afternoon
        although information was promised on 24 positively identified dead, it
        had not yet reached SSD.

    19.   Senior managers were made aware of the need to protect the pool of staff
          identified to undertake ongoing work and the long term commitment was
          recognised.

    20.   The Unit General Manager from Liverpool EHA was present at all the
          meetings. He had been liaising with the regional general manager and
          was convening a meeting of representatives from the DBAs.        He was
          committing the Mersey health authorities to a co-ordinated response and
          promised to make available information to the help line on patients who
          had been transferred to Liverpool from Sheffield hospitals and also
          patients who presented in local hospitals/casualty. It was anticipated
          that a number of survivors would be transferred to the neurological unit
          at Walton Hospital.

    21.   Miss Farrell DSS Sefton agreed to co-ordinate contact with and help from
          the voluntary sector on behalf of the Merseyside Directors. They would
          all send representatives to a meeting.

    22.   Wirral throu^i 1   '        was nominated to work out a plan for staff
          training.

    23.   There was a commitment by the local authorities to engage the two
          consultants from the Centre for Crisis Psychology in the ongoing
          training programme and to work alongside the local authorities in the
          first stages of briefing planning and debriefing etc.

    24.       Training

              I met with the two consultants and the representative from Wirral to
              discuss the possible training plan.      A number of one day awareness
              training days were identified for the very near future for senior
              managers, health managers, politicians and middle managers and a
              possible multi-disciplinary day and it was agreed to suggest six three
              day workshops for groups of 12 staff initially to be made available for
              the Merseyside local authorities although there was some discussion
              about the possibility of making places available to other local
              authorities in the region or, if necessary, putting on additional three
              day courses. In order to avoid possible competition and rivalry it was
              agreed that it should be suggested to Directors that the courses have
              mixed membership from the local authorities.


    Comment

              After vftiat appeared chaotic and unco-ordinated, it was impressive to see
              the degree of co-ordination and organisation which took place in
              Liverpool on the Sunday. David Mason's management of the group and the
              planning for ongoing activity was impressive.        Mr Mason managed to
              provide leadership whilst at the same time acknowledging the need for
              other Directors to own the plans, to be very much a part of the plans
              and for the initiative to be Merseyside-wide rather than Liverpool City
              Council led.

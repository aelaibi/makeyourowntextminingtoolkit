            I live             the above with my mother and father.     I have been a Liverpool

            supporter ails
                       il my life.           I do not hold a season ticket at Anfield but I

            attend most home games during a season and travel to some away

            mat ches .

            This year I attended the Football Association Cup Semi final at

           Hi 1 lsbo>tMigh Football Club, Sheffield between my team Liverpool and
                                                               ■.t <il /."7
           Nottingham Falsest.     I obtained my ticket  om                 who is a

            season ticket holder he couldn't go so I had his ticket I paid him £6

            (six pounds)          for the ticket which was to stand in the Leppings Ln

            te r races.

           On the day of the matcl\j3aturday 15 April             1989 (150489)       I attended the

           match with my friend

            telephone no                   We travelled down to Sheffield in my car leaving
                                                                                                 P A n Fr   2


             Runcorn at about    1000 am.
                                        We did not stop anywhere on route to
                                      Tr^A-i^ic.
             Sheffield the only delays we had were going over Snake Pass for about
                                                       -
             forty minutes this was for the tail back of football traffic on the

             way to Sheffield.

             I. saw no Liverpool     supporters drinking alcohol              whilst on route to

             Sheffield we arrived      in Sheffield at about midday             (1200),   we parked

             near to a train station by the ground,             I cannot      remember the name of

             the road but it was about a 10 minute walk to the Leppings Ln end of

             the ground.    After    parking the car we walked to the ground it would

             have been about    1213 pm when we got some fish and chips and a can of

             pop and we sat on a wall       opposite the chip shop by a garage which                   is

             on Leppings Ln after we had finis+ied the chips we walked out to the

             river bridge and sat on a g^ass bank\ wa it ing for two friends who we
                                                                      Cs so    Gwzj-yxz   /j U
             had arranged to meet.       The oril'Wtime I V a w Liverpool          fans drinking

             alcohol   from cans was at the time >tie were having our chips.                 There

             were a few with cans but they w e r e n ’t drunk.           There was no disorder or

             fighting at all.       During our walk to the Leppings Ln entrance                  I did

             not   receive any Police direction.            I just followed the large amount of

             people although I did see Police officers scattered around Leppings

             Ln.    I d o n ’t know how long we sat on the grass bank for it was for a

             good hour, we hadn't seen our friends.              I saw that the crowds were

             gathering by the outer gates and by the river bridge so we decided to

             make a move.    We moved down to the river bridge and sat on a wall,

             this would have be^q about      tv W S   pm,    (1343)   there was a lot of people

             extended outside         outer gates back around towards the bridge where

             we were sitting.

                turnstiles,   there were no orderly queues just a mass of people pushing

                outside the turnstiles.          I did'"H£>t see any Police or stewards giving
CAT             directions the only Police^          saw at\this   point were the P o l i ce horses
PouC£_
 AT             by ttna^outer gates the two po^Lhsgjnen on the horses were trying to push

L, U            the crowdsXhack and shouting         "Calm down,   calm down"      I attended the

                mgtch last yeaV so I knew which turnstile to use.               I did find

                difficulty finding the turnstiles though because of the amount of

                people outside the ground.          What we did was to walk to the right of

                the turnstiles then we managed to escape the crowd for a bit we were

                then going to move diagonally to the left and try and gain entry to

                the first turnstile to t h ^ 4 ^ f t of a blue gate.    I d o n ’t know what

                time this would have been.          WhiV^t trying to get over to the first

                turnstile on the left there was a ikrge surge of people which moved

                me and               forVards,   we were separated at this point I realise
CAT
C ^ A T i£      that th'EK^large blue ^aba^jwhich was now^dn my left hand side was

 «          ?   open.     Everyfrqe behind surged towards the open gate and I to was

-4 ^            pushed in througlVN^his gate,        therefore I did not hand my ticket in

  /^KnjueJ)     in the normal manner at the turnstiles,            I d o n ’t know who opened the
  Sa            gate,    other than the use of this gate,      I saw no other unauthorised

                entry.    Upon entering the ground things seemed to calm down for

  SstS^J        awhile,   you weren't been pushed so much.          Last year I went down the
     <3^.       tunnel so thats what I did this year,         I didn't realise you could have

                got to more terracing to the left and right by going around the sides,

                I didn't see any directions at all.          We walked towards the tunnel.          I

                cannot Kemember       if I saW\any Police or steward direction at the

                entrance t o \ h e   tunnel.     AtN^his time we had enough room to run

                towards the tunhel when we got \ o ^bout           15 yards to the tunnel

              on the grid, at this position I was                              really crushed with the weight of

              people       coming down on me from behind you c o u l d n ’t move at all from my

               position I couldn’t see what was going on in the other                                    pen behind the

              goal to my right so I did not see the barrier break                                   in this pen.

              After the large surge of people you were surging forward all the time

              due to the amount xif people                            pushing you I M o   know that the match had

               kicked off at this por**t from this position rsjust saw people in front

                of me climbing over the fencing.   I saw the players go off the pitch.

                I was stuck      in that pos ilM^n but 1 d o n ’t know how long for.
                                                 X.          &<XryW~          lh '
               I was     injured in the crush my \ j g h t arm was crushed o n a b a rri e r.                             I

              saw people treading on others                             in an effort to get over the fencing

              ,after a time                  the           pressure of people from behind relieved       itself    it was

              aV\^his         time           I. saw people in frorH) of me who were              lying    dead on the

              terracing but I d i d n ’t witness anyone who died in front or beside me.

              I did not physically assist anyone who was dead or injured the only

              thing     I did was                  pass a young        child forward over my head, who was with

              his father,               the child was              crying.

              The only thing I witnessed that was a factor in the death and injury

              to people was the                            large crush of people against one another on the

              terracing.                I left the ground at about 3.20 pm (1520)                      on my own

              accord.           I waited by the outer gates for a while to see                            if I. could see

                             as we had been separated.                        I d i d n ’t see him so I used a phone

              near to Leppings Ln to phone home.                               I saw nothing which I consider to

          be a criminal    offence.

          After the match was stopped the Police seemed to be standing around

          the perimeter,    looked busy running around,       I saw a police   car driving

          around the    pitch telling    people to make   room on the pitch.     I do not

          think that Notts Forest       should have the biggest end as they are not

          supported as well as Liverpool

          In the ground I did not see any consumption of alcohol           by a supporter.

          When I was     in the pen I \ w    no disturbance    or fighting._______________




          Although I did not hand my ticket         in at the turnstiles   I lost the

          ticket    in the pen from my coat whilst trying to free myself from the

          crush of people.

          Last year    I attended the match and stood in the same pen,         last year    it

          was a push but like a normal       game

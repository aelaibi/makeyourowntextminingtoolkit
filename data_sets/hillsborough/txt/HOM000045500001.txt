REPORT CHAPTER 4




I attach a copy of Chapter 4 of your report, as gone over by me today, together with a copy of
the original version which Graham let me have before Christmas.

2.     I have added a few short paragraphs at the start of the Chapter and at the beginning
and end of your discussion of Paul Taylor (see paragraphs 1 to 3, 52-3, and 69 of the
amended version). Otherwise there are just scattered changes in the interest, I hope, of
increased clarity.

3.     I am now looking at the remaining Chapters 5 and 6 and the Appendices before
moving on as agreed to put together a brief summary (to stand as Chapter 7). I will feed
these to you by post as I do them but should in any case have all of them ready for when you
are here next Wednesday (January 7).

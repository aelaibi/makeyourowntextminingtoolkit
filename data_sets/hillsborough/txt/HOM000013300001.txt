                        Thank you for your letter of 3 JulY» in your capacity as
                                                          </*
                                 of the Police Consultative Committee for the
                                     about the costs of the inquiries by the West
                        Midlands police into the Hillsborough Stadium Tragedy.

                        The Home Secretary has accepted, in his reply of 28 April
                        to a Parliamentary Question from Mr Beaumont-Dark and in
                        his letters to other West Midland MPs, that the
                        additional costs of the police inquiries which are being
                        undertaken in relation to the disaster by West Midlands
                        police officers should not fall on the West Midlands
                        Police Authority.

                         "Additional costs" include the cost of overtime worked by
                         the West Midlands police offices in their own force area
                         to cover duties which would otherwise have been
                         undertaken by officers seconded to the Hillsborough
                         inquiry.
  He also mentioned that it will take a while to sort out
  the precise mechanics of how the West Midlands police
  should be reimbursed.

A * recently met members of the South Yorkshire Police
   Authority to discuss their concerns and to put a proposal
   to them about how the costs should be met. tfejaJwer also
   written to them about the proposal, which they are
   considering.

  Ao you know,        also previously met a deputation
  from the West Midlands Police Authority to discuss this
                anxious to reach agreement on the
  reimbursement of West Midlands police costs.    hope the
  proposal that we have put to South Yorkshire Police
  Authority will help to achieve this.

  With regard to the efficiency of the West Midlands police
  and the service it can offer, **4^have been assured by Mr
  Dear, the Chief Constable of the West Midlands police
  that the duties of the officers absent from the force
  conducting the inquiries have been covered by other
  personnel working overtime. The Chief Constable said
  that there has been no diminution of service to the
  people of the West Midlands and no lowering of police
  efficiency.

  You will be interested to know that when the Enquiry
  began, something in excess of 350 staff were involved.
  This was reduced on 5 June to 125 and will be reduced
  again on 17 July to 65.

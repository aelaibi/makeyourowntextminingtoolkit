Dear Mr Bloore

Hillsborough Disaster Memorial

Thank you for your letter of 25 August 1998 on the above subject. Your letter was
addressed to Mr Wells; he has now retired from the police service. Mr M I Hedges, the new
Chief Constable, has asked me to reply on his behalf.

There is a memorial in Liverpool to those who died in the disaster. There is a memorial
near the Hillsborough Stadium. It is entirely a matter for Sheffield W ednesday Football
Club whether they agree to the erection of a memorial on their premises. Whilst I see the
logic of your proposal, I have learned that well intentional intervention by South Yorkshire
Police on this tragic topic, is often misconstrued.      For that reason, I hope you will
understand if I do not express the support you seek.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

Dear Mr Wells.

I am the Chairman of the above Supporters' Club and a National Council Member o f The National
Federation o f Football Supporters' Clubs.

I enclose copies of two letters sent to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

The reason I am writing to you is to ask for your support in our campaign to have a proper fitting memorial
sited at Hillsborough for the Victims of the disaster.

In view o f the extreme vendetta (I feel personally speaking in someways unwarranted) waged against your
officers by the families of the victims this may seem an unusual request. I hope by your support that part of
this animosity ean be removed. I have spoken to Mr Hicks on numerous occasions and have actually argued
the Officers case with him. He always comes down to the facts that neither Sheffield Wednesday nor The
South Yorkshire police will accept that they were part of the problems leading up to and after the disaster.
Maybe by helping us to get a proper memorial sited at the ground will remove part o f their animosity and
help them to come to terms with some of their undoubted psychological problems.

I would hope that you can convince Mr Richards that a meeting between yourself, Mr Richards and me could
finally put in motion the process to erect a suitable memorial in time for the TENTH ANNIVERSARY.

I can be contacted on any o f the above numbers.
Yours Sincerely

Dear Mr Richards.
I wrote to you on 20 January 1997 (copy o f the letter is enclosed) reference a Memorial to be placed at
Hillsborough for the victims o f the disaster in 1989.

I received a reply stating that Sheffield Wednesday did not think it appropriate at that the other memorials
were sufficient.

I would point out as stated in my last letter that this request has the backing o f the National Federation of
Football Supporters' club which represents nearly    ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT CLUBS
within the organization.

We are not an out and out militant organization that wants to persecute Sheffield Wednesday. Personally
speaking I do not feel Sheffield Wednesday did anything wrong that day and in some ways I excuse the Police
as well. It was unfortunate that on that day the innocents were the victims, this includes both those that died
and those that remain living.

              knows me well from our association when he was at Barnsley. I am sure he will verify that I
am not a person out to cause trouble and that I behave in a responsible correct manner in my dealings with
people.

In view o f the TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DISASTER APPROACHING I would request a meeting
with yourself to discuss the possibility o f you revising your earlier decision.

I can be contacted on any o f the above numbers.
Yours Sincerely___________________________

occassion I w as accom panied by a n o th e r B arnsley S upporter.A s he had never been to the
memorial before I asked him to find it for his self. He w ent to the Leppings Lane end of your
ground expecting it to be in th a t vicinity as th a t w as where the disaster happened.I told him                Com m ittee
it w as not there and th a t he w ould have to ask people passing by fo r directions. A fte r asking

decided at tha t point w h at an exam ple it w ould set to visiting supporters from abroad that
obviously w ere aw are o f the disaster and m ay w a nt to visit the m em orial them selves.

A fte r this visit w e both decided to try to get A P R O PE R MEMORIAL put up in the rightfull

2 ,T hat by placing a m em orial at H illsborough could be seen as an adm ission of guilt on the
part of S heffield W e d ne sd ay into the disaster,S om ething W e dnesday have always denied.

W e have taken these answ ers back to the relevant m eetings and both forum s cannot
agree with these reasons fo r the follow ing points.
Point 1,Everybody knows o f the disaster that happened at Hillsborough. Therefore I am sure that
the people working at Hillsborough know full well of the disaster and will have been through
varying parts o f the lead up to the disaster as part o f their training. So having a memorial will not
adversely affect them. I myself cannot walk into Hillsborough and fail to remember the scenes
shown on television.

Point 2, Whether Sheffield Wednesday like it or not the Taylor report did put some o f the blame
down to the organisation at Hillsborough. Even so putting up a memorial is NO ADM ISSION of
any guilt and nobody would see it that way. There is a MASSIVE MEMORIAL at Lockabie, is
that an admission that the people o f Lockabie were in some way to blame for the bomb on the
plane.

The main reasons behind our request are as follows.

1, Hillsborough happened and as such a proper MEMORIAL should be in place at the scene of
the disaster, not stuck away in a little makeshift garden that is not properly looked after, well
away from the ground. When I was doing further research into the memorial I was astonished to
find out there was in fact another one in the park. I did not know this one existed. This is a further
indication o f the need for a Memorial at Hillsborough itself.

2, All football supporters owe a debt of gratitude to the 96 supporters who died at Hillsborough as
well as those that were injured and still suffering because o f Hillsborough. This is because o f the
VAST improvements in Grounds and facilities as a result o f the Taylor report. It would be a
fitting reminder to those visiting Hillsborough. It would also enable them to pay their respects,
and act as a reminder o f what can happen if people behave irresponsibly.

3, Clubs also owe to same debt, because without Hillsborough the Vast amount o f money that
was made available for ground redevelopment would not have been available. Your club itself has
benefited a lot through these grants and have enabled you to carry out vast redevelopment. Some
o f which undoubtably resulted in your ground being selected as a Euro 96 ground.

I was firmly against ALL SEATER stadiums and the Taylor report at the time it was published, I
have to say now that I was W RO N G , the advent o f all seater stadia in the top two divisions and
the requirement for clubs to upgrade as proved beneficial for the game and made it better for the
supporters and ultimately for the clubs, I am sure you will agree.
W ITHOUT HILLSBOROUGH I DOUBT VERY MUCH IF THIS WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED.

I personally believe that all grounds that have received grants for Re-Development should have
some sort o f memorial to the victims o f Hillsborough as an acknowledgement to their sacrifice.

On the behalf o f the above Supporters club and all member clubs o f the National Federation of
Supporters clubs may I ask your Board o f Directors to reconsider their decision not to allow a
memorial to be placed at the Leppings lane end o f your ground.
If you agree the actual siting and size can be discussed then. Any cost o f such a memorial would
be met, therefore it would cost Sheffield Wednesday FC nothing and could be seen as a sign that
you as a club are willing to take Supporters views into account when making decisions.

In view o f the impending anniversary o f the disaster a quick response would be appreciated.

If you want to discuss this further before making your decision, I am available on the above
telephone numbers.


Yours Sincerely


Alan Bloore

Thank you for forwarding a copy of your letter to the Editor of the Times dated 4 December

when they should have been enjoying a game of football.

Thank you once again for taking the time to express your views regarding this matter.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir,

Re- Police Claim on Soccer Disaster, Friday December 4th 1998.

I am saddened by the continuing adverse publicity for the police at the Hillsborough football disaster.

As a priest then in the                                   , I too was there and worked non-stop for 24 hours
caring for the bereaved. Many of them ended up 300 yards from our vicarage on Uppethorpe Road to
identify lost ones at the City morgue. I still find myself overcome with emotion by the experience.

The police have had a raw deal. They may have made some mistakes in crowd handling, but I believe the
real reason for the problem was the enormous number of drunken fans who got out of control.

I know it is politically incorrect to say such things, but I believe there are large numbers of guilty fans from
that day who are only too happy to let the police be the scapegoats. I heard too many stories afterwards of
drunken fens urinating in local gardens before the match to believe otherwise.

Yours sincerely,
                                                                 Ian Daines, BA(Hons) Dip.Ed.

Dear

Thank you for your letter dated the 15^ April 1999, in which you enclosed the article from the
Liverpool Echo.

As I have responsibility for matters relating to the Hillsborough tragedy, your letter was forwarded on
to me from our Force solicitor, Alan Walker.

Your time and effort is appreciated in so clearly stating your observations and feelings in relation to
this article, but please try not to let your instant reaction be too consuming. With a disaster of the
nature and magnitude of Hillsborough, a host of reactions from a spectrum of people, all with
differing viewpoints, is perfectly natural. This is one such viewpoint.

Anyone with a desire to be fully appraised of the facts in relation to Hillsborough may do so by
referring to the public documents resulting from the independent inquiries.

Your letter will be added to a file collating evidence relating to Hillsborough, but as I'm sure you are
aware after examining all available evidence the Home Secretary has decided no further inquiry is
warranted at this time.

Thank you for writing, your letter will be kept on file for reference.

Yours sincerely,




Ian Daines         ^

Your kind comments have been noted and I thank you for your support o f the South Yorkshire

     I feel 1 must write to you to express my disgust at the recent
decision to prosecute the two Police Officers in respect of the
Hillsborough disaster,
     Can we hope the defence Barristers will come out on the attack? Only
Brian Clough seems to have put the blame where it really belongs, namely
on the Liverpool supporters One gets the impression all their supporters
are angels yet who caused the Heysel tragedy? I firmly believe that any
so called supporter who was in the Leppings Lane area without a ticket
played an important part in the ensuing tragedy, For instance the video
shows them climbing over the wall to get into the ground. How were the
Police expected to know how many people were, therefore, inside? Also
people without tickets would be in the way of legitimate ticket holders,
thus creating a build up leading to pushing and shoving, placing a
burden on the Police that should not have arisen,
     Had someone been crushed to death outside the ground because of
this, no doubt the knives would have been out and an enquiry as to why
the Police did not open the Gates! It would seem the Police were in a no
win situation
     Also what about the part that alcohol (as usual) played in all this?
Surely there are many Publicans who can testify as to the state in which
some of the so called fans left for the ground.
     Why was there no trouble at the Spion Kop end of the ground? Could
it be all the best Policemen were sent to that end, or as is more likely
were the Forest fans better behaved?
     I relise that the Leppings Lane end was more difficult to Police
than the Kop end, but remember pre-war there were 72,000 to watch
Wednesday play Manchester City when it was non- ticket, therefore a
•'First come first served basis" yet there was no problem that day and
people were just as eager to get inside to see the game.
     Could it be then that todays policeman is not as good as his pre-war
counterpart, or is todays so called supporter without the intelligence,
manners, politeness and respect of law and order possessed by his or her
Grandparents? I think we all know the answerto that one!
     1 hope you do not mind me writing to you but I feel so incensed at
the injustice of it all that when as I hope and believe, the Officers
are acquitted, and the people seeking vengeance (not justice in my
opinion) are finally silenced and told to get on with their lives then I
shall be one very happy man


                                                  Sincerely,
Dear Mr. Duckenfield and Mr. Murrey

I felt that I must write to express my horror at the fact that you are to go to court over the
Hillsborough disaster.

I as a mother, wife etc. understand fully the grief o f the relatives and friends o f those who
died on that terrible day: they were the relatives o f the genuine fans who arrived at the
ground in plenty o f time. But don't these same relatives realise, as do so many thousands o f
people around the country, that the people who caused the trouble are the fans who thought
they could have just one more drink in the pub, or thought they could get in by arriving at the
very last minute.

It is a maddening situation for an outsider such as I who can only read the reports in the
newspapers. I feel for your misery and hope that you come out on the right site o f justice.

PEOPLE WHO SPENT TOO MUCH TIME IN THE PUB WERE THE CULPRITS, NOT
YOU AND YOUR OFFICERS.
                                                                         South Yorkshire Ponce

My very best wishes to you both.
                                                                             29 1U11999

           Chief Constable                              15th. June, 2000



Dear Chief Constable,

                                   Ever since the Hillsborough disaster,,

like Bryan Clough,      I have always thought that the Liverpool

supporters brought this tragedy upon themselves.

                                   Surely,   on big match days, for safety

sake, the police always limit the number of tickets,            so it follows

that if only supporters with tickets had turned up there would

have been no one outside anyway .             That people do arrive without

ticivets is not only confirmed by the mob outside,           but on one of

the BBC's tapes showing the rescue operation on the pitch, a

Liverpool nan actually admitted that he never bothers to buy a

ticket because the police always let him in.

                                   I feel sorry for your two officers, who

in my opinion,      were placed in a 1Ho w i n ’ situation.      With hindsight,

I suppose the gates should not have been opened,            but had they not

done so,   I am certain that fatalaties would have ocnmrFed outside

the ground,      and they would now be charged with not opening the gates!

                                   I hope you do not mind an old pensioner

writing to you,      but I am always amazed at the injustices that

happen in this country,          and being powerless to do 'anything about it.

I would like to see the law changed so that parents,            teachers and

Courts could bring some-sort of corporal punishment to bear on some

of these teenaged tearaways without being victimised themselves.

                                   Before the war,   'Six of the best'   at

school and a clip around the ear by a bobby on the beat did me no

harm at all.       But that's another story.


                                Yours sincerely.
                                                            3 July 2000

Thank you for your letter that I received today, with regard to your concerns over the
availability o f television coverage o f the Hillsborough disaster in the ongoing
proceedings.

reason I have forwarded your letter for the information o f Assistant Chief Constable
Ian Daines, who is responsible for liaison on this matter.

I am informed that both the defence and prosecution solicitors have had access to all
such footage, and prepared their cases accordingly. Assistant Chief Constable Daines
has asked me to extend his thanks to you for your observations, and hopes that you are
assured that such coverage has not been overlooked.

Dear Sir or Madam

On the afternoon of the Hillsborough disaster I was watching
sport on television.  Shortly before the disaster the programme
briefly went over to Hillsborough, and showed pictures of
Liverpool fans arriving late, pressing to get into the ground.
These pictures are germane to the trial that is now taking
place of the police officers who were in charge of operations
at the ground on that day.  The pictures should be in the
television company's archives.  The programme was almost
certainly "Grandstand" on BBC 1, but I cannot be absolutely
certain about this.

I would be grateful if you would forward copies of this letter
to the defence and prosecution lawyers so that the court may be
made aware of this evidence if it is not already.

Yours faithfully

           I am a single man and I live at the above address with my mother,,               I

           have two brothers,- one of whom,                lives next door at

                   1*1iga n &

           I have been a supporter of Everton FC for as long as I can remember

           and I intended to get a ticket for the FA Cup Semi-Final fixture

           between Everton and Norwich to be held at Villa P k , Bi rmi ngham-

           Unf o rtunately I could not get a ticket but as               had tickets for the

           other semi-final involving Liverpool and Nottingham Forest to be held

           at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield,           I decided to go with him*     The

           tickets he had were          6 tickets for the standing area for Leppings Ln„

                    got these tickets on Friday 14th April 1989 (140489) and it was

           the following day that we travelled to Sheffield by coach to watch the

           game.       The coach we travelled by was Eavesway Travel, Ashton-in-
                                                                        PAGE      2


'Makerfield and at around 11 am (1100) we mat the coach in Billinge*

We also travelled with

friend who we have known for many years and Vincent Fitzsimmons,          a lad

who I had never met before.        Vincent was one of the 95 people who died

that day.

Anyway we left _________ at about 11 (1100) or 12 o ’clock (1200) and

travelled to Manchester via M62 and then through Buxton on A class

roads.     There were heavy traffic delays through Manchester and we

eventually arrived in Sheffield at 2*50 pm*        (1450)   We had been

stopped once    about 10 miles out of Sheffield by the Police*      A

policewoman and a policeman boarded the coach to check for alcohol and

tickets but their check was very brief.

By the time we arrived in Sheffield, we were warned that we may miss

the kick off.    There were a lot of coaches building up behind us

containing Liverpool fans M/ho, as I thought, had also been delayed in

traffic.    When we got off the coach we decided to run to the ground.

We had parked in Halifax Rd and ran to the along Halifax Rd,

Pennistone Rd and Leppings Ln.        We saw a lot of police officers lined

,up along the route but did not receive directions from any*        However,

there were also a lot of Liverpool supporters making their way to the

ground all of whom appeared to know their way so there was no need for

directions to be given.        Some of these supporters I saw drinking

alcohol from    cans but the mood was good and    I certainly did not see

any fighting    or drunkenness.     We arrived to the entrance to the ground

at about 2*55 pm*     (1455)    We were met by a large group of supporters

outside who were shouting for the opening of gates.         The gates I refer

to are these blue iron gates at the entrance which were closed when we

arrived.     I was very worried at one stage because the crowd were

shoutng aggressively at the police to open the gates and I formed the

opinion that had the gates not been opened there was an element of the
                                                                                              7
                                                                                 PAGE     3


crowd who would have caused trouble*

After about 2 minutes we had reached a position nearer to the iron

gates*     We had been carried and jostled about to the position rather

than gone the re by chance.           I also felt that had the gates not been

opened people outside would have been injured in the crush which at

that time was worse than I have experienced before.                    There was a line

of three police horses outside the gates which we had been carried

past„     As we got past and neare r the gates one of the po1i ce officers

on horseback, a male, was shouting to some people that they were

mental, referring to the i r behaviour as they ducked unde r po1i ce

horses ,

At about 2.57 pm (1457) the two sets of gates outside the ter race

turnstiles opened*        I didn’t see M/ho opened them*            As they did the

crowd caused us to break into a steady trot and as we crossed the area

outside the turnstiles a police officer said,                 "Keep to your right

1ads?"     We did this and came to a halt behind a group of supporters

who were waiting outside a blue cage like gate, the one nearest the

river.     As we had crossed the area outside the turnstiles we noticed

that despite the crowd people did not seem to be going through

turnstiles.     I saw people climbing over the turnstile area into the

ground*     I saw the Policeman on top of the turnstiles stopping people

getting over but he was alone and unable to cope.

Anyway we had been waiting in the crowd outside the cage like gate for

only a minute    or so d u r i n g w h i c h   time   everybody,   including myself,

were impatient a s     time was getting on.            As the crowd built up outside

once again the re was a heavy crush and people M/e re shout ing for the

gates to be opened*

Suddenly the gate opened and there was a strong influx of supporters

into the ground*      We all headed for a tunnel unaware that access to

the terraces could be gained in other ways.                  As we headed along tunnel
                                                                          PAGE


*1 joined in with the rest of the supporters singing,        "We’re on the

march with Kenny’s army," which, being an Everton supporter,          I was not

too happy with.       The tunnel was very packed and I had no choice as to

where I went, with all the singing we couldn’t hear anything*              As we

got to the terraces there were people trying to get out but they were

prevented from doing so by the crowd along the tunnel*          As we got to

the terraces we went right into Pen 3 and we were .carried .by the crowd

forward to a position (1) which I have marked on the plan (Exh

No       )    (Ref GR/2.)   At this point I was with o n l y h a v i n g     lost

sight of              and Vincent in the tunnel*    When we got to position

(1) Ian Rush, who had a tracksuit top on, was kicking the ball against

Bruce Grobbelaar who was standing in the goal at our end.          Only

seconds later Ian Rush ran off.        Bruce Grobbelaar turned to applaud

the crowd and I heard a whistle which I assumed was kick off*              At this

point I was approximately 15 feet away from the perimeter fence

directly in line with the gate in the perimeter fence*          I was turned

by the crowd to face toM,'ards the south stand side of the ground, my

right*       I could not see what was going on on the field but I was

panicking as I was having difficulty breathing.          I saw police officers

and camera men rush over to the fencing as people tried to get out

onto the field.       The Police Officers who had approached before telling

people to get back down into the terraces*         Meanwhile I saw a middle

aged police officer stood at the gate doing all he could to assist.

He was obviously aware of what was going on and started bending the

spikes on the fencing over to help people get over.          The pressure

inside the terracing got worse and there was a surge from behind*                At

this time the crowd in front started to fall forward gradually and I

felt myself standing forward on an incline resting on people in front

of me.       I thought people in front of me must have been dropping but

thought that strange as the pressure was so great*          That must have
                                                                     PAGE


been between 3*05 pm (1505) and 3-10 pm*     (1510)    I thought I was

going to fall down and be trampled and I was very frightened*         I tried

to find my feet and to get up I stood on the legs of somebody in

front*   I feel terrible about that now but I was frightened and my

main aim was to get out.    At that time for some reason the pressure

eased off,    I saw a pile of people in front of us.           said, "Come

on Graham, w e ’ve got a chance now," and we turned round and fought our

way back through the terrace ducking under a crush barrier as we did

so.   We got into the tunnel and as we did so we saw a police officer

trying to lift somebody off the ground.     This was at position (2)

which I have marked on the plan.     The police officer asked us to carry

out this man who, at that time, was alive.      We took an arm each and

carried this man out along the tunnel to the courtyard area where we

left him with another police officer*     We then walked through a gap in

a wall to another courtyard to a refreshment stand where we each had a

drink.   After that we walked back to the area outside the tunnel where

      pointed out the man we had carried out.    He was lying on the

floor and two other lads were stood over him.      His hood was up so that

we couldn’t see his face so I assumed he was dead.      We did not

approach him but from his clothing I am sure it was the same man.

He was white, aged late 30s, about 5 ’11 tall, well built.      He had a

few days stubble on his face and he had dark greasy hair which was

straight.    He wore a dark coloured 3/4 length jacket which had a hood.

It looked like it had a large collar and the hood was detachable*

There were a large number of injured people lying around at that time

being attended to but we did not see             ar Vincent*

At that time we decided to leave the ground.     We were aware that

people had died so thought we would phone home*       For this reason we

left the ground and visited a toffee shop where at a cost of         1 we

were allowed to use the telephone.     The man had not asked for the
                                                                       PAGE         6


•money but when I offered it he accepted it*       From there we walked back

to the ground    to look for the others but we were not allowed in*          From

there we went    back to where the coach was parked and eventually

         turned up.   The coach left without Vincent and it was not

until the following day we found out that Vincent had died.

Going back to    my position whilst on the terracing,       I am aware that a

crush barrier    collapsed.I have, however,    learned this from the      media

and was unaware at the time*     I would say,, however,     that on reflection

I was stood somewhere behind it and that people falling foM/ard was

caused by the collapsing of the barrier*

I will add that as we left the ground via the same gate as we had

entered through I saw a steward dressed in a reflective bib stood

outside the main gates on Leppings Ln.        There were a lot of Liverpool

supporters leaving and a lot of police officers stood outside who the

fans were abusing*    I heard the steward say to a group of Liverpool

supporters,   "It’s your own making,11 at which point one of the

supporters hit him, pushing him over a        parked car.   The Police said,

“Leave it out," at which point the crowd dispersed*          I did not see

anything else which I consider to be a        criminal offence.

I have also indicated on a grid (Exh            ) (Ref GR/3)   1 & 2 where     I

stood initially and where I remained throughout the crush.          I have

also provided my ticket (Exh No         ) (Ref GR/1) which I did not hand

in on the day*

I had a few minor injuries such as bruising but no injuries of note*

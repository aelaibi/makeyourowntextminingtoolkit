After     having       parked my         car and a p p ro a ch e d       the ground            I was      s to p pe d by

At about 2.45pm             (1 4 4 ^ h r s ) 1 looked thro ug h and saw Gate C or                   part       of    it'

o p e n , I d i d n ’t see wh y or who            had done        it and a s s u m e d the    fans may

have     been    responsible,           in the ten seconds            it was open before            persons

I couldn't           see   closed the       gate,    large     numbers       of L iv erpool      s up po r te r s

came     in and       into the s tand area.

Later at about 2 . 5 5 p m              (1455hrs>         X looi/ed over and saw all               of gate

'C'    open and a surge              of L iverpool        f a n s / f 1oodi ng through.       1 said          to a

steward      near me        'Bloody he 11 t h e y ’ve JDpened both gates                 now!'      m e an in g

the f a n s , al though           I didn't     see a n j ^ e      opening     the gate o r

a ut h or i si n g    its opening.



A   large    number        came    t h ro ug h to the      left    of the tunnel        towards         my    post

and    I went and stood by the wall                   to save       being    t ra mp le d on by the            fans



I had no        contact w it h the gate             prior     to this     incident and knew

nothing      of any fault            in it or     change     of    policy     regarding      its opening,

other     than by persons             in authority.



I saw none of the              crushing       in the tunnel         or ground area an d was                  not

part     of any of the            incident.         All    I saw was a ma n being            removed from

the tunnel           by four L i ve rp oo l      supp or te rs and      them a t t em p ti n g     to    revive

h irn.



I myself        prior      to the     incident      saw no examples           of d r un ke ne ss    or

hooliganism,           I was      not a s s a u l te d or t hr ea t en e d    in any w ay and saw              no

person,      police or stew ar d act              in any wa y other           than   is usual.

NOTE OF A MEETING HELD ON 24 APRIL 1989

                                                                          A 'W
HILLSBOROUGH FOLLOW-UP                                                                ---


Present:        Home Secretary
                Mr Patten
                Lord Ferrers
                Sir Clive Whitmore
                Mr Turney
                Mr Mower
                Mr Mould
                Mr Lidington
                Mr Yeo
                Mr Walters


        The purpose of the meeting was to consider action in connection with
the    Inquiry   being     conducted   by   Sir    Peter Taylor    into    the Hillsborough
disaster.


2.      The meeting considered first whether any immediate action should be
taken by Government to enhance safety at sports grounds in the period while
Sir Peter's interim report was awaited, and given that the football season
still had several weeks to run.             Sir Clive Whitmore reported that in the
days    following   the disaster officials had           considered     whether     any     fresh
guidance should be issued to local authorities about the exercise of their
powers     to   regulate   safety   at   sports     grounds.    Among     the    possibilities
considered had been fresh guidance on the question of perimeter fences and
the provision of emergency exits.             It was noted       that   a number of local
authorities and football clubs were taking action on their own initiative
to secure fresh improvements in such areas.                The conclusion of officials
had been that further action by the Home Office in such areas should await
Sir Peter's interim report, and this conclusion was endorsed after a short
discussion.      It was agreed, however, that there would be value in issuing a
guidance note to local authorities within the next few days, drawing out a
small number of the key physical security recommendations in the existing
guidance note, which was generally agreed to be clear and comprehensive.
This would concentrate on physical security measures,                   and would not deal
with the issue of command and control,               which was     certain      to come under
scrutiny by Sir Peter.           Officials would prepare the draft of a guidance
note, which might be issued within a w#ek, and would consider how it should
be distributed to local authorities.              The Home Secretary asked that the note
 should be cleared with him before being issued.               (Action:    Mr Turney).
3.      Appreciation was expressed at the way in which Sir Peter had handled
the    intense publicity given to the early stages of his Inquiry.                           It was
understandable that Sir Peter should express               some     concern     at    the    inter­
relationship of the timetable             for his   Inquiry with      the progress of the
football supporters’ legislation, given especially the scale of the police
enquiries    being made and the large number of persons who wished to make
representations     to the Inquiry.         Sir Peter would         face   a major          task   in
compiling an interim report by June/July.                There was a need for the Home
Office to establish a dialogue with Sir Peter which was constructive and
yet did not risk presentation as an attempt to steer the Inquiry.                              As a
first step, it was agreed that the Home Secretary should offer to meet Sir
Peter as soon as possible.        (Meeting now arranged for 6 p.m., 25 April).


4.      In further discussion of the timetable for Sir Peter’s Inquiry, it was
noted that the Government's prime concern would be to know whether Sir Peter
had any substantial reservations on the supporters' membership scheme in his
interim report.     Any comments Sir Peter might wish to offer on the details
of the scheme could be taken into consideration by the Football Membership
•Authority when the scheme was implemented.              It would be counter-productive
to press Sir Peter for detailed comments on the scheme at an early stage,
since he was more likely to be able to offer constructive suggestions,                             if
he wished to, at a later stage of the Inquiry.                 Sir Peter was aware that
the timetable for the Bill had been changed, and this gave him a number of
options,    including the option of offering no comment, when he came to his
interim report.     The Government would need to offer evidence on the safety
legislation and its implementation to the Inquiry.                It seemed unwise for the
Department of the Environment to volunteer evidence on the subject of the
membership scheme unless they were pressed to do so.


5.     It was noted that the Secretary of State for the Environment would be
consulting the football authorities about the way in which a provision for
all-seated stadiums should be added to the Bill.               The initial proposal had
been to attach this requirement            to the licensing powers         of    the Football
Membership    Authority:     it     might be    necessary    to     re-name     the Authority
something    like   the   "Football    Safety   Authority"     in     consequence       of     this
additional    responsibility.         This course   of    action would,       however,        carry
some    disadvantages:      it    would    detach   the     seating    issue         from     other
responsibilities, drawing safety issues and with them the membership scheme
itself towards the Home Office.                   A wholly alternative approach would be to
attach the seating requirement to existing local authority safety certifi­
cation processes, perhaps with a degree of discretion by local authorities
and some kind of central monitoring operation.                         But such a course would be
difficult to pursue in view of political suspicions of the likely response
of     some    local    authorities.         Such    a      major    change     could    alsomean       the
recommitment of the whole Bill to the House of Lords.                             For these reasons,
expanding       the     role     of   the   Football        Membership        Authority,    though       not
necessarily the most logical solution, might prove to be the most practical
one.     Summing up this part of the discussion, the Home Secretary said that
officials would need to discuss the possibilities with DOE, but would need
to keep the Home Office position in reserve to some extent.                                There was a
logical       distinction       between     the    membership        scheme    concept     and physical
safety aspects regulated under Home Office legislation.                               DOE must        remain
responsible       for     the   former,     but    this need not be a conclusive argument
against       attaching    a seating        requirement       to     the   responsibilities       of     the
Football       Membership       Authority,        which     seemed    likely     to   remain the most
promising       course.        Officials    should        enter    discussions    with     DOE   on    this
basis, and report progress to Ministers                     in due course.

   %  Thank you for your letter of 17 April about
the disaster at Hillsborough football ground.

      As you know, I went to the ground on the day
after the tragedy and I visited St Helen's on
Friday, so I have seen something of the grief
inflicted on Merseyside by this terrible event.

      My office will mention your kind offer of
assistance to Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry to Mr
Robert Whalley, the Secretary to the inquiry, (who
is at the above address). I am sure he would be
glad to receive any comments or suggestions which
you are able to provide.

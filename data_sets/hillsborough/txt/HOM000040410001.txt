  -           officer         not        known.            I entered              the     ground           with       the       rest       of    my     serial

              and      other          officers,             informed             that     there           was    trouble             from       the     c r o w d at

              the L e p p i n g s          Lane        end and            that         they    were        invading             the    field.             Once         in

              the      ground           and     onto        the       playing           field        I made       my way             over       to    the

              Leppings            Lane         end.        At      this         time     the        players       were          just       leaving          the

              field.             I could            see     several             supporters            were       climbing             over       t he       crowd

              barrier            of L e p p i n g s        Lane.

              On arrival                at L e p p i n g s         Lane         end     saw       that     the       supporters              were       squashed

              up a g a i n s t          the     fence           and    that        they were              obviously             being        crushed          by

              the      sheer          number          of    fans       behind           them.         I assisted                other        officers             in

              removing            fans         from a           small       gate        situated           to    the          righthand          s id e      of    the

              go al        post s.            The     fans       coming          o ut    of       this     gate       appeared             all       alive        at

              first         although                they were          gasping           for        breath       and          some    required              first

              ai d .        I took            serial        fans       from        the       gate     and       i nt o        the    open       space        of    the

              playing            field,         all        seemed          to    recover            quickly          once       out    of       the     crush.

              It w a s       ob v io us ” that              t he      small        gate       was     not       releasing             th e      pressure           on

              the      people            in f r o n t       of     th e     fence.            I could           see      that        there       a p p e a r e d to

              be     people             collapsing              due    to       th e    pressure           of    th e         rest-af        the      crowd.            I

              shouted            to      the        people       at    th e      bank        of     the    crowd         to m o v e        back       but     this

              was      met       by a b u s e ,         the      pushing           did       n ot    stop       although             there       seemed           to

              be     room at             t h e -rear a n d            sides        of    the        crowd.

              I could            see      that        there        was      on e       man    behind        the       fence          who     appeared             to

              me     to     be     obviously               d e ad ,    he w a s         yellow        and       he    had       fallen          down,        his '

              eyes         were         still        o p en ,    people          were        trying        to    help          him    but       there        was       no

               room.         The         only way           to     g et     to     this       man     was       to .rip d o w n            the       perimeter

               I ripped            open         a    section          of    fencing           directly           in      front        of     the man,             he

              was      passed            out        through        the      fence        and        with    others             I carried             hi m    onto

ambulance arrived behind the goal posts and this man's body was placed in

the rear of the vehicle and left with one of the vehicle's crew.                             I could

see   that   several       other     fans still needed pulling out of the crowd,                   in

company with Police Constable Burrows and other officers, I assisted with

the rescue of fans.

In    company     with DC       Burrows    and PC    1513    Reeves   and    some   supporters,     I

carried one of the dead bodies from the playing area into the gym.                                The

body was carried on an advertising board which had been ripped from' the

ground.      PC Reeves stayed with the body once it was placed in the gym.

I returned        to    the playing field,          there   were many distressed and angry

supporters.        In company with PC Burrows and other officers I was ordered

to form a cordon across               the centre line        of the field.          Remained there

until     later    told    to    supervise    Notts.    Forest      fans    leaving    the   ground.

After the f^ns had left the ground I returned to the North stand and re­

grouped with my serial and Inspector Bateman.

I then went        to Claywheels Lane and with other members of my serial we

travelled to Barnsley Hospital for reception of 28 bodies.                            On arrival at

the hospital           informed that these bodies had been re-directed to another

location      so   I     re’turned    to   Claywheels       Lane,   from    there    transport    was

arranged to convey me and other officers back to Rawmarsh.

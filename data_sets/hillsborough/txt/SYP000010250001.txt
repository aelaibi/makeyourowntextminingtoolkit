Dear Sirs
                                   Q
     My husband Mr. ___________________ , attended the Liverpool V
Nottingham Forest game at Hillsborough Stadium, on Saturday 15th
April, 1989., enclosed please find a phot-stat copy of his ticket
which remained intact in his jeans pocket, he never even took it
out to show on the gate.   He went to the match with three friends,
their tickets also remained in their pockets unshown.

     My hus band returned safely home to us having only sustained
a broken toe and very badly bruised feet.   He hasn't been able to
talk much about the awful events of Saturday he is just glad to be
home and alive.   He could not write this letter himself but felt that
the powers to be should know the truth about the ticket situation and
the fact that|hupireds of tickets were retained in tact and not ripped
in half as th-Jy should have been.

     My husband is a long standing season ticket holder and this
tragedy has broken his heart.  He loves the team and the game and
always has done.  We are both very very sorry but I am very very glad
that he is alive and belive me we are counting our blessings and all
I can say is God help the people who have lost loved ones we can not
express our sorrow for them.

    Let us hope out of this terrible disaster lessons will be learnt.




                          Yours faithfully,




                                                            s   /   ^

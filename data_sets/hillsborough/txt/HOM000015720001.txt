SOUTH Y O R K S H I R E    POLICE   -     REQUEST      TO   EXAMINE            (i)   BARR I E R     AND
(ii) STADIUM

I enclose a copy of a faxed letter I have r e c e i v e d from the
Solicitors for the South Yor k s h i r e police.         As you will s e e ; they
w o u l d like to be able to examine the barrier w h i c h c o llapsed in
Pen 3 and also the Stad i u m (including the Leppings Lane terracing,
in particular).            This w o u l d be for the purposes of the civil
p r o c e edings w h i c h have been inst i t u t e d against their clients.

Subject to the n e c e s s a r y consent being forthc o m i n g from the Club,
I cannot see any obj e c t i o n to a c c e d i n g to their request.               From
the point of v i e w of the Inquiry, the only obj e c t i o n I could see
would be if any such e x a m i n a t i o n were likely to interfere w i t h or
hinder any conti n u i n g e x a m i n t i o n of e.g. the barrier (which is
p r e s u m a b l y still at HSE's premises in Sheffield).          A s s u m i n g this
is not the case then - naturally, subject to Sir Peter's views -
I would            be  minded to  respond      to  Hammond S u d d a r d 's request
affirmatively.

I look            forward     to   hear i n g from you (given the  f orthcoming
p r e l i m i n a r y hear i n g before Mr Justice Steyn on 26th July) at your
earli e s t convenience.

also advise thos e having custody of it to pjrovide the ne c e s s a r y
facilities, sub] cct of course to the consen       of the Club, w hich we
shall seek.

finally, it has oc c u r r e d to us since the ab ovementioned tel e p h o n e

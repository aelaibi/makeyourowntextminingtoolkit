Dear

                            re: Lord Justice Taylor's Report

    I spent yesterday afternoon reading the Report, which is a very compelling and
clear document.  From our point of view I do not think we can quarrel with its
findings.

    However, it does highlight the heavy responsibility which everyone has when they
invite vast crowds onto their premises.  Sheffield Wednesday come in for a lot of
criticism, which obviously we should endeavour to avoid should the search light ever
unhappily have to fall upon us.

    One matter which sticks out very clearly is the absence of meetings recording
the changes which are agreed to the Safety Certificate.  I am not clear as to how
far the continuing changes which we have made have been put on paper, but obviously
it is something which we should now consider.

    I suggest that a formal meeting within the Club of employees and representatives
from the Ground Committee should meet to consider the implications of the Taylor
Report.  I would be concerned if we were criticised in the way that the Sheffield
Wednesday Official has been for not organising a structured meeting.

    Would you care to place this letter before the Board on Wednesday in order that
we may be seen to have discussed the report at the earliest possible opportunity.
I am sending a copy of this letter to Jack Cross for his information.

                                                          Yours sincerely,



                                                                                 —J
                                                          G.A. ENSOR.

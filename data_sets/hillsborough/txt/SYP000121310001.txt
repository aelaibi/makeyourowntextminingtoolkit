                 c o u l d n ’t get        in were       buying        cans    of beer    from a nearby Off-Licence.

                 However,           at    no time     did      I see any        violence     from these          supporters.

Roa d j u n c t i o n we were            d i r e ct ed to go       into the ground.                 At    that       stage,

I was    not aware         of the         reason for         our    instructions,               but a s s u m e d there

was    disorder      inside        the ground.

On ente ring H i l l s b o r o u g h w i t h my serial,                   I went       d i r ectly       onto       the

pitch.      The    players were walking                   off      the    pitch via the             players'

tunnel,    and     1 could see m any Police                     officers          on the        pitch at        the

L e p p in gs Lane      end of the ground.

I made my way           d i r e c tl y    to that end and             from that           point     I lost          contact

w i t h most     of my     serial.             I saw that       fans      on the L e p pings Lane                   terrace

were    pressed hard up against                    the    perimeter           fence       to such a degree

that    the fence was             bowing        outwards      under       the     pressure.          Police

officers were           trying         to lift     people over            the     fence and onto             the

pitch.      I saw that            to     the    right of the          pen where           the fans were

standing        there was         a corridor           about 2 yards wide and supp o r t e r s were

a t te mp t i fig to climb from the                pen into         this       corridor         to escape           the

crush.      1 saw       that once          in the       corridor,         these       fans were          remaining

where? they were,            as    if     in a daze.          This       had the       effect       of    preventing

others    escaping         into the            corridor.        Ac c e s s    onto     the      pitch was

av ai la bl e    from the         corridor        via an open gateway,                    and    I set about

pulling     people       onto      the     pitch.

Eventually        1 was able             to get    into      the    corridor and by pressing my

knee    between      the     palings           of the    pen fence,           -fans were able             to use          it

as a step up to            climb over            the fence an d           into      the    corridor.            I

continued doing this                   until     the    crush      inside       the    pen seemed          to ease.

O n leaving       the    c o r r i d o r , I went on t h & playing                    surface       to see          if

there was a n yt hi ng            1 could do.            O n l y at      this     point      did    I realise

the goals.            A mb ul an c e m e n ,   R e d Cross    personnel        and Po l i c e     officers

w er e    tending       to    injured fans and for a time                    1 was at a loss what                  to

do.       I saw P o l i ce       offic e r s and         supporters       using mak e s h i f t    stretchers

to    carry the         injured       to the Forest          end of the ground,             and    I gave a

hand w i th this.

An    increasing         number       of Liverpool          fans were       now on the       pitch and             it

was      obvious      that     the Fore st        fans at     the    other     end had no         idea what

was      happening.           They    chanted football             slogans     etc and this          incensed

the L i verpool          s up p o r t e r s who    began m a k i n g      sporadic     charges across               the

pitch toward            the Hop.         We were         orde r e d to form a cordon across                   the

pitch to sto p these                 charges and for a while                 1 formed     part     of the

c:o r d o n .

The      charges      soon stopped,             and      X saw a number of Liverpool              fans        on the

pitch t h r o w i n g        punches     at     a m a n they were        surrounding.             I went to

this      incident and           saw that        they were a s s a u l t i n g a newspaper

p h o t o g r a p h e r who    had a p p a r e n t l y    been taking        photgraphs      of the       corpses.

I took        him    by the ar m and            led him to the Kop end of the                     pitch.       I

him      replying       " I t ’s my    job".       1 left     this man w i t h some other

photo g r a p h e r s    at the other end of the                   ground and       returned to the

Leppi ngs L ane          end.        I saw another          photographer          being a s s a u l t e d and           I

r e cognised         him to be a c i v ilian scenes                 of    crime    officer      employed at

Force HQ a n d known to me as                     'Spike'.         1 went     to him and        led him away

t o a sa f e p o s it io n .

There        fo 1 lowed what         I remember          seemed    like a kind of         limbo,,     with

Police and           fans     s t a n d i n g ar o u n d on the     pitch and with          rumours      on the

extent        of the     fatal ities           passing     this way and        that.      We were        told to

leave        the    playing are a and            1 made my way           to the area of the           g y mnasium

be h i n d    the N or th      stand.          I went     to the    gym and       looked t h r o u g h the

doorway.            1 saw     corpses      laid    in rows across           the gym floor          and    I
                                                                                                                                       PAGE

              couldn't,             c o m p r eh en d what            1 was    seeing-          The effect was          like a hammer

              blow an d             I was       fighting          to control         my emotions.             I saw a man,

              o b v i o u s l y a father                asking about his                child and officers              trying         to help

              h im .

              M y o v e r w h el mi ng              feeling at that             time was         of help l e s s n e s s   and

              inadequacy,,                and       I saw m a n y of my friends                  and   colleagues          looking       just

              were      to get            transport,             but on arrival            there was        insufficient

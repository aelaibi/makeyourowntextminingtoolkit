     Dear Sir/Madam
                                                                             H _O      Q

     1. Many member authorities attended a seminar convened by the Association
     which took place at Wembley on 15 May 1990. As a result of debates at that
     seminar, it has been agreed that further joint work should be undertaken by
     the local authority Associations and the Football Authorities and that the
     proceedings of the seminar should be published. If your Authority was
     represented as the seminar and wishes to make further points, by way of
     examples, to be included in the proceedings, please send documents to the
     Association no later than 29 June 1990.

     2. A number of specific issues have been identified on which it will be
     most helpful to receive your Authority's advice:

          (a) Finance: Has your Authority financed joint work with the local
          Football league or Rugby League Clubs? If so, are there particular
          features to be noted and how is the local authority investment secured?
          Has your Authority made payments to the local club simply to pay off
          existing debts, or provided a guarantee for the club? If so, are there
          particular features of the local arrangement to be noted and has it
          been possible to secure the money if it has been loaned rather than
          granted?

          (b) Safety: Does your Authority have a view on the advisability of
          installing perimeter fencing rather than safety corridors (moats)? Has
          your Authority commenced discussions with the local club(s) concerning
          conversion to all-seat stadia? Has your Authority formed a view or. the
          financial effects of conversion?



                                           1
    (c) Planning: Has your Authority been approached with re-developmer.t
    or relocation plans which would involve an element of "planning gain"?

    (d) Synthetic surfaces: In view of the Football League's recent
    rejection of synthetic surfaces even at 3rd and 4th Division level,
    does your Authority have plans for joint development/community use
    which were based on the use of synthetic surfaces and which can not now
    be implemented? Does your Authority intend to proceed without
    synthetic surfaces, or to look for development with another sport (e.g.
    Hockey) where synthetic surfaces are encouraged?

    (e) Training of Stewards: Does your Authority have formal
    arrangements for the training of stewards at local clubs? Would
    national guidance be helpful?

3. The current failure of Government to bring the Football Licensing
Authority into existence is causing difficulties for local authorities who
wish to implement aspects of the Taylor Report before the commencement of
the 1990/1991 season. After discussions with the Football League, the
following advice is offered:

    "Your Authority will no doubt, be giving consideration to the
    detailed provisions which need to be included in Safety Certificates
    following on from Lord Justice Tayor's report into the Hillsborough
    disaster. The 76 recommendations cover a wide range of topics and some
    of them will need to be reflected in Safety Certificates as a matter of
    some urgency on grounds of safety. It is understood however, that ail
    clubs have been encouraged to prepare a 5-10 year development plan
    which is likely to include either substantial refurbishment of existing
    grounds or proposals for moving to new grounds. Clearly safety
    issues would need to be addressed in the short term but it is importar.t
    that the limited resources which will be available to clubs should not
    be expended on short term measures which will not play any long term
    role in providing or the greater safety and comfort of spectator than
    is absolutely necessary.

    In particular, your Authority is advised not to seek to anticipate in
    Safety Certificates Lord Justice Taylor's proposals regarding
    all-seater stadia and particularly, the timetable for going towards
    all-seater stadia which he sets out. It is understood that these
    provisions will be introduced by the Football Licensing Authority when
    it is established and that Safety Certificate Authorities do not have
    the legal power to insert provisions in the Safety Certificates
    regarding all seater stadia, since local authorities operate under the
    provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 whereas the
    Football Licensing Authority will operate under the provisions of the
    Football Spectators Act 1989. In any event your Authority is strongly
    advised to initiate discussions with local football clubs to ascertain
    the club's long term intentions before modifying the provisions of
    Safety Certificates."
This advice has also been offered to District Councils by the Association
of District Councils.

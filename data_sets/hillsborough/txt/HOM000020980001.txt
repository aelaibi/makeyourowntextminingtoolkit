FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY
I said that I would let you have some thoughts                                                 about   this
authority, in advance of our meeting on Thursday.

Estimated Costs
We have given a provisional estimate of the costs of the
authority to the Treasury, based on discussions between Trevor
Smith here and David Mould.   I attach a copy of the estimate in
case you have not seen it. We have also told the Treasury that
we might aim to recover about £250,000 towards the costs of the
authority by charging fees for licences of, say, £4,000 for each
First Division Club, £3,000 for the Second, £2,000 for the Third
and £1,000 for the Fourth. We had previously estimated the costs
of the licensing function under the Bill (ie without safety
matters) at £250,000 a year, to be recovered largely, if not
completely, from football.      The implication of our present
proposal is that this element of the cost would remain with
football; the Government would fund the extension of the
authority's role into safety matters.
Subject to your comments on this and what follows, I will need to
clear the approach with Mr Moynihan.     If he agrees, and if we
reach agreement with the Treasury, I propose to consult the
football authorities about the sliding scale for licence fees.
If they prefer a flat rate fee for all clubs, or a scale based on
a different criterion (average attendance) we might wish to
accept their choice, provided that the total amount raised is the
same.    I do not, however, propose to consult the football
authorities about appointments to the authority.
Appointments
I would have thought that we should be looking for:-

       a chairman from the law or public service;
       members, to include 1 ex-police chief; 1 ex-fire chief; 1
       building engineer; 1 or 2 with a football background
       (though not presently connected with a football club); and
       1 or 2 independents.

I would prefer to keep the membership as small as possible and if
we can keep it to a chairman + six (rather than eight, as allowed
by the Bill) so much the better.

Staff/Inspectorate
Our estimate for the Treasury envisages a chief executive at
Grade 6 level plus 5 members of the administrative staff.  This
may be optimistically low but my inclination is to keep the
permanent number as low as possible and rely on temporaries /
consultants to cope with peaks (such as the handling of initial
applications for licences).
For the inspectorate, we have referred to 3 teams of 3 full time
inspectors (1 ex-police, 1 ex-fire service, 1 engineer).      In
terms of full-time equivalents, this seems about right but the
workload of the inspectorate will be uneven and I would like to
consider the possibility of 6 half-time teams of three.    David
Mould was concerned that the more teams we have, the bigger the
risk of inconsistency between them; on the other hand, many
inspectorates are much larger than this.    We should presumably
also consider whom we expect to attract to the inspectorate; if
they are retired people, part-time would be more suitable.

Start-up Date
Parliament will have to approve an order giving the FLA safety
powers, following Taylor's final report (assuming, as all this
does, that we want it to have such powers).      We envisage that
this debate should take place at the same time as the order
establishing the Football Membership Authority is debated -
perhaps late January or early February.         For the sake of
administrative convenience, we have it in mind to run the FLA as
a shadow body (on DOE’s running costs) until 1 April 1990 and
establish it as a grant-aided body on that date.

Location
There seems no particular reason for the authority to be based in
London.   It will be important for it to be close to the FMA.
Something to discuss with the football authorities, perhaps?
Amendments to the Bill
Most of this will not require specific provision in the Bill.
But we will need to add standard provisions for the authority to
appoint a chief executive and staff, to set their terms and
conditions of employment, their pensions, arrangements for the
payment of grant-in-aid, the presentation of accounts and audit.
We will consult you about the amendments and, in due course, about
the detailed arrangements.

Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report
Finally, you will recall that Mr Moynihan has asked for advice on
what the "position of our two Departments will be, if it appears
that football clubs are opening their doors to spectators without
having taken on board the recommendations of the interim report".
I would like to discuss the advice which I will provide.
My apologies for writing at length but I thought that you might
welcome the chance to think through our ideas before Thursday.

FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY: MEMBERSHIP AND COSTS

1.     I set our below a table showing an estimate of the likely
annual costs of the FLA.



A   -   Remuneration of Chairman & 8 Members                       81,000
B   -   Salaries etc of Inspectors                                360,000
C   -   Travel & Subsistence for Inspectors                        40,000
D   -   Salaries & overheads of administrative staff              120,000
E   -   Consultation expenses                                      50,000
        TOTAL                                                    £651,000


2.     An explanation of these estimates is annexed.                        But
essentially they are based on the following assumptions:-

           Chairman at Grade 2 level working 2 days a week;
           8 Members at Grade 4 level working 1 day a week;
           9 full time Inspectors paid £30,000 per annum;
           an administrative support team of 6 staff.           A Grade 6, a
           HE0, 2 E0"s and 2 typists.

3.     The total of £651K accords with our very early estimate of
between £0.5m - £0.75m for the FLA annual costs.          I have
explained the position to FES who will take this forward in the
forthcoming PES round.

LIKELY COSTS OF FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY

THE CHAIRMAN

1.     The minimum notional full timerate for       a Chairman at
equivalent Grade 2 level is £48,100.    If this Chairman were to
work 1 day a week his remuneration would total £10,495 (£48,000 -
220 working days X 48 days a year).       Should the Chairman be
required to work more regularly, say 2 days a week, his
remuneration would double to £20,990.
2.     If the Chairman were      to be    a Grade 3 equivalent
remuneration would be £8,204 for working 1 day a week, and £6,408
for 2 days a week.

3.    Some other notional full time ratesfor Chairmen of NDPB's
are as follows:

              Rural Development Commission     £33,200
              Nature Conservancy Council       £38,025
              Sports Council                   £40,950
              Merseyside UDC                   £50,455
              National Rivers Authority        £70,350
              London Docklands UDC             £75,330

THE MEMBERS

       It is the norm for Members of a NDPB to be an equivalent 2
Grades below the Chairman. Accordingly, with a Grade 2 Chairman,
the Members of the FLA should be pitched at Grade 4 level.    The
Home Office advise that in status terms this would be appropriate
to a Chief constable or Deputy Chief Constable.
5.      The minimum notional full time rate       for Grade 4 is
£34,095. Remuneration for a Member working 1 day a week wouldbe
£7,439.    Remuneration for 6 Members working 1 day a week would
therefore be £44,634, and for 8 Members - £59,512.
6*     If the FLA were to have 8 Members working 1 day a week
with a Grade 2 Chairman working 2 days a week the total cost
would be £80,502. (A in covering minute).


FLA INSPECTORATE

7.      TheHome Office suggest that a basic salary of @ £30,000
would be necessary to attract a mid-grade        fire officer or
engineer to the inspectorate. Accordingly, 3 teams of 3 officers
would incur an annual salary cost of about £270,000.           In
addition, account should be taken of "on" costs such as ERNIC,
superannuation and use of common services.       The best advice
available on these comes from the Treasury which estimates "on
costs" fora Grade 7 at @ £10K per officer.      Accordingly the 9
strong inspectorate would involve a total cost of @ £360K. (B in
covering minute).
THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF
8.     The salaries and overheads of administrative staff have
been calculated on the basis of the DOE "Ready Reckoner For Staff
Related Costs".   The following table shows how the total of @
£120,000 has been calculated (C in covering minute):



GRADE    SALARY       ACCOMMODATION      OVERHEADS     TOTAL COST
                   (at £153.19 per m2)
  6      36,914    20.9        3,201        1756        41,871
 HE0     18,181    10.2        1,562        1756        21,499
  E0      13,625    7.7        1,179        1756        16,560
          13,625    7.7        1,179        1756        16,560
TYPIST     9,914    4.7          719         _—         10,633
           9,914    4.7          719         --         10,633
TOTAL    102,173               8,559        7,024      117,756




TRAVEL AND SUBSISTENCE
9.     This can only be an estimate. Home Office advise that as
a minimum it would be reasonable to assume T and S expenditure of
10% of the total costs of the Inspectorate.           Accordingly
allowance has been made for total of £40K.(D in covering minute).



CONSULTATION
10.    Again this can only be estimated.   It is likely that the
FLA will wish to "buy in" advice on, perhaps, architectural and
electrical engineering issues.    There may also be a need for
legal consultation if this is not already accessible. A total of
£50K for this area of work is considered reasonable. (E in
covering minute).

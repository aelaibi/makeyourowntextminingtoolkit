                directed towards the ground by Sheffield Police near to the motorway

                but closer to the ground.                               There were no directions and I parked in a

                street near to the railway station which services the ground,
                                                                       poO-'v o

Walking to the ground I d i d n ’t notice any police escorting fans to

the ground,       it was reasonably quiet although there were some fans

sitting on some grass drinking from cans.                    They were quiet and there

was no d i s o r d e r .
                                                    S.
We got to the entrance to the ground at about 2.10 pm vnVIO) and at

that time there w e r e n ’t a n y >^ e u e s    as such or crowds.         We passed

through the turns t x         / a s i ly enough.      I do remember seeing,          behi nd

me, a large number of fans who appeared to be coming f^-om t h ef rai lway

s t at io n.   These were being escorted by jMrfT po^i,

I don* t re cal 1 seeing any po 1 i c^\g4><^ice rs aj^ftTnd the entrance to the

turns tiles.       There were some stewai\ds^ ^ u t t h e y were talking           amongst

themselves and not directing the fans

The entrance used was the same as l a j ^ e a r so I had no problem

f i ndi ng it and no diffi culty entering the                ground.

As I went through the turnstile my ticket                    was checked and      I was

handed back my stub whi ch I still              pos se ss.

I. did not see any gates other than the turnsti 1es open nor did 1 see

anyone enter other than by the turnstiles.

When I entered through the turnstjMrg's into the area bjthTnd them,                         I

did not see any police o f ^ p ^ r s       or match s t e ^ r ^ i ^ nor did I see any

signs directing fans towards the standing a r e a s .

I saw the pitch through a tunnel directly in front of me and the four

of us went through that t u n n e l .       We had no problem going through the

tunnel until we got to the end where there was a mass of people

standing       in the way.   At this time there were no probl em s.                The fans

were in a good mood and were s i n g i n g .          I did not see anyone drinking

beer.

 e pushed our way into the ground through the crowd and made our way

towards the position of 6D on the grid that                   I have been shown.          The

position I was in was about two people away from the crash barrier on

            The time that I got to this position was about £.20 pm 1 1 4 2 0 ) .                 There

            were a lot of people around me but there was no excessive p r e s s u r e .

            It was just      like a normal match pressure.

            Standing with me was my brother and _____________.                               kent off

            to the r ight and stood on the fence dividing             pens 2 & 3.

            Everything seemed alright u n t i 1 about five to three            (1455).    There

            were no fights or d is tu r b a n c e s , and t h e n , at about five to three

            (1455),      the pressurs^of the crowd around me started to in cr eas e.                 As

            the game sty& rped the        pressure became unbearable and there was also a

            surge of the crowd which started to push me forwards.                 I was having

m           difficulty breathing and ended up very close to the fence                 in a

            position marked PS on the grid.

            I was unable to move myself and the force of the                crowd had tuj>rfed me

            to my left so that I was            looking towards pen 7.      I have since found a

 W          picture of myself on the front page of the Dai ly Vti r / o r , dated Monday

            17th April      1989 (170489).        Also   in the picture   is a man in a

                     /ho can be clearly seen facing the same way as myself.                  I

VAxc A V * # 3b elieve   it was this man                                  and when I eventually

            managed to turn round to look at him,              he appeared to me to be quite

            clearly dead.        His face was a deep purple and his eyes were shut.                   He

            was   1 imp as well.

            I was trapped in the crowd u n t i 1 about 3.20 pm (1520) w hen there

            appeared to be a slackening of pressure              in the crowd around me.         I

            managed to reach up and grab the top of the fence and I clambered up to

            the top of it.        At tb4 top of the fence,        I looked back into the crowd

            and saw that a \aa r / r i e r ,   the one which I was originally stood b y , had

            collapsed and I       could see a pile of about 40 people lying on and

            around it.       I had the impression from looking at them that they had

            died.

                                                                                             S34S

     I stayed on the top of the barrier u n t i l               I saw that my b r o t h e r J>a d

     been pulled out and was^-safe,              I remember,      as the game kicred off and

     the crush real ly                 see i ng the g ^ X ^ ^ h i c h   |ed f ^ m   the pen onto

     the pitch,    open and a girl was pulled out by a policeman and taken
n
     onto the pitch.       The gate was        closed again immediately.

     About two minutes       l a t e r , the gate o p e n e d ajfti two or three people were

     taken o u t , then closed again.

     I d i d n ’t see that gate open again but 1 did see people climbing over

     the fence and onto the pitch.

     After    I got over the fence         I went to the assistance of other              people

     (having first got some air back into my own lungs) and tried to pull

     the fencing up from the bottom but the police stopped us saying that

     there was no way we could get thpa-tfgh it.                  I then helped people who

     were    climbing over tj^J^ejcKflT.

     It appeared to me that the police and the stewards were s 1ow to

     react to what was happening and seemed more                    concerned with keeping the

     actual    pitch cl ea r.   When it was realised what had gone wrong the

     emergency services seemed to be chaotic and u nc o- or din ate d.                   Jjiere

     also seemed to be a total           lack of emergency f i r s t X ^ i d ^ i pm e n t .         I

     only saw one oxygen cylinder             in u s e .

     We eventually left the ground at 5.00 pm (1700)                      following a tannov

     announcement.

     I , myself,   received ix>               to both my legs^flfnd my chest



     One thing I saw was a photog Aaphjyf who seemed intent on photdgraphing

     the dead and dying.        His actions we re i nc it ing the Liverpool               fans

     and I saw one fan *isr to him and hit him.                  The pol i ce separated them,
9<
     pho tog ra pipe r WprtTked off.     The po 1 i ceman held the fan for a few

     minutes and then allowed him to go.

     Before    leaving the ground we tried to find a training shoe which
                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                  S348

         had lost.     There were three or four piles of property from the dead

         and injured on the cinder path in the area where I had come over the

         fence.     We sorted      in these piles and found his trainer there.

         In retrospect,         after the press reports of looting,   this action may

         have looked to be looting but we were only looking for the trainer

         which we found.

         1 also noti ced three or four other people who we re also going through

         shoes.     I d i d n ’t see anybody who looked to be trying to find

         valuables.

                          and two friends.

              We entered the ground at                        i (1 4 J 0 ), (I recal1 1oaking at my w a t c h )

              and went to Pen 3>                              kgs Ln Terrace.      At this time we had no

               trouble     in entering the ground and the pen itself was relatively empty,

              All four of us were             in possession of t i ckets which we handed in at the

               turnstiles?       the ticket stub was retained by myself and has

               subsequently been handed to my solicitor.

              Myself,                  and          stood together          in the Pen   (I have    previously

               me right up to the perimete                          There had been several minor

               surges   prior to this,         these were quite nonjfal and after each surge I

               had regained my position on the ter racjj^T                 After the big surge I was

               pinned up against the fence wit                                  in front of me,         It was

               impossible for me to move.               I was aware that my brother,                           was

               right by my side.

               At about 3.10pm       (1510),                                               I turned to my

               right,   i.e.   towards Pen 2,          it was at thiss st^ije that         I became aware of

               believed at the time that this rnan                       ied.

         Eventually at about 3.25pm          (1525)    I managed to pul 1 myself out over

         the top of the perimeter fence.              I did not see the two previously

         rnentioned persons again.

          I am sure that neither of these two persons were removed from the pen

          prior to myself.

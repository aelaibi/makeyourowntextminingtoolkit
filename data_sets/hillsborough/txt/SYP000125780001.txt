1.                           OR              LIVERPOOL
2   .            OR       FROM SOMEWHERE IN
I WILL GET HIS ADDRESS.
I LOST MY WATCH IN THE CRUSH OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES. THERE WERE TWO MOUNTED
POLICE IN THE SORT OF ENCLOSURE BETWEEN THE GATES AND THE TURNSTILES. I
FEARED FOR MY LIFE IN THE CRUSH OUTSIDE THE GROUND. THE PRESSURE WAS
INTENSE, WE PLEADED WITH A MOUNTED OFFICER TO CLOSE THE MAIN GATE BEHIND US,
AND HE JUST TOLD US TO PUSH BACK. THERE WAS A TEENAGE LAD THERE GOING
PURPLE, HIS FRIENDS WERE TRYING TO LOOK AFTER HIM AND KEEP HIM UP. I
CQKDN'T EVEN GET MY ARMS UP TO HELP. EVEN THE POLICE HORSE LOOKED
f o t Ih t e n e d .
WE EVENTUALLY MANAGED TO GET TO THE TURNSTILES, AND I GOT PINNED AGAINST A
DIVIDING POST, AND GOT PROPELLED THROUGH. I'VE STILL GOT MY TICKET INTACT.

ON THE INSTRUCTIONS OF A STEWARD WE WENT THROUGH THE TUNNEL, TO THE LEFT OF
THE GOAL, ON THE WINGS, SOON AFTER SOMEONE STOOD BY US AND SAID 'THEY'VE
OPENED THE GATE' . BY NOW IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE CENTRAL AREA OF THE
TERRACES BY THE GOAL WAS CROWDED, BUT WHERE WE WERE WE HAD PLENTY OF SPACE.

I WANT TO POINT OUT THERE WERE NO DIRECTIONS OR STEWARDS INSIDE THE GROUND
AND AS YOU COME THROUGHT THE TURNSTILE THE ONLY THING YOU CAN SEE IS THAT
TUNNEL, ITS ONLY FROM PAST EXPERIENCE THAT I DIDN'T GO DOWN THE TUNNEL. AT
FIRST THE POLICE THOUGHT THERE WAS TROUBLE OR A PITCH INVASION. I WITNESSED
THE TRAGEDY. AFTER ABOUT 20 MINS I LEFT THE GROUND I WENT THROUGH THE SAME
GATE AS I HAD ENTERED THERE WERE PEOPLE LYING INJURED AND I HAVE TO SAY A
LOAD OF POLICEMAN DOING NOTHING. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THEY HAD A
PROBLEM LAST YEAR ALSO AND PEOPLE WERE BEING PULLED ONTO THE TOP STAND THE
WBW STAND FROM THE MIDDLE TERRACE THEN. I WAS AT THE MATCH ALONE

I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH 2 FRIENDSs
1.                                       LIVERPOOL
2   .          FROM SOMEWHERE IN
I WILL FIND OUT THEIR FULL ADDRESSES/ BUT THEY SAID THEY WOULD BE RINGING YOU
ANYWAY.

THE TIME WAS GETTING ON, AND THE PEN WAS GETTING FULL/ AND PEOPLE WERE
SINGING/ JUMPING UP AND EVERYTHING -     SO WERE WE/ BUT IT WAS ALL GOOD-NATURED.
THEN AT    ABOUT 2.45 THERE WAS A PUSH AND WE GOT PUSHED ALL THE WAY    FROM THE
BACK TO    THE FRONT/ BUT AFTER THAT WE STILL HAD SPACE TO MOVE AROUND. I
TURNED ROUND TO WALK BACK UP TO THE BACK/ AND AS I DID SO THERE WAS ANOTHER
PUSH. I GOT PUSHED TO THE FRONT/ MY HAND WAS ON THE RAILINGS/ AND       I COULDNOT
M d V FOR A GOOD 20 MINUTES. THIS WAS STILL BEFORE KICK OFF/ ABOUT      2.55PM.
THERE WAS PEOPLE ALL AROUND SCREAMING/ AND I WAS FEELING THE PAIN/ AND IT WAS
DIFFICULT TO BREATHE/ AND A POLICEMAN ON THE PITCH WAS SHOUTING FOR US TO
PUSH BACK/ BUT WE COULDN'T MOVE.
EVERYONE WAS PLEADING WITH THEM NOT TO LET THE MATCH START/ BECAUSE IT WOULD
GET WORSE/ AND PEOPLE WERE THEN CLIMBING OUT OVER THE FRONT/ BUT THEY WERE
CLIMBING OVER OTHER PEOPLE TO GET OUT. EVENTUALLY/ WHEN I COULD MOVE AGAIN I
RAN UP TO THE BACK WHERE THE SEATS WERE ABOVE ME/ AND 2 LADS LIFTED ME UP BY
THE LEGS AND 2 LADS PULLED ME UP BY THE ARMS/ ONTO THE BALCONY. THEN I
WANTED TO FIND ME MATES, AND I WENT OUT THE BACK TO WHERE THE CAFE WAS/ AND I
WAS TRYING TO GET BACK INTO THE TERRACES AGAIN/ THROUGH THE TUNNEL/ BEFORE I
GOT TO THE TUNNEL I SAW 4 STEWARDS/ AND THEY WERE LEANING ON THE COUNTER/ AND
I WAS CRYING AND SHAKING/ AND I SAID     "WHY AREN'T YOU HELPING?" AND ONEOF
THEM REPLIED "IT'S NOT OUR PART OF THE GROUND".
AS HE SAID THAT/ ANOTHER FELLA CAME OUT AND HEARD IT AND SAID/ BUT PEOPLE ARE
DYING OUT THERE. I WENT BACK INTO THE SEATS SO I COULD SEE THE PITCH, AND I
CLIMBED DOWN BACK ONTO THE TERRACES AND BY NOW THERE WAS A LOT OF SPACES/ AND
I WALKED THROUGH THE GATE ONTO THE PITCH AND LOOKED FOR MY FRIENDS. THERE
WAS PEOPLE COMING OVER AND OFFERING DRINKS/ AND HELP, THEN I FOUND ME
FRIENDS/ AND WE TALKED TO A POLICMAN.
WE LEFT AT ABOUT 4.45 PM.
I'M A BIT BRUISED

            LANE ENTRANCE. THERE WAS A LARGE CROWD OUTSIDE, AND THERE 7
            TURNSTILES IN OPERATION FOR THE WEST STAND TERRACES. AS WE
            APPROACHED I NOTICED THAT IT WAS A LARGE CROWD, AND 4 MOUNTED

I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH 4 OTHERS:
1.                  (BROTHER)                              LIVERPOOL
2.              I,   I                      LIVERPOOL(
3. 1 ^ ^ ^ ^                                     , MERSEYSIDE
4. I
   ---------             A FRIEND OF   S.

THEY NORMALLY USE THE HORSES TO FORM QUEUES TO THE TURNSTILES, BUT NOTHING
LIKE THIS WAS HAPPENING, AND IT WAS EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. ON THE LEFT THERE
IS    CONCERTINA GATE, ON THE RIGHT A STEEL BAR, LIKE A CRUSH BARRIER. IT'S
E J ^ TO DUCK UNDER THIS BAR. WE APPROACHED THE GATE, THERE WERE NO QUEUES,
JUST A LARGE MASS OF PEOPLE. WE WERE THERE FROM 2.20 UNTIL 3.00 WHEN WE GOT
INTO THE GROUND, WE SEEMED TO STAND FOR AGES WITHOUT GETTING ANY NEARER THE
TURNSTILES, BEING SHOVED AROUND. ONCE YOU WERE IN THAT AREA YOU WERE
EFFECTIVELY PENNED IN IN FRONT OF THE TURNSTILE. AT ONE POINT I WAS BEING
CRUSHED AGAINST THE CONCERTINA GATE ON THE LEFT - IT WASN'T OPENED.
I EVENTUALLY GOT THROUGH THE LEFT HAND TURNSTILE, PEOPLE WERE ALREADY
SCRAMBLING UP THE WALL AND OVER THE ROOF, TO ESCAPE THE CRUSH.
I GOT THROUGH THE TURNSTILE, AND THERE WERE POLICEMEN THERE, AND I GRABBED
ONE AND SAID THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING TO DIE OUT THERE. HE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE
A RADIO TO CONTACT ANYONE OUTSIDE THE GROUND.
I GRABBED ANOTHER POLICEMAN, AND THEY SAID THE CHIEF SUPER WAS IN COMMAND.
I FELT THAT A GATE SHOULD BE OPENED BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO DIE OUTSIDE,
BUT I FEEL THAT THE TUNNEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLOCKED OFF FIRST - LACK OF
COMMUNICATION WAS A PROBLEM.
I THEN WENT THROUGH THE TUNNEL INTO THE TERRACES, AND COULD SEE AHEAD OF ME
THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FULL OF PEOPLE, I TURNED ROUND AND PUSHED MY WAY BACK
OUT AGAIN, WENT ROUND THE BACK OF THE STAND TO A CORNER PEN WHERE THERE WAS
SPACE.
AFTER I GOT INTO A PEN, I SAW PEOPLE STARTING TO CLIMB OVER THE RAILINGS FROM
THE CENTRE PEN. THEN I SAW A POLICEMAN RUN ONTO THE PITCH AND SPEAK TO THE
REFEREE, AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE STARTED GOING OVER.
THE TWO MAIN PROBLEMS WERE OBVIOUSLY:
1. ALLOCATION OF TICKETS BY THE FA
2.   LACK OF CROWD CONTROL OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE

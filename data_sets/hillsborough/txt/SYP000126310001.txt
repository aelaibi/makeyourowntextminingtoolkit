   To: Chief Superintendent                                       Date: 18th April 1989


             SUBJECT:      Semi Final-Nottingham Forest v Liverpool 15.^.89

              On Saturday 15 April 1989 at 09.30 I reported for duty at the ground in
            connection with the above event.Along with other special constables I attended
            the main briefing in the north stand, On completion of this I then attended in th
            gymnasium where a second briefing for special constables took place for the
            deployment of special constables by.Coumandant Stothard and Div Commandant
            Martin. The special constables were split into four serials , I was given
            command of two serials covering sectors D and E. sector D covering parking
            of supporters vehicles in the Halifax fid Southey Ave area. Sector E covering
            Middlewood Ed rtynn gardens Area.
                   At approx 10.50am all officers went aut and took up there positions.
            At 11.15 I visited sector D s/c               -3. were supervising the parking in
            that area and everything was under control. I then attended at Claywheels lane
            to change my radio which would not transmit. Haveing obtained a new radio I
            then made my way up Leppings lane to the officers on Middlewood road under
                                     ______ 3____
            the supervision of S/C                  arriving at approx 12.15* At this time there
            was a large number of supporters in this area and a constant flow of vehicles
            arriveing, and I remained in this area until approx 14.^5 when the volume of
            traffic and supporters at this point had now reduced and there was just
            intermittant vehicles. we walked along Middlewood Ed towards the ground with
            the main body of supporters who were well behaved, On arriving in ^eppings
            lane I was aware of a very large Volume of supporters, I was instructed to
            take the 6 specials to the gym on stand by. Due to the heavy, congestion
            at the ground I took the officers down Vere Hd entering the ground by gate 0
            Immediatley on entering the ground we were directed onto the pitch to assist
             it was approx 15*05, % was not aware at this time what had happened,
            Immediatly officers were split under the direction of a chief tnspectoi^not Known
            some going to ^eppings lane end;these were S/Cs                       and SO
            S/Cs                        and Myself were directed behind the goal at the
            spion kop end monitoring the Nottingham Forest supporters to prevent a pitch
            invasion. Once the supporters had settled I intermitantly helped dazed and
            distressed supporters to available first aid. Also makeing intermitant checks
            on special constables.
            At 17.30hrs I then began to co-ordinate the re-grouping of special constables
            behind the north stand as they began to return to the ground some in a very
            distressed condition. At 18.30 after de briefing, all specials being accounted
            for, I attended at the Eoyal Hallamshire Hospital to check on the condition
Gen/2       of one of my injured officers arriving at 1900hrs, S/C |                  sustained
            Eib injuries, unable to see him at this time I left the hospital, going off
             duty at 20.00hrs.              '                   Sub Divisional Officer^

We all     left the g ym n a s i u m and w a lk e d       in front of the N o rt h Stand*

a l o ng the w al k w a y at the side of the              pitch,      the game at this        time was

in progress.            I could see at a point half w ay                 long the N o r t h S t a nd

that a number of fans had                climbed on to the            pitch in front      of the

L e p p i n g s Lane    stand.     I could see fans still              c lambering over       the stand

barr ie rs a nd on to the pitch all                 the time we were m aking            our

wa y towards       that end of the ground.



M y se l f and other officers            cut a cross      the    pitch some 40-50 y ards          from

the L e p p i ng s Lane stand a nd were met w it h hyst er ic al                  fans of all         ages

s c r e a m i n g and saying     "they are       dying    in there,"       indicating     the

L e p p i n g s Lane stand.        Myself and the         rest of the serial           then made our

w a y t hr o ug h the fans       on the     pitch and up to the            railings     of that

stand.      At this time         I was    close to PC E611 Parkin,               but s ho r tl y after

reaching        the fence     I lost sight        of PC P a r k i n.



At the fence           I could see     row upon      row of fans         pushing and being

pu shed f orward         into the f e n c e .     Lots    of fans were        being s q u a s h e d and

t r am p l e d by other     fans    either     up a ga i ns t    the fence or        in front    of    it.

I could see that m any             people up a ga i ns t        the   fence were being s q u a s he d

to death,        their    bodies    pressed that         t i gh tl y up a ga in st   the f en cing

that    they     could not breathe.             I climbed on to the small              concrete wall

at the b ottom of the fence and m a n a g e d to                  pull    several     people o v e r the

b a rb e d wire of the high fencing               onto    the    pitch.      If they    could not

walk    I took     them well       on to the      pitch a nd      rende re d first aid,         then

r e tu rn ing    to the fence to repet            the    procedure.        Fans and P ol ic e

O f f i c e r s were doing the same as m yse lf w h i le some fans were m a n a g i n g

to climb over           the fence     themselve s       onto    the   pitch to safety.



The    u nc on s ci ou s and s e m i - c o n s c i o u s were   rende re d first aid and placed

                                                                                                                         S32S7

                  in the     coma position.              I o r g a n is e d other   p ar t ia l ly      injured fans a long

                  w i th some stewards            to    continue the a s s i s t a n c e    to those         left on the

                  pitch w hilst       I returned each time to the fence.



                  Sometime      during this            I met    up w i t h PC P a r k i n a g a i n and he        info rm ed me

                  that    it a p p e a r e d that several           people were      dead     inside the enclosure.

                  I went w i th him up to the fence at a point                         to the        left of the

                  L ep pi ng s Lane    g o a l , there         I saw dozens     of people w i t h their              fac^s

                  s q u a s h e d up ag ai ns t    the fencing,         their f a c es grey,            they were

                  u ncon sc io us   but held upright              by the    pressure       of the        people     b ehind     them.

                  It was     impossible       to get to these             people as the wire              fencing was

                  b e tween us and there was a barbed wire                      s e ct i o n of the fenc in g at the

                  top bending       over    back        into the s tand m ak in g        it impossible            to reach

                  over.



                  I then     }ost sight       of PC P a r k i n and e n ga g ed        in the        recovery of a ny on e           I

                  could     reach from b ehind the fencing.                    At   this    time there were             no

          ijb * s e nior officers o rg a n i s i n g the manpower,                  police and fans and s te wa rd s

                       at t h ”
                  the fans.     I can recall at leat one male w ho was lifted on to the

                  pitch and he a p p e a r e d dead,             he was    carried well         into the        pitch w here

                  his bre at hi ng and        pulse were          checked,     he was      grey and         cold,    a m a n who

                  s t at ed he was a doctor              came up     to me and      p r o n ou n ce d    life e x t i n c t .    I

                  r emoved this male from the                   pitch w i th the a s s i s t a n c e of the fans on an

I r et ur n e d to the fence              of L e p p i n g s Lane a n d at some stage                  either

before         or a fter    going    to    the g y m n a s i u m o r g a n i s e d   fans     to kick       the wire

f en c i n g    d own at a point          to the      right    of the L e p p i ng s Lane             goal,     this

was     then used to         recover       people       from the       stand.



I t h en j oined other             off ic er s   to     form a line a cross the                centre       of the

pitch.



I can state          that    i ni t i a l l y w he n we     passed the L ep p in g s Lane e n tr an ce

to the         g round    I could see several             fans     o b v i o u s l y d r u n k, w a n d e r i n g

about      or stood w it h         cans    of beer      in their hands.               Also      I can state

that a large             number    of those      fans     I came      into     contact with,            eith er

u nscathed,         c onscious      or semi       cons ci ou s     smelt      at alch aa l and some were

drunk.          T hose    that were       drunk were        causing       problems        for the        people

effecting         the     rescues,     by s ho u ti n g     s w ea r i n g and even a s s a u l t i n g P ol ic e

officers.           I do d i s t i n g u i s h b e tw e e n those       that were         drunk and

those      fans     that were grief           s t r i c k e n a nd o v e r w h e l m e d by the events.                On

the w hole        the     fans were       treme nd o us     in their effort             to assist.



A lso    during      the    period     I assisted         friends a n d        relatives         to    find others

lost and         c o m f or te d those     people who were            suffering         g re a tl y to the

point      of collapse        due to the          loss and t r au m a of the events.



At some         stage     during    the    events       of the a f t e r n o o n      I s t ay ed a w hile          near

shock      of the        incident.

                   Our    i ns t r u c t i o n s    on the      day were       to go to W es t Bar               for    refreshments,

                   my serial            Sergeant       then told all           of us to go to L e p p i n g s Lane

                   immediately.

                  We all          left s t r a i g h t a w a y , w a l k e d a l o n g s i d e   the      pitch t o wa rd s L e pp in gs

                  Lane.           The game was           still       in progress.

             The    play was         up the N o t t i n g h a m end and we a c t u a l l y                cut the          corner of

             the    pitch at L e p p i n g s         Lane.        T here was a bo ut 6 of us                   in this       g ro up and

             at    the half w ay         line we s pread out.                    T he re were a number               of fans

             w a l k i n g a bou t    in the L i v er po ol            p en a lt y area,       my    i mmediate         thought was

             that    it was a p itch             inv as io n and          I walked       t hr o ug h this        g ro up and then

                  } the horror of the fans p ress ed up a g a i n s t the front fence,

                  went   in front        of    pen 4 a nd s tood on the front                        fence.        I was      shouting

             for    p e o ple to      push back but              it was        impossible.

             Some    time d uring         this a y o u t h was             passed       over    the fence a nd he

             appeared        to me as dead.                T here were          other    fans       help in g a nd we got him

             In       my    opinion           the    only             reason       for     the     deaths         would       have     been      the

             1    have           heard       stories          in          the    press     but     I     can     say    1 saw     nothing

             which          I would           class          as       a    criminal        offence         before        or    after       the    crush.

             As       1 said           I have       been          throughout             the     oourilry         following           Liverpool,

             Hy       opinion           is    that       1    realise             w h a t ’s    been      said in        the     press      about            the

RE:    HILLSBOROUGH MATERIAL HELD BY MERVYN JONES -
       FORMERLY CHIEF CONSTABLE, CHESHIRE CONSTABULARY

I refer to my previous correspondence dated 15 October 1997 in which I sought to bring the
existence of the above materia' to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's attention and his authority to
transport the material from Ch-. „re to Sou‘! vorKshire and to place it in the Hillsborough
Archive.

I have today received a telephone call from the secretary of the Chief Constable of Cheshire
informing me that the room in which the material is stored is required for other purposes and that
they have no other secure storage for it I have been asked if I could make arrangements for its
removal as soon as possible

As three months have now passed since I brought the existence of this material to the attention
of the Scrutiny Team may I now bring it to South Yorkshire as ! originally requested because I
would iike the opportunity to examine it before ! retire in just over 3 weeks time and ascertain
whether or not it merely duplicates the material heid here in the Hillsborough Archive.

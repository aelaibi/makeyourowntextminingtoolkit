           At      15.10 hrs on Saturday 15th April             1989        (150489)   I attended at

            Hillsborough Football Ground w ith several other officers who had been

            engaged in traffic duties during the morning and early afternoon.                                  On

            our arrival we were directed on to the playi ng area and towards the

            Leppings Lane end of the g r o u n d .

            As we got onto the pitch we saw                a crowd of people            covering approx        1/4

            of the playing area.          The re was a general atmosphere of confusion

            and people wandering aimlessly a b o u t .               In company with Policy/

            Constable 609 Parker,          I saw a youth laying on his back on /the hai f way

            line of the pitch.        He was obivoiusly in pain and complaining about an

            injury to his ribs.           Several youths were trying to give him a drink of

            water.     We approached and prevented him from drinking and called for a

            stretcher with the assistance of other youths we carried him to

         the rear of the North Stand/along side the gymnasium where Sp, Johns

         Ambulance officers were waitiyng.        We then returned to the pitch and

         after a short time joined a cordon across the         centre of the pitch,

         preventing the Liverpool        supporters on the pitch,    reaching the

         Nottingham Forest supporters at the Penistone Road end of the ground,
                                 /
         During the time on/the         pitch we were being taunted and abused by

         Liverpool supporters on the pitch and those         ipr the North S t a n d .

         Shortly after yhe match was abandoned and            made our way onto

         Penistfone roa^t/ where we were delegated to / form a cordon to assist the

         exit of the Nottingham Forest supporter;

         Approx    15 minutes   later we were on public order patrol       responding to
         /                                       %

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


Further to my letter of 25 May, I enclose a paper prepared by
this Department on the Government's proposals for a national
membership scheme for football spectators.

The first part of the paper summarises the background to the
introduction of the Football Spectators Bill and is accompanied
by supporting material which may be helpful to Lord Justice
Taylor. The second part draws attention to the statement made by
the Secretary of State for the Environment on the launch of the
Bill and to speeches made by Government spokesmen in the House of
Lords during the Bill's passage so far, which seem to be of
particular interest to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.

Our understanding is that Lord Justice Taylor may wish to look at
the technology which suppliers have offered to provide for the
national membership scheme. If the Department can be of any help
in arranging a demonstration, we will be happy to do so.

I also enclose a note on the Council of Europe Convention on
Spectator Violence, with accompanying papers. No other country
operates a national membership scheme of the kind proposed in
this country but if there is any information which Lord Justice
Taylor would like about experience in other countries, we would
be happy to arrange the appropriate contacts. An official of this
Department,  Mr Peter Lee,    is the Chairman of the Standing
Committee established by the Convention.

THE NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP-SCHEME


INTRODUCTION

1. This paper is concerned with the Government's proposals for a
national membership scheme, as provided for in Part I of       the
Football Spectators Bill now in Parliament. It summarises      the
background to the decision to introduce the Football Spectators
Bill and draws attention to Ministers' statements on the reasons
why the Government believes the scheme to be necessary to counter
hooliganism associated with football. Separate evidence from the
Home Office provides information about: the continuing problems
of crowd control associated with football matches; other relevant
legislation; and the policing of football.


NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME - BACKGROUND

2. In January 1986 the Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety and
Control at Sports Ground's chaired by Mr Justice Popplewell
recommended that:


      "Consideration should continue to be given to some form of
      membership scheme for Football League clubs in England and
      W al e s ."


Partial membership schemes for individual League clubs were among
the measures agreed between the Government and the football
authorities  in February    1987.  Copies  of  the  press  notice
announcing the package of measures are attached. The agreed
objective was that all clubs should introduce schemes covering at
least 50% of each ground's capacity by the beginning of the
1987/88 season. It was also agreed that the Football League would
commission a study by independent consultants on the scope, costs
and benefits/disadvantages of a reciprocal membership scheme
embracing all 92 League clubs.

3. The Minister for Sport's report to the Union of European
Football Associations (UEFA), in June 1988, at the end of the
1987/88 season, entitled "Progress on Measures to Combat Football
Hooliganism",    (attached)   recorded   that   progress  on  the
introduction of partial membership schemes had been slow; only 16
clubs had met the target of 50% ground capacity agreed in
February 1987. A consultants' study on reciprocal membership had
been commissioned, as agreed, and received by the Football League
in  July   1987;   there  had  been   no  further  action  on the
consultants' study.

4. The Minister for Sport's report to UEFA listed a number of
serious incidents of hooliganism at and around football matches
during the 1987/88 domestic season. These were followed by the
scenes  of disorder involving English supporters during the
European Championships in West Germany in June 1988. On 6 July
1988, the Prime Minister met the football authorities to discuss
the need for further action.
5. Copies of the joint statement issued after the 6 July meeting
are attached. The Government pressed the football authorities to
introduce a national membership scheme to control access to
Football League matches. The football authorities did not believe
that such a scheme could be introduced on a voluntary basis and
the Government said that it would bring forward proposals for
legislation to give statutory backing to a national membership
scheme. It was agreed that a working party under the chairmanship
of the Minister for Sport, consisting of representatives of the
football authorities, the Government and the police, would be set
up to look at the details of the scheme.

6. The Minister for Sport's working party published its report on
9 November 1988. Copies of the report and of the DOE press
notices issued at the same time are attached. The report sets out
the working party's views on what the main principles of the
national membership scheme should be and contains a series of
recommendations for the football authorities and the Government.


THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL

7. The Football Spectators Bill was introduced in the House of
Lords on 16 January 1989. Copies of the Bill as introduced and as
amended to date in the House of Lords are attached. The main
provisions of the Bill are in two parts. Part I provides a
statutory framework for a national membership scheme for football
spectators. Part II gives the courts powers to impose restriction
orders on convicted hooligans to prevent them from travelling to
English matches abroad; Part II is explained in the Home Office
evidence.

8. The contents of the Bill and the Government's reasons for
introducing it are summarised in two press notices issued on
publication (attached). Among the main points made by the
Secretary of State for the Environment in launching the Bill were
the following:


       "We welcome the measures which the clubs and the police
       have taken to deal with hooligans inside football grounds.
       But their effect has been to keep the lid on the problem,
       not to cure it. At too many matches, violence remains just
       below the surface. Rival supporters have to be kept apart
       by physical barriers and by the employment of large
       numbers of police."

       "Outside football grounds, the behaviour of rival groups
       of supporters makes life intolerable both for law-abiding
       football supporters and for those who live or trade nearby
       or wish to travel by train on the same day as a football
       match."

       "The Bill proposes that everyone who attends a designated
       football match in England and Wales should be a member of
       the national membership scheme, or otherwise authorised by
       the scheme, and that designated matches should be played
       only on licensed football grounds. Those who are convicted
       of a relevant offence will be disqualified from membership
       of the scheme and the scheme itself will allow for the
       Football Membership Authority to ban others who misbehave
       at football matches."
       "For the first time, there will be an effective and
       comprehensive procedure to keep hooligans away from
       football matches. Of course there will be attempts to
       abuse the system but if the scheme is effective, those
       attempts will fail. We believe that it offers the real
       prospect of ending football hooliganism both inside and
       outside grounds. If hooligans know that they will not be
       allowed in to football matches,       they will have no
       incentive to travel to them. The link between football and
       hooliganism will be broken and football will cease to be a
       focus for violence."


9. The Government remains committed to the introduction of a
national membership scheme for the reasons given by the Secretary
of State when the Bill was introduced and by Ministers during its
passage through the House of Lords (see below). The continuing
problem of hooliganism associated       with  football  has  been
highlighted since    the Hillsborough disaster by    a number of
incidents at the     endof the 1988/89 domestic season. The
Government believes that the national membership scheme is
essential as a means of ensuring that hooligans can be excluded
from football grounds in the future.

10. There has been a pause in the proceedings of the Football
Spectators Bill since the Hillsborough disaster but it will
resume its passage with Third Reading in the House of Lords on
Friday   16  June.   The Opposition have    tabled a    "reasoned
amendment", regretting that the Government has decided to proceed
with the Bill in advance of Lord Justice Taylor's report. Lord
Justice Taylor may be interested to see Lord Hesketh's speech in
response to the Opposition's amendment.

11. Ministers are aware of the range of issues presented by the
Hillsborough disaster but nevertheless take the view that the
case for the national membership scheme has not been altered by
the disaster. They have always made it clear that the key issue
in setting the timetable for the introduction of the scheme is
the need to be satisfied about the availability    of the right
technology. Suppliers have claimed that there need be no delays
at turnstiles as a result of the scheme and that checking
membership cards can be carried out in the same time as it
presently takes to check season tickets or pay for tickets. The
Government will not, however, approve the implementation of the
scheme until it is satisfied that it will work effectively and
efficiently.

12. The Football Spectators Bill has been debated in the House of
Lords on the following dates:

                       NEW MEASPRES TO COMBAT FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM



          Football     League          Clubs will be expected                  to    introduce membership
    schemes     from       the     1987/88        season,          the     Government          and    football
    authorities announced today.


          This is part of a new eight-point plan in the campaign to clamp
    down on football hooliganism.


          The package also means that clubs will have to work up detailed
    local plans on the control of their home and away supporters.


          A top level meeting today put the finishing touches to the plan.
    Those present were           Richard Tracey, Minister for Sport; Douglas Hogg,
    Minister    for Home Affairs;               Philip Carter,            President       of    the Football
    League;    Bert Millichip,            Chairman        of the Football             Association,      and a
    representative      of       the    Association           of   Chief    Police        Officers     (ACPO).
    The   meeting    was     the       latest    in   a       series     between       the Government         and
    football authorities.


          Richard Tracey who chaired the meeting said:


    "This package      reflects          the     Government's            and        football     authorities'
    continuing      commitment           to     tackle         hooliganism           in   partnership,         in
    the interests          of    both    public       safety       and     the      future     well   being    of
    the game".

     "The Government and football authorities are determined to tackle
football hooliganism head on.                 We hope that this will show everyone,
including      the   rest   of    Europe,      how   determined      we   are    to repair     the
tarnished image of the English game.


     "This     package,     alongside        the   efforts   of    the    police   and     British
Transport Police forms a good basis for the future.                         The recent police
operations     'Own   Goal'      and   'Full    Time'   have      shown   that the hooligans
can expect no hiding place."


     The package of measures will mean that:


    -    The     League     will       ask   all     clubs   to    submit       detailed     local
         plans for dealing with the management and control of their
        home and away supporters.               These plans will be produced
        by the end of the current season and will be drawn up in
        consultation with the local police, local British Transport
        Police, the local authority, and other relevant organisations
        such as local coach operators and recognised
        supporters clubs.


    - The League, with advice and support from ACPO will ask
        all clubs to develop and introduce membership schemes for
        specific areas of their grounds by the beginning of the
        1987/88 season.          The schemes will cover at least 50% of
        each ground's capacity as determined by the conditions
        of the ground's safety certificate.


    - A team of representatives comprising the League, the Football
        Association, the Football Trust and independent advisors
        will be available to help and assist those clubs in need
        of guidance.


    - The Football Association will automatically take account
        of clubs' local plans in any disciplinary hearing in the
        event of crowd disorder or violence.




                                               -2-
- The League, the Football Association and the Clubs, with
  advice from the local police, will consider the need for
  all ticket arrangements at particular matches.


- The League will commission a study by independent consultants
  to report on the scope, costs and benefits/disadvantages
  of a reciprocal membership scheme embracing all 92 League
  Clubs.     The Association of Chief Police Officers have agreed
  to assist with and advise on this study.


   As   agreed,    Football   Trust       grants   will   be   made    available
   to Division Three and Four clubs for the installation of
  closed circuit television depending on the particular needs
  of individual clubs.


- The League and the Football Association will support and
 promote the development of family enclosures and other
  initiatives      designed   to      establish      closer    links     between
 clubs and their communities.

    THE 1987-88 SEASON



    PROGRESS ON MEASURES TO COMBAT FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM



    A REPORT BY THE MINISTER FOR SPORT




    INTERNATIONAL MATCHES



    Introduction



    1.      The interim report to UEFA in January stressed the importance

    that the UK attaches to close co-operation between the Government,

    football   authorities       and   the    police   and    their    counterparts

    throughout Europe.     The UK chairs the Council of Europe's Standing

    Committee on the European Convention on Spectator Violence and was

    the first to sign and ratify the Convention.         The UK plays an active

    role in the work of the European Community TREVI forum on football

    matters, established to improve communication between police forces

    about   preparations   and     security    arrangements    for    international

    football fixtures.     Many of the arrangements agreed by the Standing

    Committee and the TREVI group were put into practice in the detailed

    planning for the West Germany v England friendly international in
    September 1987.

     -->ropean Championships



    2.        The interim report mentioned that, building on the experience

    gained     at    this     international         match,    a    Working     Group       was     to    be

    established        to      oversee       the      arrangements           for     the      European

    Championships in the Federal Republic of Germany.                          The Group met for

    the first time on 19 January and has met regularly since then.                                      The

    Group is chaired by a Department of the Environment official and

    comprises       representatives          of    the    Football     Association,          the    Home

    Office,     the    Ministry       of     Defence,      the     Foreign     and        Commonwealth

    Office,     the    Police        and   the      British       Transport        Police.         Other

    interested parties, such as the ferry operators, have been called to

    meetings as appropriate.               Within the Working Group the Government,

    the FA and the police have worked closely together to ensure that

    every possible precautionary step is taken to minimise the risk of a

    criminal        hooligan     element,          masquerading        as     English        football

    supporters causing trouble at the Finals.



    Action by the FA



    3.        The FA have worked           closely with the German authorities on the

    detailed        arrangements       for        England's       supporters        attending           the

    Championships.            Tickets      for      the   Championships            have    only     been

    available in this country through the FA and                        all England supporters

    buying these tickets will                be accommodated insegregated areas.                        An

    important       concern    has    been    to    ensure,       as   far   as     possible,       that

    tickets were not sold to known troublemakers.                        A rigorous system of

    processing and vetting ticket sales was adopted for both individuals

    making direct applications               to the FA and travel              agents       providing

    package    trips    to the Championships.                 No one was           supplied with         a
^xcket unless they had completed a comprehensive application form

giving    full    details     of    the   applicant     including        their    travel       and

accommodation arrangements.               All applicants were checked against the
FA's list of offenders.



4.       In consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and

the    Department      of    the    Environment,       the    FA    produced      a        leaflet

reminding supporters of the need for good behaviour and providing

guidance for those travelling in Germany. The leaflet was issued to
everyone buying a ticket.



Action by the Police



5.       The BTP have, notably through the TREVI network,                         cooperated

closely with their counterparts in the Federal Republic of Germany

and    other    European     countries        likely    to    be   affected,          ie    those

countries      through      which    English     supporters        will travel         to     the

Championships. Information on the numbers of supporters and identity

of    known    and    potential      trouble     makers       planning to        go    to     the

Championships        without       tickets     was     passed      to    the     appropriate

authorities.         Action was also taken to identify recommended routes
for coach travel.



6.       The     Metropolitan       Police,     at     the    request     of     the       German

authorities,      are to provide a team of five officers to attend the

Championships as police             "spotters".        They will        assist   the German

police    by     providing     information        on    the     behaviour        of    England

supporters, identifying potential troublemakers and in communicating

with English supporters.             They will also coordinate intelligence on

the movement and behaviour of English supporters.
7.        I have     strenuously      insisted      that     there      should    be     maximum

police      cooperation,       co-ordination        monitoring          and      exchange     of
intelligence.



Action by the UK Government



8.        The Government expressed the hope that no English supporters

would travel to the Championships, thus avoiding the potential risk

of   extreme      provocation    by   "supporters"          of   other    competing       teams

which     might    occur.      However,        recognising       that    supporters       would

ignore this advice, the Government sought to address two particular

concerns. The first was to see that no ticket sales were allowed on

match days, or indeed for a period preceding the games.                           The recent

decision of the German authorities to allow no ticket sales on the

day of the match and two days before for each of England's group

matches was a welcome step in this direction.



9.        The second concerned ticket allocations                    to British Service

personnel stationed in Germany.                Although British Service personnel

in Germany have no record of football hooliganism the Government was

concerned about the degree of provocation that they would be likely

to experience in non-segregated areas of the stadium.                         It would have

been far better if all Service personnel had bought their tickets

from the FA and thus been accommodated in the English segregated

area. However,      tickets in West Germany had been available for some

time through the voucher system, and many Service personnel chose to

use this method of obtaining their tickets.                        It was not possible

therefore    to    accommodate    all     of    them   in    the   English       area.      But

Service     personnel       determined    to      attend     the     Championships         were
exhorted to buy their tickets through the FA and some 3,400 tickets

have     been    purchased       in    this     way.         British      Service    personnel    in

Germany are in no doubt about the need for good behaviour or their

liability to appropriate disciplinary action under Military or Civil
Law, should they transgress.



10.      The     Government           hope     of     course        that    these     exhaustive

precautionary measures will be successful and that the Championships

will be trouble free.             However,          despite all the efforts which have

been made the Government cannot of course offer any guarantee that

trouble will not occur; nor should it be overlooked that our tough

stance     towards crowd control can only be offered                           in the     form of

advice to the organisers of the tournament.



11.      UEFA have       asked    what        might    be    done    to    restrict    travel    by

'supporters'      known to be likely to cause trouble.                          The removal of

passports       is not    an option          for policy and            practical     reasons.      A

British citizen has a right in law to enter or leave the UK 'without

let or hindrance'.          Freedom of travel within the European community

is a matter on which the EC is taking a cooperative interest in the

run up to 1992.          Any steps that were taken to restrict travel within

the community could only be achieved by agreement of the constituent

countries rather than by the unilateral action of one country.                                   The

British passport establishes identity and nationality,                               it is not a

licence to travel.              The British Visitors Passport and the British

Excursion Document are freely available from Post Offices throughout

Britain.         Someone        deprived       of      one    passport       could    acquire      a

replacement       at     once     and        without     difficulty.           This     parallels

arrangements in European countries who have national identity cards

by which owners can travel in Europe without passports.




                                                                                                       A
DOMESTIC SEASON



12.    The interim report set out the measures which had been put in

place in recent years in order to deal with football hooliganism.

These include strengthening of police powers by banning alcohol at

football grounds and the introduction of exclusion orders.             It also

set out    the package of anti-hooligan measures        agreed   in February

1987 between the Government and the football authorities,           for full

implementation by the beginning of the 1987/88 domestic season.



Progress



13.    The efforts of the police aided by the additional powers they

have been given and the greater use of CCTV have made a significant

impact in the control of hooligan behaviour,          though they have not

eradicated it.     So far as the clubs and the football authorities are

concerned,   good progress had been made in some areas but not all

clubs have responded as far or as quickly as we would have wished.

Indeed a few are more than a year overdue in implementing this basic

package of anti-hooligan measures.



14.    All Football League clubs now have local plans for dealing

with home and away supporters agreed with the police;            all   ticket

arrangements     have   worked   well,   and   the   Government's   Manpower

Services Commission's Community Programme has sponsored and financed

"Football in the Community" schemes at 28 League clubs and schemes
are planned at a further 12 clubs.
I




    xa.     CCTV is widely recognised as                  the single most important and

    effective measure in combatting football hooliganism.                              Although 73

    clubs in the Football League had fixed CCTV installations at the end

    of    the     season,   and     a    further    4     had     access    to   portable     police

    operated       systems,      there     are    still      15   clubs     which,     for   various

    reasons, have not yet had CCTV installed.                         But the Football League

    have said that          12 of       these will      do    so by    the beginning of next

    season and that the other 3 will have access to a portable system,

    again by the beginning of next season.



    16.     As I mentioned in the interim report, progress on membership

    schemes has been slow.               16 clubs have met the 50% ground capacity

    provision of the February 1987 agreement.                         18 clubs have achieved

    between       40-50%,   21    between    30-40%,         20   between    20-30%,    9 between

    10-20%,       and 8 with less than 10%.               The reasons why clubs have not

    been able to reach the agreed level are explained in the interim
    report.



    17.     The Football League agreed in February 1987 to consider the

    possibility of a reciprocal membership scheme covering all 92 clubs.

    A consultants report on the feasibility was received in July 1987.
    It recommended that:-

              -    the   longer     term    aim    of     the     League     should     be   for   a

              reciprocal membership scheme which has all away supporters as
              members;

              - partial reciprocal membership schemes should be in place by

              the beginning of the 1988-89 season.

    The League also told the Government in November 1987 that they would
I




    consider     the        introduction     of     a   self     regulatory           system     for

    anti-hooligan measures.            Regrettably there is no progress to report
    on these issues at this stage.



    Preliminary Police assessment of the season



    18.    The police are currently conducting a full appraisal of the

    season just ended, and this will not be completed until next month.

    The Association of Chief Police Officer's sub-committee on football

    hooliganism      has however, given us a preliminary view.



    19.    A    list    of     matches     where    serious     incidents        of     violence

    occurred    is     at    annex    A.     In    general     ACPO     identify        two     main

    categories of match.             First those in which there has been a good

    deal   of   animosity between some             sections    of     the    crowd,    but     where

    police segregation and containment techniques have prevented actual

    violence.     The second category comprises matches                       where    there has

    been little evidence of bad behaviour or concerted aggression (often

    because away support has been light),                but where the potential for

    trouble could not be discounted.                 It is estimated that the second

    category represents a significant majority of matches.




    20.     Although violence by groups of hooligans away from grounds

    and on transit systems continues to occur, overall police strategies

    have succeeded          in containing    the problem,        but    at    a high cost         in

    terms of manpower.           The police are considering ways of increasing

    effectiveness      through,      for example,       the    more    active     use    of    CCTV
 /stems.          The    police     are      firmly    of   the     view      that   the       alcohol

controls are proving beneficial and have done much to improve the
demeanour of away supporters.



21.    The    statistics          on     attendances,       arrests        and     ejections        at

Football League grounds are not yet available for the whole of the

1987/88 season.           The latest available figures cover the period up to

the end of January 1988, and these are at annex B.                               The police have

rightly always maintained that in themselves these statistics are an

unreliable guide to the general level of crowd behaviour.                                      Despite

the well-publicised ugly incidents at end of                            season matches,             the

overall marginal improvement in behaviour within grounds in recent

seasons has been maintained.                  But there are still disturbingly large

numbers of hooligans who seem willing to indulge in aggressive and
provocative behaviour.



The cost of policing League grounds



22.    The        cost    of     policing       League      grounds      in      Great        Britain

increased during 1986-87, the latest year for which full statistics

are available,           by    16.6%,    rising     from a total         of      £3.13    m    to   the

highest ever level of £3.65 m.                      Preliminary figures for the first

half   of    the     1987-88      season       show   an    increase       of     29%     over      the
corresponding period for 1986-87.

Incidents of Hooliganism



23.    Police strategies have ensured that progress has been made in

containing        the    problem        of   hooliganism.         As    with      many     European

nations,     we    have noted       that      the   decline    in      incidents         inside     the

stadia has been accompanied by a continuing likelihood of trouble
 jcurring outside stadia.      Incidents inside grounds this season have

highlighted that there remain serious challenges to law and order.

It    is disappointing      that    the   season     should     have    begun,    at

Scarborough,    with   a   major    incident   of   hooliganism      and   end,   at

Chelsea, on the same note.         At international level you will be aware

of the deplorable incidents of violence at and after the England v
Scotland match at Wembley on 21 May.



24.       A note covering some of the major incidents of crowd disorder
this season is at annex A.



25.       It remains   the Government's    firm     intention    to continue      to

work with the football authorities for further progress on measures

to combat hooliganism.       The position is not static and determined

efforts    by clubs,   police and courts       are needed     over     a period of

years.     I will be reviewing with the football authorities before

next season, what more needs to be done and how quickly.
 ^arborough v Wolverhampton Wanders - 15.8.87                                Annex A


The main cause of the trouble was the inadequacy of the segregation

arrangements.     The barriers proved not to be strong enough and were

breached   in several     places   by Wolves      supporters.      The    relatively

large crowd     (7,314)   for this ground meant that space between Home

and Away supporters was very narrow and it proved impossible to keep

the two sets of supporters apart.            There was substantial damage to

the ground's stands and newly installed toilets.                  56 people were

arrested for offences of public order,             criminal damage,       theft and

drunkeness.      11   people    were    ejected    from   the   ground.      The    FA

announced, shortly afterwards, that all Wolves away matches would be

all-ticket for an indefinite period.



QPR v Chelsea - 12.9.87



The main incident of disorder occurred after the match had finished.

Chelsea supporters     in the    "away" end were being held back by the

police to allow the "home" supporters to disperse.               Most of the QPR

supporters had left.      Some 250 Chelsea supporters ran onto the pitch

towards the QPR "home" end.            Police and mounted officers were used

to disperse the Chelsea supporters.               19 people were arrested          for

various public order offences.          21 people were ejected.



Arsenal v Millwall - 9.1.88



Prior to the match, two public houses were damaged.               At the kick-off

approximately 100 Millwall supporters who had managed to infiltrate

the Arsenal   "end"    - the North Bank,          began   fighting with     Arsenal

supporters. The Police moved in quickly and the Millwall supporters
 „ere removed. When Arsenal scored, Millwall supporters showered the

police     with     coins.      48    people       were    arrested     and     73    people   were
ejected.



Aston Villa v Liverpool - 31.1.88



Returning from the match,               100 Liverpool supporters badly damaged 4

coaches of a train.             Windows and lights were smashed, seats slashed

and   ripped       out   and    fire    extinguishers           stolen.       The     police   were

called and the supporters rounded up and put back on the train.                                 The

train,     escorted by police officers,                   proceeded to Stafford Station

where it was taken out of service.                    Supporters were put on the next

train and escorted back to Liverpool.                          All of the supporters were

interviewed by CID officers at the Merseyside and BTP forces.                                  The

value of the damage was estimated to be around £5,000.



York City v Sunderland - 26.3.88



There were two incidents of crowd disorder at this match.                               The first

occurred about 20 minutes after the kick off.                          About 150 Sunderland

supporters attempted to gain access to the area immediately behind

the goal and began attempting to demolish a segregation fence.                                 The

police     moved    them       to    another   part       of    the   ground.         The   second

incident occurred after the end of the match.                          Sunderland supporters

started pulling out seats.               The police moved in to prevent this and

to remove the supporters.               The police contained these people at one

end   of   the    pitch    to       enable   the    rest       of   the crowd    to    leave   the

ground.     However,       about 300 on the pitch became disorderly.                           The
 -ossbar     at    one    end        of   the     ground    was    broken.        32   people       were

arrested,       all from the Sunderland area,                     for a variety of offences

e.g. public order, criminal damage and assault.



Chelsea v Charlton Athletic - 7.5.88



Problems     occurred       when          about    100     Chelsea    supporters       managed        to

infiltrate the segregated area for Charlton supporters.                                 The police

managed     to    prevent        a    further      300     Chelsea    supporters        from    doing

likewise.         Just after the kick-off the Chelsea supporters                               in the

Charlton end were attached by Charlton supporters and a fight ensued

involving       about    400     people.           The   police      then    moved     the   Chelsea

supporters       from    this        part of      the    ground.      Immediately after             the

match there were two fights outside the ground following attacks by

Chelsea supporters on Charlton supporters.                           These were soon broken

up   by   the     police.            35   people    were     arrested       and   there      were    47
ejections.



England v Scotland - 21.5.88



This match resulted in a number of incidents of disorder in Central

London, as well as at Wembley Stadium.                         Over 200 arrests were made

altogether, 112 of them in and around the Stadium.                                A general level

of   aggressive      and    drunken          behaviour       prevailed,       both     inside       the

stadium and in London generally.                        A serious incident occurred on a

London Underground train travelling from Wembley Park station.                                        A

crowd of 1,000 supporters were involved, trespassing onto the lines

and wrecking the train, causing it to be withdrawn from service. The

incidents inside the Stadium occurred in non-segregated areas.                                      The

police    were     able     to       deal    quickly       with    these     incidents.          Firm
  slicing prevented         any major incidents of disorder.                         It appeared

that most of         the offenders      had previously been drinking heavily.

However, local public houses were closed and traders restricted the

sale of alcohol immediately around the ground.



Chelsea v Mlddlesborough 28.5.88



The atmosphere was from the outset highly charged and difficulties

on the terraces were aggravated by the ticket selling policy of the

club which did not ensure total segregation.                     The club had sold 600

tickets to both Chelsea and Middlesborough supporters for a sterile

area within        the northern end       of    the members          enclosure.             Missile

throwing       and damage     to    the stands     ensued.         A     similar       situation

occurredin the West          Stand,     and in     order to        prevent any serious

outbreaks          of disorder,     the police     relocated         a    large       number     of

Middlesborough        supporters.        At     the     end   of       the     match        Chelsea

supporters [upset at their teams relegation] penetrated the security

fence    at    the Chelsea        "home end"    and   encroached          onto       the    pitch,

charging towards the Middlesborough supporters.                        Mounted police were

called and cleared          the pitch.       The disorder continued               outside       the

ground     into     the   early     evening,     causing      some       damage       to     public

property      in    and   around    public     houses    in    the       area.         104     were

arrested, 20 of which were made in the ground.                       The police received

32 injuries,        including      fractured jaws,       noses     and       ribs.         Numerous

injuries were received by spectators hit by flying seats, stones and
coins.

                                     AND     FOOTBALL            LEAGUE




The    Government and                the     football            authorities
discussed        the      n e ed     to     take       action       to         curb
violence       and       hooliganism                associated                with     football.
We    particularly             deplored             the b e h a v i o u r        of       so - ca l l e d ^
supporters          of    the      England           t ea m    in W e s t           Germany        during       the
European championships.                             H o o l i g a n i s m was            not a p r o b l e m
confined       to     football            but       football        provided                a f o c us    for    it

both    at   home        and    a b r oa d .


The    Prime M i n i st er           therefore             said     to         the
football        representatives                     that      sh e w o u l d         like

football        authorities.


Government measures


Considerable             police           resources           have            already
been devoted             to     football,             backed        by
 restrictions            on a l c o h o l         under       the    Sporting
 Events      (Control           of    Alcohol)             Act    1 98 5        an d      new

 Public Order             Act      1986.          The      police will
 intensify          their       efforts             to d e a l    with
 criminal        behaviour.                 The      Government                is
                                                                         ■l

            The    Government              is a l s o       considering              applications            from

            measures            agreed       between          the     Government             and    the     football
            authorities              in F e b r u a r y       1987.         Nevertheless                the p o l i c e
            view was            that      partial         club m e m b e r s h i p           schemes       had    not
            made     a significant                   contribution               to c o n t r o l l i n g
            hooliganism.


            The      Government              pressed         the    football
            authorities              to e s t a b l i s h      a    national
            membership              scheme         to c o n t r o l      access        to all
            Football            League matches.                    The     football
            authorities              do      not     believe        that        such     a

            bring        forward          proposals           for     legislation              to

BACKGROUND TO THE WORKING PARTY

1. The working party was set up following the meeting between the
Prime Minister and the President of the Football League and the
Chairman of the Football Association on 6 July 1988.      At that
meeting, the Prime Minister told the football authorities that
the Government believed that a national membership scheme to
control admission to football matches was necessary to counter
the continuing incidence of hooliganism associated with football.
The Prime Minister pressed the football authorities to establish
a scheme on a voluntary basis. The football authorities did not
believe that such a scheme could be introduced on a voluntary
ba s i s .

2. The Government recognises that there has been considerable
progress  on   the  anti-hooligan measures    agreed   between  the
Government and the football authorities. The Government cannot,
however, accept that the level of disorder within grounds is
tolerable. The Government and the police remain concerned that at
many grounds, football matches continue to provide a focus for
aggressive behaviour and gestures. These in turn may produce a
hostile  environment   and create   the  risk   of   disorder.  The
consequences  are  high   levels  of policing    and   increasingly
elaborate physical structures for crowd control and segregation.

3. The Government believes that a national membership scheme,
together with CCTV and other measures, can succeed in removing
the hooligan element from football matches and in breaking the
attachment of hooliganism to football. The Government sees the
national membership scheme as an essential element in a package
of measures which the Government is developing,   alongside those
already  taken   by  the  football  authorities,   to  deal with
hooliganism associated with football.

4. Considerable police resources are devoted to football, backed
by restrictions on alcohol under the Sporting Events (Control of
Alcohol) Act 1985 and powers for the police and the Courts under
the Public Order Act 1986. The police will continue their efforts
to deal with criminal behaviour. The Government is considering
ways of preventing convicted football hooligans from attending
matches abroad. It has already issued advice to police and the
courts on the enforcement of the law on the misuse of alcohol and
on the need to ensure swift justice following incidents of
hooliganism.

5. The President of The Football League and the Chairman of The
Football Association, told the Prime Minister that they disputed
strongly the necessity for the scheme. They argued that over the
past season there had been very few incidents of crowd disorder
within football grounds; the main incidents of disorder occurred
away from grounds and were outside the control of the football
authoritxes. They said that individual clubs did, however, take
firm   action   against   supporters   who    were    arrested for
football-related   offences.   The   football    authorities  were
unconvinced that the introduction of a national membership scheme



                                  1
would solve the problem of disorder which occurs away from
grounds and which is coupled with the increasing incidence of
serious disorder by young people in areas that are totally
unconnected with football.

6. The football authorities suggested at the meeting that the
introduction of a national identity card would provide a better
means of deterring hooliganism in the country as a whole than a
membership  scheme   confined  to  football.  The  view   of  the
Government representatives on the working party was however, that
the question of a national identity card was outside the working
party's terms of reference.

7. The football authorities said that they had co-operated fully
with the Government on the measures to curb hooliganism contained
in the agreement following meetings with Government Ministers in
1985 and 1986. The football authorities have taken wide-ranging
initiatives over the past two seasons to deal with the disorder
within football grounds. The main initiatives were the use of
closed circuit television (CCTV) at grounds, the introduction of
family areas and of voluntary membership schemes in home support
areas and the formation of local plans for dealing with crowd
control at matches in liaison with the local police.         They
consider   that  these  have   been  successful.   The  continued
segregation of supporters both inside and outside the ground,
liaison with the police on kick-off times and other measures have
helped to reduce considerably the potential for disorder. The
football authorities consider that, on those few occasions where
crowd disorder has occurred, the Football Association has, after
the necessary inquiries, dealt severely with clubs who have been
adjudged not to have taken all reasonable precautions.

8. The football authorities are seriously concerned that a scheme
involving the checking of membership cards would create new
problems in handling the admission of spectators. They are also
concerned about the possible long term effects on the football
industry of the introduction of the scheme. Football, as a
leisure industry, relies heavily on the revenue generated by the
paying spectator and they fear that many casual supporters and
elderly supporters and family groups will be deterred by the
scheme from attending matches.


The working party

9. The Prime Minister said that the Government would bring
forward proposals for legislation to give statutory backing to
the national membership scheme. Having made their position clear,
the President of the Football League and the Chairman of the
Football Association recognised the Government's commitment to
the introduction of a national membership scheme and undertook to
co-operate with the Government in considering the details of the
scheme.  It was agreed that a working party chaired by the
Minister for Sport would examine the details of the scheme.




                                2
10. The objectives of the working party were:


    i) to review the main principles of the scheme; and

   ii) to identify appropriate technology to implement the scheme
        for the start of the 1989-90 football season.


It met for the first time on Tuesday 26 July and on five further
occasions.  Its meetings were attended by representatives of the
following bodies:


   Football Association
   Football League
   Association of Chief Police Officers
   Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency
   Home Office
   No 10 Policy Unit
   Department of the Environment.


11. The football authorities representatives have taken an active
part in the discussions of the working party and they have agreed
the contents of the report subject to the points of disagreement
noted. Given that the Government is committed to the early
introduction of legislation for a national membership scheme, the
working party has been working to a very tight timetable. This
has imposed considerable pressures on all members of the working
party and, taken together with the strict confidentiality of the
working   party's  discussions,   has   prevented   the   football
authorities from consulting the clubs and others, as they would
have wished. They reserve the right to comment further in the
light of their consultations.     Subject to this,     the report
represents the recommendations of the working party,       to the
football authorities and the Government,       on what the main
elements of an effective scheme might be;     the Government, the
police and the football authorities are not committed to accept
these recommendations.

12. The Prime Minister made clear at the meeting on 6 July that
funding for the scheme would be a matter for the football
authorities. The working party has, in consequence, not discussed
funding in detail, but the football authorities are concerned
about the financial implications of the imposition of the scheme.




                                3
CHAPTER 1: SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

1. This chapter provides a summary of the working party's
recommendations for the main elements of the national membership
scheme, as discussed in the report.


1. GENERAL

     a)   Admission of spectators to        a   designated    football     match
          will only be permitted if:

              - the spectator produces a valid membership card for
            checking at the point of entry to the ground; and

              - the ground on which        the match   is    to be played        is
            covered by a licence.

     b)   The scheme will be a national one administered by a
           Football Membership  Authority;   information about all
          members will be held on a central computer.

     c)   A member will be entitled to only one card which will
           indicate the club which he, or she, supports and qualify
           him, or her, to attend any designated match.

     d)   The   scheme  will   apply  in  England   and  Wales   but
          consideration should be given to its extension to Scotland
           and Northern Ireland.

2.    MEMBERSHIP OF THE SCHEME                           (Chapter 2 )

     a ) An application should involve:
             a standard application form
             proof of identity
             proof of address
             a photograph.                               (paras 3-6)

          The football   authorities       disagree   with   the   need    for     a
          photograph.

     b)   Membership cards should include:
              the m e m b e r's name
              a photograph
              a membership number
              date of expiry
              the name of the club nominated
              the member's national football allegiance
           they should be readable electronically and valid for               two
           or three seasons only.                 (paras 7-13)

          The football authorities         consider that membership       should
          be valid for ten years.




                                       4
     c)   Exemptions from membership:
              no general exemptions for paying British spectators;
              limited temporary membership for accompanied foreign
              nationals;
              clubs   to  make  special   arrangements   for  guests,
              hospitality boxes and groups such as parties of school
              children, accompanied children in family enclosures
              and disabled people in designated areas with special
              access;
              non-spectators should not be subject to the scheme.
                                                   (paras 14-21)

     d)   Criteria for withdrawing or withholding membership from
          hooligans should include:
             mandatory criteria imposed by legislation linked to
             conviction for football-related offences,     involving
             bans of two or five years;
             discretionary   criteria   operated by   the   Football
             Membership Authority who will decide whether to impose
             bans and for how long.               (paras 22-28)

          The football authorities consider that mandatory criteria
          should apply to convictions for all offences of violence
          against the person.

     e)   Two new criminal offences should be created:
              for false application for membership;
              for gaining or attempting to gain entry to ground
              without a valid membership card.      (paras 29-30)

     f ) The football authorities consider there is a need for the
          two further criminal offences indicated in the body of the
          report. There should be a requirement for a member of the
          scheme to produce his/her membership card for inspection.
                                                  (paras 31-32)     *


3.    DESIGNATED FOOTBALL MATCHES                 (Chapter   3)

     a)   The scheme should apply to all matches between League
          clubs' first teams.                     (para 2)
     b)   The scheme should not apply to matches between non-League
          teams.                                  (para 3)
     c)   Matches between League clubs and non-League clubs should
          be designated but the scheme should allow initially for
          admission of non-members;               (paras 4-6)
     d)   Special   procedures    for  matches   involving    foreign
          teams.                                  (para 7)
     e)   Admission   for    members   only   to    matches   between
          English/Welsh and Scottish/Northern Irish teams.
                                                   (paras 8-11)




                                    5
4.    RESPONSIBILITY FOR       THE   SCHEME:   the      Football Membership
Authority and the clubs                                   (Chapter 4)

  a)    The FMA will be designated by the Secretary of State; it
        will draw up a scheme in accordance with criteria imposed
        by legislation; the scheme will be subject to approval by
        Secretary of State.                     (paras 1-2)

  b)    FMA's responsibilities to include:
           supervise application process
           approve/reject applications
           maintain central register of all members
           draw up rules on withdrawal of membership
           make decisions and possibly hear appeals on withdrawal
           licensing grounds (if this responsibility is delegated
           by the Secretary of State).
                                (paras 3-6) and (paras 12-13)

  c)    C l u b s ’ responsibilities to include:

              dealing with applications, maintaining records, supply
              of information to central register
              installation and maintenance of approved machinery for
              checking membership cards
              adequate   arrangements   to   control   admission    of
              spectators and to deal with holders of rejected cards
              provision of sufficient trained staff to operate all
              aspects of scheme
              other requirements to ensure effective operation of the
              scheme.                              (paras 7-11)

  d)    The scheme should be monitored by a small part-time
        inspectorate employed by and responsible to the FMA or
        another agency (or the Secretary of S t a t e ).
                                                    (para 14)

   e)   sanctions  on  clubs  which   fail         to    carry    out    their
        responsibilities should include:                 (paras   17-27)

        i)         withdrawal of the licence to admit spectators            to
                   the ground for persistent or serious failure or          in
                   an emergency following a serious disturbance;

        ii)        fines for minor breaches;

        iii)       criminal liability for admitting spectators           to a
                   designated match at a non licensed ground.

   f ) The FMA and the clubs will need to register with the Data
       Protection Registrar.                  (paras 28-31)

5. NOTIFICATION OF OFFENCES                              (Chapter 5)

In operating discretionary criteria to disqualify from membership
those whose behaviour is unacceptable, clubs will need to receive
information from the police about those who are being ejected




                                     6
•
    from the ground, and about those who are being arrested for an
    alleged criminal offence committed on the club's premises (para
    3).

    For the mandatory criteria imposed by the legislation to work
    properly, the FMA must receive information about convictions for
    football related offences. The working party recommends:


       1. the question of whether an offence      is    football     related
       should be determined by the courts;

      2. the Government should initiate discussions with the courts,
      the Crown Prosecution Service and the police to determine the
      most efficient means of notifying convictions to the FMA
      (paras 5-12).


    The Government should determine with the police and the football
    authorities suitable arrangements for ensuring that troublemakers
    are not admitted to the scheme at the outset. An early Government
    announcement sliould make it clear that past behaviour will be
    taken into account in deciding who shall be disqualified from
    membership (paras 13-16).


    6. TECHNOLOGY AND TIMING                           (Chapter 6)

       a) The Government representatives and the police are satisfied
          that the technology is available to implement the scheme.
          The main elements should be:

              i)    a computerised central register
             ii)    a computer at each club
            iii)    card readers at turnstiles, to be portable           if
                     possible.
                                                    (paras 1-11)

       b)   Membership cards are to be readable electronically. The
            options,   on which the working party has    not   drawn
            conclusions, are:

               i)   barcode cards
              ii)   magnetic stripe cards
             iii)   Smartcards.
                                                       (paras 12-17)

       c) The new technology may also provide opportunities for the
          clubs to improve their own administrative procedures and
          for marketing.                          (paras 18-19)

             The football authorities are not committed to these views
             and the working party agreed that, until the consultants
             report and the views of the commercial advisers had been
             received, these must remain matters of judgement.




                                      7
CHAPTER 2: MEMBERSHIP OF THE SCHEME

1. The central feature of the national membership scheme will be
that spectators will not be admitted to designated football
matches unless they can produce a valid membership card, properly
issued to them.   Cards will be checked at the point of entry to
the ground. No member will be able to hold more than one card,
but a valid membership card will entitle the holder to attend any
designated match.
2   The working party discussed whether people should become
members of the national scheme directly or via membership of a
Football League club. Direct membership of the national scheme
would provide economies of scale and mitigate the burden of the
scheme on clubs; vetting of applications and decisions about
withdrawal of membership could be handled centrally. On the other
hand   the more closely individual clubs are involved in running
the scheme, the more responsibility they may be expected to take
for its success. On balance the working party accepted the strong
recommendation of the representatives of the football authorities
that members should join the national scheme directly,        but
indicate which club they support (or the club with which they
wish to be associated). Individual clubs may wish to develop a
direct role in exploiting the commercial opportunities of the
scheme.


Applications for membership

3. Applications for membership should be made on a standard
application form drawn up by the body responsible for running t e
scheme (hereafter called the Football Membership Authority, FrfA).
Application forms would be issued, and received on completion, by
Football League clubs and other agencies who would pass them on
for vetting to the FMA (see chapter 4). The form would seek the
following information:


   name
   address
   date of birth
   date of application
   sex
   club which applicant nominates
   national football allegiance.


 4 The working party recognised that a balance had to be struck
 between requiring essential     information and asking so many
 questions   that  people   were   reluctant   to  complete  their
 application forms. The view of the Government representatives and
 the police was that the applicant should also be asked to confirm
 that he was not presently a member of the scheme, and to provide
 details of any previous withdrawal of membership and of any
 previous  conviction  or prosecution     pending for   an offence



                                 8
committed at or on the way to or from a football match. This
would help to deter undesirable applicants and to facilitate the
vetting process. The football authorities disagreed and felt that
these additional questions would be a disincentive for people to
join the scheme.

5. The applicant would be required to show proof of identity and
proof of address. Young people unable to produce proof of
identity or address could have their applications signed by an
adult who could produce such proof. The view of the Government
representatives   and   the police,   with  which     the   football
authorities disagree, is that applicants should also provide two
photographs, one for the card, one for the F M A 's records.   Clubs
might wish to make arrangements for taking the photographs of
applicants; it would, in any case, be necessary for them, or the
other agencies to which application was made, to check that the
photographs of personal applicants were of the person concerned.
6. The working party took the view that,          provided that a
sufficient number of outlets were available for the application
process, postal applications would be unnecessary and should not
be allowed except in the case of applicants from Scotland and
Northern Ireland    (if not part of the scheme)        and foreign
countries (for whom photographs would need to be countersigned by
a responsible person). Membership cards should be sent to the
applicant at the address given as an additional test of the
address. The football authorities consider that the availability
of temporary membership cards to cover delays in processing
applications is essential.


Membership cards

7. The technology for membership cards is discussed in chapter 6;
some options would make it possible for the cards to carry more
information than others.  The minimum information required to be
carried on the card for the scheme to be effective would be the
name of the member, photograph (see paragraph 9), the date to
which the card is valid, the name (or logo), of the club the
member nominates and national football allegiance; the card must
also be     readable electronically and be numbered. The police
considered that it would be a useful additional safeguard if the
card were capable of bearing the member's signature.

8. The working party recognised that no     system of membership
cards was impervious to forgery and fraud.  We were advised that,
without causing unacceptable delays at entry turnstiles, it was
not currently possible to verify electronically fingerprints or
other unique personal characteristics. The conclusion of the
working party was that a combination of both a photograph and
electronic readability offered the best means of restricting
admission to holders of valid cards.    If the card did not meet
both of these requirements, the opportunities for abuse would be
unacceptably wide.

9. The football representatives did not accept the necessity for
the card   to carry a photograph of the applicant. They were very
doubtful    of   its  value   other than    to   provide  initial



                                 9
identification on detention by the police. The photograph would
add to the complexity of applying for a card. It was however the
view of the Government representatives and the police, that a
photograph was essential to the integrity of the whole scheme
both to deter fraud and impersonation and to aid identification
if the holder were involved in disorder. The football authorities
were firmly of the view in any event that photographs should not
be required for children under 16. The view of the Government
representatives and the police was that photographs should be
required at least for children of 14 and o v e r .

10. The working party discussed what the most appropriate life
span of the membership card might be. If cards were valid for one
season only, the number of lost, stolen and damaged cards in
circulation could be kept to a minimum. But a requirement "to
renew cards every year might prove a major deterrent to potential
members (and reduce attendances);    it would also add to the
burdens of the FMA and the clubs. At the same time a system of
life membership would entail problems about changes of address
and physical appearance and would, unless the cards were replaced
regularly, build up an unacceptable level of invalid cards in
circulation. An accumulating database of invalid cards would be
likely to rule out the possibility of using portable card readers
(see Chapter 6).
11. The football authorities felt that membership should be valid
for the same length of time as a British Passport, ie ten years.
The cards could be reissued without reapplication ac inLtrvals
say of two or three years thus renewing the database. The view ot
the Government representatives was that       membership without
reapplication should be valid for a period of two or three y ea r s .

12. When the member arrives at the ground, he will hand his card
to the turnstile operator who will run it through the elec^ronxb
reader which will check its validity. There would be unacceptable
delays if the turnstile operators were asked to check pho t,ograpns
as well. The football representatives were particularly concerned
about the delays that might result when cards are rejected by the
electronic readers. It is essential that there is a means of
identifying   invalid   and   damaged  cards  separately   at
turnstile. In the case of an invalid card, it would be for the
police to investigate whether a criminal offence had been
committed. The football authorities reserved their right to
comment further on this point after seeking advice from their
consultants. The working party recognised that the arrangements
for   dealing  with   rejected   cards  would need   very   careful
attention.
 13. Members should be asked to inform the FMA of changes of
 address and of other relevant information, and if their card is
 lost or stolen.     Information about lost or stolen cards is
 important to the security of the scheme  but there is no obvious
 way to compel members whose cards are lost or stolen to inform
 -the FMA. In the view of the Government representatives and the
 police the risk that people may fail to report lost or stolen
 cards makes it particularly important that cards should include
photographs. It was accepted that clubs should be able to issue
temporary membership cards, valid for one match only, to members
whose cards were lost, stolen, or damaged.

Exemptions from membership

14. The working party believes that consideration of possible
exemptions from membership should start from the premise that
exemptions should be allowed only if there is a very good reason
for them and if arrangements can be made to ensure that they do
not create an unacceptable loophole in the scheme. For some
groups,  exemption is not the obvious answer which it might
appear. A general exemption might be proposed, for example, for
children under a certain age, disabled people,       and Old Age
Pensioners, on the grounds that they were unlikely to cause
trouble. But these are potentially large groups and exemptions
would themselves impose an additional layer of checking, for
example to ensure that those concerned were the age they said
they were. The Government representatives and the police consider
it is preferable to require membership of all spectators (subject
to the following paragraphs) and to leave it to the FMA and clubs
to issue some (or indeed all) membership cards free, or at a
reduced rate, if they wish.


Accompanied children in designated family areas

15. The working party considered, in the interest of encouraging
families to attend matches, that children under 16, accompanied
by an adult member of the scheme, could be exempt from the scheme
provided t h a t :-


   (i)        they view the match from a designated family enclosure;
              and

   (ii)       there is direct access to that family enclosure,    not
              allowing transfer to other areas of the ground.


Disabled people in designated areas
          "     *   —   —   ™   ....................




16. The working party considered that a similar exemption could
apply  to those disabled people     for whom  clubs  provide  a
designated area and special access.


Foreign Visitors

17. Exemption may    also be   justified  for   foreign visitors
attending a single domestic match, at the discretion of the club.
Clubs could maintain a small stock of temporary membership cards,
valid for one match only, which could be issued to foreign
visitors, against proof of their identity (passport or national
identity card).   The clubs should be responsible for their
behaviour.   The clubs should also maintain records of those to
whom the temporary cards are issued,       to ensure that this



                                                       11
arrangement is not abused by foreign nationals who attend matches
regularly (and who could apply in the normal way for a standard
membership c a r d ).

18. The working party recommends that similar privileges should
not be extended to Scottish or Northern Irish visitors. Foreign
visitors may reasonably be asked to show their passport or
national identity card as proof of identity (since they will have
needed them to enter the country). This is not the case for UK
nationals and it is more reasonable to ask an occasional visitor
from Scotland or Northern Ireland to obtain a membership card of
his or her own than to ask a foreign national, who may be
unfamiliar with our language and institutions, to do so. Wide
availability of temporary cards to UK nationals would lay the
scheme open to abuse.    The arrangements for matches involving
foreign teams are discussed in chapter 3.


Other guests
19. The working party considered that there was a good case for
allowing the exemption of certain spectators who do not pay at
the turnstiles such as guests of the club s ' directors, sponsors
and their guests and those using hospitality boxes. On the one
hand, they are present at grounds to watch matches and it may be
aroued that they should        he expected to become members of the
scheme In the same way as other spectators. On the other htmd^
the, risk of hooliganism,      among these groups is negligible and
hospitality boxes and sponsorship are an important source of
revenue to many clubs. Furthermore, special additional procedures
would be required to check membership cards of people who do^not
usually go through the          turnstiles.On balance, the working
p a r t y ’s view is that admission of guests should not depend on
membership of the scheme.
20.  For other categories of club or        sponsor’s guests not
physicalIv segregated from the rest of the spectators xt shoexd
be possible for'”the clubs to make appropriate arrangements _In
advance for temporary match day membership,      as for roreign
visitors. In this and all cases where satisfactory arrangements
can be agreed the club, and the sponsor in the case of sponsor's
guests, should take responsibility for the behaviour of those who
benefit from them. Temporary membership cards should be produced
in such a way as to ensure that they could be used only once.

21. Another group for which exemption could be claimed is that of
organised school parties or parties of children from another
club. The working party would not wish the scheme to preclude
such groups from attending football matches. The working party is
confident that the clubs will be able to devise arrangements to
accommodate them.   The possibilities would include temporary
membership and a special entrance and enclosure within the
ground. The requirements of the national membership scheme will
not apply to those attending football grounds in a professional
capacity: the police; ambulance men; caterers; journalists etc.
Criteria for withdrawing or withholding membership

22. The main objective of the national membership scheme is to
deny entry to those who may be expected to cause trouble, in
order further to improve standards of behaviour at football
matches.   The  scheme  must   therefore  provide   criteria  for
withdrawing or withholding membership both from those who have
been convicted of relevant criminal offences and from those whose
behaviour is, in other ways, unacceptable.     The working party
considers that:


   (1) the withdrawal or withholding of membership from those
   convicted of relevant criminal offences should be subject to
   mandatory rules, imposed by legislation;

   (2) the FMA should have discretion to exclude people (whether
   convicted of criminal offences or not) from the scheme for
   behaviour which it finds unacceptable, (this discretion should
   be recognised in the legislation which establishes the scheme
   and should be exercised in accordance with rules drawn up by
   the FMA and approved by the Secretary of Sta te );

   (3) nothing in (1)   or (2) should remove from the individual
   football club its    present right to refuse entry to its
   premises.


Mandatory criteria

23. The purpose of establishing mandatory criteria for banning
those convicted of criminal offences, is to ensure that potential
offenders are aware of the consequences for their continued
membership of the scheme. The working party recommends a two-tier
tariff for convicted offenders:


         i)    if the offender receives a custodial sentence     -
               withdrawal of membership for five years;

        ii)    if any other sentence,     including   a community
               service order or a fine, is imposed    - withdrawal
               of membership for two years.


These criteria would be established in legislation and the
withdrawal of membership would take effect on the FMA receiving
notification of a conviction from the police or the courts. The
standard two tier tariff suggested above would be broadly
consistent with the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. It
would be open to the FMA to impose additional bans on these
offenders at their own discretion (see paragraph 26 below).

24. The working party considers that these mandatory rules should
operate only in respect of a category of offences similar to that
listed as football-related in the Public Order Act 1986 for the
purposes of exclusion orders (see A n n e x ), (provided that the



                                13
court declares that the offence itself is a f°°tb all-related °j®
- see chapter 5), and of the new offences recommended below. It
may be argued, and the football authorities were strongly of this
view  that conviction for any crime of violence should
withdrawal of membership. It would however be difficult to
clear and reasonable line; violence in the family, for example,
may be no guide to a person's behaviour at a football match,
conviction for violence at other sporting events would be
obviously relevant and again the football authorities considere
that this should be taken into account.
25  It was with reluctance that the Government representatives
and the police took the view that the practical difficulties of
defining  such   offences  and  of  arranging   for   notification
precluded extending the mandatory criteria to them. The wider t
ranae of offences considered relevant, the more difficult
Sould be to arrange the disclosure of Information to the FMA <see
rhaDter 5 below)    and to justify such disclosure. The football
authorities maintained their strong view that for the scheme to
operate  effectively the mandatory     criteria  must   extend  to
convictions for any violent crimes.


Non-mandatory criteria
    it is essential that the FMA should have discretion to impose
bans of its own   both in the form of additional bans in respect
of criminal offences on top of those required by the legislation
and in respect of other forms of unacceptable behaviour.  The FMA
might withdraw membership, other than as a result of =      ction
for a criminal offence, in the event of behaviour leading to
arrest or ejection from the ground (whether or not the per so
concerned was subsequently charged); and other forms of offensive
behaviour which can produce an unacceptably hostile environment
inside grounds.
 27    The working party envisages that the non-mandatory criteria
 for withdrawa 1 of membership to be operated by the FMA should be
 iSe subiect of rules, concerning both the abuses for which bans
 ^ ? 1 ^ T m p o s e d and their length, approved by the Secretary of
 State      The working party recommends that the minimum period for
 which" membership should be withdrawn, at the
 should be twelve months, within this
 - r ~ „ i s o m e cases (eg ejection from a ground) may give rise to
 pre-determined automatic bans, effective from the date the F M A i s
 notified of the incident. In other cases the clubs would make a
 report to the FMA, who would then decide the appropriate ban      in
  the liqht of the circumstances. The FMA may wish to conside
  whether people should have the right to appeal against withdrawal
  of membership (see chapter 4 below). Just as there should be
  mandatory and discretionary rules for withdrawing membership so
  there will have to be parallel rules for withholding membership
  from applicants.
  28 The football authorities felt strongly that the Police should
  forward to them information on arrests for a football related
  offence wherever it took place.     However,  the view of the



                                  14
Government representatives and the police was that the F M A 1s
discretion to withdraw membership in cases of arrest would have
to be restricted to incidents inside or just outside football
grounds.  It might be difficult      for the FMA    to impose a
discretionary ban on a member of the scheme who was arrested away
from the ground, in travelling to or from a match for example,
because the FMA would have no direct evidence on which to base
its decision. The FMA might find it difficult to justify imposing
the ban in advance of conviction, when an alleged offence had not
occurred on a football club's premises.

New criminal offences

29.   The   working   party  recommends  that   the   legislation
implementing   the  scheme  should establish  two   new criminal
offences in respect of membership of the scheme,       along the
following lines:


   a)   it should be an offence knowingly or recklessly to provide
        false information in applying for a membership card;

  b)    it should be an offence for anyone to attempt to obtain
        entry or to gain entry to a ground (or to be present in a
        ground) for a designated football match without being in
        possession of his or her valid membership card, except in
        accordance with the scheme.


30. The case for the second of these offences is perhaps less
obvious than the first.   It would be possible to rely on clubs
simply turning people away if they did not have a valid card or
if they tried to use someone else's card.  But the working party
believes that it is essential to minimize the danger that large
numbers of people may attempt to gain entry without valid cards.
The establishment of a new criminal offence should deter people
from trying to cheat the system. The police may require specific
powers,  for example powers to arrest in these cases,        for
effective enforcement.

31. The football authorities believed      that   two   further   new
criminal offences were also needed:-


        it should be an offence for anyone to fail to produce his
        or her card on demand to a police officer or authorised
        officer if inside the ground or to a police officer if
        outside the ground, or upon arrest for a football-related
        offence;

        it should be an offence for anyone to     fail to surrender
        his or her card when ordered to do        so, by a police
        officer, in or around the ground.

CHAPTER 3: DESIGNATED FOOTBALL MATCHES

1, The Secretary of State will designate those football matches
to which admission will be subject to the requirements of the
national membership scheme.   The working party recommends that
designation should initially be confined to matches involving
League teams. The Secretary of State will have the power to add
further categories of matches (and other sporting events) to his
initial list should it prove necessary to do so.

2. Designation should apply to any match between Football League
clubs' first teams, wherever it is played, in England and Wales,
to include:


            i)   Football League matches;

           ii)   Cup competitions confined        to League   clubs;

          iii)   FA Cup   or   Welsh    FA   Cup matches between   League
                 clubs;

           iv)   the FA Charity Shield match;

            v)   "friendly matches".


For these matches, admission should be restricted to holders of
membership cards (subj ect to chapter 2 a b o v e ). The working party
took the view that there was no present case for designating
matches between reserve teams or youth teams representing League
clubs.

3. The working party proposes that the Secretary of State should
not designate, initially, matches in the GM Vauxhall Conference,
nor other matches between non-League, amateur or junior teams.
There  are  two categories of match where      the  question of
designation is less easy to resolve:


     a)    matches between a League club and a non-League club, in
          the FA Cup or the Welsh FA Cup, or a friendly match; and

     b)    matches between an English or Welsh League              club,    or
          national team, and a team from another country.


4.   a)    Matches between League and non-League tea m s.  For such
          matches played at League grounds, there are two options:


            i)   restrict admission to holders        of membership cards.
                 This would almost certainly         mean that supporters
                 of the non-League team would         be admitted only if
                 they had joined the national        membership scheme as



                                       17
              supporters of a League club (as many of them may).
              It might be possible to establish a special
              category   of  membership,  within   the  national
              membership scheme, for supporters of non-League
              clubs but the working party did not feel that the
              number of matches involved would justify doing
              so.
       ii)    Allow non-members access to the ground for such
              matches.     Supporters of the League team would be
              encouraged to use turnstiles at which their cards
              would be checked according to national membership
              scheme procedures but supporters of the non-League
              team would not have to produce membership cards at
              the turnstiles allocated to them (though they
              would have to buy tickets, in advance, from their
              own clu b s ).


5.  The working   party   felt that   option  (i ) represented   a
disproportionate burden on non-League clubs and their supporters,
given the small number of matches for which the procedure would
be relevant and the lack of trouble in the past at such matches.
Option (i) might also pose problems of its own - for example, if
supporters of the non-league team had joined the scheme as
supporters of the League club who were the opponents on the day.
The working party recommends, therefore, that option (1 1 ) should
be followed, at least initially. The matches concerned would
nonetheless be designated, so that members will be required to
produce membership cards on request and risk losing them if they
misbehave (the scheme would allow for an appropriate variation).
If there were to be trouble at such matches, they could rapidly
be brought fully within the scheme.

6. For matches between non-League and League teams played at
non-League grounds, only the second option would in practice be
available, if the electronic readers used to check membership
cards at League grounds were not portable (see chapter 6), sin^®
visual checks of all cards would cause too many delays. We would
in any event recommend the second option.

7. b) Matches between Enalish/Welsh teams and teams from another
country.  For matches involving non-UK opponents, whether at club
or international level, all home supporters would be admitted
only on production of their membership cards.    There would have
to be special arrangements for foreign supporters. It is not
reasonable to require nationals supporting their team for one
match   in this   country  to become members    of  the  national
membership scheme; nor can they be excluded altogether.    On the
other hand,   some control is essential.       The working party
proposes, therefore, that supporters of foreign teams should be
admitted only through specified turnstiles, on production of a
passport or national identity card. The club will need to take
reasonable precautions to ensure ticket and passport or identity
 card are in order. The working party recognised that, having




                                 18
taken such precautions,   a club could not be held responsible if
say a supporter were      to gain entry by producing a forged
passport.

8. For matches between English/Welsh teams and teams from
Scotland or Northern Ireland, the working party proposes that
admission should be confined to holders of national membership
scheme membership cards.      Many Scottish and Northern Irish
supporters will be members because they support Football League
clubs anyway. For those who are not, and who wish to attend
matches involving their teams in England or Wales, there will be
no alternative but to join the scheme, as a supporter of an
English or Welsh club. The working party considers that such a
requirement is essential in order to avoid disruption at matches
between English or Welsh teams and other British teams.

9. The working party does not feel, however, that this approach
is an entirely satisfactory one. In particular, we are concerned
that some Scottish or Northern Irish football supporters might
claim, in joining the scheme, to be supporters of an English club
against whom their own local team plays. It would be impossible
to segregate supporters effectively in such circumstances; and
the threat of withdrawal of membership would not be sufficient to
deter potential Scottish or Northern Irish troublemakers because
it would have no implications for their future attendance at
matches in their own country.

10. In the light of this difficulty, and also because there is
some danger that hooligans banned from the national membership
scheme in England and Wales will begin to attend matches in
Scotland or Northern Ireland (there is already considerable
evidence of fans from England attending major Scottish games) the
working party recommends that further consideration should be
given to extending the scheme to those countries.

11. Chapter 2 proposes that applicants should be asked to state
their national football allegiance in applying for membership and
that membership cards should indicate that allegiance.  Cards can
therefore help achieve segregation at international matches
staged in England and Wales between the four home countries.
                                                                    t
CHAPTER 4: RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SCHEME; THE FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP
AUTHORITY AND THE CLUBS ~~~~~

1. The Secretary of State will designate a Football Membership
Authority  to  draw   up  the  national   membership  scheme,  in
accordance with criteria laid down by Parliament.    The FMA will
be responsible for submitting the scheme to the Secretary of
State for approval and for ensuring that it is in place on time.
The scheme will be a national one governed by national rules but
the FMA will delegate much of the day-to-day responsibility for
operating the scheme to the clubs. This chapter discusses the
respective responsibilities of the FMA and the clubs and the
arrangements for monitoring their performance.

2. The Football Association and the Football League have decided
that they will wish to share responsibility and establish a joint
body which they would recommend to the Secretary of State for
designation as the Football Membership Authority. The working
party noted that the football authorities had, at this early
stage, appointed consultants to advise on all matters related to
the scheme.


Responsibilities of the FMA

3. The FMA will produce the standard form for applications for
membership (as described in chapter 2). It will determine the
arrangements by which applications are to be made - whether the
clubs are to be the only places to which applications may be
made, or whether post offices or even banks might be invited to
distribute and receive forms. Wherever applications are made,
they will be passed to the FMA for decision.        It will vet
applications for membership against its records to ensure that
no-one has membership of more than one club and that the
applicant is not under a ban. It will need to inform the police
about false applications.    It may receive information about
misbehaviour by members from sources other than the League clubs
-for example from the police and the courts (see chapter 5), from
non-League clubs, from Wembley, and from international sources.
It will decide whether applicants are to be accepted and whether
membership is to be withdrawn in cases which do not involve a
criminal conviction (see chapter 2).


Central register of members

4. The FMA will maintain a central register of all members of the
scheme, of those "blacklisted" from membership and of cards which
have become invalid for other reasons.        The clubs will be
required to supply updated     recommendations for withdrawal of
membership, and (since some people might prefer to tell the club
rather than the FMA) information on cancelled membership and lost
and stolen cards to the central register. The FMA will inform
clubs of new members who have nominated them and also supply
up-to-date details of invalid, lost or stolen cards. Thus, each



                                20
club should have, for every match, details of members who are its
supporters and an up-to-date list of all cards that have been
invalidated before their expiry. The FMA will need to take a view
on the frequency of the exchange of information between itself
and the clubs.


Withdrawal of membership and appeals

5. The FMA will make decisions about withdrawal of membership on
the criteria discussed in chapter 2. It will need to draw up
rules, in consultation with the clubs, on the circumstances in
which a ban is to be automatic (eg in the case of ejection from
the ground) and for how long, and on the other cases in which it
will consider recommendations for banning from clubs. These rules
will also   need to deal with the possibility of      extending the
mandatory bans applied in the case of convictions, where the FMA
and the clubs consider that an offence is serious enough to
warrant an extended ban. These rules on withdrawal of membership
will be an integral part      of the scheme when it issubmitted for
approval to the Secretary of State.

6. In all cases where membership is withdrawn by the FMA for
periods other than mandatory periods the FMA may wish to consider
whether it should operate a procedure for appeals.


Responsibilities of the clubs

7. Football clubs would have day-to-day responsibilities for many
aspects of the scheme.       They would, in most cases, hold the
licence to admit spectators to their grounds but licences will
relate to grounds rather than clubs,        since a ground has a
physical existence which a club does not. The licence for the
ground   would,   however, depend  on   the   club meeting    its
responsibilities under the legislation and under the scheme.

8. Clubs' responsibilities      under   the   scheme   may   include   the
following:


   a)   Membership applications and records

          i)   ensuring that application forms are complete and
                that photographs are of the right person; passing
                applications quickly to the FMA for vetting;
                issuing cards promptly (NB any other agency which
               deals with applications will also have to meet
                these requirements);

         ii)   supplying regularly up-to-date information about
               lost and stolen cards and cancelled membership to
               the FMA;




                                  21
       iii)    amending club records of members who are their
               supporters and ensuring that their list of invalid
               cards is up-to-date on receipt of information from
               the FMA;

  b)   Dealing with offenders

         i)    prompt reporting of misbehaviour which may lead to
               withdrawal of membership by the FMA;

        ii)    prompt action in response    to   FMA   decisions    on
               withdrawal of membership;

  c)   Match arrangements

         i)    making adequate arrangements to prevent entry to
               designated matches by spectators not in possession
               of a valid membership card properly issued to
                them;

        ii)    installation of the equipment required by           the
                scheme and ensuring proper maintenance of it;

       iii)    making adequate arrangements      for   dealing   with
                holders of rejected cards;

        iv)    taking such precautions as are      reasonable, (as
                they do now),     to cope with     the arrival of
                last-minute crowds;

  d)   Staff
         i)    provision and training of sufficient staff to meet
                all aspects of the club’s responsibilities.


9. The working party considered the case for requiring clubs to
take other anti-hooliganism measures, in addition to those listed
above, as a condition of the ground licence. The availability of
CCTV, effective arrangements for segregating rival supporters and
adequate stewarding have all been essential to the success of a
package of anti-hooligan measures. On the other hand, it will
also be essential to avoid an overlap between the requirements of
a certificate issued under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
and a licence related to the national membership scheme; if the
two   were  to  overlap,  clubs   could  find  themselves  facing
conflicting demands, though of course local authorities would
have to act within the boundaries of the national membership
scheme legislation.

10. The case for including a requirement on the availability of
CCTV in the licence conditions may be a particularly strong one,
since it does not fall within the Safety at Sports Grounds Act
and is an essential tool in crowd control and the identification
of troublemakers. Subject to that point, the working party took
the view that, at least initially, the responsibilities of the
clubs in respect of the scheme should be confined to those



                                22
spelled out in paragraph 8 above-   The Secretary of State should
have the power to add further conditions to a licence, on
detailed arrangements for segregation, for example, if it becomes
clear that it would be helpful to do so.

11. The working party noted that a number of clubs had expressed
concern about the implications that the scheme would have for
their arrangements for handling crowds, for example, in dealing
with people who support neither home nor away clubs or in opening
the gates before the end of a match to allow people to leave (and
as a consequence allowing others to enter). Given the variety of
arrangements adopted at different football grounds, issues of
this kind would need to be resolved by individual clubs in
consultation with the local police and the FMA.        There is,
however, no reason why the existence of membership cards should
pre-determine a club's approach to supporters or change its
existing segregation arrangements; cards could, moreover, help
clubs in implementing their present segregation arrangements. The
membership scheme will not prevent clubs from allowing people to
leave matches before the end but, in doing so, they will have to
take reasonable precautions, consistent with the need for safety,
to preclude the admission of people without membership cards.


Monitoring the scheme

12. The working party believes that the scheme should operate, as
far as possible, on the basis of co-operation between the clubs
and the FMA. There will, however, have to be arrangements for
monitoring the clu bs ' performance    and for a system of sanctions
to   be  applied     in   the    event of   failure   to   meet   their
responsibilities. As to who should perform this role, it may be
argued that if the FMA is to be responsible for the scheme as a
whole,  it should act as licensing authority,          and have full
responsibility for monitoring the club s ' performance and for
taking action against those who do not carry out their duties
under the scheme. On the other hand, there may be advantage for
the Secretary of State to be the licensing authority, to act as
an independent arbiter of the clu b s ’ performance and to take
corrective   action     in    certain  circumstances.    The   football
authorities were strongly of the view that the latter was the
appropriate cour s e .

13. One way in which the FMA and the Secretary of State might
share responsibility would be for the Secretary of State to
delegate the licensing function to the FMA, within a framework
which he would approve. He would retain a reserve power to direct
the authority to take action if he considered it essential, in
the event of a serious disorder or if he had reason to believe
that a ground should lose its licence. The Secretary of State
might also require the FMA to make annual reports to him about
its actions as licensing authority but, for the most part, he
would not seek to intervene. The working party did not reach
agreement on this issue and the phrase "licensing authority" is
used throughout this chapter.
14. The licensing authority would set up a small part-time
inspectorate to monitor the introduction and operation of the
scheme and to advise on whether a ground should receive a licence
in the first place and when appropriate on whether it should
subsequently be withdrawn. The inspectorate would need powers to
inspect and warn clubs about any failings in their operation of
the scheme. The working party would expect the inspectorate to be
drawn largely from ex-police officers or others with relevant
experience.

15. The FMA will itself be under a statutory duty to operate the
scheme satisfactorily.  In case it fails to do so, the Secretary
of State will need a power to terminate the scheme, so that he
may designate another body to take on the job. The working party
proposes that the Secretary of State should give at least six
months notice of termination and that this notice should expire
only on 1 May in any year (to give time for a new authority to
prepare for the following season).

16. Given the power of the Secretary of State to terminate the
scheme, the working party does not consider     it necessary to
create any specific new sanctions to which the FMA should be
liable in respect of its duties in relation to the scheme; but it
will in any case be liable to action for breach of statutory duty
or to mandamus, if it fails to impose sanctions on clubs as
required by the scheme,     or to carry out its other duties
effectively.


Sanctions on clubs

17. The licensing authority will need to be satisfied that a club
is both capable and ready to carry out its responsibilities under
the scheme before a licence is issued for the ground. In the case
of a non-League club ground that is to be licensed, such as
Wembley, the licensing authority will need to be satisfied that
all the ground arrangements are satisfactory.         The licensing
authority should have discretion to attach conditions to the
grant of a licence and, once issued, the power to suspend, vary,
or revoke a licence if it appears that a c l u b 's failure to carry
out its responsibilities under the scheme is of sufficient
significance to put the ef fectiveness of the scheme at risk,
either at the club itself or nationally.

18. The suspension of a licence may be necessary in the event of
persistent or serious default. Thus, a persistent failure to deal
with offenders promptly or to maintain the scheme's machinery
would be grounds for suspension; so, too, would a serious case of
under staffing at a match.  The licensing authority would need to
warn a club before suspending a ground licence and give it time
to put right the fault or to make representations as to why the
licence should not be suspended. The licensing authority would
also need a power to suspend the licence without notice in an
emergency, subject to a right for the club to apply for the
suspension to be lifted as soon as possible thereafter.




                                 24
19. The licensing authority might use its power to vary licences
either for individual grounds or for all, for example to add
requirements about segregation. It might also be necessary to
vary a licence in the case of a ground used by two clubs.   If a
licence is initially granted in respect of both clubs and one of
them fails to manage its membership arrangements properly, the
licensing authority might vary the licence so as to suspend the
use of the ground by the offending club, but to allow the other
to continue.

20. The power to revoke a licence completely, rather than suspend
it until a club's failings are put right, may be needed if a
ground is closed or a club goes into liquidation.    A club which
is relegated from the League may wish to have its licence
revoked.  Following revocation, a licence would only be restored
to a ground if the licensing authority was satisfied that the
requirements of the scheme were to be met.

21. The effect of suspending a club's licence would be to deny it
the right to admit spectators to its matches and it would,
therefore, be a financial penalty. Suspension of a licence would
not, however, prevent clubs from playing home matches,       (and
fulfilling their obligations to the League etc), though they
would have to do so behind closed doors. The football authorities
felt that major sanctions of this sort must be for the Secretary
of State.


Financial penalties

22. The working party envisages that the FMA should draw up a
structure of financial penalties which it would impose upon clubs
for minor breaches of the scheme.       Thus, a club which was
regularly a day or two late in supplying information to the FMA
or was negligent in the content of the information it supplied
would not commit an offence serious enough to warrant the
suspension of its ground licence but would be liable to a fine
imposed by the responsible body.     The structure of penalties
would be approved by the Secretary of State as part of the
scheme.


Criminal offence

23. The working party recommends that it should be a criminal
offence for a club to flout     the provisions of the scheme by
admitting spectators to a designated match on a non-licensed
ground. There would have to be appropriate penalties for such an
offence. Under parallel provisions of the Safety at Sports
Grounds Act 1975, for example,  club officials who    are held to be
liable can be fined and/or        sentenced to up to  two years
imprisonment.




                               25
                                                                    c
Misbehaviour by a club's supporters

24. The working party does not believe that the question of
withdrawing a ground licence should automatically arise as a
direct result of the behaviour of a club's supporters, at either
home or away matches.     The club's responsibilities    are for
maintaining membership records, dealing with offenders, making
adequate match arrangements and employing adequate staff. If
those responsibilities are all fulfilled satisfactorily,      and
supporters misbehave, it is not appropriate to penalise the club
but rather to identify and punish the supporters concerned.   The
Government representatives and the police believe that the effect
of the national membership scheme will be to make identification
easier and punishment more effective.

25. The working party has also considered whether it might be
appropriate for the FMA (or the Secretary of State) to have the
power to suspend the membership of all or some of the members of
the scheme who were one club's supporters, for example if there
were serious disorder amongst those supporters. A sanction of
this kind would, however, be indiscriminate in its effects, and
would  inevitably penalise far more innocent than guilty people.
The working party does not therefore consider that such a
sanction is appropriate.


Exemptions for clubs

26. The working party does not propose a specific power for the
FMA or the Secretary of State to exempt any club from the
requirements of the scheme. If the scheme is to achieve and
maintain credibility, it must apply equally to all.   All clubs
will have to satisfy the licensing authority that they are
capable of operating the scheme satisfactorily before they are
granted a licence.     If they are not ready by the date of
implementation, they will not be able to admit spectators after
that date.
27.  The scheme    should, however,   allow  for  break-downs  of
machinery and other short-term emergencies beyond the club's
control.  In such cases, it should be open to the local police in
consultation with the club to decide that, in the interests of
public safety,   a match should go ahead without the normal
arrangements for checking membership cards at the point of entry
to the ground. It would remain an offence for a spectator to
attempt to obtain admission to the match without a valid
membership card. The clubs would report all such emergencies to
the licensing authority and any club which appeared particularly
liable to failures of machinery (and could not demonstrate that
it had provided for a reasonable level of maintenance) or other
short-term emergencies would run the risk of having its ground
licence suspended.




                                26
Data Protection Act 1984

28. The FMA and the clubs will need to register with the Data
Protection Registrar (DPR),    and comply with the eight Data
Protection Principles set out in the 1984 Act. When registering,
the FMA and clubs will be required to provide full details of the
data  that  they will   be holding,    the purpose of    it  and,
importantly, the persons to whom it will or might be disclosed.
It will also be essential for the scheme membership application
form to be drawn up so as to ensure that an applicant is clear as
to why the information being sought is required and how it will
be used or disclosed.

29. Members will have the right to see and challenge the accuracy
of any computerised information held about them. The clubs and
the FMA will also have to ensure appropriate security measures to
guard against the loss, destruction or unauthorised access to, or
disclosure of, any such information.

30. The scheme, as envisaged, does reflect the Data Protection
Principles. For example, the requirements on members to inform
clubs of chancfes in personal details, and to renew their card
regularly, will help avoid the register containing inaccurate
information or holding information for longer than is necessary.
The information required for scheme membership (Chapter 2), and
that to be transmitted in the case of a relevant criminal
conviction (Chapter 5) has also been reduced to the minimum
considered necessary for the effective operation of the scheme.

31. The principles of data protection may be unfamiliar to the
FMA  and   to many of    the clubs.   The football  authorities'
consultants will therefore need to seek the advice soon of the
Data Protection Registrar on how compliance with the protection
principles can best be achieved. The Registrar has a duty, where
appropriate, to encourage the development of codes of practice
for data users and the working party recommends that a duty be
placed on the FMA to draw up such a code.




                               27
CHAPTER 5:   NOTIFICATION OF OFFENCES

1. Chapter 2 explains the criteria which the working party
recommends for withholding or withdrawing membership of the
scheme. Conviction for a football-related offence would result in
automatic disqualification, for 5 years or 2 years depending on
the sentence imposed by the court.       In addition, Chapter 2
identifies circumstances in which the FMA should have discretion
to add to these bans       and to withdraw membership,     within
guidelines drawn up by the authority and approved by the
Secretary of State, from those whose behaviour is in other ways
unacceptable.
2. The working party agreed that it was essential to the
effective administration of the scheme that the FMA should
receive information promptly about those from whom membership
should, or may, be withdrawn.    This chapter considers how this
might be achieved, in relation to information which will be known
to the courts and the police.


Discretionary withdrawal of membership
3. In Chapter 2, the working party recommends that the FMA should
consider withdrawing membership from those who have been ejected
from the ground, usually by the police, for breach of a club s
ground regulations; and from those who have been arrested on a
club's  premises  for an alleged     criminal  offence.   In  such
circumstances the police should draw the attention of a club
official,  who will be designated for the purpose,         to the
circumstances of the ejection or the arrest, so that the club may
note the membership and other details of the member at the time,
and thereafter report those details to the FMA.   A brief standard
report may be devised for the purpose.

4. The football authorities considered that this should be a
statutory procedure, but the Government representatives and the
police considered this unnecessary and inappropriate.  The above
outline will need to be considered in more detail by the police
nationally and the football authorities.      It may be useful,
however, to make it clear within the terms of the scheme that
ejection from or arrest on club premises will render a member
liable to disqualification from the scheme.


Mandatory withdrawal of membership

5. The FMA must receive         information about convictions     for
football-related offences.       The working party considered     two
issues:


        (i) Who     should   determine   whether   an   offence
                  "football-related"?




                                  28
©
           (ii)    Who should   notify   the   fact of   conviction   to   the
                   FMA?

    6. The football authorities considered it should be incumbent
    upon the police to notify all convictions for football-related
    offences to the FMA.   (Indeed they would strongly prefer to be
    notified of convictions for all offences of violence against the
    person,  but  the  Government  representatives  and  the police
    considered this to be too wide - see Chapter 2, paragraphs 24 &
    25).

    7. There are two difficulties with the proposal to give the
    police   this  duty.  First,  police  records   are  regarded  as
    confidential, and have been disclosed only on grounds of national
    security, for the protection of the vulnerable, and to assist in
    the administration of justice. Disclosing them to assist the
    football   authorities with  a membership    scheme would   be a
    significant step, and one which could have wide implications.  It
    is, however, important to point out that, once the scheme is
    established, all that would be disclosed is the fact of a recent
    football-related conviction which might well have been reported
    in the local press anyway.

    8. The second difficulty is that it would be left to the police
    to determine what is a football-related offence as defined in the
    legislation.  Interpretation of this statutory definition is most
    unlikely to give rise to problems       in respect of offences
    committed in or near the grounds.  The working party considers it
    is most important, however, that the definition should include
    offences committed on the way to or from matches, such as those
    arising from incidents at railway stations, motorway service
    areas, or at towns and villages en route.     These incidents may
    occur some considerable distance from a ground,        and at a
    considerable time before or after a match.

    9. The decision as to whether an offence is football-related may
    therefore give rise to difficult questions of mixed fact and law
    which the interests of justice may suggest should properly be
    decided by a court. The Government representatives and the police
    recommend that the mandatory withdrawal of membership should
    apply to those who have been convicted of offences which have
    been declared by a court to be football-related within a
    statutory definition.

    10. The working party envisages that the        prosecution would be
    responsible,  in all appropriate cases,         for seeking such a
    declaration at the time of conviction.

    11. If this recommendation is accepted, it affects the question
    of who should be responsible for notifying details of the
    conviction to the FMA.  To involve the police would seem to add
    an unnecessary link in the chain, the more so as the police no
    longer attend court as a matter of routine since the institution
    of the Crown Prosecution Service.   The most efficient solution
    appears to be for the courts to notify the FMA of the facts of
    conviction.  Although this would represent a new burden for the
    courts, they would be freed from the tasks arising from the



                                    29
existing football exclusion order provisions.    The scheme would
render these redundant.  Thus, the courts would no longer have to
consider in relation to a football-related offence whether an
exclusion order should be made under section 30 of the Public
Order Act 1986; for what period (section 32); and whether to
allow an application to terminate such an order (section 33). For
the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, the implications
would not seem to be significantly different from those arising
from the existing exclusion order provisions.

12. The working party recommends that the question of whether an
offence is football-related should be determined by the courts.
We  further   recommend  that  the  Government  should  initiate
discussions with the courts, the Crown Prosecution Service and
the police in order to find the most efficient means of ensuring
that the convictions are notified to the FMA.


Withholding membership

13. The previous paragraphs relate to disqualification from
membership when the scheme is established.  It is most important,
however, to ensure that troublemakers are excluded from the
scheme from the outset.   In processing the many applications for
initial membership of the scheme, therefore, the FMA will need to
ensure that they have as much of the necessary information as
possible about previous misconduct.

14. The FMA would have fairly ready access to some of the
information.    The courts, for example, send copies of all
exclusion orders to the Football Association.       The football
authorities confirmed that they and the clubs have also collected
a considerable amount of information, for example from other
clubs or through the media, upon which they already acted against
hooligans.
15. The working party considered what steps may be taken to
supplement this information.    Police records do not distinguish
football-related offences, and it would not be possible to
identify all of them.      There are also issues of principle
involved (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above).      It may be possible,
however, to invite the Association of Chief Police Officers to
ask forces to keep records of convictions, for example for
offences occurring on club premises, and to notify these to the
FMA before    the  initial   applications  are processed.     The
information would cover the name, date of birth, address, offence
and sentence.   Similarly, the police could be asked to draw the
attention of clubs to persons whom they were ejecting from, or
arresting at, a ground, so that these details too would be
available to the FMA from the clubs at the outset of the scheme.

16. The working party recommends that the Government should
determine with the police and the football authorities suitable
arrangements for ensuring that troublemakers are not admitted to
the scheme.  An early announcement by the Government should make




                                30
It clear that previous convictions for football-related offences
may be taken into account in deciding who shall be disqualified
from membership*                     ...
CHAPTER 6: TECHNOLOGY AND TIMING

1. The Government representatives on the working party are
satisfied that available information technology is fully capable
of providing for the implementation of the national membership
scheme. The working party was advised that the principles of
applying technology to read membership cards electronically are
well understood and relatively simple. The football authorities
were however not completely satisfied that the technology was
available for a workable scheme. They are not committed to
accepting paragraphs 3-17 below, and will wish to be guided by
their recently appointed consultants.

2. Both the Department of the Environment and the Football League
have received large numbers of unsolicited letters offering
technological and commercial solutions for the scheme.        The
working party did not see it as its task to make a choice from
these offers but, in order to consider the different ways in
which the scheme might be approached, we invited four companies
with different market specialities to make a formal presentation
on the scheme: a card manufacturer; a security access control
company; a computer systems company; and a Smartcard systems
supplier. This chapter draws out a number of common features of
the technology available and discusses a number of technical
options   as    drawn   up   by   the    Central   Computer   and
Telecommunications Agency.


Central register

3. Details of all members of the national membership scheme will
be held on a central register.       The register will be the
responsibility of the Football Membership Authority though it may
employ someone else to run it. The register will be used for two
main functions:


   1.   to maintain a full listing of all members of the scheme;
        to receive applications for membership and to apply
        computerised security checks on them, to protect against
        accepting  known   hooligans;   multiple  applications  to
        different clubs; repeated use of one address; and other
        possible abuses (there are sophisticated search techniques
        available but their cost is unlikely to be justified by
        the benefits they might bring);

   2.   to build up and maintain a "national referral file" on all
        known   hooligans,  lost   and  stolen   cards,  cancelled
        membership and other invalid cards, a regularly up-dated
        copy of which would be fed into each club's own computer.




                                32
Computer requirements

4. Every club will need a computer of Its own to hold the list of
members who are its supporters and to receive the national
referral file but it would only need to be a micro computer. To
save repeat programming costs this microcomputer should be a
standard type across clubs. Many clubs will already have such a
computer for accounting, management and membership purposes.

5.   There      would  be   no   need   for   expensive  permanent
telecommunications links between each club and the FMA or an
agency running the central register, on its behalf (called, in
this chapter, "the central bureau"). The exchange of information
between the central bureau and each club could be managed through
small computer disks sent by registered or secure post. These
disks would only need to be sent once or twice a week (subject to
the F M A 's views). In the unlikely event that the latest version
of the referral file failed to arrive in time for a given match
then the previous version already held in the club’s computer
could be used. Alternatively each club could, at marginal extra
expense, have standby dial-up facilities to the central bureau or
could, at more expense, subscribe to a telecommunication service.
This would make it possible to exchange information much more
rapidly, to cater for matches held throughout the week.

6. The processing requirement of the central bureau is expected
to be modest but will require an appropriate computer to support
the potential size of database. The cost of such a computer would
be difficult to justify for only occasional use and the obvious
solution   is  to employ    a commercial   bureau  or   the  card
manufacturer. The bureau must have adequate security to safeguard
the referral file from tampering or disclosure.


Machinery at turnstiles

7. A member seeking admission to a match would hand his card,
with money or ticket, to the turnstile operator (this avoids the
risk of vandalism if spectators were permitted to insert the
cards in the readers themselves). Each turnstile house would be
equipped with a card reader and the card would be read to check
that it was valid (see chapter 2). There is a consensus among
potential suppliers that very little time would be needed for the
card to be read - one of the companies which gave a presentation
to the working party speculated that this might perhaps be as
little as h second for each c a r d .in addition to the time now
taken to enter the ground. Nor would there need to be any better
lighting in turnstiles (a point of concern raised by the clubs)
than is already needed to receive money.

8. Cards will be checked against the referral file (of invalid
cards) held in the local computer (the card reader would of
course distinguish between invalid cards and damaged cards which
it could not read). This means that either each card reader must
be cabled to the local computer; or, if intelligent card readers
with sufficient memory were used, a copy of the referral file
could be loaded from the local computer into each card reader



                               33
                                                                    c
 before each match, making turnstiles self sufficient. Options
 which enable card readers to be portable are attractive because
 they do not require permanent cabling to the local computer.
 Cabling is expensive and time consuming. The cable would also be
 vulnerable,  particularly when the ground is unoccupied,      to
 deliberate vandalism. Burying the cable or use of specially
 secure conduit would increase cost and installation time.

 9. Another advantage of portable self sufficient card readers is
 that they could be taken to non-league grounds. Card readers with
 their own intelligence and memory - hence portable - are in every
 day use but no company has claimed to have one currently in
 production which is sufficiently powerful to meet football's
 needs. A number of companies feel confident they could develop a
 sufficiently powerful, battery driven reader quickly (not all
 turnstile houses have mains electricity).

10. One disadvantage of not connecting card readers physically to
the local computer is that during match entry no record can be
built up and made available to all turnstiles on which cards have
been used that day. Cards might then be "passed back" for reuse
unless the cards themselves can be marked physically or can
receive information electronically. This is a major consideration
for the technology of the scheme, given the need to avoid a
card-holder passing his card back to someone who might have been
banned. Only Smartcards and "water mark magnetic stripe" cards
can be updated electronically by the card reader while being
checked and so avoid the problems of "passing back" without
requiring cabling.


Programming

11. The programming of the local computer to hold lists of
members who are a club's supporters and the national referral
file, is well within the scope of basic programming techniques
and should not cause any problems. Programming the on-line
interrogation of the referral file during match entry may require
some special programming to handle the accumulative load at the
larger grounds. This will require investigation but should not be
a major problem.


Membership cards

12. The working party is not recommending any particular type of
membership card. Each type has its advantages and detailed
discussions with suppliers have not yet been held. Without firm
commercial bids the costs and timescales are speculative (and the
costs of cards quoted below also depend on their production in
large quantities). However the following comparisons may be made.

13. Barcodes, consisting of black stripes, are relatively easy to
forge. Someone determined to beat the system would only need to
alter the visible black stripes on his card for it to look the
same as any valid card. Barcode readers are more expensive than
magnetic stripe readers and reputedly less reliable in exposed



                               34
weather conditions. Barcode cards however do have thei^yantage
of being robust and can be read even if the card is badly bent.
Only a few suppliers have suggested barcode cards. These cards
with name, photograph, club and other information (such as
advertising) would cost about 50p each.

14. Most suppliers have suggested magnetic stripe cards. The
encoded information is written electronically on a strip of
magnetic material. A disadvantage of these cards is that they are
not secure; the recorded information can be lost accidentally or
destroyed with a magnet. On the other hand, the technology is a
familiar one, in use on credit cards, and magnetic stripe cards
are the only cards which have an ISO standard. This might be
important if the scheme was to be used in Europe or exported to a
wider market at a later date. The cost with photograph etc is
about £1 each.

15. Smartcards contain a single chip computer which (in most
cases) is accessed through gold pins on the surface of the card.
The chip is mounted either top left or centre left of the card.
There is no ISO standard. Provided the same physical position is
used throughout the national membership scheme, however, the chip
position is not important. Smartcards are very secure. The memory
is erased if the card is tampered with. Smartcards use dip rather
than swipe readers. Dip readers are operationally reliable since
they are not dependent on the correct speed of swipe but the
cards do need careful placing in the reader to line up the gold
pins. Smartcards may take very slightly longer to use at the
turnstiles. An alternative Smartcard is available which does not
require contact pins.

16. The major advantage of Smartcards is that they can receive
and store information about the matches which the holder has
attended. This prevents multiple use of the same card and
overcomes the major problem of using portable intelligent card
readers. Smartcards can also hold more information about the
holder, which may have wider commercial advantages, and they
could be extended to cover other sports and activities. The
disadvantages are: the use of Smartcards in the UK is still in
its infancy (but growing); no card reader yet in production is
powerful enough for a fully secure portable system (though the
manufacturers say that one could be produced quickly); there is
no experience in using Smartcards in a hostile environment; and
the time through the turnstiles will have to be checked
carefully. The price with photograph is about £5.

17. A type of magnetic stripe, called water mark magnetic stripe,
is becoming more widely accepted. This card is physically the
same as a normal magnetic stripe card except that the stripe has
an area where the magnetically held information is permanently
bonded and cannot be erased. The stripe can also receive other
information while the card is in the card reader. The cost is not
known but is expected to be about half the cost of a Smartcard
whilst having most of the advantages.




                               35
Marketing opportunities

18. The Government representatives believe that the introduction
of   the  national   membership  scheme  offers   a  number   of
opportunities including:-


   a) improving club procedures

       provision of automatic entrance      statistics   by   chosen
       criteria eg by age, home address

       reduction of fraud at the turnstiles (and, in the case of
       Smartcards allow clubs to check that season tickets are
       used only by the member to whom they were issued);

       availability of local computer for accounting,     payroll,
       word processing, management support;

   b ) commercial exploitation

       availability (subject to the rules of the Data Protection
       Act 1984) of mailing lists for sale to pools companies,
       mail order houses, sports shops etc

       advertising on the membership card

       arranging discount schemes with local traders or other
       schemes to enhance the attractions of going to a football
       match

       opportunities for local lotteries and other direct mailing
       schemes.


The football authorities do not share this belief and see little
commercial advantage or improvement to clubs' administration
stemming from the scheme.

19. The basic concepts and technology for a national membership
scheme are available. Different technical options, have different
timing and financial implications. The FMA will have to choose
between options, taking account of the timetable considerations
discussed in this chapter. Opinions were divided on the marketing
potential of the scheme. The working party accepted that this
could only be established once the views of the consultants and
the football authorities' commercial advisers had been received.
It should be noted that, in relation to the Data Protection Act,
members should be given the opportunity to opt out of commercial
uses of their information. Further guidance on this issue will be
included in the proposed code of practice (Chapter 4 paragraph
31).




                                  36
Timing of the scheme's introduction

20. The implementation of the national membership scheme will be
affected by the technical options discussed in the previous
chapter. The tighter the timetable which the Government imposes,
the more    immediate will be the demands on the football
authorities to commit financial and manpower resources to the
preparation of the scheme if they wish to avoid the closure of
football grounds to the public. The working party accepted that a
detailed timetable for implementation cannot be imposed in
advance of the consultants report and decisions on the detail of
the scheme.    The project management arrangements which the
football authorities choose to employ will have their own
implications   for  timing*   Three alternative   approaches  are
discussed as indicated below:


   i . "Do it Yourself"

  The FMA could, with some consultancy help, buy in the hardware
  and software itself and integrate and manage the whole
  project,   subcontracting out cabling and other works as
  necessary.


   ii. Contract out the technical work

  The FMA to retain financial control but to contract out all of
  the systems work to a prime contractor. This prime contractor,
  probably from a "systems house" would act on behalf of a
  consortium which covered collectively all necessary skills and
  products.


   iiii Handover to a service management company

  The FMA to make a contract with a service management company.
  The FMA would only need to specify its requirements eg the
  start date of the entire scheme; the degree of security
  required; the criteria for issuing membership cards, maximum
  delay at turnstiles etc. It would then be the contractual
  responsibility of the service management Company to meet these
  requirements.


21. The working party considers that implementation by August
1989 for all 92 League clubs would be very difficult to achieve
but the Government's view was that it was just possible given the
right commitment. The working party does not consider that a
phased implementation of the scheme, say a Division at a time, is
worth pursuing, because of the danger of displacing hooligans
from clubs in the scheme to those outside during the phasing
process. Whatever target for full implementation is set, it would
be in the interests of all parties for the consultants report to
be received, and the football authorities and the clubs to begin




                                37
their preparations for the scheme, as soon as possible.   The
working party considered the possibility of introducing   the
scheme in mid season.




                            38
ANNEX; FOOTBALL-RELATED OFFENCES UNDER THE PUBLIC ORDER ACT 1986


i.     Any offence committed during the relevant period of a
       prescribed football match (ie from 2 hours before the
       start of the match until 1 hour after the end of it) while
       the accused was at, or entering or leaving, or trying to
       enter or leave the football ground.
ii.    An offence involving the use or threat of violence towards
       another person, and committed while one or each of them
       was on a Journey to or from any association football
       match.

                                     THE FOOTBALL NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME

                                           WORKING PARTY REPORT PUBLISHED



                         A working party report,            setting out the main principles of a

                   national    membership      scheme       to   control   admission     to    football

                   matches in England and Wales, was published today.



                         The working       party was    chaired       by Colin   Moynihan,     Minister

                   for   Sport,      and    included        representatives      of    the     Football

                   Association and the Football League.



                         The recommendations agreed by the working party for the main

                   elements of the scheme are as follows:



                   GENERAL

                   Admission   of    spectators        to    a   designated   football     match     will

                   only be permitted if:

                               the    spectator   produces        a   valid   membership      card    for

                               checking at the point of entry to the ground;                  and




                  2 MARSHAM STREET • LONDON SW1P 3EB • TELEPHONE 01-276 3000


                                                                                                            J
                the   ground     on    which     the    match      is    to   be   played       is

                licensed.



The   scheme      willbe    a national         one           administered by       a   Football

Membership Authority; information about all members will be held

on a central computer.



A member will be entitled to only one card which will                                  indicate

the club which he, or she, supports and qualify him,                          or her,      to

attend any designated match.



The   scheme      will     apply      in England       and    Wales     but   consideration

should     be     given     to     its extension             to   Scotland and         Northern

Ireland.

          areas with special access;

          non-spectators should not be subject to the

          scheme.

          conviction for football-related offences, involving

          bans of two or five years;   '

          Membership Authority who will decide whether to

          impose bans and for how long.

                              -3-
Two new criminal offences should be created:

            for false application for membership;

            for gaining or attempting to gain entry to ground

            without a valid membership card.



DESIGNATED FOOTBALL MATCHES



The   scheme    should    apply    to   all     matches   between   League    clubs'

teams.



Matches   between     League      clubs    and      non-League   clubs   should   be

Admission      for   members     only     to    matches   between   English/Welsh

and Scottish/Northern Irish teams.



RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SCHEME:

The Football Membership Authority and the Clubs



The FMA will be designated by the Secretary of State;                        it will

draw up a scheme in accordance with criteria imposed by

                                        -4-
legislation;   the   scheme   will   be   subject   to   approval   by   the

Secretary of State.



FMA's responsibilities to include:

          supervise application process

          approve/reject applications

          maintain central register of all members

          draw up rules on withdrawal of membership

          make decisions and possibly hear appeals on withdrawal

          licensing grounds (if this responsibility is delegated

          by the Secretary of State).



Clubs' responsibilities to include:



          dealing with applications, maintaining records, supply

          of information to central register

          installation and maintenance of approved machinery for

          checking membership cards

          adequate arrangements to control admission of

          spectators and to deal with holders of rejected cards

          provision of sufficient trained staff to operate all

          aspects of scheme

          other requirements to ensure effective operation of the

          scheme.

                                      -5-
The   scheme        should       be     monitored             by    a     small        part-time

inspectorate employed by and responsible to the FMA or another

agency (or the Secretary of State).



Sanctions      on        clubs        which         fail       to       carry      out        their

responsibilities should include:



      -     withdrawal of the licence to admit                           spectators         to the

            ground        for    persistent         or     serious       failure       or   in    an

            emergency following a serious disturbance;



            fines for minor breaches;



            criminal liability for admitting spectators to a

            designated match at a non-licensed ground.



The   FMA   and     the    clubs      will        need   to    register         with    the      Data

Protection Registrar.



NOTIFICATION OF OFFENCES



In operating discretionary criteria to disqualify from membership

those whose behaviour is unacceptable, clubs will need to receive

information       from    the police about               those who       are     being      ejected

from the ground,          and about those who are being arrested                            for an

alleged criminal offence committed on the club's premises.

                                         -   6-
For   the mandatory     criteria     imposed by     the    legislation    to work

properly, the FMA must receive information about convictions for

football related offences.          The working party recommends:



      -     the question of whether an offence is football related

            should be determined by the courts;



            the   Government    should      initiate      discussions    with   the

            courts, the Crown Prosecution Service and the police to

            determine     the      most    efficient      means    of    notifying

            convictions to the FMA.



The Government should determine with the police and the football

authorities suitable arrangements for ensuring that troublemakers

are   not   admitted    to   the    scheme    at    the    outset.       An   early

Government announcement should make it clear that past behaviour

will be taken into account in deciding who shall be disqualified

from membership.



TECHNOLOGY AND TIMING



The   Government    representatives        and     the    police   are   satisfied

that the technology is available to implement the scheme.                       The

main elements should be:

                                     -7-
                 a computerised central register

                 a computer at each club

                 card readers at turnstiles, to be portable if possible.



Membership         cards    are     to    be    readable      electronically.         The

options,         on which the working party has not drawn conclusions,

are:



                 barcode cards

                 magnetic stripe cards

                 smartcards.



The     new      technology       may    also       provide   opportunities   for     the

clubs       to    improve   their       own   administrative     procedures     and   for

marketing.

                    membership scheme for football supporters in England and Wales                                           -

                   belief         that   the   scheme      can    and will             - break         the    link   between

                   hooliganism and football.

July between the Prime Minister and the President of the Football

League      and     the Chairman          of    the    Football          Association,                to   review

the main principles of a national membership scheme for football.



       "The         working       party         included               representatives                of      the

Government,         the     police       and    the    football              authorities.             All     the

members of the working party have co-operated                                     in preparing this

report and it has been agreed between them.                                      I pay full tribute

to the co-operative approach which                               the    football          representatives

on    the    working        party        have    adopted           throughout             many       hours     of

discussions.



       "The report addresses the specific issue of when the scheme

should be implemented.                   It refers to the work that has to be done

on the technology of the scheme and its installation at 92 League

clubs.      Our target will be to achieve implementation                                         throughout

the   Football           League     by    Spring       1990       -     subject       to    Parliament's

approval       of    our    legislative          proposals             and     the    installation             of

appropriate technology.



       "There were           6,147       arrests       at    Football          League       matches          last

season      and     violent       incidents        have          continued       this       season,         both

inside and outside grounds.                      This cannot be allowed to continue.

The   national           membership       scheme       offers          the    prospect          of    breaking

the    link,        of     ending        the    role        of    football           as     a    focus        for

hooliganism and violence.

receives a non-custodial sentence. The order requires the person subject
to it to report to a designated reporting agency within 30 days o f the
making o f the order and thereafter as directed by the agency. Failure to
report is an offence.
  Clause 14 provides that a person may apply to the court to term inate a
restriction order made against him which has been in force for at least one
year.
   Clause 15 directs the court after making an order imposing or
term inating a restriction order to send copies of it to the person to whom
it relates and to the bodies which may be concerned with it.

   Clause 16 sets o u t the functions o f reporting agencies. These include
registering an offender and giving him notice o f the requirement to report
at a specified time and place. It is an offence to fail to comply with the duty
to report and to fail to comply with other conditions imposed by the
agency.
   Clause 17 provides for a person to apply to the reporting agency for
exemption from a requirement to report in respect o f a particular match.
It is an offence to make a false statem ent in connection with an
application. There is an appeal to the magistrates’ court from the refusal
o f the agency to grant such an application.

   Clause 18 provides for the Secretary o f State to issue guidance to
designated reporting agencies and to make regulations governing the
giving o f notices imposing a requirem ent to report. Notice given in
accordance with the regulations is presumed to have come to the attention
o f the person required to report.

  Clause 19 and the Schedule provide for the m agistrates’ courts to
impose a restriction order in respect o f offences committed outside
England and Wales which are specified by Order in Council as
corresponding to football-related offences under the Schedule.

 which provide for offences by bodies corporate, the service o f documents
 and the commencement and extent provisions o f the Bill.


 Financial effects o f the Bill

    The measures introduced by the Bill are expected to give rise to public
 expenditure o f about £2.5 million per year taking into account police,
 Crown Prosecution Service, court and legal aid costs and the cost of
 operating the designated reporting agencies. T hat does not take account
 o f income from fines. The cost o f the Football M embership A uthority
 and the installation o f equipment at grounds and the issue o f membership
 cards, which may be required under the scheme, is a m atter for the
 football authorities.

Effect o f the Bill on public service manpower
   The Bill may require a m inor staffing increase in the D epartm ent o f the
Environment if the Secretary o f State assumes the licensing functions
under clause 10. The Bill should not result in any increase in manpower
o f other departments.

                      FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL PUBLISHED


         Proposals to introduce a                   national membership scheme for
 football      supporters       in   England          and    Wales,    and     to    prevent
 convicted     football    hooligans     from attending matches                abroad    are
 set out in a Government Bill published today.


         The Government hopes to have the scheme in place in Spring
 1990.


         The Football Spectators Bill would:


               control    the    admission          of      spectators    to    designated
               football   matches     in England            and Wales     by means      of    a
               national membership scheme;


               provide for the licensing of football grounds to admit
               members of the scheme;


               stop   convicted      football         hooligans    from    travelling        to
               matches abroad and so help prevent the violence which
               has tarnished our national reputation in recent years.


         The    Bill     provides     for       the      appointment      of   a    Football
 Membership Authority (FMA) to prepare and subsequently administer
 the membership scheme.

2 MARSHAM STREET - LONDON SW1P 3EB • TELEPHONE 01-276 3000
           The proposal is that only members of the scheme (or others
authorised         by    the    scheme)        would       be    allowed          to    attend     matches
designated         by     the        Secretary        of    State.            Convicted           football
hooligans could be disqualified for standard periods of two and
five years.


           Grounds on which designated matches are to be played would
need   a     licence       granted        by   the        Secretary          of    State    (or     by    an
authority      appointed             by   him).            An    essential             requirement       for
obtaining      a        licence       would     be        participation            in    the      national
membership scheme.              Without such a licence, clubs would be unable
to   admit    spectators             to designated matches.                   These       matches      will
include      all    League        matches       and        any       other    matches          which     the
Secretary of State chooses to designate.                               The licensing authority
would also have the power to revoke or suspend                                          licences where
clubs are judged                to    have     failed           to   comply        with     the    stated
conditions.


           To prevent violence or disorder at key                                  football matches
abroad,     the Bill proposes that courts should be given the power
to impose      'restriction orders'                   on convicted football hooligans.
This would require those individuals to report to named agencies
on the day of designated overseas football matches.


           The Bill contains 22 clauses and one schedule.


           A guide        to the Bill is attached to this News Release.



NOTES TO EDITORS

The Government hopes that the football authorities will take on
the role of the Football Membership Authority and the Minister
for Sport, Colin Moynihan has today written to the President of
the Football League and the Chairman of the Football Association
to invite them to confirm that they wish to do so.
                                2                 -   -

               GUIDE TO THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL



THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTE


This guide provides a layman's summary of the main provisions of
this Bill.   It is not intended to be an exhaustive or definitive
interpretaion of the clauses.


The Bill is arranged in 3 parts.


PART I (clauses 1-10) provides for a national membership scheme
for   spectators    at    designated    football    matches    in    England    and
Wales and for the licensing of grounds on which these matches may
be played.    It provides for the Secretary of State to appoint a
body to draw up the national membership scheme and for the scheme
to be approved by him.
The effect of Part I would be that:


                   only members of the national membership scheme (or
                   others authorised in the scheme) would be admitted
                   to those matches in England and Wales designated
                   by the Secretary of State.


                   spectators could be admitted to designated matches
                   only on    grounds       licensed    by   the    Secretary   of
                   State


                   any member of the public attending or attempting
                   to    attend   a    designated      match   other    than    as
                   provided for by the scheme would be committing an
                   offence




                                        1
                   it would be an offence to admit spectators to a
                   designated match on an unlicensed ground


                   anyone convicted of a relevant             offence would      be
                   disqualified from membership of the scheme for a
                   standard period of two or five years


PART II (clauses 11-19) provides for the imposition of restric­
tions on convicted football hooligans travelling abroad,                   to help
prevent violence or disorder at football matches played outside
England and Wales.       It provides for courts to be given the power
to impose restriction orders on individuals lasting                  for two or
five years.      Reporting conditions will apply when key matches are
being played abroad.          Individuals will be required to report as
directed to a designated reporting agency.                  This Part also sets
out    the   functions   of   reporting    agencies   and     provides    for   the
Secretary of State to issue guidance to agencies.


PART   III   (clauses 20-22)     contains general       provisions       providing
for offences by bodies corporate, and the commencement and extent
of the Bill.


HOW THE      GOVERNMENT'S     POLICY   OBJECTIVES     ARE    DELIVERED     BY   THE
CLAUSES


Spectators in England and Wales


Clause 1 is the interpretation clause for Part I.                  It provides
for the Secretary of State to designate football matches to which
the national membership and licensing schemes will apply.




                                       2
*
    Clause 2 makes it an offence for any spectator to attempt to gain
    entry to,          or to remain in,                 a ground         for a designated             football
    match,       except         as    a    member       of       the    scheme.        It     sets    out    the
    penalties to which an offender may be liable on conviction,                                              and
    provides for arrest without a warrant.


    Clause 3 provides for the Secretary of State to appoint a body to
    run the national membership scheme and for a change of appoint­
    ment to be made if necessary.                            The Bill refers to the body to be
    appointed as the "administrator",                             it is referred to generally as
    the Football Membership Authority.


    Clause       4    provides            for    the    administrator            to    draw    up     a   draft
    scheme,      and       to    submit         it     to    the       Secretary      of    State     for    his
    approval.          The administrator should also agree with the Secretary
    of State when the scheme is to take effect.                                      The scheme,      and any
    later modification, is to be laid before Parliament.


    Clause 5 provides for the framework of the national membership
    scheme.           It   lists       certain         requirements            which    the    scheme       must
    fulfill and other matters which it may cover.                                          It also ensures
    that    information              supplied          by   members       or    potential       members       is
    subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act.


    Clause 6 provides for the circumstances in which people may be
    refused membership of the scheme and in which membership may be
    withdrawn         from them.                It provides            for the       disqualification         of
    convicted football hooligans for standard periods of five years
    where    a       sentence         of   imprisonment            is    imposed,      or     two    years    in
    other    cases.             The    clause        also        provides      for    longer    periods       of
    disqualification to be determined under the scheme itself by the
    Football Membership Authority.




                                                             3
Clause 7 makes it an offence for a club, or anyone else, to admit
spectators to any premises during a designated              football match,
unless those premises are licensed for the purpose.


Clause 8 makes general provisions for the granting of licences to
admit spectators to designated football matches.            It covers:


                 charging for licences


                 the scope of licences


                 a right of inspection of the licensed premises


                 procedures   which       the   licensing   authority    must
                 follow if it wishes to vary a licence


                 the conditions which the authority may attach to a
                 licence.


It makes it an offence for a club to contravene the conditions of
a licence.


Clause 9 provides    for the circumstances in which           the licensing
authority may suspend or revoke a licence to admit spectators.


Clause 10 provides   forthe Secretary of State to be the          licensing
authority and for    him to appoint another body as           the authority
and for the procedures by which such an appointment may be made
or terminated.




                                      4
FOOTBALL MATCHES OUTSIDE ENGLAND AND WALES


Clause     11    is    the interpretation          clause       for    this      Part.         It
provides for the Secretary of State to designate football matches
played    outside       England    and     Wales       and    to     designate      reporting
agencies.


Clause     12    and   the Schedule       provide       for    the    courts     to    make         a
restriction order in respect of a person convicted of a football-
related    offence      where     this    would    help       to    prevent      violence      or
disorder    at    or    in connection with             designated      football        matches
played outside England and Wales.


Clause      13 provides that        a    restriction order             has effect        for    a
period of two or five years and requires the person subject to
the order to report to a designated reporting agency within 30
days of his conviction and thereafter as directed by the agency.
Failure to report would be an offence.


Clause      14 provides that         a    person       may    apply    to the      court       to
terminate a restriction order made against him which has been in
force for at least one year.


Clause    15 directs the court after making an order                             imposing or
terminating       a    restriction       order    to    send       copies   of    it   to      the
person      to whom      it relates       and     to    the    bodies       which      may      be
concerned with it.


Clause     16 sets out the functions of reporting                      agencies.          These
include    registering an         offender       and    giving       him    notice       of the
requirement to report at a specified time and place.                             It would be
an offence to fail to comply with the duty to report and to fail
to comply with other conditions imposed by the agency.




                                             5
Clause 17 provides for a person to apply to the reporting agency
for   exemption       from    a    requirement         to       report       in     respect   of    a
particular       match.       It    would   be       an     offence          to   make    a   false
statement in connection with an application.                                 Provision is made
for an appeal to the magistrates'court from the refusal of the
agency to grant such an application.


Clause 18 provides for the Secretary of State to issue guidance
to    designated         reporting    agencies            and        to      make     regulations
governing the giving of notices imposing a requirement to report.
Notice given in accordance with the regulations is presumed to
have come to the attention of the person required to report.


Clause 19 and the Schedule provide for the magistrates' courts to
impose    a    restriction        order    in       respect         of    offences       committed
outside England and Wales which are specified by Order in Council
as corresponding to football-related offences under the Schedule.


                                          GENERAL


Clause    20   is    a    standard    provision           to        ensure    that     directors,
members    and      responsible      employees         of       a    body     which      knowingly
commits   an     offence     under    the       Bill      may       be    held    personally       to
account for such an offence.


Clause 21 is a standard provision concerned with the service of
documents required or authorised by the Bill.


Clause 22 provides for the citation of the Act, the commencement
of its provisions,           for the repeal of certain provisions of the
Public Order Act 1986 and for the limitation of its extent to
England and Wales.




                                                6
The   Schedule       lists   those    offences       which   are   relevant   for   the
purposes   of    Clauses       6     and   12   ie    for    disqualification       from
membership      of     the   national       membership       scheme   and     for   the
imposition of a restriction order.

                              BREAKING THE LINK BETWEEN VIOLENCE AND FOOTBALL
                            Nicholas Ridley Outlines The Government's Proposals



                            The    Football       Spectators         Bill           will   provide       the    means        to
                    break   the    link    between      violence             and     football.          For    the        first
                    time,   there will be an effective and comprehensive procedure to
                    keep hooligans away from football matches,                             Environment Secretary
                    Nicholas Ridley said today.


                            Speaking        in     London       at           the     launch       of     the     Football
                    Spectators Bill, Mr Ridley said:


                            "Everyone       will       recall    the           immediate        background           to    the
                    Government's      decision          to    legislate              on    this        subject       -     the
                    incidents       in May       last   year     and          the    appalling         scenes    in       West
                    Germany during         the European Championships                      in   June.          The nation
                    demanded      action    and    the       Government             agreed.            When    the       Prime
                    Minister met the football authorities on 6 July, she invited them
                    to   establish    a     national         membership             scheme      themselves.               They
                    refused and she told them that the Government would bring forward
                    legislation to establish the scheme.


                            "The Bill also deals directly with the problem of English
                    football hooligans abroad.                It gives the courts powers to impose
                    restriction      orders       on     convicted             hooligans          to     prevent          them
                    travelling to English matches abroad.
                                                                 -   1   -




                  2 MARSHAM STREET • LONDON SW1P 3EB • TELEPHONE 01-276 3000
         "This Bill has nothing to do with the idea of a national
identity card.        Our intention is that if people wish to go to a
football match,       they will have to obtain a membership                                  card    for
the purpose.        If they behave like hooligans, they will lose their
membership.         The   concept        is    entirely        different         from    that      of    a
national identity card that someone could carry all the time.


         "We welcome the measures which                          the clubs       and    the    police
have taken to deal with hooligans inside football grounds.                                           But
their effect has been to keep the lid on the problem, not to cure
it.     At    too    many    matches,          violence            remains      just     belovj      the
surface.      Rival       supporters          have       to   be    kept    apart      by    physical
barriers and by the employment of large numbers of police.


         "Outside football grounds,                      the behaviour          of rival       groups
of    supporters      makes        life       intolerable            both       for     law-abiding
football     supporters      and    for those who                  live    or   trade       nearby      or
wish to travel by train on the same day as a football match.


         "For the police,           this means that every weekend                           thousands
and   thousands      of     them    are       employed         to     deal      with     travelling
football     supporters      and the matches                  themselves.         The       ratepayer
and the taxpayer have to foot most of the bill.


         "Football        seems     to    be        a    focus      for    hooligans         and     for
violent behaviour in a way unheard of in most other sports - and
most other forms of activity.                   There have been isolated outbreaks
of trouble at a few other sporting events in recent years.                                           But
not on remotely the same scale or frequency as football and the
Bill which is published today deals only with football.

          "The Bill establishes a statutory framework for a national
membership scheme for football spectators.                                  It does not prescribe
the contents          of     the scheme.             It provides           for me to              appoint     an
authority        to    draw        up    a    scheme       and     to      submit          it     to    me   for
approval.


          "We hope,          and expect,           that the football                  authorities will
establish the Football Membership Authority.                                     Colin Moynihan has
written    today        to    the       President        of    the    Football            League       and   the
Chairman of the Football Association to invite                                            them    to confirm
that   they      will       take    on       the    responsibility and                    to     ask them     to
produce an outline programme for the scheme.                                         The Government is
asking Parliament to impose the requirement for a scheme.                                               But we
want the scheme to be devised and run by football.


          "The Bill proposes that everyone who attends a designated
football    match           in England        and Wales          should         be    a member          of   the
national      membership            scheme,         or        otherwise         authorised             by    the
scheme,    and        that    designated matches                should      be            played only         on
licensed football grounds.                        Those who are convicted of a relevant
offence will          be disqualified               from membership              of        the    scheme     and
the    scheme         itself        will      allow        for       the     Football             Membership
Authority to ban others who misbehave at football matches.


          "For        the    first       time,       there       will      be        an    effective         and
comprehensive           procedure            to    keep       hooligans away               from        football
matches.      Of course there will be attempts to abuse                                           the system
but if     the    scheme       is effective,               those      attempts            will     fail.      We
believe     that       it     offers         the    real       prospect of                ending football
hooliganism both inside and outside grounds.                                         If hooligans know
that they will not be allowed in to football matches,                                              they will
have no incentive to travel to them.                                 The link between football
and hooliganism will be broken and                             football will cease to be a
focus for violence.
                                                     -3-

           "This is why the Bill   is necessary.   We have   said   all
    along that we want to co-operate with the football authorities in
    drawing up the scheme and I shall be meeting the chairmen of the
    League clubs this afternoon to talk about the Bill.   I hope that
    they will begin to see that it is in their interests;    I have no
    doubt but that it is in the interests of society as a whole."

        The member States of the Council of Europe and the other States party to the European
 Cultural Convention, signatory hereto,

      Considering that th# aim of thtf Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its
 members ;

        Concerned by violence and misbehaviour amongst spectators at sports events, an d in
 particular_at football matches, and the consequences thereof ;

           Aware th at this problem is likely to put at risk the principles embodied in Resolution (76) 41
 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe known as the “ European Sport for All
 C h a tte f” ;

        Emphasising the im portant contribution made to international understanding by sport,
 and especially, because of their frequency, by football matphes between national and club teams
 fronj European states ;

       Considering that both public authorities and the independent sports organisations have
separate but complementary responsibilities to com bat violence and misbehaviour by spectators,
bearing in mind th at the sports organisations also have responsibilities in m atters of safety and
that more generally they should ensure the orderly conduct of the events they org anise; considering
moreover that these authorities and organisations should work together for this purpose at all
appropriate levels ;       '

       Considering that violence is a current social phenom enon with wide repercussions, whose
erigias lie mainly outside sport, and th at sport is often the scene for outbreaks of violence ;


       Being resolved to take common and co-operative action to prevent and control the
problem of violence and misbehaviour by spectators at sports events.
       Have agreed as follows :

                                               Article 1

1.    The Parties, with a view to preventing and controlling violence and misbehaviour by
spectators at football matches, undertake, within the limits of their respective constitutional
provisigns, to take the necessary steps to give effect to the provisions of this Convention.


2.    The Parties shall apply the provisions of this Convention to other sports and sports events
in which violence or misbehaviour by spectators is to be feared, as appropriate to the specific
requirements of such sports and sports events.

        Preoccupes par la violence et les debordements de spectateurs lors de manifestations spor*
tives et notam m ent de m atches de football, et par les consequences qui en decoulent ;
      Conscients du fait que ce problem e menace les principes consacres par la Resolution (76) 41
du Comite des Ministres du Conseil de l’Europe, connue comme la «Charte europeenne du sport
pour tous» ;

sport et, particulierem ent, en raison de leur frequence, p ar les matches de football entre les
equipes nationales et locales des £ t a ts europeens ;
        Considerant que tan t les autorites publiques que les organisations sportives independantes
ont des responsabilites distinctes ifiais corhplementaires dans la lutte contre la violence et les
 debordem ents de spectateurs, compte tenu du fait que les organisations sportives ont aussi des
.responsabilites en matiere de securite et que, plus generalement. elles doivent assurer le bon
 deroulem ent des manifestations q u ’elles organisent ; considerant p ar ailleurs que ces autorites et
 organisations doivent a cet effet unir leurs efforts a tous les niveaux concernes ;

origines sont essentiellement exterieures au sport, et que le sport est souvent le terrain
d ’explosions de violence ;

maitriser la violence et les debordem ents de spectateurs lors de manifestations sportives,

6TH CONFERENCE OF EUROPEAN MINISTERS       RESPONSIBLE    FOR    SPORT
REYKJAVIK, 30 MAY - 1 JUNE 1989


SPECTATOR VIOLENCE

Introductory report »by P A Lee,      Chairman of the Standing
Committee of the European Convention on Spectator Violence


Contracting Parties

1-      It is customary to begin these reports on the    work of the
Standing Committee with an account of progress in          respect of
ratification of the Convention.     I am pleased to      be able to
report that there are now 15 contracting parties and      5 signatory
states.    We look forward to other member states        signing and
ratifying the Convention.


The work of the Standing Committee

2.     Since the 5th Ministers' Conference in Dublin in 1986
there have been four full meetings of the Standing Committee and
three meetings of its research working party.   The Committee has
continued to monitor the application of the Convention, reviewing
its provisions and receiving progress reports from member states
and UEFA on national      priorities  and  initiatives.    UEFA's
Secretary General attends the Standing Committee's meetings as an
observer and UEFA regards the Convention as a good safeguard.


3.    The Standing Committee has not proposed any amendments to
the  Convention   but  has  adopted  5  recommendations  to  the
contracting parties concerning


(1)    restrictions on alcohol sales during travel to matches;

(2)    restrictions on alcohol sales around grounds before, during
       and after matches;

(3)    increasing police co-operation including the use of
       "spotters";

(4)    increasing police co-operation by organising international
       seminars;

and most recently -

 (5)   guidelines for the control of ticket sales - which are set
       out in the papers before this Conference.


4.     The Standing Committee's findings      may be summarised by
saying that hooliganism remains a problem    inside stadia - though
the success of existing measures including   effective policing has
resulted in a decline in major incidents      - and outside stadia.
There is no room for complacency.
 ^       „ T^e Committee received reports on domestic developments,

 so-called supporters in city centres.


 Report on anti-hooliganism measures

 fnw-;+-a^AS                 ^0 ^^-0W UP work, the Standing Committee was
          ' a       e inf°rmal meeting of Ministers in Athens, in June
LpnnT-f           w produce a report on anti-hooligan measures.      This
                   Sen c°mpleted and is included in the Conference
hoSfJ?,*,        represents a comprehensive list of measures, drawing
F         ^       omestlc experience in the member states and on the '
              -
              4   mP 1°nships in West Germany.        Member states are
hnniinan-0 consider the various measures in the context of their
        2 1S™ problems.          With that purpose in mind I invite
 m i s t e r s to approve the report.


Research pr o~ject

discuSSn        £ h Mlnisters                       turn to this subject    in the
discussion which is to follow this report.
Future work
g.     I turn now to a more general look at the future wor      o
the Committee and invite, Ministers to agree to the following wor
plan for the coming year.


10.    The immediate priority task, I hope you will agree,
be national and international preparatory work for the  or    up
tournament next year in Italy.   Exhaustive planning and maximum
international co-operation will be vital.


11.    It is important that the Standing Committee and the
European Community forum on police co-operation known as
TREVI Group should develop their relationship: they have sep
but complementary roles and it is important that they s ou    ^W?h _
together.  It was a welcome development that the Secretary o
Committee attended the TREVI de-briefing seminar on the Europea
Championships    held  in Munster   in March   and        ctanriinn
representative     attended  the  last meeting   of the   Stanaing
Committee.   I understand that the lessons from the exper        _
Germany are being incorporated in draft TREVI guide ines
international    co-operation on the policing of^                 nn
football matches.   Once they have been agreed it is the branai y
Committee's intention to adopt similar guidelines to ensure
policies are consistent.


12.    Some member states have said that they wish to discuss
the context of the Standing Committee the implications °
readmission of English clubs to Europe.   The Committee  ere o
intends to consider this at the appropriate time.


 13.    The Committee will, in concert with the CDDS,    pursue any
 research project agreed by Ministers.


 14.   The disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15      April in
 Sheffield has, tragically, thrown ■ the importance of     spectator
 safety at sports stadia into high relief.


 15.   The Federal Republic of Germany has written ^ to me to
 suggest that it would be appropriate to convene a special meeting
 of the Standing Committee to consider the provisions of tne
 Convention in respect of safety issues.   Athough the work o     e
 Committee has necessarily been devoted thus far to the matter o
 hooliganism, we should not lose sight of the fact that           e
 Convention is also concerned with spectator safety. Following any
 such meeting on safety issues the Committee would assist t e
 in preparing a text on the principles of spectator safety an     e
 measures which can be taken to ensure that they are fu i e ^
 If Ministers agree, the Standing Committee will put this wor    in
 hand and pursue the important issue of safety in co-opera ion
 with the CDDS.

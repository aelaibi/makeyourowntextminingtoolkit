FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL AND SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

N i c holas Ridl ey co pied to me his letter of 1£r July to
John Wakeham.      I u n d e r s t a n d he had to b r i n g f o r w a r d the
tabling of amend m e n t s and that the Bill does now pro vi de                          for
safet y role for the lic e n s i n g authority.

I am wr iting to put on record the c o n t ribution that can be
made by the He a l t h and S a f e t y Execu ti ve , a l t hough of cours e
you may alre a d y be bear i n g HSE's e x pertise in mind, since it
a l r e a d y enfor ce s h e a l t h and sa fety in sports grou nd s not
cov ere d by the S a f e t y of Sport s Gr ounds Act.

The HSE has a large and ex p e r i e n c e d inspectorate, and
specia l i s t s have just giv en ev idence to the Hill s b o r o u g h
inquiry on the s t r e n g t h of crash barri er s etc in the ground.
It has w e l l - e s t a b l i s h e d liai so n arr a n g e m e n t s wit h local
au th or ities, w hich are its enf o r c i n g age nt s for muc h he a l t h
and sa fety legis la ti on .            I beli e v e some kind of r e l a t i o n s h i p
betw ee n HSE and the new N DPB will be necessary, and would be
beneficial.

I am copying this let te r to the Prime Minister, memb er s of H
Committee, Sir R obin Bu t l e r and First P a r l i a m e n t a r y Counsel.

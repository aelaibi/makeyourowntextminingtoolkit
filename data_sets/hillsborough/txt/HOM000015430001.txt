    HUISBQRCUSH STM3ICM DISASTER - POLICE CCMPIAIN1S ADIHCRI3Y INVOLVEMENT




    The Chairman of the Police Complaints Authority, Sir Cecil Clothier,
    spoke to me yesterday evening following our earlier consultations about
    what should happen in the highly likely event that complaints are made
    about the conduct of the police which will require, as a matter of law,
    a supervised investigation under the aegis of the Police Complaints
    Authority.


    2.   Sir Cecil Clothier has, I understand, agreed with Mr Peter Wright,
    the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire (whose duty it would be in the
    event of such complaints where there have been fatalities to refer them
    to the PCA) that as and when such complaints are made they should be
    referred in due form of law and he, Sir Cecil Clothier, would
    personally assume responsibility for their supervision.


    3.   He would regard the West Midlands Police investigations on behalf
    of Lord Justice Taylor as fully sufficient to meet his needs in so far
i


as they covered any matters complained of; he knows Lord Justice Taylor
extremely well, and both as a matter of law and as a matter of his
responsibility as Chairman of the PCA would have complete confidence
that they could work satisfactorily without friction.




                                                                              1
    4.   There remains the question whether Mr Dear would find this
    acceptable - Sir Cecil Clothier has not consulted him (I thought
    rightly, since no complaint has yet been made).


    5.   For yet a further enquiry by a third police force to be conducted
    to comply with the requirements of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
    would be wasteful and absurd; and I hope and expect that Mr Dear will
    make no difficulty about his enquiries under Lord Justice Taylor being
    adopted for the purpose of any complaints by agreement between the
#   Police Complaints Authority and Lord Justice Taylor in the event.

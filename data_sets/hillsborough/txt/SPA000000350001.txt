I a m w r iting to give you formal notice of my intention to retire on
1 M a y 1990.

As you k n o w it had always been m y intention to leave the Force on reaching
60 years of age, but my personal resolve was over taken b y the tragic events
at Hillsborough.     It seemed to me the proper course of action would be to
await the outcome of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry and to deal, as I
thought appropriate, with what emerged in the findings.

Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry is n o w complete and all the necessary police
actions arising from it have b een commissioned and largely concluded.

The enquiries on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions and Her
Maj esty' s Coroner being carried out by the West Midlands Police are likely
to be completed in April, and I have made every effort to ensure that all
ava ilable evidence and information has been brought to the attention of
Mr Dear and his investigating officers.              The timing of my retirement
should ensure that I am in post to deal w i t h any queries raised by the
i n v e s t i g a t i o n and to anticipate, so far as I a m able, the conclusion of
the investig ation I instituted.

I ha ve had the honour and privilege to command the South Yorkshire Police
for the past seven years and despite the tribulations of recent months I
have no hesit ation in saying that morale is high and the Force is in good
heart.    W h o e ver is fortunate e nou gh to be appointed the next Chief
Con stabl e will receive the full support of what by any normal standards is
a most effective and efficient Force.

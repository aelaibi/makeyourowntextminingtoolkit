The Gate          public          house - OPEN          (side door          to    locals    only).

We were         directing           coaches        down C l a y w h e e l s      Lane and during             the    first

few hours           the      crowds were            steady.         T h e y were making          their way          to the

ground an d            no    trouble was           seen.

There were a                lot    of    people       (rnaybe 20      in total)         asking      for      ’The

Sportsman''            w h i c h I did not          know where         it was       and there was a                gradual

increase          of        people       coming       from the      ground       side asking         if any pubs

were        open.           Some Liverpool            fans   did     get   into The Gate              public house

through         the         side doors       (door men         on duty).

All     who     e n q u i r e d were        told most        public        houses were          closed       for the day

but those who                enquired            still made     their way away from the                      direction

of the        ground and up Pe n i s t o n e R o a d North.

The     supporters'               t rain a r r i v e d at W a d s l e y Bridge at               1.50    p.m.       (some

15-20 minu t e s             earlier        than expected).

A b o u t 8 0 0 - 1 , 0 0 0 s u p p o r t e r s who all             made    their way under             separate

escort        down L e p p i n g s        Lane      to the     ground.           This    crowd was        orderly and

I saw no          incidents at all.                    Little       singing       - well    beha v e d       in general.

Traffic was             now b u i lding           up and     it was        noticed a lot of the

sp e c t a t o r s w ere          carrying         drink.      The    time       now about 2 . 1 0        p.m.       Some

were        drinking         from       *4 packs*       and others          from    large       bottles.

P e d e s t r i a n traf f i c          now was       fairly    heavy and a lot were                   sat    on the

walls        drinking         before making             their way          to the ground.

At 2.15         p.m.        aproximately            instructions           received       via    radios       to    close

L e p p i n g s Lane         to v e hicular           traffic - DONEE.

C o a c h e s were          still       a r r iving    but   these were           now    parking       on Halifax

Road as C l a y w h e e l s             Lane was       full.        V ery few      cars.        P e d e s t r i a n traffic

now very heavy.

Obvious         that        some    had no tickets             as    they were          in a group asking             for

tickets.

The    general      beh a v i o u r   I w ould describe            as good.          Some    had been/were

drinking,         m a n y were    not.      By this       time all making             towards          the ground.

Co u l d hear      over    the    radio     of    problems       at L e p p i n g s Lane         end and at a

certain time,            I believe after           the m a t c h    had started,            an    i nstruction

’ALL A V A I L A B L E O F F I C E R S TO T H E GROUND'.               My few serials were                   soon

gathered         together      and we made         our way       to L e p p i n g s Lane         side    of the

ground.

On arrival         could see a large              group       of Police Officers,                and argument

taking     place wit h         supporters.           I thought         this was a public                order

s i t u a t i o n and    I fo r m e d a cordon across              the    t u rnstiles       to keep

spectators         away.       The    turnstiles were            closed but          people were arguing

that    they had tickets and were dem a n d i n g                      entry.        These were          kept       back

and    it was      some m i n u t e s    later whe n          people were        leaving         the    ground,

d i r e cting abuse        to the Police,            that      I realised s o mething              else was

d r a s t i c a l l y wrong.

ce nt i*o 1 .     I entered       the ground         itself      behind the West Stand.                       A large

number     of     people were         injured,       some were         o b v i o u s l y dead.         Others were

in a state         of shock.          People     were     tending        to the      injured.           After       the

initial         shock,    I remember        giving      first aid         to a youth who               had obvious

internal injuries.

3.' cannot       remember      if the      radio was work i n g at             this time               but    I do

not    recollect         hear i n g any transmissions.

Together        wit h a n o t h e r   officer      I moved       the     injured y o u t h who was

conscious         to the sterile          area     behind the West and S outh Stand.

I remember a doctor               a r r iving and       I said      I. w a n t e d   the    injured

prioritising.             This    he did.         I noticed another             doctor       certifying             the

dead.

I n i t ially the a m b u l a n c e s were         slow.       The y w o u l d find         it difficult

getting      t h r o u g h traffic and           pedestrians.

           One w o u l d a r r i v e   and   the   injured near     the t urnstiles        would   get   on —

            although     they were       not   the more urgent        cases.      This was      eventually

            ov e rcome and w i t h more a m b u l a n c e s    now a r r i v i n g all   the   injured were

            removed.

            The     dead were     then   removed and     the    officer     dealing wit h the dead

            taken with      it.

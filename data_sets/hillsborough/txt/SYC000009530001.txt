   NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                    Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.

3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                          Re

     care/self-neglect').

  b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
    infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one

     induced abortion.                                                    Verdict
     C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.

Dear Sirs,

Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
due course.

 I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
 evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
 coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
 inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

 Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
 under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
 witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
 this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

 Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
 to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
 appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
 consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

 May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
 attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

 I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission, of a name or
 names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
 to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

 I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
 heard from you by the end of^^^prCember I will assume you have no names to
 submit.

 Yours f a i t h f u l l y ^ ^

         am actively considering your suggestion.  I will reply to you hopefully in
         the very near future with my decision.

Dear Dr Sapper

RE:   THOMAS HOWARD

I have had an opportunity of going through the SuMoary with Mr and Mrs
Howard, they have no questions to raise can either its contents or the
contents of the Post Mortem.

Mr and Mrs Howard will be in Sheffield (with a social worker) to hear their
son's Summary presented; they will also wish to be in Court when the
grandson’s Summary is presented                   and I trust you would have
no objection to this.

Yours sincerely

                As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
                Disaster stand adjourned to a date to he fixed. You may also
                he aware that it had heen in my mind to resume these Inquests
                on the 15th of January 1990.

                I have now heen informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
                has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
                behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
                Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

                I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
                Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
                he may wish to undertake.

                I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
                or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
                matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
                a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
                on this matter further.

                I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
                is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
                fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Dear Sir

RE:   H ILLSB O RO U G H


Many thanks for your letter of the 27th July enclosing copies of the Post-Mortem
Reports.

I will certainly make clear to my clients the conditions under which these
Reports have been released.

A cheque for £26.95 to cover your copying charges is attached, might I trouble
you for a receipt for accounting purposes.

Since I gave you my list of deceased a further one has been added, he is
John McBrien The Old Vicarage, Well Street, Holywell, Clwyd, might I please
have a copy of his Report to complete the set.

Yours faithfully           ____ / _______

                Hear Sirs,

( ~)            You will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
                reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
                in fact put in as evidence.

                However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
                ^nd the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
                I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
                I am prepardd to release to you upon request, the post mortem
                report of your client(3 ).

                The release of these post mortem reports are cn the basis that:-

                         a.       They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                                  subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                                  they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

                         b.       They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
                                  consalling of the deceased's relatives or for proper
                                  legitimate purposes in connection with any legal proceedings
( )                               in which solicitors may be engaged.

                         c.       Subject to t h e . , they are to be kept confidential until
                                  they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

                I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect .
                of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
                assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
                each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
                above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
                I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
                reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
                the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

                The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is        per sheet (total t U                             'fC
                Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

4th July 1989

Dear Mr Popper

I write following my very helpful conversation this afternoon with Mr Thompson
from your office to confirm a number of points.

Firstly, I understand that you are favourably inclined towards the requests
that you have recieved from a number of Solicitors to release copies of
the Post-Mortem Reports on the victims of the Hillsborough Disaster in advance
of resumed Inquest Hearings and in this regard might I ask you to let me
have copies of the Reports on the deceased named in the attached list the
families of whom I respresent.

There is a strong feeling from many of the families that early receipt of copies
of the P.M. Reports would be beneficial both in terms of answering some
hiterto unanswered questions and also in perhaps reducing the anguish which
might be suffered when full details of the cause of death become known at a
public hearing perhaps some weeks or months hence.

If payment is required for copies of any of the Reports then needless to say
I will be happy to deal with this.

I understand that the relative positions of approximately 50 of those who
suffered fatal injuries has been established at or immediately prior to the
estimated time of death, this information is being generally discussed and
although I am not asking you at this stage to release the names of the 50
involved I would be very greatful if you would confirm that this information
is correct, perhaps the number has increased from 50? Would it be your intention
to release this information prior to reopening of the inquests?

Finally, I confirm that I will speak to my fellow committee members tomorrow
(Wednesday) about the issue of ’block representation’ of the bereaved families at the

Dear Detective Superintendent Beechey,

T?ot HTT.T.S'RQROIJGE DISASTER - BODY FILES.


As agreed with Mervyn Jones, I am contacting you in connection
with any detailed amendments which I think perhaps should be
made to the files.

I have already mentioned to Inspector Tobe that the summaries
are fine, my only reservation being because they are in the
third person and do not contain quotes may give rise to perhaps
some extra questions from solicitors. However, as the format
has already been settled, and I believe that the majority of
cases have already been drafted, I do not think that there is
very much we can do about it at this stage.

 I have now managed to read through several files and would
 like to draw the following points to your attention




                                                                                    conx■a




                                                                                             I

                                               -    2




Deceased Reference No.81 Thomas Howard.                   iX

Page 20 of Peter Muir’s statement seems to have a patent error on it.
He says that an ambulance collected the body from the temporary
mortuary at 5*25p«®» and took it to the Medico Legal Centre where
he stayed and identified it to someone as Body 81.

That I think is patently wrong in that the polaroid photographs
were not taken until well after that. The summary seems to have
got it right, but I am not quite sure how.

I am of course open to correction on any comments which I may
make to you. In addition, the only ones that are really urgent
are any typing corrections to the summary sheets as those are
the documents which will have to be sent out.

For the next few days I will not be at the Medico-Legal Centre
but you will be able to contact me at my home where I will be
a good bit of the time.


Yours sincerely,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner.

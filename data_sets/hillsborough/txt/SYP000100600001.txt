POLICE CONSTABLE 43



'F' DIVISION, ECCLESFIELD POLICE STATION



On Saturday 15 April 1989, I attended at Ecclesfield Police Station at 9-00

am in     full uniform and        from there was      transported to Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club at Hillsborough to perform public order duty before,                                during

and after the F A Cup Semi-Final between Notts Forest and Liverpool.

I arrived      at the    ground    in    full   uniform    and was   in     serial 17 under the

control    of Police Sergeant 468 Whitlam.                 Our pre-match brief had been                 to

perform    duty    at   the    Leppings     Lane    turnstiles,      numbers      1    to   8,    (those

allowing access to the North Stand).                During Phase 1 of the event and after

a briefing,       together     with     other   officers   on duty     at   the       ground     for   the

match, our serial took up our positions on the outside                      of the turnstiles           at

Leppings Lane, the time being approximately 11.45 am.

I was stood outside the penultimate turnstile for the North Stand (together

with WPC 3027 Tagg), before the turnstiles for the West Stand.

Between approximately 11.45 am and 1.45 pm on that date,                          fans entered the

turnstiles at my location in a slow manner.                  I was suprised at the lack of

persons who had arrived by 1.45 pm.                During this period (11.45 aÂ® - 1.45 pni)

I   searched      several     persons    entering    the   turnstiles       and   removed        several

unopened pop cans and a banner from persons.                    Some people decided to open

the cans there and then and drink them before entering and I saw a number of

persons    stood some distance           away from the      turnstiles drinking slowly.                  I

could see by 1.45 pm that a large number of cans of beer and pop had been

placed against a wall nearby.
From about 1.45 pm onwards, the number of persons arriving began to increase

dramatically.      Searches became more infrequent as the number queueing up to

enter began to increase.         At this stage the mood was generally good natured

but a lot of people had begun to congregate about 15 yards away from the

turnstiles and were making no attempt to enter the ground.                   I saw a mounted

Police Officer on several occasions ask those congregating to make their way

into the stadium, but a large number ignored these requests and just moved

from one position to another.            A few people were asking me if they could

enter without tickets and I informed them that they couldn't and many people

were queueing up at my turnstile to then be told by myself that they had the

wrong ticket and had to go to another part of the ground.

After a while I saw that the crowd waiting to enter had begun to increase

considerably.       At   this   point   a   youth   was   refused   entry    by   one     of   the

officials     on   the   turnstile.     I   approached     this   youth     and   could    smell

intoxicants    on his breath.         I informed him to leave        the area due         to his

apparent drunkenness.        (I did not want to arrest the youth because I had to

give consideration to the numbers arriving at the turnstiles).                    He used some

abusive language and then joined a queue at one of the other turnstiles.                         I

approached him and seized his arm,           informing him that he was under arrest

for attempting to enter the ground whilst drunk.              As I did so he began using

abusive language and began to struggle.             On looking around for assistance I

could see that the crowd had become considerable                  and there was no Police

back-up available within a reasonable distance.              Several persons stood near

the youth told me they were with him and would take him away.                     Some persons

were becoming hostile and in view of this I decided,                  in the interests of

safety and to prevent injury, to allow them to do so.                I saw them escort the
youth a few yards away before losing sight of them                         in the crowd.

I managed to squeeze my way back to the turnstile                          entrance I had been stood

at and saw several youths sitting on a corrugated steel wall which divided

the seating turnstile from the turnstiles for those wishing to stand.                                        As I

looked ahead I saw that the crowd of people had become so large that I could

no longer see past them.               They stretched in every direction.                     I informed WPC

Tagg that     it would be         dangerous           to continue searching persons              due to the

numbers arriving and the density of the crowd in the immediate vicinity.                                        I

saw that many of the younger persons in front of me were chanting loudly and

had cans of beer in their possession.                          One person had hold of a bottle of

beer   and   was    waving    at       me.       He    was   extremely    unsteady       on    his    feet    and

appeared     very    drunk.        I    suddenly        felt    a surge    of   people        begin    to push

forwards     and    I     could    see       a   mounted       Police    Officer    in    the        background

signalling with his arms for people to hold back.                           I was pushed momentarily

against the wall next to the turnstile.                         I shouted for people not to push,

yet those immediately in front of me did not appear to have been pushing and

one man shouted,          "It's those behind".                 Persons with tickets           for the wrong

turnstiles were now experiencing difficulty in leaving                             the        turnstile      area

and I was     having       to physically          hold people backwards            in     order to make        a

small gap for these persons to squeeze through.                          Still more people seemed to

be pushing forwards and the numbers sat on the steel wall began to increase.

People were climbing onto nearby fencing.                        The mounted officers were further

in the background and there was a mass of people between these officers and

ourselves     on    the    turnstiles.           I began       to think    at   this      stage that         some

people could end up being seriously injured and began to feel concern for my

own safety.        I asked Police Constable Tagg, who was looking pale, if she was

okay and she said, "Yes".
                                                        -    4    -




Suddenly,        I felt a large sustained surge towards the turnstiles and I was

pushed forcibly against the wall next to the turnstile I was at.                                        I could

not move for a second.                  I pushed back to gain some space and saw that the

people in front of me began to look scared.                                  An old man was pushed forward

through      the      crowd     and    people     near       me       were   pleading   with    me   to let him

through.         He    looked badly shaken and I had to push amongst the crowd and

make a small gap to allow him in through the turnstile.                                   Several men passed

me clutching their children, many of whom were crying and one child had a

bright red colour to his face.                        I assisted these and a couple of old men

through the turnstiles.                 I was by now facing the crowd with my back against

the wooden frame of the turnstile and pressed right up against it.                                        I was

having extreme difficulty staying in position and by now I had lost sight of

WPC Tagg and my other colleague on the turnstiles, other than a WPG on my

left who was having extreme difficulty moving and appeared very upset.                                        I

raised      my    am     in     the    air    hoping        to    attract     the   attention    of a mounted

officer but they were not looking at me, there was a sea of people, some in

front of me were drunk and there was a lot of abusive language being used by

some   in    the       crowd.         I heard    people          shouting,     "It's    going    to be another

Heysel" and "People are going to get fucking killed here".                                     I now feared for

my   life    and       the    lives    of     those    near me          as the surge     for the turnstiles

reached unbearable pressure.                    One man shouted to me, "There's an old man on

the floor here".              I could not see for the sheer number of persons in front

of m e . I shouted to the persons I was facing to stop pushing and lean back -

there's a man on the floor.                    A white teenage male youth shouted at me, "Fuck

off", as the surge continued.                    There was a look of sheer panic on the faces

of those         directly       in    front    of me.            I could now see some           people pushing
forward hard and chanting.                   I was pushed sideways against the wall next to

the    turnstiles        and     by    now     was     experiencing     difficulty          breathing.       I

signalled frantically towards the mounted officers but they did not appear

to respond.       I could feel my back pressed against the wall and I was on my

tip-toes.        I began to feel             extremely        frightened and faint.           I could hear

shouts of, "There's going to be another Heysel" and "Someone's going to die

here".        I feared for my life by now.                     I saw the turnstile next to me and

grasped the wooden frame with my hands.                         I forced a deep breath and pulled

myself    towards       the     turnstile.           People    were   pushing    from   every    side.       I

forced myself into the turnstile and shouted at the official taking tickets

to let me through.              As I passed through the turnstile and looked back into

the crowd,      the people at the turnstiles were pushed right up against them.

As    people    came    through       they    were     by now extremely         angry   and    frightened.

Many   shouted towards me             that    people were going to die outside and voiced

their annoyance and anger that they had been through such an ordeal at the

turnstiles.       I assisted one child who had been helped over the turnstile and

lost   his     father.        I saw that some of the officers who had been with me

earlier were now on the inside of the turnstiles with me.                                   They also said

they    had    been     crushed       against    the     walls    outside.       I   informed     a nearby

Inspector of the gravity of the situation outside and the fact that we had

lost control.          He acknowledged my concern.

I then saw that several people were jumping over a crash barrier behind the

turnstiles which separated               the North Stand supporters from the West Stand

supporters - they were jumping across to the West Stand side of the barrier.

Some    then pushed the barrier out of the way and just ran through.                                     There

were    people running past me in all directions.                         I was now fearful for my

safety    on    this     side    of    the    barrier     - several youths           were    threatening     a
                                                   -   6   -




nearby    Police     Sergeant,         swearing   at       him    and   behaving    in    a very     hostile

manner and some began shouting at me voicing their anger over the situation.

I saw several people who ran past me on the North Stand side had tickets for

the West Stand.          On looking to my right I saw several people stood on top of

the wall next to the turnstiles.

Suddenly      I saw the gate           at the side of me open and a sea of people run

through towards the Leppings Lane stand.                         In a few seconds the rush was over

and on the instructions of a Police Sergeant (whose identity I do not know),

I ran through the gate to the outside of the stadium towards the position I

had originally occupied at the turnstiles.                         I saw that there were very few

people now on Leppings Lane.                 As soon as I reached the turnstile area the

same Police Sergeant shouted to me that there were people on the pitch.                                  We

both jumped over one of the turnstiles and round to the Police control box

in the ground.        There were a large number of Police Officers running with us

now.     We passed the Police box and ran onto the pitch and as we did so, I

saw that the Leppings Lane stand appeared to be completely full of Liverpool

supporters.        I saw several climbing from the lower tier to the upper tier.

There were dozens of Police                 Officers        in frontof the        fencing between        the

Leppings Lane       stand and the           pitch and several            Liverpool       fans were    on the

pitch.     My first impression              was that they were invading the pitch.                     I ran

towards    the     fence    and   as    I   did so I saw a middle                aged man beingpassed

overhead by the crowd and the Police Officers assisting some to climb over

the fencing.        At this point I realised something was wrong though I didn't

appreciate the gravity of the situation.                         As I reached the fence near to the

goal   area    I   saw     several      Police    Officers        inside   the     terracing   among     the

crowd - they appeared to be jostling with some fans and a lot of abuse was
being directed       towards    them.          I saw    some   persons     attempting to grab the

officers and being held back by other fans and I saw some fans climbing up

from the lower terrace to the higher terrace.                      I then looked to my right and

saw a large number of people lying in different positions on the floor near

to the barrier.          There were young and old alike and I saw a pair of legs

sticking up with the rear of the body buried beneath other bodies.                                It was

at this point I realised the gravity of the situation.                             The next thing I

remember I was stood near to one of the gates in the barrier giving access

to the pitch.        This    gate was open.             A small child, white male,            about 10

years    old,    wearing    a red T-shirt         and    jeans     was being passed through the

gates.     I grabbed hold of the child and carried him onto the pitch where I

saw St John's Ambulance people attending to some injured people.                              I placed

the child on the floor and saw that he was limp, he was not breathing and he

was white with purple colouring around his lips and eyes.                          I could not feel

a pulse and began to give heart massage while two nearby St John's Ambulance

members approached and began to give artificial respiration and assist with

the massage.        Eventually      he    began    to breath again and a pulse returned,

though    he    remained    unconscious.          I     left   this     youth   with   the   St   John's

Ambulance people and returned to the above mentioned gate.                             (I do not know

the identity of the youth but see Appendix 'A' at the end of order).

As   I   returned   I saw several Police               Officers'      helmets being thrown in an

aggressive manner from Leppings Lane lower terraces over the fence towards

officers    near    the    pitch.        There    was    a   lot   of   chanting    and   abuse    being

directed       towards    the Police      by    a large      number of supporters         in Leppings

Lane.     I saw that people were crushing forward to get out of the gate but

that the back of the lower terrace was almost empty.                            I shouted for people
to move     back    into the    space and some did, but many kept pushing forward.

After several people had been carried out of the gate I went in towards a

barrier down the middle of the terrace, believing there were still dead and

injured on that side.           As I entered several people became abusive and some

were hysterical.           I approached the barrier and saw there appeared to be no

injured on my side but I still saw many bodies lying on the floor on the

other side of the barrier.               Some fans shouted hysterically at me and I was

fearful for my safety.           Police Officers and several fans were carrying them

out and trying to assist them.               I saw there was a very aggressive attitude

by fans on that side of the barrier towards officers and abusive language

was being directed towards them.                 I climbed out of the gate I had entered

and went round to another gate on the other side of the dividing barrier.

There were many Police Officers there and as people were passed out of the

gate we all took turns           at carrying them on to the pitch.              It was obvious

that many of those we did carry were already dead.                  I saw an ambulance next

to   this    gate    and    several    ambulancemen    assisting.     All   the    time   Police

helmets were being thrown towards us from the terrace and I saw one hit a

Police      Officer.       I   handled    many   bodies,   some   alive   and   some   dead    and

assisted in taking them onto the pitch.               I do not know their identities.

I heard      the Notts Forest         fans chanting though I could not hear what they

were saying and this added to the hysteria of the Liverpool fans.                      Many fans

were pulling up boarding to use as stretchers and assisting to take dead and

injured towards the Penistone Road side of the pitch.                 I assisted with this.

One youth who was drunk grabbed hold of me on the pitch as I was doing this,

his face was covered in blood.               He kept telling me he wanted to see Kenny

Dalglish and he would not let go of my clothing.                    It took several minutes




                                                                                              Ifeus.
for me to shake him off and continue assisting.                   I began comforting some of

the    injured and family and friends of the dead on the pitch.                        I was then

ordered to join a line of Police Officers stood across the centre of the

pitch    and   prevent Liverpool       fans,    other     than   injured,   passing.     I saw a

large number of Police Dog Handlers and dogs appear on the pitch behind me.

The atmosphere in the ground was still very tense and I was fearful for my

safety.     Many Liverpool fans were incensed at the Notts Forest fans though a

broadcast      by   Kenny   Dalglish   asking     people    to co-operate     over     the ground

tannoy system helped ease the situation.                  Liverpool fans began to calm down

though several approached Police Officers in a threatening manner and some

of these were obviously hysterical and many were shouting abuse at us.                       Some

fans were,      however,    extremely co-operative          and assisted in the removal of

bodies and supporting upset fans.

After a while I was ordered,            together with other officers in the line, to

leave the ground via the Penistone Road exit, which I did.                     I then performed

duty    in Penistone Road,       directing Notts          Forest supporters     to coaches and

vehicles, ensuring emergency vehicles had unobstructed exits available from

the ground.

After de-briefing at the ground, I returned to Ecclesfield Police Station at

7.00 pm and went off duty from that location.

APPENDIX 'A'

The youth I refer to above             (who I carried onto the pitch and assisted in

reviving)      is unknown to myself.           However,    in
During the event I was not issued with a personal radio and was unaware of

the situation elsewhere outside and inside the ground whilst I was involved

in the crush.

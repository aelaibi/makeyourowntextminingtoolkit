             TSSTH.’O OF OUIS:l DARTJlTvS AT S’CTTTSLD l.’SIT.ESDAY F .C .

     A preliminary meeting was hold at the dub attended by the Secretary
Mr E.W. Taylor.               of Ifusband and Co., the Clubs Consulting
Engineers a n d a n d
               explained that two years previously Ills firm had carried out
a scries of tests on the barricro. Although the design load for the barriers
was based on the figure of 206lbs per foot for balcony balustrades in the
Dritish Standard Code of Practice l)o. 3 Cliaptor V, it vas anticipated tliat
tliis figure would be increased following the Tbrox disaster. It vas
therefore decided to uso a figure of 3001bs per foot for these tests i.e.
an overload of some 455*. It vas discovered tliat certain barriers would
not withstand tills figure of 3001bs per foot and tliese barriers vere
immediately strengthened.
     The recommendations in the tfheatley Report regarding the design of
crush barriers are that the barriers should be designed to withstand either
340 or 2301bs per foot run depending on where tho barriers are on the
ground, the slope of the terracing and the horizontal distance betveon the
barriers (Pago 31, para 41.2). It has been agreed with the Home Office that
thcso figures should be increased for testing existing barriers to 400 and
288lbs per foot run respectively, to give an adequate safety margin.
     Tho two ends of the ground have their own entrances, there beiiif. no
tcrracing on the sides of the ground. According to the recoiiunendations In
the Whcatloy lteport, all the tcrracing on the ground is classified as
"poak viewing" and thorefore the barriers vere tested generally to 4001 bs
per foot run. The exceptions wero two rows of barriers (numbers ?3 to 31
and 32 to 38). In the case of thcso two rows, the spacing between each row
of barriers was S'S” on terracing with a slope of 1 in 4* This close
spacing allows a reduction in tho tcot load and therefore these two rows
were tested at the reduced loading of 28Slbs per foot run.
     The barriers are numbered and we havo vised these as reference in this
report. They are located asfollowsi-

         Spion Kop             - Ponistonc Hoad End      Carriers      1to 101
          Lepping Lane End - Ground Level                Carriers    102 to 130
                 ditto           Suopcnded Terrace       Darriers    131 to 144

     There are five types of barriers on the ground.

Type (a) A horizontal otccl rail of 2”" diameter is supported by vertical
posts consisting of 2W x 2” id.s. angle together with a diagonal bracing of
the same material in front of the posts. The bracing is bent horizontally
at tho top of tho barrier and joined to tho vertical leg by a gusset plate.
Tho horizontal rail is fixed by a claiap, bolted to the vertical and
horizontal angles. Tho barriers vnry from single to multiple spans.

Typo (b) 8" x 8" concrete posts at 11'0" centres support a horizontal tube
ox 2^" diameter. At uid span, the tube has an additional support from
4" x 2" vertical channels voided to tho tube and boltod to the terrace. The
channols in turn arc strengthened by 2*" x 2^" angle struts concreted into
t’.e tcrracing 18" behind the chaiuicl and welded to the channel jusv below
ti.e horizontal rail.

      (c) 7" x 4" R.S.J. posts rupvoi't a 3" diaiictcr horizontal cube.
 -.‘<o io continuous and sleeved iJii’ough t!.e wel of i.>o po^ts.

V .^ (J) S" x 4W vortical R.u.J's Bu,v.w**t a 4J' C/i, diameter tube.

                                                                               Contd
                           Continued.


Type (e) litis it a tubular barrier using 2|!n diameter tube throughout.
Tho vertical posts and horizontal rail are Bade of continuous tube bent to
a goal post configuration with rounded corners. The horizontal tube is
strengthened bji a raker of tho same material welded to the rail 18" from
each end and 18" in front of the barrier at terrace level sloping into the
barrier until it is 6" away at the top. The raker is then bent to sake a
horizontal welded connection with the rail.
Talcing the areas in numerical orders-

Spion Kop.
The majority of barriers on the ground are'contained in tlxis area mostly
consisting of type (a). Failure of these barriers when it occurred* was
due to«-
1. corrosion - usually of the top bracket holding the horizontal rail.
2» weak foundations, allowing the barrier to be pulled out of the terrace.
3*   too great a span - generally in excess of 8'0n - allowing the
     horizontal rail to bend excessively under load.
4*   the distance between the raker and vortical post being Insufficient at
     terrace level i.e. 12" apart instead of the normal 18" to 24”# failure
     in tliis case occurring from bending of the posts and rakers.
     Particulars of each failure are given in the Appendix.

     As previously mentioned, due to the close proximity of barriers behind,
barriers 32 to 38 were loaded to the equivalent U.D.L. of 288lbs per foot
run. These are type (b) and have been strengthened previously. They
withstood the test loads satisfactorily with the exception of barriers 37
and 38 which failed due to cach having one span of 11'6". Of the type (c)
barriers (No's. 82* 83 and 84 ) only one was tested and failed due to weak
foundations. Further testing of tliis type was not continued to avoid
possible damage.
     The following barriers were not completely tested due to obstructions
or lack of terracing behind, No's. 1, 3l» 4S# 62, 73, 8l# 85 , 90, 94# 99#
100 and 101.

Leppin.ts Lane End.
At ground level# the barriers consisted, with one exception, of type (a).
Please refer to the Appendix for details of those barriers which were not
strong enough. Barrier 126 was type (d) and withstood the test load.
On the suspended tcrracing, a tubular barrier, type (e) has been installed
wlvich, unfortunately, was found to be inadeuate to take the test load.
Excessive bending started to take place in both the rail and mid post.
Testing was not continued as the barrier tested was considered to be typical
of those in tills section and we wished to avoid any unnecessary damage.
     Barriers 125 and 127 were not completely tested due to obstructions or
lack of terracing behind.

 Perimeter I,'all.
A section of insitu wall wiiich generally measured 3'6" high x 4" thick was
tested and found to be satisfactory. However# at one corner of the Spion
Kop there is a small section of pcriiuctcr wall made from precast concrete
planks 2n thick and 12" wide, supported by 6" x 5" concrete posts# slotted
to take the concrete planks. Previous experience on other grounds has
shown that this wall can withstand an equivalent U.D.L. of approximately
3001bs per foot run if in good condition.
                              Continued.


Other Points.

■Certain parts of tho foncing guarding the drop at the back of the Spion
 Kop are not very strong and should be strengthened.
Tho fencing guarding a drop over the exit tunnel at the left corner of the
Spion K6p has terracing beliind and therefore lias pressure exerted during a
natch.
Tills fence vas tested and started to fail at an enuivalent U.D.L, of l801bs
per foot run.
Ilandrailing on some of the exit stairs fron terracing and seated areas does
not conform with the report. (Page 23 para 13.4).

Conclusion.

Tito ground is veil maintained and the failure rate for the barriers is veil
below the average for grounds tested so far.
As vitli many other Club's, tho barriers are not spaced according to tho
recommendations in the Wheatley Roport. Tills is particularly noticeable at
the top of the Spion Kop and the suspended tcrracing at Lepplngs Lone. In
both areas the terracing has a steep slope of I In 2 and due to tho space
between barriers an effective distance between them of 18 feet measurod at
right angles to the tcrracing.

     Finally, we would lihe to thank llr Taylor for Ids co-operation in
carrying out these tests together vith             rliosc knowledge of the
ground and experience vith the original testing were of great value.

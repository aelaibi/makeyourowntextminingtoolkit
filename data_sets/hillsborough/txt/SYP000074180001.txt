As    I remember          the m ai n topics were              info on    crowd       control,         e v a cu at io n

w h i c h was a l l o c at e d to Notts Forest                 fans.

By    12 noon        large     number        of fans were       coming     into the ground and                  I

n oted      that     some of      them were Liverpool              fans,    who were d ir ec te d to the

parts       of the ground a l l o c a t e d to their               team.       As    time went         on the

crowds        coming      to the       ground    became       very heavy,        as was       expected.

The    overall          mood of the          crowd was     very good,       they were           good       nature

a nd there was a general                     'carnival'       atmosp he re .     On about 4 or 5

occasions          I and other          o ff icers     from my serial          stopped fans who were

d ri n k i n g alcohol         a nd made       them    pour    it out onto          the ground          prior       to

was    done       by the fans          with ou t any     complaints        or trouble.                I do not

Between 2.00pm            (1400)       and 3.00pm        0^300)       large      number       (say about 25 to

35    people)         either a sk ed me         p e rs on al ly w here       they could buy a ticket

f rom or a l t e r n a t i v e l y      I heard them shout ins o u t , asking anyo ne                        had a

ticket      to sell.         I did       in fact       note at      the tiiSe that           the m a j o ri t y of

these       people      e nq uiring      about     tickets were           from Liverpool,            this was

made    obvious         by their accents.

About 2.40pm            <1440)     I     was    stood wit h Police S er ge a nt 266 JACQUES,                      who

had a       personal      radio an d          I could overhear            t r a n s m i ss i on   coming from

Officers         on L ep pi n gs       Ln who were       clearly having               problems wit h      crowd

control.         As    It seemed that           these    officer         were    e xp er iencing       some kind

of trouble,            I then st ay ed next            to Police S er ge an t J A CQ U ES to             listen      in.

On the a p p r o a c h to 3 . 0 0 p m          <1500)    I could hear            increased         radio traffic.

E it h e r at or very s h or tl y              prior    to 3 . 0 0 p m    <1500),       I heard radio

transmissions            saying        that    people were         being     killed and

seriously         injured at L ep pi mj * Ln t ur ns ti le s and                      1 heard an officer

ask i n g    for a gate       to be opened,              n   .

I then d i s t i n c t l y    heard someone             shout^           t h e fftadio,     “ 10/99,    10/99".         1

recog n i s e d this       call      as the S o u th Yorkshi re                 code for disaster.             I then

h e ar d a command being                given to open a gate.

For    some while         then     I was       enga ge d dealing w it h the               crowds     still

en te r i n g    the gr ou nd thro ug h our             position,         and a l t h ou g h      I was aware

that so me th in g        unusual        was    taking       place at L ep pings           Ln I do not         think

an y of us knew e x ac tl y what                  it was.

A bout 3 . 2 0pm        (1530)     I was       informed          by Police S er geant J A CQ U E S that              it

a p p e a r e d some     kind of        pitch i nv asion had took                place      by the Liverpool

fans and that            the m at ch had still               not ki ck ed off,          or had been star te d

a n d a bandoned.          Notts       For e st    fans were        still       trying     to enter      the
                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                             SI 844

gr o u n d at this         time,      t h ro ug h our        position,       and     I noted that       small

g roups      of L i ve rp oo l       fans    kept      coming     round trying          to buy tickets.             By

this     time our         p os iiton had v ir t ua l ly           cleared and the fans we saw had

 o b v i o u s l y been d ri nking          though none          of them were outright                drunk.

A bout 3 . 4 0 p m       (1540)     we were made a ware               that     some    people     had been

k il l e d   inside       the ground.            We    had been due          to take our meal at 3 . 0 0 p m

 (1500)      but    o b v i o us l y this went          by the board as              circumstances

developed.We             then     r ec ei ve d    info stating         that     the match was a ba n do n ed

as a disaster             had taken         place,      there     being about          15 to 25       people    dead.

We were       d ir ec te d out        onto P e ni st on e Rd to assist ambulances,                       the Fire

B r ig a d e and o f f -d u ty        nurses,         doctors       etc   coming       into the ground.

F r o m about 4 . 0 0        pm    (1600)        onwards,      people     began to leave the ground

and this        pre s e nt ed      problems        getting       e m e r g e nc y vehicles      in.     as   time

wen t    on this         became      th ou sa nd s     of    people    leaving the ground,              streaming

 onto P e n s i to n e Rd,         w h i c h was      full    of a m b ul a ne c s    etc.     It was appar en t

A bo u t 4 . 3 0 p m     ( 1630)     I noti ced some LiverplSaJL faNps on Pen s it on e Rd w h o

■                                ---------------------
 A p p a r e n t l y some N o t t ^ F o r e s t fans had been                cheering when the disaster

 occurred,         not    knowing       the i^ll        extent      of what        had happened.         Other

officers       and myself           broke up tw^s^iriall fights,                     m oved on the Liverpool

 fans and       con ti nu ed to see a mb ul a nc e s              in a nd out.          Under     the extreme

 circu ms ta nc es        I my se lf     deci de d not to arrest anyone                      but to try and

 calm    then down.

We st ay ed        in P en i st o ne Rd till about 5 . 3 0 p m                 (1730),       at whi ch time      the

m a j o r i t y of the      crowd had c 1 e a r e d .           We we re then          re c a l 1ed   inside    the

ground,       to sit a g a in         in the N or th stand.               At    this time we          heard that

there we re 84            conf i rmed d e a d .

              We    sat    in the N or th S t a n d for about an hour and after a while we were

              g iven a de-brief           by a senior       officer.    By that    time we were           fully

              a ware      of what      had taken       place and   it was   obvious    that some         officers

              had gone        t h ro ug h an extreme       ordeal,   some were weeping          openly and

              their       uniforms      were    dishevelled.

              A bo u t 7 .00pm        (1900)   we were     stood down and w al k ed to the Tra f fi c

              d i v i s i o n at C l a yw h ee l s    Ln w here we had a bite     to eat and         r ecovered our

              Personnel         Carrier.       We then     returned to H a c k e n th r op e and went         off

              d uty at S . 0 0 p m      (2000).

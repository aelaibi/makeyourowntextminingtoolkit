           I am a single man and I live at the above address with my parents and

We had to catch the coach at Woodside Coach Depot, at 10 o ’clock.                    The

coach d i d n ’t leave the station until about half past ten and after

about ten minutes of our journey the driver announced that the coach

would be stopped by the Police,           on the motorway and checked for

alcohol.      I had two small bottles of labatts and although there were

other fans drinking     I didn't see any dru nkeness.

I don't know which route the coach took to get to Sheffield but I

don't     remember us being delayed at all by road works or any other

problems.      I do recall   that most of the journey was by motorway and as

we got off the motorway at a large island I saw a Police car and as we

passed this the coach slowed right down and I expected the coach to

stop and for us all to be searched far alcohol but we w e r e n ’t and

continued on.      As we made our way through Sheffield the traffic was

quite heavy but not too bad and the coach wasn't held up.                   I think I

saw one coach that had been stopped by the Police                in Sheffield but

apart from this I didn't notice much Police              presence.

The   coach parked in a designated coach park that was a fifteen walk

from the ground.

As we got off the coach we weren't checked by the Police, and we

d i d n ’t receive any direction or escort at all to the ground.                We got

off the coach at about       1 o'clock and walked towards the ground with

the main flow of fans.        We passed several        pubs that appeared closed

although     it was obvious that there were people inside them.                 I walked
                                                                                       PAGE      3
                                                                                       S1"/60

           with my four friends and we spent about three quarters of an hour

           looking for a chemists shop because my mate had a bad stomach,

           After we had f ound a chemists we made our way to the Leppings l/ane,

           entrance to the ground arriving at the entrance at about tworaclock.

           At the entrance there were small groups of people standing             Yn
           the road outside the large metal     gates,   with about eight Police

           Officers on foot watching them.      There were Police Officers on horses

           walking up and down Leppings Lane itself.        We broke off from,

           and          iecause they had seat tickets and went through thar large

           gates   into the area just before the tur nstiles.       WE had jh a    difficulty
S .c x e
           getting to the turnstiles and no problem getting throu/h them.               Inside

           the court yard between the turnstiles and the back a j / the stand there

           were    a few Police men standing searching the odd person,            but we did

           not get searched at all.

           As soon as we entered the ground,     we w/nt through the centre tunnel

           into the terracing.     There was no Poa ice or steward control at either

OTTywp     end of the tunnel and we went into' Pen 3 and took up a match

           viewing position near to the fro'nt of the terrace to the right of the

           centre fence.

           I have indicated this point as E;<h           with the                   At this

           time there was only one line of people in front of us before the

           front fence.

           We had no difficulty in finding this poi nt on the terrace as although

           there were a number of people already in the terrace we were able to

           get through the crowd easily.

           At about twenty past two I walked back up the terrace and back down

           the tunnel    to get something to eat.   Again I had no difficulty getting

           through the crowd on the terrace it was just like getting through the

           crowd on the Hop on a normal match day.        I went on my own

           and walked around the area at the back of the stand for about twenty
                                                                                   PAGE       4
                                                                                   S1760

          five mintues looking for something to eat and at one point I went up

          some steps onto some terracing that appeared to Jfefe full      in the left

          hand corner of the stand.        I eventually found/somewhere to buy some

          food and made my way back to,the       centre tun me1.   The area at the back

          of the stand was more crowded than beforaf by this time as people were

          coming into the ground but I d i d n ’t see any more Police or stewards

          and as I got to the tunnel again there was no Police or steward

          control at either end.

          Again I had no difficulty in getting along the tunnel and once on the

          terracing    I had no difficulty getting back to my mates at the front

          again it was 1ike a^tting through the average crowd on the k o p .         By

          this time the tarracing had filled up more but was not too bad.            I

          rejoined my nystes in near enough the same place as I had left them,

          this would i4ve been at about a quarter to three.                                   I

          Just befo/e the teams ran out onto the pitch there was a surge from

          the back/but we were able X o      push back and regain our original viewing

          pos i t iOTi just after the/teams had ran out onto the pitch there was a

          second more powerful ysurge from the back and this time were unable to

          push back at all.     /i   was crushed against the person in front with both
Pi TDtt
          of my arms    pi nneex across rny chest. My mate         a lad who was

          standing next to me and I all tried to push back together to make some

          room but we couldn’t move back at all.My two friends? at some stage,

          managed to work their way back wards

          through the crowd but I couldn’t move at all.

          As the crush went on I was forced between two people who were up

          against the fence and was wedged between these two.          I was able to

          move my arms at this stage and push myself off the front fence.            As I

          did this I looked down and saw what at first        I thought was one person

          lying on the floor face up.        I remember that this was a man of about

          thirty.     He was big in build,    he had dark brown hair and thats all        I

          can remember about him.          I remember that his eyes and mouth were open

          and that his face was a purple j c o lour.      Ther was no movement at all

          from him and at that time I ^nought that he had just passed out.I was

          pinned up against tjae feiyre for about ten minutes and I was
C/m
          aware of people c/fimbing over the fence onto the pitch I assisted a
fa HN S
CHOL      few people c 1 inmi ng over the fence by lifting them up once 1 had got

          my arms free,

          After ten minutes or so,         I was able to push back a bit more and as I

          did so I again looked down and saw that there was another body                   ^
                                                                    -------------- 7»'

          underneath the other man.          I could just see the side of a fan?',         I

          think   it was a fella.        I didn't see any of him other than Jlis face.As
  t   r
          time went on the crowd pushed back some more and thereywas enough
                       F V W S
          room for me to climb up onto and over the front fencj/. There were

          mostly fans on the fence with Police behind t h e m \ y I *was helped off                I

          the fence by two Police men.          As I climbed onto the fence    I saw a pile

          of bodies just to the right of wherjr I had been/standing           I d o n ’t
                                                   /
          remember any descriptions of a i y 'i nd iv id ua ls / I just remember the pile

          of bodies up against the waLt at the front of the front fe n c e .

          Once on the pitch I took >fold of a corner of one of the advertisement

CAT       boards that were being/used as stretchers and assisted with
ad® t r   transporting about s/x fans up to the corner of the ground by the

          Forest f a n s .   At m i s   time I was not aware that

          although I was yrery upset at this time.

          While   I was still on the pitch I d o n ’t know what time it was, a

          steward came up to me and said that I ’d better go back to my coach.                 I

          walked back to the terracing where we had been standing and saw that

          all of the fencing had been ripped away.          There were two girls from

          the ground staff standing         by this holding a large container of water.

          I helped them by carrying this through the gap in the fencing up the

          terracing and back through the tunnel where I gave it back to them and
                                                                          PAGE       6

made my way back to our coach.

As I said I have visited Hillsborough one? before and that was for
                                             /
last years F A Cup Semi Final.     On t h a y o c c a s i o n there seemed to be a

lot more Police action than this yeai

Although we w e r e n ’t checked for tickets on either occasion I know for

sure we checked last year than this,

I feel that there should have been better organisation of fans inside
                                                                          /
the ground with fans being made to stand in specific areas and/not

being allowed to all stand in one area.       Even though I visit/ed the

ground last year   I di d n ’t realise that you could get into/the

terracing from any other route other than through the cgfatre tunnel
                     C A T 0(£j£^CTICW    C5lCfW^>               _
and I d i d n ’t see any signs or Police Stewards telling 'Ti b otherwise.

I think that the gates in the fences are         inadequateVor   effective

evacuation of the terrace    in the case of a potential disaster.          These

need to be looked at and revised.

After the game had been stopped it seemed to me that the fans were the

only ones who knew what was going on.      There was no organisation of

the emergency services at all with everyone running around in circles

not knowing what to do.     Once I was on the pitch I just did my best to

help other fans while the emergency services stood around as if they

were waiting to be told what to do.

               Further to my statement made on 28th May 1989,                 I entered pen number
                                             M       <40                     ---
               three together with Philip DUGGAN at approximately g a r t e r             to three

               We made our way through the crowd towards the from; of the p e n . We

               took up a position at the front of the pen in the centre about three

               feet behind the front fence.           I was only there for a couple of miputes,

               when    I left Philip,       went back through the       crowd and bought a

               beef burgeiy;        I then went back into pen three and rejoined Phi yip at the
■-> G
               •Front of/the pen. By this time it would have been about seven minutes

        3      to three. The teams had not come out on the pitch at that stage. When

               I rejoined Philip he was          in a different     position to when I

               left him. Our new position was              left of where we were standing first,

               about ten feet from the dividing fence between pens three and four and

               about three feet behind the front fence.

                                                                                 SI760A

         We remained in this position until w ^ e v e n t u a l l y managed to get out of

         the pen and onto the pitch.     I remember that just before     leaving this

         pen, as we were making our way towards the gate,        seeing a broken crash

         barrier on the other side of the L e n about two or three feet behind

         the steps that we were standing |/n. The re was a pile of people at the

         front of the pen against the froi^t of the pen. This was

         the first time I became aware that a barrier had broken.         I first saw

         the broken barrier at about thirteen or fourteen minutes         past three.

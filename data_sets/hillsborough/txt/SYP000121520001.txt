POLICE SERGEANT 2777




HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION,             'D' GROUP




At 9-^5 am, Saturday 15 April 1989, I paraded at Hillsborough for briefing in

connection with semi-final Liverpool and Notts Forest.                        I was allocated my

duties    that being in charge of Serial No 63 allocated the call sign Tango

nine.      This    was   a mobile      serial and comprised of the following officers

Police Sergeant 2777 Johnson,              'FI', Police Constable 7^0 Rowbotham,           Driving

School,      Police Constable          3173 Kirk, Pros, Police Constable 390         Leach, Pros,

Police      Constable      19^0   Pattison,     U/Water Search         andPolice Constable     1691

Womack, Serious Crime Squad.

After the briefing by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, Superintendent Murray

and     Chief    Inspector     Beal,    and   crime    information     from   Detective   Sergeant

Charlesworth, I collected a personal radio, transit van keys and pack lunches

from the gymnasium.

I then returned to the North Stand where I was further briefed by my serial

Inspector, Inspector Wallace.              Our duties were:-

Phase 1 - Patrol         Hillsborough/Langsett         Road   paying     special   attention     to

                licensed premises.

Phase 2     - After meal at 3.15 pm, to patrol as before.

Phase 3 - Continue patrol.

I briefed my officers, we consumed our pack lunches and then commenced patrol

at approximately         10.15 am.       The driver of our transit was Police Constable

Rowbotham,       I was   the   front seat passenger and the remainder of the serial

were seated in the rear.

We patrolled Langsett Road to the Kelvin Flats travelling from Hillsborough

Corner, returned the same route,        turned left onto Holme Lane to the one way

system and then back along Holme Lane to Langsett Road.

It was    apparent that there were a large number of both Liverpool and Notts

Forest supporters      in the area.     They were in high spirits but presented no

problems at this stage.

I visited the following public houses in the course of our patrols:

1.         Freemasons, Walkley Lane.          Spoke to the landlord, M         r       H     e    was

            only allowing Liverpool supporters into his pub, he together with

            four or five barmen were remaining on the door at all times.                         There

            was no trouble and he was advised re drinkers standing outside.

2.         Queens Ground, Langsett Road.             At approximately 1.00 pm I entered

            these premises.       The pub was absolutely full of both Liverpool and

            Notts Forest supporters.          Most were      in high spirits but there was

            no trouble.       I estimate the pub contained approximately 250 people.

I also gave passing attention to George IV, Langsett Road, Burgoyne Arms and

Masons.    There were no supporters outside these premises.

A    general patrol of the area was made but no public order situations were

encountered.

At approximately 1.15 pm, my transit was directed to an incident at the Royal

Hotel,    Penistone Road,      opposite the dog stadium.

The   landlord had     asked the Police      to help him       clear    the pub because           some

damage    had been caused      inside. Other officers were             presentand there           were

approximately    100   fans    outside and    the    same   number     inside.There         was no

violence although most of the fans seemed in very high spirits and some were

drunk.     I am unable    to say which fans were            there but I got the impression

that they were Notts Forest supporters.




                                                                                   ^   3^
The fans were moved along and the pub emptied.              On the pavement outside were

a large      number    of bottles   and glasses,   many    of which were       broken.   Three

members of staff were directed to clear up this debris, which they began to

do whilst I was there.          We then resumed patrol.

At approximately 2.15 pm I was directed to assist              otherofficers at the Horse

and Jockey Public         House   on Wadsley Lane.     I there spoke     to Sergeant Miller

and it was decided        to close the pub.

Outside the pub were approximately 250 Liverpool               fans.    Most   appeared drunk

and   the    car   park was     strewn with bottles   and   glasses, manyof which were

broken.

The   fans were       in good humour and no animosity was directed at the Police.

With Sergeant         Miller,   I went into the pub,      explained by intentions to the

manager, who was in full agreement.

The juke box was turned off and I informed the fans in the pub that they had

ten minutes in which to finish their drinks.              The pub contained approximately

150 Liverpool fans who had obviously been drinking most of the day.

Myself and Police Sergeant Miller received no animosity and the fans were in

good humour.          These   same facts were given to the      fans outside      the pub and

four members of staff began collecting the bottles and glasses.

By 2.30 pm the pub was empty and the fans were escorted by me and Sergeant

Miller's      transit,    down Wadsley Lane    towards the ground.        We had also been

joined by two dog         handlers, one of whom was Police          Constable Twigg, although

they were not deployed.

We    then   transported a Police Constable with a prisoner             from the bottom of

Wadsley Lane to the Police Room.          I do not know details of either person.

At    approximately 2.50 pm we resumed patrol             but due   to very heavy traffic,

remained in Middlewood Road near to Wadsley Lane, monitoring the traffic and

fans.       At this time radio traffic was very busy.          I heard a request that the
match be delayed to allow fans into the ground.                        This request was refused.                I

do not know who requested or who refused.

I    can   recall    hearing   Superintendent            Marshall       request     on,     I    think,      four

occasions for the gates into Leppings Lane to be opened to relieve a crush of

fans.      Finally his request was granted.                At the same time I heard a Sergeant,

I think Sergeant Higgins of 'F' C and V, request a further gate to be opened.

This request was also granted.

We then made our way to Leppings Lane and my officers were de-bussed.                                       There

were hardly        any Police in this location and some fans had started to leave

the ground.

I    saw   several    casualties     being       given    first       aid    on   the   left    side    of    the

driveway     and     approximately    20    dead       people    on    the    right     hand    side    of    the

driveway.        It was at this      point that I realised the enormity of                       the problem

but     didn't   know what had       caused      it.      A     line of officers were deployed to

stand as a barrier or shield in front of the dead.                           I deployed my officers to

allow access for the ambulances and fire tenders which were now arriving.

The departing fans were growing in numbers and many showed and spoke hatred

to    the Police.       They   called      us    murdering       bastards         and blamed us        for    the

deaths.      Many had to be restrained by Police and their friends from attacking

Policemen.       However, some of the fans were blaming their own supporters.

Because of the hatred I felt and the build up of fans which were congregating

on Leppings Lane, I requested further assistance to control and disperse the

crowd.      At this time I was       unaware of the events inside the ground.

The     ambulances     could   not   cope       with the        number       of   injured      so I   put    four

injured fans in our transit and with Police Constable Rowbotham took them to

the Hallamshire Hospital.

I returned to Leppings Lane to try and locate the rest of my serial.                                        On my

return I saw that barriers and a green sheet had been erected in front of the
The public order situation had become calmer and I requested further duties.

My   transit and serial were deployed and we attended a few minor public order

situations      butthe    sheer    volume      of   traffic     and    pedestrians     impeded     our

mobility.

We   remained     on     patrol   until     9-00    pm   when   we    were   allowed   a   meal    and

eventually were stood down at 10.00 pm.

It   wasn't until about       7-30 pm that I discovered the large number of dead                   and

up   until   that      timethought    the      only      casualties    involved   were     those    at

Leppings Lane entrance.

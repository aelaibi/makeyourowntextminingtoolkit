HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


I thought I should let you know that in the next week or so I
should like you to reimburse the Football Association, from the
accounts of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry, the cost
of two tickets for the FA Cup Final Tie on 20 May.

I attach a copy of a letter which Lord Justice Taylor received
from the FA inviting him to attend the Cup Final as their guests.
He thought it would be inappropriate for him to accept
hospitality from the FA at this point, but said that he would
like to attend the Cup Final as a paying member of the public to
see for himself the organisation of this major event.  I have
therefore been in touch with them, and written to Mrs Smith at
the Association as enclosed, requesting them to send two tickets
which would then be reimbursed from the Inquiry1s funds.

When these tickets are received, my secretary, Mrs Humphries,
will ask you to reimburse the FA.   I would be grateful if this
could be done as soon as possible, and a record of it sent to me.
Lord Justice Taylor attaches considerable importance to it being
on the record that he has paid for these tickets from the Inquiry
so that it is clear that he has not received hospitality from the
FA. The point here is that the FA are one of the parties being
legally represented at his Inquiry.

              On     J5 A p r i l         1989       ( 1 5 0 4 8 9 ),    I was       on    duty       in    connection             with       the

              football              match       at    Hillsborough              between          Liverpool             and    Nottingham

              Forest.               I have       previously              submitted          my       recollection             concerning                the

              events           of    that       day       and    now     wish       to    clarify          matters       in    respect             of

              deceased              and    injured          person          I had        dealings          with.

              I    initially              entered          the       ground     at       about       3.15       pm   (1515)        and    was          posted

              on     the       pitch       in    front          of    the    North        Stand.           I had       been    there          a    couple

              of     minutes          when       I realised              the    seriousness                of    the    incident          and          I then

              went        towards          the       goal       at    the    Leppings           Ln    end.

              As     I approached                I saw          that     there       were       spectators             lying/on          the       pitch

              all        over       the    goal       area.          Many      of    them       were       beini       attended          to       by    police

              officers              and    other          fans.         There       is    one    perso^          lftVparticular               that       I am

 ( P ^ i k         yeaj^s    of       age-< he         was       stocky          and    had       a       fat       face.        He       had      short       hair

q j J }A           am    sure        he    was       wearing          a    football          shirt          but       I *m      not       sure      what       colour

                   it    was.         I cannot             remember             any    other          details.                 The       mans      face       was

                   purple        and       his       tongue          was    puffed          out       of    his       mouth.              I think         he    was

                   dead.

                   Together           with       3    or    4    football             supporters                I    carried             the      man    on    the

                   hoarding           across          the       pitch       between          the          Hop       and    the       North         Stand.           We

                   went     up       the    slope          turned          left       and    placed             him       on    the       floor         adjacent          to

                   the    rear        of    the       North Stand               before       you          get        to     the       p o l i c e room.             There

                   were     already             several          bodies          on    the floor.I              immediately                         returned             to

                   the    pitch           and    had       no    more      dealings           with          the           body.

                   Whilst        I    had       dealings with               other       deceasedpersonsand                               injured               persons

drink       at a       pub f u r t h e r        away       from       the    ground          using        a

91    bus,       I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r          the     name      of    the       pub.         There        were         other

supporters             in t h e r e        drinking,            but,       there       was     no    drunkeness

I had a          couple         of     pints      a n d at       about       2.10       pm t o g e t h e r         with

walked       back       to     the      ground        reaching             there       at    about        2.40       pm.

On    the    way       to     the      ground        I received             no P o l i c e         direction             or    escort        and

saw    no    drunkeness                violence        or       disorder.

O n m y ar r ival            at      the     t u r n s t iles     therey^ere                only about             12     people

outside          the    North Stand               t u r n s t i l^esya n d        I had        no    difficulty                entering

the    ground          or     finding         which        turnstiles             to    use.

As    I went       throuh            I showed my             ticket         but     it w a s n ’t t a k e n              from     me.         I

have    subsequently                   left     my    ticket          on    the     terracing             at A n f i e l d as            a

mark    of       respect          to    those        who     died.

I had       no    difficulty               finding         my    seat       and     t oo k up m y          s eat         in the       front

row a l m o s t        on the          halfway        line       at a b o u t       2 . 5 0 pen.

I immediately                saw       that     the    terraced             area       behind        the       goals          seemed

excessively             crowded whereas                    the    other          parts a p p e a r e d           virtually            em pty,

but    I w a s n ’t a w a r e           of a n y t h i n g       untoward.

I saw some             people          climbing        out       of    that       area        j u s t a f t e r the            players

came    on but          didn't          think        t hat      was    unusual          but        just       after       the     match           had

started          their       numbers          increased and                 then       I saw a man walk                       past    us

whose       left       arm was          badly        broken       and       it w a s        then     tha^/ I r e a l i s e d             th at

something          seriods             was    happening.

Three       of    my    yriepds            then      came       past                                 he       l i v es    in

                Sergeant                came          and       helped       us.

                We       took          the       hoardings             back       Onto       the    pitch and          put a         dead     body          on    it

TO              Tms           person was                   also    a male             with    shortish          brown       hair,       he w a s           in his

                I helped                carry          him       only a short                distance          because       there          were       so m a n y

                other             fans       holding             the    board          I decided          to    go    back       and    help more.

I again          saw                                who       with       others,             was    putting          a man         on a       boar d ,

he a s k e d      for       help       so     I joined             in.        We       put    the       man    on    the     board and

carried          him across             the        pitch.           Looking             back       he was        obviously            dead         but

I was       n ear      his       head and           talked          to     him         telling          h i m he w a s a l r e a d y a n d

would       be OK.

This       mafn I w o u l d        describe              as    in his             early       thirties,             very well            built

hi</ h air        waflf $         k bro w n ,           he    had a        round         face.           I think          he w a s       wearing
                                                                         C-
a/blue          top/   m il ft c4n ’t be c e r t a i n of t h a t , but he w a s w e a r i n g b l u e

/|eans.          His       whole       face        seemed          bloated,             his       eyes    were       s hut     but       appeared

to    be    bulging.

When       we    put       him    on    the        board       he w a s           lying       on    the       pitch       j us t    on    the       six

yard       line       to    the    right           of    the       goals          as    you       look    at     that      end.

We w e r e       b e ing     helped          by a P o l i c e            Officer             to    carry       this       man,      I at       one

time       I started             shouting           at       people        blocking               our    way and          this      officer

told       me    to    calm       down       I ’d be a l r i g h t .

We    took       the       body    to       the     far       e n d of      the         pitch and             put    him w i t h         the

other.

I again          went       down       to    the        Leppings           Lane         end,       but    there       were         no m o r e

bodies          I could          see a n d         I c o u l d n ’t see                anything          else       I could         do.        I

must       have       stood around                 for       some    considerable                   time,        trying        to     see

anyone          I knew.

The    only       one       I saw was                                      all         I know       is th at         he    lives         in

                       He    told       me     that          Hewie       had       been       carried away                on a      stretcher.

I e ve nt ua ly went               to       th e    M a n a g e r ’s dug               out a n d        sat    there       for      a while,

at    one       time       being       given        a    cup of w a t e r ,              I remember              the m a t c h       being

called          off    but       for    th e       l ife      of    me     Ic a n ' t        remember          how    I left              the

d o n ’t k n o w w h a t          time       it was.

At    no    time       did       I see       anything              t hat      I        consider          to    be a c r i m i n a l       offence

                    I am a single ma n an d               I live at the above address and                        I am     c u rrently a

                    On Saturday            15th April       1989     <150489),        I went     to the FA Cup Semi               Final

                    m at ch at H i l l s b o r o u g h    b et w e e n L i v erpool     and Notts Forest.                 I am

                    a Li v e r p o o l     supporter.

                    I brought a ticket               for the game          from a friend who               had got      it from

                    Anf i eld.         I paid £ 6 . 0 0 for         it and    it was      for the       standing a rea           in

                    L e pp in gs Lane.

                    I t ra ve l l e d to the games, with                        and                    a nd

                                                                   and three      others     of who        I only know by their

                    first     names.         We   t r av el le d    in two    cars,     leaving       from Liveprool             at

                    a bout 8 .30 am on the S at u r d a y morning.

                       am   not    sure what         route     it was      that we      took    to Sheffield,            but we were

                                                                                                                          S2321

              not    subject       of any traf f i c         delays and we did not stop any where                            en

              route       to Sheffield.          We    eventually arrived                 in S h e f f i e l d at about        1.30

              pm or a       little earlier.             We      parked our        cars       in the W a d s l e y Bridge

              area,       I'm not e xa c t l y sure where.

              On the way to S h e f f i e l d          prior       to us reaching             the ground,       I can say

              that     I didn't see a n y b o d y          drinking at all and                 I can also       say    I didn't

              w i t ne ss any fighting,              disorder,       or d r u n k e n e s s    between    parking        the       cars

              and    get ting      to the ground.

              6 n the way to the g r o un d             I didn't          see    or    receive any       police       d i rections

              and only saw Police O ff i c e r s                outside         the    entrance       to the ground          in

              L e p p i n g s Lane        itself w hi ch was at about                 1.45    pm.

S - O . B .   W h e n we a rr i v e d at the e n t rance             to the ground,                there were queues           up to

              the    t ur n s t i l e s    but not    in an y      real    sort       of order.        Outside     the

              entrance         there about       two    or three Police O f f i c e r s               on h o rseback who

              were m a k i n g      people     get    into the ground,                not a l l o w i n g anyone      to stand
   frT
              a bout      or walk a r o u n d .       We a t t e m p t e d to walk away from the e n t r a n c e at
t_|l_
              this     stage      to go for a walk around,                  but as we          tried to we were           ushered

              into     the entrances           by these Police Officers.

              T here were         other Po l i c e O f f i c e r s at the             entrance,       and these were           on

              foot     stood      by the      large    iron gates an d the                turnstiles.       There were              two

              at    the    turnstiles         who were       s e a rching       people,       although    I didn't        get

              searched.

              I didn't         see any stewards            at    this     point a n d        I can't    recall     any others

              giving       directions a n yw he re           in the ground.              We didn't       have any

              difficulty          in finding         the entrance          to the       ground as       I was with

              any d if fi c u l t y       in e n t ering     the    ground,       no more          than I w ould expect,             it

              had only took us a bout                 ten or fifteen m i n u t e s             to get    into    the ground.

              I e nt e r e d    the ground       t hr o u g h the t u rnstiles               and    I did hand my ticket

O nce    inside          the gr o u n d    I didn ' t v s e e any    signs     directing us where to go

to s t a n d , a l t h o u g h      I   was    f o llowing                        who knew where        to go

because        he had been to th ff ground before and knew where                              to go.     He

k new    that there w ou l d                   a crush     in the    pens     in front    of the goal         so

we went and stood                 i n /pen 6 near        to the front         by the dividing       pen 5.

We all       stood togetlner              in this    pen and didn't           use the tunnel      under the

stands       to    pens 3 /and 4 also              I didn't      see a n y Police       or stewards      at the

entra n c e       to the      tunnel       at this time.

Between        us getting           into      the gr o u n d and getting          to Pen 6 I can say I

didn't       see any disorder,                 or fighting,       the m o o d was as normal         between

the     fans.       Also       I didn't        see anyone      d r i nking    inside    the ground,      no one

seems      to bother any more                  because     they will       oXly be taken off you          in

any     case.

It was about 2 .05                pm by the        time we / e a c h e d     our standing      position,       and

I could see that                the two        centre    p^ns were       packed full      and as time went

these      two     pens were gett i n g mare and more                    condensed.       You see      that    in

our side          of the      terrace         and/the    other    side     that there were       very    few

people       in them and t he re / w a s            plenty of       room.      We were awa y from these

pens and at this                time wasn't         involved      in any      crowd    crush at all.

I. am    now aware           that       in Pen 3 a crush barrier              broke,    but   I didn't    see

it break and was                not     near    it whe n     it did.

At about 3 pm I could see                       people     getting     crushed against         the side

fencing        which divides              pens 4 and 5.          There     were    people at this stage

trying       to climb out and get                 into     pen 5, and        in fact    one of my friends

         climbed          into the small          pen to help        people       climb out.     We didn't

r eally know what was                   going    on until              climbed      back over and was

crying and he said that                       he had seen someone            who was   dead.     It was       then
                                                                                                           PAGE           4
                                                                                                           S2321

we    r e a l s i e d that    there was         s o mething w rong and that there were                     other

people       crying     in the       crush.

We    could also        see that        the     crowd was       surging        forward and that          people

were     being       forced f or wa rd an d out to the sides.                         There were       fans who

were     climbing       over     other     peoples       heads        in an effort       to get out.

I c a n ’t say when the             surge       o c c u r r e d but   it was     only a short          time after

the game       had started.             I can't       really say why this               large    surge

o c c u r r e d other    than the         crowd seemed to              push from the back of the

terrace.

After     the surge          had o c c u r r e d    I could also         see    people    climbing       over     the

fence at the front               onto     the      pitch.     Also      prior    to the surge          I saw

P o l i c e Officers         pushing      people      back     into     the    pens,    because       I think

they thought           it was      going      to be anot h e r         pitch    invasion.        It was after

the    surge     that    they began to help                 people      out and onto the           pitch.

Whilst       I was stood         in Pen 6 I didn't w i t n e s s any of the deaths                         that

o c c u r r e d only a man who was                 sat onthe      terrace       steps who was          holding

his    head    in his hands.              It was at this              point    that            came    back    over

the    fence and told us that                   he had seen someone who was                    dead.

At    this    stage myself          and                          and                       climbed over           the

f ence     into the small            pen 5 an d w a l k e d down to the open gate at the

bottom.        When we got           to the gate         there was a P o l i c e m a n standing               there

a n d he a sk e d us         not to     come       onto the     pitch a n d to get         back       into the

stands.        We told him that we were                     student      nurses and       could we help.

He a p p e a r e d    confused and         not      knowing what was            going    on.     He e v e n t u a l l y

told us to follow him and we got                         into the        pitch and started to follow,

but    he just w a n d e r e d off.

At    this    time     I lost      contact with                  and     I could see a line of bodies

that were        lined up a long           the goal         line,     most     of them had jumpers

pulled up over their                 faces and were           blue.       I took       it that    these

people were           dead as      no one was         taking an y notice              of them or helping

       them,     bo    I w on d e r e d   off    up the       pitch.        In a n y    case there was            no way

       yo u    could get to them to give m o u t h to m o u t h                        because     they were        so

       close     together.          As    I w an d e r e d up the        pitch      I met up with                       and we

       e x c h a n g e d a few words.            I then went          over to a crowd of about                    six

       people who were            s t a nding a r o u n d someone            over      by the North S t a n d           side,

       I c a n ’t say exac t l y w he re           it was       other       than    it was     towards       the    side

       o uts i d e    the   18 yar d      box.

       I could a man           lying      on the floor and              could see that he had a plastic

       airway        tube   in his mouth.              One    of these       people were giving him heart

       m a s s a g e and another          giving m outh         to mouth.           There were        the    others who

       were     s h o uting at him to            come    round.         I asked        if they were alri g h t with

       him and        if they were         tired or not,             he said that         he was okay so            I left

       them alone.

       I w o u l d describe         the m a n on the gorund as,                    30 years       old,   short      light

       b rown hair,         plump build,          I c o u l d n ’t say what            he was wearing.

       I am     not    sure    if this man         lived or not,             but    he was     g r a d u a l l y turning

       blue a n d he was          being     sick a n d was           not breathing.

       I could then see that                they were          coping as         best    they could an d           I then

       w a n d e r e d about     that     side    of the       pitch for a few minutes.

Qy^~   ^      this    point there were more                  fans    on the      pitch and were          carrying

       people        up the    pitch on m a ke sh if t          s tretchers         from a d v e r t i s i n g    hoardings,
no
       I d i d n ’t help anyone            else and          I made my wa y         back to the terrace and

       went an d stood back               in pen 6 w here            I o r i g i n a l l y was.     Everyone        else

       was     back    there apart         from              and             .     We sat    down and talked

       amongst        us and by this            time    everyone       se e m e d to have         been taken away.

       I could see that             the fence at the                front    had been broken t h r o u g h or

       o p e n e d up.

       We s t o p p e d where we were             until we were all                back together an d heard a

       loud speaker a n n o u n c e m e n t        telling          us to    leave      by one of the            exits,    1

       c a n ’t say what        time      this was,

              We    left      the ground and mads                     our wa y back          to the        cars,   and the        people

              from S h e f f i e l d were a s k in g                 us    if we w a n t e d      to use the        phone,    which        I

              did.      We e ve nt u a l l y got               back       to the    cars after           teleph o n i n g   our

              f am i l i e s and made            our wa y back to Liverpool.

              T h r o u g h out      the w h o l e       of     the day and the              incident         I didn't a n y t h i n g

              happen,         w h i ch    I consider            to be        a criminal           offence.

              Going      back      to before           the      game       had b egan I believe               that one       of the

              factors         that       c on tr i b u t e d    towards        the deaths          that     occurred was the             way

              the P o l ic e       h an d l e d the       crowd outside               the turnstiles.

C A T         The P o l i c e m a n on h or se b a c k were                  herding       people        into the ground,            not

              form i n g      people        into an y sort                of queues.         The       other officers who were

Pcr\_-        on foot were               not help i n g w i t h the               crowd    control         they were        stood about

              se a r c h i n g    people.

              It was       obvious          that     there were             crowds      still      trying        to get     into the

              g round and the start                    of the game sh o u l d have                     been d e l a y e d , so as     to

              give     time       to get these             people          inside.        They have have delayed games

              before       this      to get        people        in.

              I went       to the         replay at Old T r a f fo rd and this sho u l d have                               been the

              wa y H i l l s b o r o u g h      should have               been handled.

              A lso    there was a break                  down        in c o m m u n i c a t i o n s    between Police and

              S t e w ar ds      inside the go r u n d to allow others                            to direct        fans     into the

              w ings w here          there was           plenty of           room and        no    crush and this            could have

              a v o i d e d any      crush that                happened.

              A no th er      obvious         reason           was    the a l l o c a t i o n of the ground. Liv e r p o o l

              should have            been given                the Kop end of the ground.

              A fter     the disaster              had         occurred       I believe there was                 noneed      for    the

              Police       cordons w hi c h were                 set up on the             pitch,        certainly not the            one

              w h i c h was       put along          the N or t h Stand,             a g a i n a b r eakdown         in

              The     tanrioy system should also                           have    been used to            let    people    know

             e xa c t l y what was going        on.

             It was       incredible     the wa y the fans          reacted    in the way they did a n d         I

             and     react      in the way the      fans    did.

             I   would      like to add that        I think       there s h o u l d be a review of the

             d e s ig n of the grounds,         e sp ec ia ll y at the     entrance      to the L e p pings Lane

             w h ic h    is far too small      a n d gives a funnel           type   effect.

             Also       there    should be a    look at the fencing            so    if it has to stay there

             is sh o u l d be of the type           that    can    collapse    easily.

             There       should have     been more     cornmuni ct ion from the delays            fans are

             s u b j e c t e d to,   so that   it   is known that fans are going               to ar r i v e at the

             g r o un d at      the same time.

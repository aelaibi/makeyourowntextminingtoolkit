    You wrote on 17 April to Mr Moynihan enclosing a 4 page
report about the disaster at Hillsborough from a Liverpool
Councillor, Mr Peter Millea.                   Mr Moynihan will be responding on
the points about the Football Spectators Bill, but the
correspondence has been forwarded to the Home Office to respond
I   the other points made.

      As you know, an Inquiry under the Chairmanship of Lord
Justice Taylor has been formed to investigate the events of
Hillsborough and to make recommendations. I have therefore
forwarded yours and your constituent's correspondence to
Mr R Whalley, Secretary to the Inquiry, who can be contacted at
this address.

                        I enclose correspondence to Colin Moynihan dated 17 April from
                        David Al t o n MP concerning the tragedy at Hillesborough and
                        enclosing a report from his constituent who witnessed the events,
                        requesting that these views be passed on to the Inquiry Team.

                        Since this subject is the responsibility of the Home Office, I
                        would be grateful if your Department could respond to Mr Alton
                        direct on this issue.

                        However, the postcards concerning the Football Spectators Bill,
                        which are also mentioned in Mr Alton's letter, have been retained
                        by DOE and Mr Moynihan will respond on this matter.

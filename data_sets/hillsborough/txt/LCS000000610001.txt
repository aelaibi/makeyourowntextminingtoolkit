    Dear

    I am writing to express both my own and Sunderland Social
    Services appreciation of the time that you and other staff
    made available for me when I visited the Centre last Monday.
    It certainly was a most instructive and illuminating time
    and will in all honesty be most helpful in helping to
    concentrate our minds on the pre-planning that is required'
    in anticipation of any disaster i.ij this area.-  •: -

    You will .see that I have sent a copy of this letter to your
    Director because he too was most cooperative and I think
    exemplified what I have always respected and that is
    Liverpool,'s generosity no m a t t e r what pressures they are
    under at the time.

    Once aqainj, many thanks.

    Yours             cerely

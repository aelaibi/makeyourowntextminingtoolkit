           I am a single man and I have lived at the above address for the past

           two years.      I was made redundant from Corporation employment             last

           October and since that date I ’ve been unemployed,



           I have supported Liverpool Football Club from the age of nine years

           and since that time I have been to most of the home and away games and

           I would say that I have been to about eighty per cent of the football

           grounds in Britain.         I would say   that at about 90 per cent of the

           matches    I ’ve been to, throughout my life I have stood on the

      K    terracing.      I have been to Hillsborough Football           stadium on about

           twenty occasions,      three of which being          in the last twelve months, and

           at most of these I have stood in the Leppings Ln terracing and have

           not experienced any problems with crowd crush in that area before the
                                                                                                  S1111

              F.A. Cup semi final on Saturday 15th April              1989 <150489).   I obtained a

              ticket to the Leppings Ln terracing off a friend of mine,
                     f'J'V
                           who is a season ticket holder and obtained the ticket

                   Fom Liverpool Football   club.     I paid        the face value of six pounds            t

                         Having obtained    the ticket,         I     made arrangements with four

              friends,     including          to travel to the        ground in a private         car

              belonging to a friend who I only know as                      The   other two men I
                               fS\~               rJ^~
              only know as        and                               I d o n ’t know any of these

              mens addresses off hand.        Although I d o n ’t socialise with these men

              very often,     I have known them for about thirty years.

              We arranged to meet in Shaw St. Liverpool at around 11 o ’clock on the

              Saturday morning.        Once we had all met up we left Liverpool          straight

              away to go to Sheffield.        I d o n ’t     know which route we took to get to

              Sheffield,     and we d i d n ’t stop at all between Liverpool and

              Sheffield,     except in Manchester we were held up for short periods of

               time because of road works.Once         inside Sheffield we        made our way to a

              side street about twenty minutes walk from the ground to park.                       At no

              time while we were driving through Sheffield did I see any signs or

              Police direction to the ground or parking areas.                I did see groups of

              Police either in cars or riot vans parked outside every pub on the

              route to the ground which were all closed even though it was                   in

              normal     licencing hours.

              We parked the car in the side road at about two o'clock and ij

              »hat area I saw no Police at all             in that area there were y f r y    few fans

         /    about and very little traffic. Having parked the car we'went                   into

              a pub that was only about thirty yards from where we had parked.                          I

              d o n ’t remember the name of the pub but I know that/[ have been there

              on previous visits to Hillsborough.              The pub was packed and I w*tfld

              say eighty per cent of the people in there were Liverpo<tol fans going
                                                                               goi

-p y J       H o    the match.   I recognised a lot of faces in the pub from the matches
                                                                                    PAGE     3
                                                                                    S1111

             although I don't know them by names.       The atmosphere in the pub was

             great,   everybody was excited,   friendly and good humoured as you would

             expect for a cup semi final.      There was no rowdiness or disorder and

             no drunkeness at all.

             We had two drinks in the pub and left there at about twenty past two.

             We were in no rush to get to the ground because we thought that seeing

             as it was an all ticket match and we got tickets.         We would have no

             difficulty in getting into the ground especially seeing as I've had no

             problems before at Hillsborough.

             By this time the five of us who had travelled together had met up with

^            another group of five men who had travelled from Liverpool and who I

             know.    All ten of us left the pub and waited at a bus stop directly

             opposite the ground.     After only a couple of minutes a local service

             bus arrived and we all got on.      The bus journey was less than ten

             minutes and dropped us off at the end of Leppings Ln on Middlewood Rd,

             only a minute walk from the ground if that.        The mood on the bus was

             one of excitment again, with no disorder at all,        I saw no people on

             the bus or on the road dryfking at all.

             We received no Police direction or escort at all on our way to the

             ground and I didn't s e / any Police presence right upjuntil I ireactyBi

             We arrived at the entrance to the ground,       in the road that is at about

             twenty past to half past two.

             I knew again from previous visits to the ground,       which way I had to go

             to get to the turnstiles    leading to the terracing.     I didn't   look for

             any signs because of this and I saw rya Police or Stewards at all

             directing   people to turnstiles.

             On reaching the area immediatelv JSefore the turnstiles       I saw just one

             solid mass of people waiting to get i n .     The two mounted officers were

       in amongst the crowd shouting for the crowd to push back.           There was

       no way for the fans to push back because of the number of fans packed

       into that area.

       Our main intention was to get into the ground to see the match so we

       joined the mass of people and waited to get to the turnstiles.           Once

       inside the crowd I had no control whatsoever over where I went,          I just

       had to go where the sway of the crowd took me.          My arms were pinned to

       my sides by the force of the crowd and I could feel myself being

       crushed from the front and back and I had some difficulty in breathing

       because of the pressure.         As I have said I am used to going to

       football matches and beincpin amongst        large crowds and I accept that

     ^^jetting squashed t o g e t h ^   is part of this,   however in this crowd the

       crush was greater thaiv I have ever experienced and I felt very scared

       as the crush was so u n u s u a l.   I cannot put into words how bad and

       horrifying   it was.

       The crowd around me were becoming more and more panicked and

       appealed to the Police on the horses to open the gate to relieve the

       crush.    I remember thinking that had I been able to get away from

       the crush,   even if it meant missing the game and going straight home,

       I would have done so quite happily..

       With the crush of the crowd I was/forced out to the right and I

       remember being only about four / o r     five feet away from a large gre^h '

       coloured metal gate that I h a p e since found out is known a s gajre C

       when I saw it open obviously from the inside and a massive \jmrge of
C_
       people took me through the the open gate.           I had no idea whatsoever

       where to go and had to go with the crowd because of the crush around

       me.   I can't say whether or not there were any signs directing         people
                                                                                      PAGE        5

            as were big six foot bodies and small       children alike.

            The crowd was travelling at a fast walking pace and 1 still had my

            arms pinned to my sides and I was unable t y m o v ee them    at a
                                                                  t h e m al all.

            terracing anyway. The passage along the tunnel was a continuous

            fast walking pace wih no hold ups at all.        When we reached the end of

            the tunnel onto the terracing      I still h|W no control at all where            I

            was going and was forced to the right / f the centre fence and into

            the area that I now know to be Pen 3 m       was forced down the terracing

            and all the time I was aware of people falling down and screaming out

            for the crush to stop but there was nothing y/u could do about            it.

            I was forced forwards and reached a point oyrly feet away from the

              ont fencing when I lost my footing and t4ll d o w n .       I have marked the

            appropriate   point where I fell on the grid with the letter A (Exh

                 1).   Because of the pandemonium I d i d n ’tX-ealise at first that I

            had gone down,   I thought I had gone blind, A ir    something.    Once   I

            realised what had happened I found m y s e l y lying on my front on the

            terracing with people walking and standing on me and people even using

            me as a spring board to jump on me and on the people in front I have

            no idea how long I was on the floor or whether        I last conciousness at

            any time   I was in terrible pain but some how I w a s n ’t fully aware of

            that at the time.     I honestly thought at that time that I was going to

            die and resigned myself to that fact.

            Fortunately I was helped up by two men who I have no idea who they are

              lthough I hope one day I will find out so that I can thank them for,
\       C\9 ^ lthou9h 1 h
                       saving my life. I vaguely remember sj*eing a Policeman who
    W   g   1 ieiieve’ s
     '/tA ' was on the o ther side of the

    ^       front fencing kicking the front fence in^tnd then I was pushed through

            the gap in the fence and that is the lVdret I remember.

PCs      %A         the organisation of the FA Cup Semi final on that day was the

              worst I have seen \ / o m the F .A. all the way down to the m a t c h s t e w a r d s

              in the ground.

              I blame the F .A. for the ticket allocation. Liverpool have a weekly

              home support of over 39,000 fans compared to Nottingham Forest

              support of 20,000 fans.       Surely this being/the worse it makes sense to

              give the Liverpool     fans a greater number of tickets and the more

              spacious terracing,     that is the Spiosi Kop.       I blame Sheffield

              Wednesday F.C.     for the ground desygn and layout.          As I have said

              there are no signs telling       peoples where to go to get to the

              terracing and everybody is bound to go through the centre tunnel               into

*   the centre pen.      Again,   having got inside the centre pen the design

    of the ground prevents fans from spreading across the terracing

    because of the fences between the individual sections.            The fences at

    the front of the terracing I don't agree with anyway,           but if they are

    in place then the gates should be a lot bigger than they are or

    preferably the fencing itself should be hinged to allow easy escape.

    My impression of the Police operation was that the officers were more

    interested in protecting       property,   that is the pubs, that they seemed

    to be guarding,      thats controlling and taking care of the fans.        I

    feel that the Chief Constable is the man responsible for any Police

    action and he is the one who should take responsibility.            Having been

    in the crush outside the ground I think that the Policeman who opened

    the gate had no option.        Having said this I feel that the crush

    should never have been allowed to develop in the first place and

    despite all of this I Jfc'nought that when the gate had been opened the

    fans should have baen showed where to go to, the fact that the

    L i v erpool   fans vy&re not organised by the Police      indicated that on the

    day the Liverpool      fans were looked upon as being not worth the effort.

    I did not see one match Steward all day.         J if   stewards are used by

    clubs then surely they should assist witp         organising the fans but on

    that day they weren't to be seen.

    I am still      in possession of the complete ticket for the match although

    my solicitor has custody of it at this time.

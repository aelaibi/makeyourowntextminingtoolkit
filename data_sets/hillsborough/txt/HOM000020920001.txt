      Dear Mr Jones

      With reference to your letter J M J / D H / 16/6/89, on the subject of the
      H i l l s b o r o u g h Dis as te r Irvjiry, I wou ld state that firstly I have
      be en involve d with my comp an y on i n specting and testing crush
      barriers on football gr ounds since shor t l y after the Ibrox
      Disaster.

      In it ially the requirements in S c o tland at least were to ensure that
      the barr iers were in a safe state to c o m p l y with insurance
      requirements.            The W h e a t l e y report fol l o w i n g the Ibrox disaster
      re c o m m e n d e d that crush ba rriers shoul d have some form of inspection
      and testi ng appl ie d and we were invol ve d in the very early days with
      d i s c u s s i o n s with the clubs, the insurance compa ni es and then the
      Local Authorities.

      We p r o d u c e d our s p e c i f i c a t i o n i dentified as St anding Instruction
      N um be r 30, the second issue dated J a n u a r y 1986 is enclo se d with this
      report.

      We were theref or e i n specting and tes ti ng crush barriers and
      a s s o c i a t e d equipment on football gr ounds be fore the issue of the
      first G r e e n Boo k in 1973.

      We have alway s made the assu m p t i o n that this is a guide to safety at
      s p o r t s g r o u n d s and should not be taken as a specification.

     cotland including both the in te rn ational gr ounds and the major it y
    of the premier div is io n and first d i v ision grounds.

    T he testing is carried out after discu s s i o n wit h either the
    engineers involved, the mana ge me nt or di re ctors of the football                             club
   |and v e r y often with the Local Au t h o r i t y officials.

    firstly to carry out a de tailed visual e x a m i n a t i o n using our
    fence/wall                  SkiU    ^   *Valua te   • • < * - b a r r i e r , handrail   or perimeter


    I am certain          that    this part of our inspe c t i o n is by far the most
    important.

   The m e chanical test is appl ie d to the ba rriers by loading the
   upright which is the support for the horizontal.             This load is
              d .a c c o r d i n « lh* distanc e betw ee n the uprights, and the
   full load is applied to any upright w hich is supported on either
   8 1d e ,


   We then            apply a load to the centre of the horizontal.     This load is
   applied            at 2 points, 2 feet apart and after co ns id erable discussion,
   c a l c u l a t i o n and in man y cases, dispute wit h engineers, architects
   and Local Aut h o r i t y officials, it is g e nerally agreed that the load
   the upright            9 c e n t r ® of the horiz on ta l      is 0.7 x the load applied            to


   As the         load is applie d we me asure           the deflection.

   If the specified load is ap plied with less than one inch (25mm)
   deflection, either to the upright or to the horizontal, then the
   ba rrier will be accepted.

    If the spe cified load has not been ap plied with 2 inches                     (50am)
    deflection, then the barr ie r will be_rejected.

    Once the specif ie d load has been ap plied and held for the time
    r e q u i r e d in the Gree n Book, that is 5 minutes, then the load is
    re l e a s e d and the re covery is measured.

    If more than 0.25 inches (8mm)                 permanent d e flection remains then       the
    ba rrier will be rejected.

  From this you will see that we do not agree with parag ra ph 5 of
  An nex C in that as a me ta ll urgist, in my opinion, any failure of a
  barrier to fully recover once the load has been appli ed is a
^p^ailure .

   We w o u l d invest ig at e the reaso n for failure and give a report on
   what in our op inion is the cause of the problem,         This can be either
   that the steel or metal up right or hori zo nt al deflects because it is
   taken above the yield stre ng th and thus for all practical purposes
   is a failure.       It can very oft en however, be that the fo undation is
   weak and the barrier will therefore fail by a cantilever action.
   With reinforced concret e        barriers, failure will often occur because
   the r e infor ced steel has corrode d re ducing the ducti li ty of the
   barrier.

   We have no doubt that thj crush barriers of football grounds have
   evol v e d over the years with, in many cases, a minim um of technology
   and it is my op inion that the Green Book is a guide to safety and
   cannot be accepted as a specification.

   It w ould be difficult, if not impossible, to produce a document in
   the form of a British St andard which would sp ec ificy the testing to
   be c a r r i e d out to e x i s t i n g grounds w hich v ary considerably in
   design, cons t r u c t i o n mate ri al and type of foundation.

   I beli e v e that we           have the c a pability of i n t e r preting the Green Book
   and in d i s c u s s i o n     wit h the officials of the clubs and the Local
   Au thorities , have            a c h i e v e d a sa ti sf actory comp ro mi se and to date we
   have c o n s i d e r a b l e   h i s t o r y of success.

   With ref e r e n c e to your sec on d question, we have no ex pertise on the
   c a p a c i t y of grou nd s but be lieve that if you discuss the situation
   with Mr Peter H o w a t t , S t r a t h c l y d e Regio na l Council, India Street,
   G l a s g o w (telephone 041 -2 04 -2 90 0) , he will be able to help.        He has a

    1          IN TR OD UCTION

               The pur po se of this St anding In struction is to detail the method
               u se d by ROSS Ma terials T e c h n o l o g y for the e xamination and

   •           testing of crush barriers, pe rimeter walls and fences, and
               a s s o c i a t e d handr ai ls in Sports Grounds.     This St anding
               I n s t r uc tion should be read in co nj unction with the
               R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s laid down in the current Gre en Book "Standard on
               Sa f e t y in Sprots Grounds".


    2          M a r k i n g & Id entification

               It is of vital importance that to av oid c o nfusion and to rapidly
               identi fy the barriers, the same sy stem of barrier mark in g is
               a dop t e d on all grounds.    It may be that prior drawi ng s have
               alre a d y been pro du ce d with nu mbers and that we m a y in some cases
               be requi re d to examine and to test these.

                If no n u m b e r i n g system has been arra ng ed                    then the following
                syste m should be adopted.


    2:1         Ground

                The areas on the gr ound should be cl early identified.    That is,
                always sta nd in g in the centre of the pitch and fa cing one of the
                Stands, the areas should then be nomi na te d as the following:


                Area           (1)          The left hand side.
                A rea          (2)          The area behind.
                Area           (3)          The area to the right         hand.


                 In ce rtain circumstances some natural divi si on s exist which may
                 then a l l o w some d e viation from this procedure.         That is, a
                 d i v i d i n g ra iling beh in d may n ecessitate that instead of Area (2)
                 that this area is n o minated            as Areas (2 and 3)and   the right
                 hand side then becomes Are a (4).

     Barriers

     There is however, no dev ia ti on from the technique of numbe ri ng
     the barriers.  This will be as folfoWs:

     S t a n d i n g in the desig n a t e d area and facing the pitch, the
     barrier at the bottom left hand side will be desi gn at ed as
     Ba rrier 1,

     C o n s e c u t i v e num be rs will then be appli ed to the barriers along
     to the end of this row comin g back to be hind Barrier 1 and
     n u m b e r i n g in a similar fashion.      A "snake" type num b e r i n g system
     will not be allowable.

     Where b arrie rs are not cl early p r e v i o u s l y identified, then they
     will be identi fi ed using an indelible mar ke r at 2 positions on
     the barrier, p r e f e r a b l y at an area where contact will not take
     place.


     Visual       Inspection

     The procedure        for the visual   exam in at io n will be as follows:

     All barrier s to be clos el y vi sually exam in ed pay in g pa rticular
     a t t e n t i o n to the base of the upright, to the general state of
     the upright and the horizontal member.          An y weld joints,
     corrosion, borken concrete, cracks etc,          are to be reported with
     comments.          Any looseness either of the upright or ho rizontal are
     to be reported.

      Barriers are to be cl as sified into types.     For example, barrers
      with concre te with relative dim en si on al information, or barriers
      steel with relevant di mensional information, and the qua nt it y
      and the numbe r of each type of barier to be recorded.

      Relevant infor ma ti on on specific barr ie rs rega rd in g any problems
      identified and remedial action requ ir ed will be recor de d in the
      report.


      Me chanical T e s t i n g

      The current re c o m m e n d a t i o n in the G r e e n Book St andard is that
      10% of the barri er s will be tested per annum so that the whole
      ground is covered in a 10 year period.

      It is RMT po licy to use disc re ti on in this area but the mini mu m
      number will always be tested.     The d i s c r etional element is that
      if the barr ie r types var y then a higher p r o p o r t i o n of one type
      may be tested if there is soma obv io us reaso n for this.

      The bar riers tested will be recorde d to ensure                 that du pl ictaion
      does not take place the foll ow in g year.

4;1     Barriers

        The test is carried out by applying' a ho rizontal force in the
        d i r e c t i o n in whi ch the crowds wouLcPpush.       This force will be
        ap plied to the upr ig ht and to a hori zo nt al member.          There may be
        a vertical force act in g in an up ward d i rection but this will
        always be less than 5% of the ho ri zontal force.              The force will
        be a p p l i e d g r a d u a l l y to the load of 6 Kilo Newtons per linear
        metre (400 pounds per linear foot) or 4.3 Kilo Ne wtons per
        linear m etr e (290 pounds per linear f o o t ) . The distanc e be tween
        the u p r i ghts is used for ca lc ulating the load.          The basic load
        used will be agr ee d before testing commences but it should -
        always be RMT's aim to test to ensure that the barriers comply
        wit h the hi ghter of the 2 loads.

        The s p ecified force will be appli ed to the horizontal me mber of
        the barr ier through 2 points 600mm (2ft) apart at appr ox im at el y
        mid point of the barrier.           The load will be calcu la te d by
        m e a s u r i n g the di stance betwe en the .uprights, multip l y i n g this
        by the req uired loading and then by a factor of 0.7.

        The force appl ie d to the vertical member will be the full load
        c a l c u l a t e d from the unit force m u ltiplied by the distance
        be tween the uprights.          For vertical mem be r at the end of the
        length of a barrier the load will be half of the above.

        In each case the force will be m aintained for su fficient time to
        ensure that all movement ceases and the d e flection from the
        vertica l or horiz on ta l noted. Any defl ec ti on greater than 25mm
        (one inch) will be identified.     Any de fl ection greater than 50mm
        (2 inches) will be rejected and the barrier class if ie d as having
        failed, even if the member returns to normal after load is
         reduoed.

         The force will then be removed and the recovery of the                      ,
         de f l e c t i o n noted. Any defl ec ti on grea te r than 6mm (0.25 inches)
         rem a i n i n g after one minute will result in the bar ri er bei ng
         rejected.


 4 :2     H a n d r a i 1s
         Whe re te sting of handr ai ls is requ ir ed then the load will b ®
         appl i e d in a similar manner to that of the crush barrier s using
         a so lid back support where possible.          If this is not possible
         then the load will be applied and the d eflection of 2 handrails,
         one in front and one behind, noted at the speci fi ed load.         If
         the total d e f l e c t i o n is greater than 50mm (2 inches) then    e
          handrail                  will be rejected.

          Whe re n e c e s s a r y         the   technique for loading han dr ai ls .ill be
          agreed after discussion.

P e r imet er Walls
                                        '» • .
The Per i m e t e r wall will be te st ed -using the higher of the 2
loads, that is 6 Kilo Newt on s per linear metre (400 pounds per
linear foot).        The load will be ca lc ulated as if the wall was a
vertical, that is the full load will be applied.

In the absen ce of regular pi llisters then the load will be
a ppl i e d based on a dista nc e of 6 feet and this load will be
app li ed through the head of the testing mac hi ne via a tubular
6 foot pole bra ce d acros s the wall and the lod appli ed as near
the top as possi bl e and at least with in 100mm of the top course
of brick.

Care should be taken to ap ply the load even ly by inserting
spacers no more than 100mm apart.


Report

A report will then be issued d e tailing the type of crush barriers
used, the general state of the barriers, any barriers with an
i d e ntification nu mber which in our opinion, should be rejected
for undue looseness, exce ss iv e corrosion, crack in g or damage.

None of the barri er s id entified as ha ving problems at the visual
e x a m i n a t i o n will be subjected to me ch anical testing.

Details, wi th id entification numbers, of any barriers whi ch fail
the mech an ic al test under load will be noted.      Any bar ri er s with
id entif ication nu mber whi ch defl ec te d more than 25mm (one inch)
under load will be identified,       An y other relevant comment will
be m a d e .

It is our aim that the report at all times should be posit iv e and
helpful in that if any problems are identified, if a sol ut io n can
be re adily seen, then remedial act io n should be det ai le d in the
report.

Where on a second visit the foll ow in g year the same problem,        a
p r o b l e m id entified and not remed ie d from the previous year,
then this should be reporte d im me diately to a responible
individual and cer t a i n l y highli g h t e d in the report.

Dear Mr Stickley

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY PART II
TECHNICAL WORKING PARTY ON THE GREEN GUIDE


I am writing to confirm that arrangements for the second meeting
of the technical working group, under the chairmanship of
Professor L Maunder.

Please find enclosed two maps, one of the University Campus and
one showing the approach roads to the city and University.
Anyone travelling by car from the south should approach on the
A6127 (A1) taking the city centre turn off, which is marked on
the map.

The meeting will be held in the Old Committee Room in the
Registrar's Office at 6 Kensington Terrace, also marked, and will
begin at 11am. A buffet lunch will be provided.

Finally, I enclose an Agenda for the meeting.

                                        Yours sincerely



                                                      t.

         THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - STAGE 2

         WORKING PARTY ON THE CREEK GUIDE - IDENTIFICATION OF AREAS

         POSSIBLY NEEDING IMPROVEMENT



         CHAPTER 5 - INGRESS



         Introductory Paragraph.     Needs expanding to include harmony with the

         transport and arrival patterns of spectators - home and away*      Also to

         have regard to the need to enable organising of orderly queues with no

         possibility of bottle-necking.



         44.     Needs to include provision for



                  (1)   Positive counting and recording of numbers passing through.



                  (2)   Exclusivity of turnstiles to one enclosure only*



                  (3)   Very clear signposting (in relation to last),



                  (4)   Warning turnstile operators of need to close.



         45.     Note the call for inspection.     This prompts a proposal for an

                  expansion of Chapter 4 to include ALL such needs.



         46.     Having moved counting provisions to 44 above, this clause should be

                  expanded to emphasise the need to anticipate patterns of arrival,

                  to ensure balanced egress is available.    Also there is a clear need

                  to advise against any ad hoc arrangements to open additional

                  entrances which cannot monitor the numbers and flow rates.

                                          -   2   -




     47*      Needs to refer to cash amounts charged and orderly queues.    Having

              regard to interim Report recommendation 19, consider suggesting a

              maximum number to pass through each turnstile not exceeding 700 in

              the most favourable conditions, reducing to 500 for adverse factors

              and only raising the lower level after proving ability.



     Additional Cla«»e» required ia this Chapter



     A*      Amenities inside the ground should not obstruct or disrupt the

              steady flow between turnstiles and enclosures e.g. toilets,

              refreshments, sale of programmes or other things.



     B.      No subdivision of enclosures.



     C.      Large enclosures to have an adequate number of well distributed

              entrances to facilitate even packing.



      0*     Entrances to enclosures to be designed to avoid local pressures     on

              spectators - i.e. attention to avoid downward ramps or stairs

              producing direct pressure onto crowds.   Break up such flows by

              crush barriers (reverse effect to that illustrated in figs.     1 and

              2 Pages 28 and 29).

                  Additional

                  A serious danger is created in many grounds by the differences
                  between the levels of the front of the terraces and of the pitch.
                  Many spectators were crushed against the retaining wall        at
                  Hillsborough. Major consideration should be given to the means of
                  minimizing this hazard.

                  The Popplewell Report concentrated on Fire Safety.  This Chapter is
                  well defined. Only general observations seem appropriate: (i) what
                  are the mandatory requirements of Building Regulations for older
                  stands?    (ii) joint consultation (para 176) will be a prominent

                                              Review of Green Guide

                                 Chapter 16. Estimation of Safe Ground Capacity

                           This chapter requires a comprehensive re-write. Some of the
                   major     issues for discussion are noted below.  A few cover more
                   general    ground,

                   1.            Should there b e a chapter on Safety C e r t i f i c a t e s ?

                   2.             Alternatively, should Safety Certificates be created            in
                           Chapter 2 (preferably re-titled)?

                   3.            If mandatory requirements     fall into the province              of
                                   Safety       Certificates, should guidance be given             on
                                   the construction of Safety Certificates.

                   217 - 220          Possibly minor amendments only.      Plans of               the
                                  Grounds should be required in Safety Certificates.

                   221 - 224          The   rage of packing densities (2,7 ■ 5.4/m^)  is
                                  extremely wide.   Specification of a maximum allowable
                                  value,  qualified by references to the state of the
                                  Ground, seems more sensible.

                                      The distinction between "peak viewing areas" and
                                  "other areas"   (see Table 1, p. 37) is ill-defined.
                                  Should it be discarded?

                                      The Interim Report calls for a reduction of 15% in
                                  the allowable capacity of terraces as determined by the
                                  existing Green Guide. This corresponds to a maximum
                                  allowable   density   of about 4.6/m      for   terraces
                                  conforming to the other guidelines, How should this be
                                  handled?

                   225 - 227          Examples   are a good idea, but        the   existing
                                  presentation is confusing.     In an improved version,
                                  various categories could be tabulated according to a
                                  scheme based on the three principal parameters:   barrier
                                  spacing, barrier strength and slope of terrace.   If the
                                  distinction between ’’peak" and "other" viewing areas   is
                                  retained, a fourth parameter is introduced.

                                        The logic of Examples B, p.66, should be reviewed.

                   228                This is a mixed bag.   It begins with exclusions on
                                  behalf of small crowds in small Grounds (but what about
                                  large crowds in small Grounds, etc?), and works out an
                                  example not obviously connected with the introduction.

                   229 - 232           Considerations of flows,

                                                                                                  LM

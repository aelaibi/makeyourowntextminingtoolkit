             On Saturday                   15 A p r i l     1989      I commenced              duty       in full       uniform,            parading

             Following                this       briefing,          I commenced            duties          in T a n g o      3 Mobile,            marked

             beginning                a    considerable             movement         of    fans       around        ou r     are a ,    which

have       to     stop     to     prevent           any      disorderly             behaviour.

At    11.30am that                date       we     noted a general                  progress              of    several         fans to

premises            from     th e      road,        where      they were             beginning              to     obstruct           the

junction.                Some     of    the       fans       were    actually             sitting           and      lying       on the

road       surface,          in o b v i o u s         danger        of    traffic,             and were            wa.med        against

this       practice.              The       Beehive          licensed          premises             were        in d a r k n e s s     and

the    doors         were        closed        with a         ’C l o s e d *    sign          exhibited            thereon.            I

noted       however          that       a    continuous             sporadic          stream           in g r o u p s       between           two

At    The       Middlewood             Tavern,          there       appeared          a good a ttendance                        of

Liverpool             fans,       and       tw o m i n i      coaches          were       parked           outside,         the       car

park was            relatively              full.         There      was       no    obvious           spillage            of    fans       onto

the    car        park,      until          later       on w h e n       fans       sat       in the        car      park,       and also

gathered            on    the     pavement            opposite           the    licensed             premises.

About       1 pm      I noted          that       The     Horse      and       Jockey          was     packed         out       with       fans,

there       was      a gathering               of     possibly           two    hundred             on the         car     park/frootage

and    a    large         group        of    f an s     were       gathered,          possibly              fifty        in all        on the

grass       verges         and      banking           opposite           and    about          twenty were               seated        actually

on garden walls                   and       steps       to    private          houses.              Al l    the     fans        appeared

to    be    drinking             heavily,           some      excessively             so.           I often         saw     f a ns     coming        ,

from       the      premises           carrying           several         pints       of       beer        each,      and       obviously,

from       their         actions,           for     their      own       consumption.

    The*actions                of    the     fans       was    varied.                 Some       were        drinking             and     talking

    quietly.              The       majority         however            were       extremely              boisterous,                   and    the

    litter         was     general           over       the a r e a w i t h             cans a n d            bottles          everywhere,

    bankings,             pavements,              roads and             frontage.                 We    approached                 youths       sat       on

    walls       to    private             housing        and       asked          them       to     consider             the       residents,

    and    eventually                one     fan made          an       effort          to       clear        that       area,          with    the

    aid    of      several           black        bin    liners.

    We    remained             in    the     area,       on    one       occasion                1 i a i sjjo^kjiLkC'h S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

    Marshall          and       appraising              him    of       the       s i t u a t i o n.,,'              w ere     advised          that

    if t h e r e      was       any       trouble,         for      the          five       of    us    to      r e j a i ^             the    vehicle

    until       assistance                came.         The    ground             control           was       similarly advised                      of

    the    situation                by P o l i c e      Sergeant             Miller.

    From     1.30pm            or    thereabouts              we    took          up    static          position             opposite           The

    Horse       and Jockey.                  I saw       that       a    large          number          of      f an s     had      become

    drunk,         on e    or       two    excessively              so.           They were             organising                 themselves

    into     groups            of    ten     or    twenty          and       singing             football            s o n g s , containing

    several          of    th e      better        known       obscene             words.              Eventually              a    number          from

    two    to      six     fans        started          standing             on a b o u n d a r y w a l l                with       a    private

    house,         possibly            some       seven       feet       hig h ,        and       leading            the     singers.               It

    was    unavoidable                 that       eventually             they          would        fall        from       the      wal l,      and

    many     did      so,       falling           through          foliage             at    the       b a ck    of      the       wall       and    into

    private          property.               I could          not       see       t h at     any       person         received             obvious

    became         very        drunk.         One       youth,          in his          teens          wa s     exceedingly                drunk,

    and    eventually                could        only     stand with                  assistance               of    tw o     of       his

    urinating             on    th e      forecourt           of    the          licensed           premises,              oblivious            as       to

one    person           detained           during          the     journey           to    the      ground.            This     wa s     by

to    be    hundreds,             away    from     th e      ground.                 Very       shortly          after        this,

possibly          about       3.15pm        I was       directed,                with       my    serial          into        the      ground,

by a s e n i o r          officer,        who     I do          not kno w .

On    entry       through          th e    gate    into        an      area before                th e    tunnel,           leading            to

the West          Terrace,          I was        confronted             by       a    large       congregation                 of      fans.

They       were       very    noisey,        and       it      was some seconds                    before          I realised                that

it w a s        not    their       usual     no i s e ,         but t h a t of         terror            and     p an i c .      A*      I

neared          the    tunnel       I saw        two    or     three         persons being                     carried

therefrom.                Some     people        immediately                began          to w o r k       on    t h em,      as      if    in

an attempt             to    resuscitate           t hem.           I go t           close       and      saw     that        two      of

these       persons          appeared        to    be       d e ad .        Others          were         being      carried            from,

the    tunnel,            in a s i m i l a r      condition,                and       I then          realised         that

something             very    serious        had       occurred,             either             in the       tunnel*           or      the

ground.

An    officer          was    directing           as    many        officers               as     possible          into       the       ground

and    in a c c o r d a n c e       with     this       I entered                the       West       Terrace,         via       the

tunnel.            I found         this     to    be a l m o s t        blocked             with         hysterical            p e ople,          of

all.ages          and       sexes.         I shielded            two        youngsters                out    of    the        crush,         and

then       went       back    through        the       tunnel          to    the       West       Terrace.             This         took

several          minutes.

In;the          ground       I saw        that    the       gate       to    the       pitch was               open,     and        at      least

two    openings             had    been made           in the          crowd          control          fence.          I went            onto

the    pitch and             immediately           saw       several             bodies          of    f an s     laid        n ea r     the

goal       at    t h at     end.      I went       to a h o l e             in       the    fence        and with             other
                                                                                                                                                       I
officers          and       fans    began         pulling         people             out     of    the      terrace.              Some        were     J

 shouting     to be a ll ow ed       to get to the alre ad y            crowded turnstiles.                    I

 shou t e d at the     supporters        to give over           pushing,        but they would n' t

 listen to what ‘they were              being    told.       A horse      near the bridge wall

 broke    from the     line and supporters             began      r i i shing    through towards           the

 this    enclosure     to try and stop           people      being     crushed at the turnstiles

 but my horse was           forced against a metal               barrier trapping my              leg.         I

 c onsidered       it,too    dangerous       in this      enclosure       so I came        out and

 placed my horse        across       the gate wa y to        prevent      further       supporters

 entering     the enclosure.            Supp or te rs were        climbing        on top of the

 s upporters       outside    the    turnstiles were            pushing and almost             fighting            each'

 other    trying     to get    through the turnstiles.                  At no time         did    I see any

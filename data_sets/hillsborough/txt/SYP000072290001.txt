an d then went             next    door       to the    "B*      entrance.        There were        no q u e u e s

or    crowds.            We had    no trouble          getting       in.    The        time was about        1320

hrs.         I saw two P o l i c e m e n        on horses,          I cannot      remember      seeing a n y more,

and    I cannot           remember       seeing any stewards.                   All    of this was        outside

beer     or anything.              I did not        see any         fighting      or disturbances.

I had my ticket               taken from me            on entrance         to the ground.             I saw some

was    now about        half       past one.           ('1330)

On e n t e r i n g    the g r o u nd at the L e p p i n g s Ln t urnstiles                  I did not see any

other     gates       open other          than the turnstiles.                  I found my m a t c h viewing

p os itio n and stayed              there wit h my brother                  and my mates all            the time.

The    first        thing    I n ot i c e d was        the sud d e n build up of            pressure a r o u n d

me,    this was about              half    past t w o.            (-1430)    I norma l l y w a t c h Liverpool

from the Kop           end and       I am used to being                 in a tight        crowd but the

p ressure      at this m a t c h was            greater.

I w o u l d say my original                m at c h    position was          behind the goal,            half w a y up

the t e r races        towards       the     left.          We all     noticed      it was getting         very hot

and    the a tm os p h e r e was          getting       very tense,          people around me were

gett i n g    squeezed.

People       in front        of me and to my                left were       s h o uting   help get       back,

t h e r e ’s a lad dying,            the     lad was w e a r i n g a red Liverpool                 top with       blue

cords     or jeans,           I was       say he was          ten to twelve years               old,    brown hair.

I don't       know     if     the    lad was handed up and passed                     over the         crowd.     I

did see       one     lad     w i t h what      Ithought was a broken                 arm being         lifted up

a nd over      the     crowd to the           front.

People       were all        shouting       down to the             front    to t w o male Ft) 1 ice O f f i c e r s

who were       behind the goal              facing          us,    "Open the     gates,     t h e r e ’s people

dying,"        T hey did not          react      to this.            I cannot       remember      too much about

t h i s t i.m e .

The    next    thing        I noti c e d was          the teams       coming     out,     the time must          have

been    five    to three.            (1455)           The    pressure was        bad,     you    could not move

at all,       only your        head       perhaps.           The    gajm’

    The    crowd surged,            every o n e want           forward.           We    got split         up,    all     the

    lads    I came       in wit h got            separated.           I went          forw a r d two      feet to my

    left.        I ended up a ga i n s t           a crush barjj*irlfr.                The    bottom      part     of my

    chest was       up agai n s t          the    c r u s h j>afr r i e r , (sternum)           my feet were             on the

    same    level       as the bottom o£^?fne crush barrier.                                  The    pressure was          now

    against       my back       pushing me against                   the    barrier.           I could feel m y s e l f

    p assing      out.       I could feel              my    legs    going       to    jelly.        I was       taking    short

    shallow       breaths,        the      pressure agai n s t me was                   preventing my             chest

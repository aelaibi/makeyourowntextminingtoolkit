          disclosure and its timing again,

           We regard this as

process.

There can be no justification for the postponement of the disclosure of this critical material
the grounds that one party might be granted leave to quash the decision not to take over
proceedings which are pending in a lower court.

The magistrate has confirmed that the committal proceedings will begin on 19* April.

I look' forward to an early reply.


Yours sincerely

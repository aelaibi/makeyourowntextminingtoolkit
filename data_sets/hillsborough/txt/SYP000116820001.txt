              I am Police Constable 2592 Richard Shimwell,                       currently serving at

              Hackenthorpe Police Station,                    Sheffield.

                      8.30 am on Saturday,               15th April 1989,    I commenced duty at

  I     A*?   Hackenthorpe Police Station.                     I was then transported to Hillsborough

              F o o t B a i r G r W n d . a r r i v i t i g at approximately 9,15 am.     toll owing a

              briefing in the North Stand at approximately 10.00 am and a short

              meal break,                   I commenced duty in the West Stand.       I was a member of

              Serial 13, of which PS 2001 Burman was in charge.                         I took up my point
 %
              at approximately 11.15 am in company with PC 3088 Coupland at the

              base of the stairway leading to the seated area in the West Stand.

              There are two such stairways and we were working at the one nearest

              to the North Stand.                     Our duty was to assist the six stewards also in

              this location.                     Their function was to check the tickets of those

              entering the seated area via the stairway and tear the corner off the

              ticket to prevent                    it being thrown down and re-used      by those with

              standing tickets only.

              At 12 mid -day the turnstiles were opened and from that point onwards

              there was a steady influx of fans throughout the afternoon.                          All

              tickets were checked by the stewards and admission gained only by
  those in possessi on of a ticket for the seated area.          In addition to

  assisting the stewards we were also instructed to prevent anyone

 coming down the stairway prior to kick off.            This we had to do on a

  number of occasions,        although all those advised were receptive and

  agreeable.

  The volume of spectators entering the ground remained steady and
'■f


  controlled until about 2.30 pm when there was an apparent, increace in

      the number of fans entering the seated area via the stairway.           At

  this point I noticed that many of the fans were rowdy although              none       j

  were particularly troublesome.                                                         I
                                                                                         J
  At about 2.50 pm there was a surge of fans pushing their way          onto       the   j

  stairway, many of w ho m had tickets        for other areas of the ground or

  no tickets at all.         As the stewards attempted to direct these people

      to the correct area,    or indeed refuse entry,   the crowd behind grew

      rapidly and began to push forward.     As a result,   the stewards were

  forced against t h e ;stairway % s the crowd pushed passed.       Myself and

      PC Coupland went to their assistance and informed the crowd to stop

  pushing so that the stewards could effectively check the .tickets.

  However,     this was to no avail and the crowd continued to push past

  and by the sheer weight and number we were unable to offer any

  resistance.      At this point I advised the stewards to stand back and

      let the crowd enter.    As the surge began to diminish I received a

  radio message requesting "All officers onto the perimeter tr ac k” .

  I immediately ran round to the rear         of the West Stand toward the

  Police control box.        As we entered    the terraced area beneath the

  control box I saw a woman lying on the floor with a man crouched over

  her holding her head.        Myself and PC Coupland went over and I could

  see that the wom an was gasping for air, vomiting and obviously having

  great difficulty breathing.        We   immediately rendered first aid,

 placing the woman in the recovery position and a St. John's ambulance
                                                                                    PAGE

member was requested by another officer who had also come to the

womans assistance.                 This arrived a short time later and the woman was

left in her care.

We then entered the perimeter track via the South Stand and I

immediately saw that the players had left the pitch and a number of

people were climbing over the fence behind the West Stand goal mouth.
1.             .           '


My initial thoughts were that the pitch was being invaded by the

 Liverpool fans and hence the match had been interrupted for this

reason.            I therefore went towards the goal mouth with the intention

 of assisting with crowd control.                I climbed onto the small wall at

 the base of the railings and shouted to the crowd to stop pushing

 because I could now see that people at the front were being crushed

against the fence.                 I still did not realise that anyone was injured

 and continued to shout at the crowd.       A  man at the front then shouted
                    •’                                                   >■
 " T h e y ’re dying in here", and he indicated toward the ground*  I

 looked down artd I immediately saw that beneath the crowd at the front

 of the pen, were bodies on which they were standing:.                  I stood back

 onto the pitch in dismay and told PC Coupland what I had seen.                      I

 then got              back onto the wall and began assisting members of the crowd

 over the              fence.    I could see more and more bodies at    the base of the

 railings most of who m wre motionless and appeared dead.                  On the

 opposite              side of the fence from where I was standing      there was a man

who was facing towards the crowd.                 He   appeared to be   uninjured and I

 could see that at his feet was a young girl who was purple in the

 face and lying on the floor.                I prodded the man in order to attract

his attention and shouted to him to pass the girl over to me.

However,       he appeared oblivious to my presence and was obviously in a

 state of shock.                Again I climbed down from the fence and walked

towards the small emergency gate behind the goal mouth.                   This was

 open and as I approached I was met by Chief Superintendent Nesbit.
He ordered officers into the pen to pull free the trapped and

 injured.    Several      officers,    including P C ’s 28 Drewitt,   1535

Fairclough 2980 Wright,           and 2818 Marshall entered the pen and

 immediately began to pass bodies through the gate.              Myself and others

formed a line on the opposite side of the fence and passed the bodies

 onto the pitch.       During this process there was a pause in the flow of

bodies coming through the gate,            at which point I walked onto the

pitch and began to render first aid to a man who had just been passed

 through.    He was aged approximately 25 years with dark hair and dark

moustache.       He was purple in the face and his eyes were open,

bloodshot and glazed.             I listened to his chest for a heartbeat and as

 I did so I was joined by a St. J o h n ’s ambulanceman who told me to

give mouth to mouth as he rendered cardiac massage.                I opened the man

mouth and blew into him.             I repeated this procedure several times and

;;,^aS',,t^en joined by another St. >John’s ambulanceman who was carrying a

 cylinder of oxygen.         He told me to place a pipe from the cylinder
                                                                                  :


 into the man's mouth, which I did.            The other St, J o h n ’s man

 continued to give massage for a short while longer before he said:

 ”H e ’s dead,   forget    it.”

 I closed the m a n ’s eyes and walked back toward the chain of officers

passing bodies from the open gate.             I joined the end of the line and

was passed the body of an elderly man,             aged about 50 years.       I

carried the body to the pitch and was about to render first aid when

 I was joined by a man in civilian clothing who stated he was a Doctor

He looked at the body and told me the man was dead and not to bother

with him.        I therefore went back towards the fence in order to assist

people over.       By this time the crowd at the front had depleted and

other officers were in the process of removing the last of the bodies

from the ground.

Together with PC Coupland and other Officers             I entered the pen and
the* terraces beneath the railings there was a large amount of

clothing,      shoes and spectacles. The atmosphere at this point was

extremely tense with members of           the      crowd shouting obscenities          j1
                                                                                       i
towards us.        We remained in the     pen for about 10 minutes and then            i
                                                                                   ■   i
returned to the track in an attempt             to locate the remainder of my          \

                                                                                       i
serial.      Whilst we were on the pitch there was a message over the

tannoy from Kenny Dalglish advising the Liverpool            fans to assist the

Police and remain calm.

We remained on the track for a further 20 minutes after which there

was a further message given over the tannoy informing the spectators

that the game was to be abandoned.          At which time the ground was

cleared.

Again we tried to locate the rest of our serial and we were joined by

       ^88 P a y n e '

Hackenthorpe Officers.        We were then told to gather the details of

people who had been in the West Stand at the time of the incident,

however,     by this time the majority of the crowd had left and I was

unable to obtain any details.,          I then joined PS 2001 Burman in the

seated area of the West Stand.          After searching the stand for                  j

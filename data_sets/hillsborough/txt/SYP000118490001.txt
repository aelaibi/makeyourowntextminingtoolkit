ground        I saw        that       the re wa s          quite          a number           of L i v e r p o o l      f a ns    t h e re

waiting        to       get     into       the      g ro u nd -        These       supporters             were      well        behaved.

Several        f an s      e nq u i red of roe w h e r e                  they     could          find a       public        house         open.

This     was       a    regular        enquiry           throughout               the       day.

At    abOut        12 n o o n        the    turnstiles               were     opened and             f an s      started         to     enter

the     ground.            There       was       s ti ll    a f ai r a m o u n t             of    supporters           outside            the

ground who              had     no    intention            of     entering             the    ground.            Many     of     these

fans     were          drinking        alcohol           from        cans     and       bottles and you                 cold         see

them     stopping             other        f an s a s k i n g        if t h e y        ha d a n y    spare        tickets.

Together           with       Mounted Officers                    at      this     location and                other      members            of

my    s e r i al       we w e r e     constantly            encouraging                 people       to     enter       the      ground

and     if    they        did    not       h a ve    tickets           move       them away          from        the    turnstile

area.         All       the     time       the      volume        of      fans     was       increasing.

At    12.20        pm     I saw a          la rge      group         of    fans        on    the    footpath           in L e p p i n g s

Lane     approximately                 50 yards            away f r o m the t u r n s t i l e s                  in the         direction

of P e n i s t o n e       Road North.                 There was             about          30-40     people        blocking            the

footpath and               spilling           over       o nt o      the     r oa d     causing          traffic        to      stop.            On

going        towards          the     group         1 saw a man              X now know             to    be

                                                                                                  Liverpool.             I could           see

th at    he    had a handful                  of     tickets           he w a s        offering          for     sale.          On     seeing

me a p p r o a c h ! n g        he    placed         the    tickets           in       his     po ck et .        He w a i       arrested

for O b s t r u c t i n g        the       Highway         and       taken        to    the P o l i c e        R o o m at       th e    rear

of    the N o r t h        Stand.           On      searching                               , I found          that     he      had     11

tickets        for       the L i v e r p o o l         end and 7 tickets                      for    the N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t

end     together           with £701.64.                   The       tickets           were       checked wit h           the

Football           Club       office        and were            originals.                  I ascertained              t ha t    the

tickets        were        being       offered           for      sale       at    £35.                           stated         that

he    had     obtained           the       tickets         from        the A n f i e l d          ticket       office.           After

returned          to m y       position            in L e p p i n g s    Lane.           The     time      then was          1.15          pm

The      cr ow d s     had     grown        but     there       did     not     seem       to    be a n y       problems.              From

th a t     p oi nt     onwards          the      flow     of    f ans    greatly           increased and               it w a s

noticeable             t hat      many were             carrying        c an s a n d       bottles         of a l c o h o l .

These         were     prevented            from        entering        the     ground,             Leppings          Lane       was

thronged with                supporters             and       I was     continuously moving                       people         away

from       the    footpaths             and      from     the m i d d l e       of    th e      road.          These     f an s w e r e

directed          to    the       turnstiles             or a w a y     if    they       di d    not      have a       ticket.

Due      to    the     problem          vehicular             traffic        was     having         dif fi c u l t y

negotiating             Leppings            L ane,       the     road was          blocked          off at        both    ends.

I was         made     aware       j us t     after       2    pm t h a t     a special             train       h a d a r r i v e d at

Wadsley          Bridge        Station           containing            Liverpool           fans.          On    their     arrival

at L e p p i n g s      Lane       they       greatly          increased           the     volume         of    supporters

there.           As    time       went      on     it    became        clear       t hat     the a m o u n t       of ans

without          tickets          was    growing.

At    about       2.30       pm    1 was         aware        of a n    incident           t hat     t oo k     place      in

Leppings          Lane       about       50 yards             Catch Bar         Lane       s i de    of    th e    turnstiles.

1    had      heard     the       sound       of    breaking           glass       and a gap appear                   in the       f an s

approaching             me.        I could          not       see w h a t     was     happening            but w e n t       towards

this       location where                I s s a w PC 2 1 2 0           Thorpe        a n d PC 2 3 3 3 E n g l i s h             walking

towards          me w i t h       two    youths         who     were     obviously              under      arrest.           I

ascertained             t ha t     there         had     been a fight              between          the    rival       fans.           I

was      then     approached             by      three        men who        s h o w e d me      t i ck ets       they    had

purchased,             these       tickets          were       obviously           photostat           copies.

I then re turned                  to a position nearer                       the turnstiles.                    All    the time

the      crowd was g row in g and w i t h other                              officers           entered the            crowd to

try and          ease the          congestion.

I cannot          say the exact                  time but         for a short              time the double exit

gates         alongside           turnstiles            A were     o p e n e d aild t h e n            cl os ed .
                                                                                /     ' ...
Mounted          officers         were        s t i 11 a t t e m p t i n g t o / g e t the             f ans      in o r d e r l y

turnstiles               that         allow        fans       into      the       standing             area.        These          fa ns      were

climbing            o ve r       th e     wall      and       into      the       ground.              I became             aware       of

possible            serious             problems           outside           these         turnstiles              due       to    the       sheer

volume         of       f a ns    present.               With        other        officers             we w e n t       into       the       crowd

in o r d e r        to     close          the      iron gates              situated            about         15 y a r d s         in f r o n t       of

the      turnstiles               a n d at         the     head       of     th e      road      leading           to       the    official

car      park.           So      t ha t      the    crowd        could          have       a more         direct            access       to       the

turnstiles.                    I then         saw a mo u n t e d             officer           alongside            these          gates

having         a    problem with                   s ome      supporters               and     o ne     appeared             intent          on

getting            to    t hi s       officer.             I got        hold         of    this        person and                pul led      h im

away      from          th e     h o r s e,     t e l 1 i ng h i m         to     calm down             he w a s        s t i ll       tryi ng       to

p us h    forward.                I pul 1 ed s e v e r a l              other          people          away     from         trying          to    push

p as t    the       h or s e .          The     horse         d id    not       have       room        in whi ch to m a n o e u v r e .

While         I was        in the            crowd       several           fans        who     were       obviously Nottingham

Forest         f an s      with         tickets          for     the S o u t h            Stand        were attempting                   to       reach

t hi s    stand          via      th e       road     leading           to      th e      official           car    park.              I informed

them      that          they      could         not      reach        the       stand         t hi s    way     due         to a b a r r i e r

across         the       r o a d , and          di r e c t e d       them       to     th e    cor rect w a y               to    the    stand.

They      got a g i t a t e d             and annoyed                because           they      c o u ld     see       a    large       sign

above         the       turnstiles.                 The       sign      showed            SOUTH STAND and                    an a rrow

underneath               pointing             down       the     r oad       to      the      car      park.

Due      to    the       immense             pressure          of     supporters               around         me    I had          to

p hysi c a l l y         push my way                b ac k     out      of      the       crowd        into L e p p i n g s            Lane«         The

crowd was               getting           denser         as    k i ck      off       t im e    approached               and       the    mood

more      agitated               and      aggressive.

The      pressure              seemed         to    ease       and      I found            out      later       t hat        a    double          exit

Sometime            after         3     pm    I received a                 radio me s s a g e             requesting               that       all

the      playing          area.            On    entering             the    playing          area        I saw        people        o n the

pitch         (supporters                 and Police) .                It s e e m e d        to me        that        there     had      been a

pitch         invasion.                Many      supporters                were    climbing             o ve r    the    perimeter

fence         and    through              the    gate        in the         perimeter             fence.          A    lot    of     p e o pl e

forward          and      r i gh t        up    to    the     fencing.             Th e      situation worsened                      and

there         seemed       to        be    hundreds           of      people       and Police               around.           I saw        some

offi cers           and     supporters                trying          to    pul 1 a w a y         the     f enc i ng      from       the re

supports.                I assisted              them and             then    helped          lift        the     bodies        and      injured

from      t he      terracing              o n to      the       pitch.           At    this       t ime a St.            Johns

terracing.                X helped              lift       two     bodies         into       the a m b u l a n c e , t h e y w e r e

obviously            d e a d a n d we re              checked          by the          attendant.                Two m o r e       people

One      of    the       bodies           that       had     been      taken       out       of    the      terracing           was      a P au l

help      I carried              the       b o d y to        the      gymnasium           where         it w a s       certified           dead

Throughout               the     time          I was       on the ?p i t c h           I was       aware         of P o l i c e ,

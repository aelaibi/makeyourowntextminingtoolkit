                   Further to the questionnaire that I made to the West Midlands Police

                   regarding the Hillsborough football                  stadium disaster on the 15th April

                   1989 ( 150489) J [ would like to add t h a U w h e n            I walked through the
c a t
                   tunnel      I w /m t    into the pen to thaXTeft        (Pen    h) «        We stood right at
T U N t4 € > L ~
                   the front and the young           lad m io was with us,                             14 yrs,

s -i a k d         of                     because he was so small he stood up on the fence to

                   get a better view.


                     Ca t                   oeowj.
                   Just before the game kicked offy^There was a surge from the back which

                   pushed me over to the left                id side of the pen.                I ended up still

                   near the front to the left j f i           the goal.          I saw that

                   was still up on the fe            ; about     15'G from me.            I was shouting at him
 C A T
                   to climb over which              did.      I was still        trapped and co uldn’t move
                                                                                          PAGE     2
                                                                                          S3393

               where    I wanted.   Each time I was pushed back and forth I was awars of

               something beneath my feet,      it was obviously a body.          I couldn't

               avoid going over     it because the crowd was dictating which way 1 went.



               1 was    right up against the fence and had rny arms outstretched holding

               the mesh.      I couldn ’t climb up and get out from where 1 was because

               of the overhang on top of the perimeter fence and the crush of the

               people behind me.      1 was aware of people stepping on my shoulders in

               order to get themselves out of the pen.               I was terrified that I was

               going to get pushed onto the floor.          If I had done I would never have

               got up alive.



               After about    10 minutes the crowd pressure had eased and I was able to

               put my hands on the mesh and physically push myself back to avoid

               stepping on the body beneath me,


-f£A           It then became clear to me once tne p ressure had eased that the body
ecu                                                                       7
               beneath my feet was a white male, aged
COn 5 I (£ 1
               he had                             hair,   he wore
'/IBU/VL          “
£\/< M j L --------
T O ^ h                     He had blood coming from         nose and it was obvious from
diSc'i         the marks on his face that he had b^?n trodden on



               I then got down on the floor and attempted to resuscitate the man.

               and another fan had already tried a couple of times to lift him up

               over the fence but he was too heavy.



               I cleared his airway and gave him the         '/s s   of life for a good few

               minutes.      He was not responding and       sn a couple of policemen came

               over to me and said,     “W e ’ll have aXjo so n” .       I stayed there with him
                                                                               PAGb          3
                                                                               S3393

but it was obvious to me that he was dead.            After the policemen had

failed to revive him they lifted him up and          ’rolled'   him through the

fence where the mesh had been pulled up and onto the track.                   I d i d n ’t

see what happened to him after that.         I then climbed through myself

and went to re-unite myself with my son and young



I found them by the stand       and just made sure                  alright.         I

was then made aware of a young     lad who was 1,                   s ground    in

front of the stand to the      left of the Leppini                  .     He had     a St

Johns girl with him and a      Police Sergeant.       A             ne had leg

injuries and to stay away from his legs.          / Some lads then came over

with a makeshift stretcher.       The Polioe Sgt.      said to tie the la d’s

legs together which somebody did.           then carried the lad on the

stretcher to the far end of t/he s y & d iu m.     We left him with somebody

who seemed to be organising t'fiTT^’casualties.



I still w a s n ’t aware of the full extent of the tragedy and waited

around for the game to re-start.        It was a scene of absolute            chaos.

I eventually left the ground at about 1610 hrs            (1610).

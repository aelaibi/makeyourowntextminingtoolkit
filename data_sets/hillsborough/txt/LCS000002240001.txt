Dear Sir/Madam,

Hillsborough Assistance Pnit

I enclose a copy of a report which was presented to this morning's
Inter Agency Group regarding the proposed staffing arrangements
for the Hillsborough Assistance Unit.

The Inter Agency Group endorsed the recommendations contained in
the report and is now most anxious to proceed with recruitments
as quickly as possible.

However, as not all Authorities were represented at the meeting
today, the Group asked that I write immediately to Directors of
Social Services seeking confirmation that the proposed staffing
arrangements are acceptable and, as time is very much of the
essence, the Group further requested me to say that in the absence
of a reply by 10.00 a.m. Friday, 2nd February, it will be assumed
that the arrangements contained in the report are acceptable and
matters will proceed accordingly.

Yours faithfully,




City Solicitor.
                                                                    APPENDIX      B
             REPORT FOR INTER AGENCY GROUP - MEETING 26.1.90



HILLSBOROUGH ASSISTANCE UNIT



Introduction

Confirmation haw been received from a number of Local Authorities of provision
of financial support for 1989/90 and 1990/91.   To date no reply has been received
from either St. Helens or Sefton.   Nottinghamshire have agreed to contribute
£12,000 and Sheffield are considering their position.

Implementation




     1)        The Unit should be established on a phased basis -

              Phase 1 to include Assistance Unit Manager P06

               Children Society (Children's Outreach Worker only - secondment has

               requirement in this way for the issue of new contracts. If secondme^P
               cannot be achieved then employment of a temporary should be considered.

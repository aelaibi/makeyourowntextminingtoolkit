              I am a De t ec ti ve          Constable           in the       South Yorkshire               Police         s t a t i o n e d at

             Hammerton Road              Police      Station.

             At     10 a.m.       on S a t u r d a y ,     1 5 th A p r i l ,    1989,       I attended            the    pre-match

              briefing        in r e l a t i o n   to     the F .A.         Cup Semi-Final              football          match

             Sheffield Wednesday Football                          Ground.

             The    briefing         took      place      in the N o r t h        S t a n d and was           addressed          by

             Superintendent              Duckenfield,            followed         by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     Murray,

              Inspector        Sewell       and Detective               Sergeant        C h a r 1e s w o r t h ,   all     briefing

             officers        on    the    ground         layout       and    recent      behaviour            of   supporters           from

             both     clubs.

             Following         the     briefing myself                and    other      C.I.D.         officers          were    further

             briefed        by D e t e c t i v e   Superintendent                McKay about            our    individual

             duties.         Detective         Constable           2405     Dynes       and myself            were       assigned

             duties        outside       the   ground.           At     recent        football         matches       at    the    same

             stadium a         large      number         of m o t o r    vehicles        ha d    been      broken         into a n d

             contents        stolen       during         the   course       of    the    g ame.         We were          both    dressed
in    plain       clothes            and    were       instructed            to    carry        out       observations               for

such    offences             in P e n i s t o n e          Road      from an area             outside        the     grou nd and

u p to a n d       including               the    Owlerton Sports                  Stadium.

At    11 a.m.          the      same       day.       Detective          Constable            Dynes        and    I commenced

duties       as    outlined            above.              We    left    the      football         ground and walked

from    there          to L e p p i n g s        Lane       where       Detective          Constable             Dynes      had

previously arranged                        to m e e t       a Police         informant.               The    route         took       us

past    the S p i o n H o p            end       of    the      ground and          the       general        route         to    the

ground       from       t he     city       centre.             At    this     early       hour       a    large      number          of

supporters were                  already          beginning             to a r r i v e     and a number               of    these          were

drinking          alcohol            from     cans.

Following          a discussion                  with       the a b o v e      m e n t i o n e d man,        we      continued             our

foot    pa tro l        up      to    the     Owlerton Stadium                    where       we m a d e     our      presence

known    to       staff         at    the     car      park       entrance.             The     t im e     then would            be

around       midday.             Opposite             the       stadium      is th e m a i n          junction         of

Penistone          R o a d , Bradfield Road and Livesey S t r e e t .                                       Situated            at    the

junction          is a       public         house          named      the    ’R o y a l    Hotel*.           The      footpath

outside       that        public           house       was       completely         conjested with                   supporters             of

Nottingham             Forest.             There       w as     the     sound      of     singing          inside      the       pub,

suggesting             f a ns    of    t hat      club were             also      inside.

At    that    time        we w e r e        monitoring               channel       19 of        our       personal         radio,

that    channel           being        solely          for      C.I.D.       use.         R e c e p t i o n wa s     good and              in

fact    we    received               notification               via Detective              Sergeant          805 Buxton               that

othe    local          public         houses          were      a lso    congested            in the        s am e   a r e a.         We_____

did    in fact          make         our w a y        to    the      'Royal       Hotel*        where       we    spoke         to a n d

identified             ourselves            to    uniformed             officers          who    were       outside.             This

was    done       so    that         they w ould            recognise          ourselves           in the         event         t hat      we

required assistance.                         We       spoke       to a      uniform        Inspector,             this      being

                                                                                                  Following               our

conversation              I actually              entered            the        public        house          to a s s e s s         the

behaviour           of    t he     f an s     i nside.              Th e    pub w a s         completely              full          of

Nottingham              Forest       f ans       and      it    is s afe           to      say    that        the m a j o r i t y             of

them were           the     worse         for     dri n k .          One        y o u t h was       actually              standing             on a

table      in the         pub      leading            the      fans        singing.              There        wa s    not       however             any

sign     of    trouble.              We     reported            our        observations                 to    the     uniform

officers           outside         and      v o 1u n t e e r e d       our       services           should           the       pub n e e d           re­

visiting.

We    then     continued             our      f o ot      p at r o l       along        Penistone             Road        towards             the

and     from       speaking          to     them a          large          number          were     in f ac t         ’t i c k e t

touts*.            One    particular               tout        was     spoken           to a n d        boasted           of    having             SO

tickets        for       sal e.        He    said a            six     pound          terrace           ticket        would          cost me

twenty        f iv e     pounds.            W h e n we         identified               ourselves             to h i m         he    s a i d he

was     from Li verpool                and       * t o u t e d * on a            regular          basis.             He    said          he

obtained           his    tickets           from       players             of    the       c lu b a n d a l s o           he 1d a         lar ge

This     particular               ’t o u t ’ s t a t e d        t hat       in the          week        before        the       game

Liverpool           Police         had      taken         his       tickets           from       hi m     to a s s e s s        their          origin

and     validity.            He      said        he    ha d     only        got       them       b ac k      the     previous             evening

and     this       had    reduced           their         street           value.           Each        ticket        he       stated would

ha ve    fetched          around          fifty        pounds          in m i d - w e e k .

As    s t a t e d at      that       t ime       t h is     man was             one     of a p p r o x i m a t e l y           EO    ’t o u t s ’

present.            We    were      approached                 on m y       occasions             by fans            wanting             to    buy

tickets,           and    the      high      v o 1 ume         of    them        e v e n at       that        t ime       suggested                t ha t
man y were         travelling                to    the       g a me    without         tickets.             This        was     mentioned

within       the       g r o u n d w h e n we a t t e n d e d             there        for      our m e a l        break        at    around

1.30    p.m.

At    2.00     p.m.         Detective             Constable            Dynes      and      I returned              to     our    patro l

as m e n t i o n e d        above.            In the          short      s p a c e of     time       we      had        b e e n a w a y , the

volume       of       supporters              outside            the    ground had             risen       drast i c a l l y .            I

should       point          out    however,             t ha t    the     number          of    f a ns     actually           entering

the    gro und was             minimal.                The      turnstiles          at     the H o p        end      showed          no

signs     of      congestion             and       the       r o a d at     tha t      end      of    the      g r o u n d wa s

clear.         Traffic            was    moving           easily        for      a match         of      the     standard            that

was    taking          pla ce .         At    the       c it y    end     of     the      entrance          to     the     Spion Kop

is a g a t e w a y          leading          to    the       South Stand            entrances.                 The      gateway           and

also    a bridge             on    the        far      s i de     of    it w a s c o m p l e t e l y         congested.               It was

noted     that         this       blockage             was      caused      by fan s           asking        for     and also

offering          for       sale       match       tickets.             There       were        no P o l i c e       Officers             in

uniform        present            at    t hat       location and                despite         the      fact      that       it d i d         not

fall     under         our     br ie f,       we       t oo k    it u p o n      ourselves            to m o v e        these        persons

on.

We    continued along                   Penistone               Road    towards           Owlerton           Stadium.

Throughout             t hat      patrol          we    saw      two    uniform           officers           only who were

standing          at     the      j u n c t i o n w i t h P a r k s ide R o a d.                 The       lack      of     officers

visibly        present            was    commented               upon.          Fans      present          were      arriving             in

numbers,          a    large       number          of w h i c h w e r e          drinking            beer      from       cans.

At    approximately                £.43       p.m.        Detective             Constable            Dykes       and      I had

returned          to     the      bridge          area       immediately            before           the    S pio n Kop

entrances.              That       ar e a was           completely              blocked and              f ans     were       spilling

into     the      roadway.              A group           of H O       p lu s    f a ns    came       running           down     the          road

away    from          the    site       of H i l l s b o r o u g h        Park.           It w a s       apparent           that      th e s e

youths       had       been       involved             in s o m e      incident           and     so w h i l s t         I watched

over    Detective              Constable               Dynes      he    stood amongst                 them.
The      mood    of     the    c r o w d at       that        time,      who       comprised             in the        main       of

drunks,         was     such     that       either          would       have       been       impossible              without          the

assistance            of a u n i f o r m         officer.              That    particular                pi e c e     of    road

(Penistone            Road)      is    directly             p r io r    to    th e      c ity    side       of      the     football

ground.          We     continued           to    follow          the     particular             youth and             I was

surprised          to    find     that       the       only Police             Officers             in v i e w w e r e           three       or

fo u r    from     the N o t t i n g h a m F o r c e .             The       y o u th was        cautioned             in t h e i r

presence         and     his     details          obtained             by one        of    the N o t t i n g h a m          officers.

Whilst      t h is      c o n v e r sa t io n was           taking        place         the     youth's          friends          became

very      hostile        towards         us a n d        there         was    no     doubt       that       t hi s     section          of

fans      were     not     only       the    worse          for    drink        but       intended          to      fight        with

anyone      they        could.

Immediately             after      t hi s     incident            a number           of S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e          Passenger

Transport          buses       arrived           at     the     ground.            T he    majority            of     persons          on

those      buses        were     also       d ru n k .        It s h o u l d       be     noted      however,              that

despite         their      late       a r r i v a l , their            entry       to     the    g r o u n d was           qui c k .        I

believe         tha t    the     time       would         be a r o u n d 2 . 5 0          to £ . 5 5       p.m.        We     had      been

j o i n e d at     the     scene       by    Inspector             Manus       Booth and asked                      him     to    relay a

message         to m a t c h     control          warning          them       of     the      potential             disorder           in

Hillsborough Park                 after          the m a t c h .         He    stated           t h at    the       control

channel         was     heavily        conjested and                   suggested           t h at    we     pass       the m e s s a g e

later.          It s h o u l d    be     noted          t hat     we    could        neither         pass        or    receive

messages         on     the    radio        w h i c h we        were      issued          (C.I.D.         channel           19).

Around      3.00        p.m.     we a s s u m e d        the      match       had       started          by th e       sounds          of

cheers      coming        from        inside          the     ground.          Traffic           in P e n i s t o n e        Road       on

the S p i o n K o p       end was           very sparse                a n d we      commented            on     how easily             it

had      cleared.          It w a s      our      opinion          t hat      it was          in f ac t        less        than a

normal      Saturday           home     g am e        at H i l l s b o r o u g h .         No    persons            appeared           to

have      difficulty           in e n t e r i n g        the      ground.            Apart       from a          number          of

persons         who     will     be    described              in the         next       paragraph,             the     majority             of

Nottingham             fans       appeared             to     have a r r i v e d            in t i m e       to    enter      the     gr o u n d .

At 3 .0 0    p.m.           however,             a group           of a p p r o x i m a t e l y         100 y o u t h s       had

congregated             outside             the       gate     immediately                  pr ior      to th e         S p i o n Kop,

those     gate®         leading             to    the       rear        of    the S o u t h S t a n d .             There       were        no

uniform      officers              in view.                 The     mood         of    the y o u t h s        was       restless        and       it

was    obvious          that       they          did    not        hold       tickets          for      the       game.       From

comments          we    overheard,                they were               speaking           of     rushing         t he    gates       to

gain    entry.              At    this       time       we w i t h d r e w            to    the     central         carriageway              of

Penistone          Road          because          we w e r e        both         of    the     opinion            t hat    we w e r e

isolated          from       other          officers           and would               neither          h a ve     been     able      to s t o p

the    youths          or    defend          ourselves               if      the      situation             became        ugly.       Without

warning       the y o u t h s           suddenly              began          running          down      behind          the S o u t h Stand

towards      the L e p p i n g s             Lane       e n d of          th e     ground.             We    b e l i e v e d at      th at

time    t hat a f i g h t              was       probably            taking           p l a c e at      the L e p p i n g s        Lane      e nd

and    sti ll      we       could       neither             pass        or    receive          messages            on     the C . X . D

channel.

At    around 3.05                p.m.       it w a s        apparent             t ha t     something             was     taking      p l a ce

inside      the        ground          to    the a n n o y a n c e            of      the N o t t i n g h a m       Forest         f an s    wh o

were    booing          strongly.                We w e n t        to a t u r n s t i l e           nearby where              we     saw

Police      Constable              1032 Pitt                i nside.             He    told       us    t h at     there      ha d    been a

pitch     i n v a s i o n at           the L e p p i n g s           Lane        end.         Detective            Constable          Dynes

climbed      over           the    turnstile                and      entered           a gangway.

On Detective                Constable             Dynes         returning              to m e we            both     returned         to

was    l a te r    to       unfold.              A short           time       after         th is      we    saw P o l i c e       vehicles

arriving          at    the       ground and                it w a s         obvious         that       something            serious         had

occurred.              We    decided             to    return           to    the      Police          gym    to     find     out     if we

could assist.                    The    turnstiles                 at     the S p i o n        Kop were            now     empt y.

On    entering          the       g y m we w e r e            told        that        persons          had    been        c r u s h e d at       the

Leppings          Lane       terraces.                 There        was       talk         of m a n y       casualties          and

other       C.I.D.          officers.              Detective              Sergeant             Lindley        came       into     the    gym

and    there was             then        talk      of    o ver          eight       deaths.           It was       suggested            that

all    tables          were       removed          from          the a r e a        in    case      it w as       needed         to

receive          casualties.

Th e   g y m at        t h at     time      was     divided              by    n e ts     into      three        sections.            The

section          nearest          th e    entrance               wa s    occupied             by P o l i c e ,    th e    centre

section          had      tables         l ai d    out w h e r e          programme              sellers         were     counting

their       takings,             and     th e     far    secti on was                  unoccupied.               The     d e s c i s i o n was

made       t ha t    th e    first        area      be       used        for     the      dead and          the    second         area       for

the    injured.              Casualties             started              arriving             in the      gym,     within minutes

it wa s         obvious          dead     bodies         were           arriving          continually             and     injured

needed          urgent       medical            treatment.                Relatives              were also         entering           the

mood       of    some       of    t hem was         violent              but     understandable                  in the

circumstances.

I initially went                    to    the      middle           section where                  I did        everything            in my

p o w er    to      help     th e      injured,          amongst              them were            two     very    small         children

who    had       lost       relatives.

There       were       Police          Officers          present              who        ha d b r o u g h t      some    of    the

injured          in a n d        numerous         Fire           Officers,               but no m e d i c a l       officers.            I

strongly            remember           seeing       a    person           being          helped       by the       Police         and

F i re,     wh o     had     oxygen         in use           on him,           but       at     the     s ame     time     I was

shouted          over       by a n o t h e r      Police            Officer              who also         requested           the     use    of

oxygen.             I brought            this      to    the a t t e n t i o n            of     the F i r e      Officers,           but

was    told         they     only        ha d a c c e s s         to     one     oxygen          u ni t   and     that      if    they

took       it off         the m a n       he w o u l d           die.         I returned            to    the     other       officer

and    told         him     I was        unable         to       get     any more             oxygen.         I f el t      so    sorry

for    that         officer         and     I felt           a    little         useless,           where        were     the m e d i c a l

teams?

On    returning            to     t he      first        section        I could          not    believe          the a m o u n t         of

dead     bodies           which        h ad      been and        were     still          being       brought          in b o t h       by

civilians           and Police                Officers.            There       were       fans       in the       gym       demanding

to    see      or    identify            bodies,          people        being       resuscitated and                   people

weeping          over      th e    dead.            The    dead and           injured          were    being          brought          into

the    gym       on s t r e t c h e r s          and a dv e rt i si n g        boards.            There      was       nothing           I

could       do      for    those         people          I was     now    seeing,             they were a l r e a d y              dead.

At    s ome      time      we     were        instructed           that       one    Detective             must       go    to     one

uniform          officer          and       assist        with     property,             paperwork          and       placing          the

body     in a b o d y           bag,        placing        a number           on    each       bag.        The     bodies          were       to

be    placed         in    rows        of     12.        I went      to a u n i f o r m         officer          at    th e      far     end

of    the      gym and          that        was     to    be    body     1.        The    body was          t ha t     of a y o u n g

boy.        The      Police        Officer           was       crying     uncontrollably,                   I talked             to h i m

and    tried         to    hel p.           He    told me         how    he    had       carried       the       young        bo y     in,

that     he      ha d     tried        to     resuscitate            him,      but       he    had    died.           How     do      I even

start       to      tr y a n d      e x p la i n my        feelings           and    thoughts          at    that          tim e.            I

then moved              to a n o t h e r         body and         another          and    carried          out     this       duty,

continually               finding           Police        Officers        totally             destroyed and amongst

them     some        relatives              hugging        their        dead       relative.           There          were       at    th is

time     doctors           present            who    were       certifying           t h e m dead,          and       in t he         other

section          helping          the w o u n d e d .

On    completing            this         du ty,      w h e n all        bodies       had       been    numbered             and

b ag g e d ,     with      other         C.I.D.          officers,        I returned              to H a m m e r t o n R o a d

Police         Station,           this        being       after      gathering            relatives          who       were        looking

for    missing            relatives              onto     the F o r c e       coach.           Relatives           on arrival                at

Hammerton Road were                         taken        into     the    bo ys      c l ub w h i c h       had     been       opened

for    t hi s       purpose.

I then attended                   at     an      office        in H a m m e r t o n R o a d P o l i c e          Sta tio n where                  I

liaised with               other         officers          and     there       commenced             the    duty       of     speaking

to    relatives            and      recording             details        of m i s s i n g        persons.

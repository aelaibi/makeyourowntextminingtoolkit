 THERE WITHOUT TICKETS WHO ADDED TO THE PROBLEM AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE THERE.

 THERE IS DEFINITELY NOT ENOUGH TURNSTILES AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END OF THE

 GROUND TO ALLOW ACCESS FOR SUCH A LARGE CROWD.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE HATCH WAS STOPPED?

 AN ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE CROWD IN ORDER TO^k€TT THEM KNOW

 THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM.         THE CROWD WOULD HAVE LISTEJiHT AND THE POLICE

 WOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE TO DO OTHER THINGS.                T j ^ M E D I C A L FACILITIES IN THE

 GROUND WERE VASTLY INSUFFICIENT TO HELP               IN   IIS INCIDENT.    AN OVERALL VIEW

 IS THAT THE FANS WERE LEFT TO           AL WITi       'HE INCIDENT RATHER THAN THE.

 EXPERIENCE OF THE POLICE BEING D              f ED   TO GIVE FIRSTAftfT      NO O N E A P P E A R E D

 TJfeTAKE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION           THE DECISIONS>#Y POLICE MANAGEMENT WERE

 VERY POOR

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THAT THE ORIGINAL CHOICE OF THE GROUND WAS                      NOT THAT THE ENDS

 WERE WRONG BUT THE GROUND WAS WRONG.            THERE WERJc JUST NOT ENOUGH POLICEMEN

 IN THE GROUND AREA ON THE DAY.          THERE WEj6E M/NY ELSEWHERE BUT NOT ENOUGH IN

 THE VACINITY OF THE GROUND.         THE POLICE COMMUNICATIONS WERE BAD,               WHEN THE

 GATES WERE OPENED AND THAT WAS A GOOD DECISION,               NO ONE DEPLOYED OFFICERS TO

 P}iR
    ® W EeN T PEOPLE FROM ENTERING THE T U N N E L .

 I REMEMBER SEEING A POLICEWOMAN,          THAT I HAD        SEEN EARLIER ON OUTSIDE         THE

 LEPPINGS LANE END, SEARCHING PEOPLE INSIDE THE GROUND AT                   ABOUT    3 . 1Q PM (1510).

 SOMEONE MUST HAVE TOLD HER TO GO INSIDE THE                 GROUND WHEN, QUITE      CLEARLY THERE

 WAS A LARGE BUILD UP OF PEOPLE WHERE SHE HAD BEEN.

 IT APPEARED THAT THE POLICE WERE T O T A L U       INAWARE OF THE SITUATION, THEY DID

 NOT APPEAR TO KNOW WHAT WAS G<

 THEY APPEARED MORE CONCERNED JN STEPPING PEOPLE FROM GETTING ONTO THE PITCH

 THAN HELPING THE INJURED OR G E N I N G PEOPLE FROM THE TERRACES, THIS WAS LEFT

 MAINLY TO THE FANS.

 G55

 I VISITED THE SAME VENUE LAST YEAR Al^iC THE POLICE PRESENCE WAS MUCH MORE

 EVIDENT.    THEY WERE CHECKING FANS FOR TICKETS PRIOR TO THE GROUND AND

 TURNING NON TICKET HOLDERS A W A Y . / I FELT THAT THE CROWDS OUTSIDE THE

 TURNSTILES WERE ORGANISED M U C K 3 E T T E R LAST YEAR, THERE WAS OR APPEARED TO BE

 MUCH LARGER POLICE PRESENCE.           I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT THE POLICE WERE MORE

 CONCERNED IN GETTING THE PEOPLE INTO THE GROUND FOR THE KICK OFF RATHER THAN

 ASKING FOR A POSTPONEMENT AND ORGANISING THE CROWDS MORE EFFICIENTLY.

 T l ® POLICE DID NOT APPEAR PREPARED FOR THE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ARRIVING

 LATE.     I BELIEVE THAT THE ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TICKET ALLOCATION WAS

 TOTALLY WRONG.

 SOMEBODY,    IT DID NOT MATTER WHO, SHOULD HAVE REALISED JUST HOW FULL THE PENS

 WERE AND ACTED TO PREVENT IT.     APART FROM THE CENTRAL PENS BEING FULL, THE

 SIDE TERRACING WAS EMPTY AND THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTICED.

 THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS INCORRECT.          LIVERPOOL HAVING A BIGGER GATE THAN

 FOREST SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED MORE TICKETS AND THE HOP END.

 I FEEL THE POLICE MAY HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY COMPLACENT AS THE SAME MATCH LAST

 YEAR WENT OFF WITHOUT INCIDENT.

2 PEOPLE CAME ONTO THE PITCH THROUGH THE GATES AT THE                            ONT OF THE PENS (3 &

4).      THEY LOOKED A BIT WOB£           ON THEIR FEET BUT THE                CE OFFICERS ON THE

PERIMETER         PUSHED THEfc/BACK IN.           O

AT ABOUT 3.30PM         (15*50> ABOUT 200 POLICE F ORMED A ^ O R D O N ACROSS THE^*1TCH WHICH

TOTALLY INADEQUATE TO DEAL WITH SO MANY INJURED. ALSO - THERE SEEMED A GREAT

SHORTAGE OF SPECIALIST EQUIPMENT TO RESUSCITATE THOSE IN NEED.

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING T£JAf YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIR)

LAST YEAR POLICE STOPPED US 10 MILES FROM HILLSBOROUGH AND CHECKED THE COACH

FOR BEER/AND TICKETS. THOSE WITHOUT TICKETS WERE ASKED TO LEAVE THE COACH AND

t jjjh   DljKENK WAS CONFISCATED.       THIS DID NOT HAPPEN THIS YEAR. WE WERE STOPPED

RIGHT OUTSIDE THE GROUNQ^AiMD THE POLICE ONLY CHECKED FOR B E E R . Wg^WERE NOT

ASKED IF WE HAD TICK&TTS

LAST YEAR THERE u d s A LARGER POLICE PRESENCE OUTSIDE T                          TURNSTILES.      WE WERE

FILTERED TOWARDS THE CORRECT TURNSTILES IN ORDERLY/QUEUES - THERE WAS NO

PUSHING OR >^HOVING AND WE HAD ARRIVED QUITE LATE AT THE GROUND - ABOUT

2,45PM      (1445).   I CAN'T REMEMBER         IF WE WENT IN AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END THOUGH

OR THE OPPOSITE END - OUR SEAT WAS IN THE NORTH STAND.

I D I D N ’T SEE ANY MOUNTED POLICE OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES AND FEEL THAT THERE

SHOULD ALWAYS BE TWO OR THREE OF THEM TO ASSIST IN MARSHALLING THE CROWDS.

                                                                                 GSL3G42

 SOME OF MY FRIENDS WHO WENT IN THE CENTRAL PENS AT THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACES

 LAST YEAR HAVE TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS SEVERE CRUSHING THEN AND MANY OF THEM

 DECIDED THIS TIME TO GO INTO THE END PENS TO AVOID THE EXPECTED REOCCURRENCE.

 I UNDERSTAND THAT LAST YEAR STEWARDS WERE AT THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE,          DIVERTING

 FANS TO THE END TERRACES WHEN THE CENTRAL PENS BECAME TOO FULL.

 FRIENDS HAVE TOLD ME THIS YEAR THAT THERE WERE NO STEWARDS OR POLICE AT THIS

 POINT.   I THINK THAT THE LATE ARRIVAL OF FANS AT THE GROUND WAS NOT A

 CGNTRIBUTARY FACTOR     IN THE TRAGEDY. FANS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ARRIVE AT ANY TIME

 AND EXPECT TO GET INTO THE GROUND SAFELY IF THE POLICE ORGANISATION IS

 EFFICIENT.

 AT^ABOUT 4.5PM (1605) WHEN I GOT BACK TO THE COACH I SPOKE TO TWO POLICE

 Om:CERS.     THEY SAID "I BELIEVE THERE HAVE BEEN QUITE A FEW INJURIES".

 I THEN SAID,    "THERE WAS ABOUT 40 PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED - H A V E N ’T YOU GOT A

 R A D I O . " THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD      AS ONLY INSPECTORS ANE^ABOVE WERE   ISSUED

 WITH RADIOS.    I FEEL THAT ALL FELICE     OFFICERS INVOLVEj^fN THE MATCH, EITHER

 INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE GROUj^D SHOULD BE EQUIPPED JrfiTH RADIOS TO MAINTAIN

 CONTACT WITH THEIR SUPERIORS AT         ALL TIMES.   ^

 GATES AT TOP & BOTTOM OF TERRACING.

 6.    PERIMETER FENCING SHOULD BE REDESIGNED.

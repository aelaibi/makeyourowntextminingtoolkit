Inquiry into the
  Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
50 Queen Anne's Gate
LONDON SW1H 9AT

Dear Mr Whalley

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

The Royal Institution has carefully considered Lord Justice Taylor's
invitation to send a written submission to the Inquiry on the needs for
crowd control and safety at sports grounds. However we do not feel that
we have particular expertise to draw on in this matter and will not
therefore be responding.

Yours sincerely




E M G Hewitt
Secretary
Building Surveyors Division

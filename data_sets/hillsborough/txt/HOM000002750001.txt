    Many thanks for your letter of 18 April with which you
enclosed a copy of your Department's guide to the establishment
and conduct of a public enquiry into a major disaster. This will
be very helpful to those setting up the enquiry into the
Hillsborough disaster, and the Home Secretary is very grateful to
your Secretary of State for sending this to us.

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND DISASTER
In    view of theestablishment by the Home     Secretary of a
Public   Inquiry   into  the  tragedy at Hillsborough Football
Ground,   my ^ Secretary of State has asked me to offer the
attached guide to the establishment and conduct of a public
inquiry into a major disaster.

The guide has been based on the experience of the Secretariat
appointed by the Department to support the formal invesLigation
into the fire at King's Cross.    Although it has been prepared
for    use by this   Department in any future major   disaster
the principles    and requirements are likely to be of more
general application.

    is already being used for the      investigation  into the
rail disaster at Clapham and at an earlier stage was offered
to,    andmaterially assisted, those concerned with  the PiDer
Alpha disaster.

MySecretary   of State hopes    it may be of some assistance
to your officials responsible   for the Hillsborough Football
Ground inquiry.

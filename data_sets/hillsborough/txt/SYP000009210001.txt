not    feel        any       pulse,    there were    fans a ro un d me asking            us to do all we

could for him.                    After about      the eight minutes           had elapsed a w h ee le d

a m b ul a n c e    trolley stretcher            came a l on gs id e    us.         There were     fans with

this     trolley,             I c a n ’t remember    seeing any a mbulance             persons wit h          it.

I still       hads^the resuscitator                on his face,,       this    casualty was        placed

onto     the t ro ll e^N^nd w h ee l ed away,              I a c co m p a n i e d this    casualty to the

a m b u l a n c e w hich was           parked at    point E as ma rk ed on the H i l l s b o ro u gh

G r o u n d Map         .     There     was an a mb ulance     crew there and

I left the              resusated with the a m bu la nc e         crew and          casualty C and

returned back                 into t he ground.



I then went              to    casualty D as ma rk ed on the H i l l s b o ro u gh ground map

where S t a t i o n Q ff fieer                      and F i re ma n                  were having

d if f i c u l t y with a resuscitator,               it was failing           to    provide    sufficient

pressure,           we a tt e mp t ed to       replace   the oxygen          cylinder twice,        checking

the valves              seals etc.,       but the unit       failed to work           properly.        S ta t io n

Officer                        then    instructed Fireman                      and myself       to obtain a

hoarding           to    carry     casualty D off.           I w ould describe           casualty D as a

white male about middle 2 0 ’s, average                        height and of slim build,                  I

d i d n ’t notice what                colour   or styled hair         this    casualty had.          I c a n ’t

remember what he was wearing.



We o b t ained some              hoarding w hi ch was        lying about        on the    pitch,     we

r et urned to            casualty D,       he was    placed on the           hoarding,    he was     carried

off    by persons              I presumed were       fans,    in my opinion this           person was

dead.         He was           carried off      between the S pi on Kop and the N or th Stand,



At this       point           I noticed a nothe r c o n s c ^ ^ s      casualty be i ng        car r i ed on

something,              as              1 it was a hoarding,           I helped the       persons wit h

this    casualty to              carry him between the two stands                   of the Kop and N or th

St an d and around             into    the gyirhsasiurn, where a person who             I presumed

to be a doctor            took over.



I. noticed that as we went                  into the gym that         inside    the gym was

divided         into three sections.               All    the bodies were       in the first

sect io n with many             policemen      in attendance.          The    conscious and

injured         casualties were          in the    centre     section.



I then went         to the       centre     section of the gym wh                   nded to      two

injured an           nattended          casualties          One    of these    casualties had an

injured knee,            the    other    I c a n ’t remember       the extent    of his    injuries,

but    the      injuries       to both were what          I considered       relatively minor,         I

sa ti sf ie d myself           they were     not   in shock and not          in need of any

immediate attention.                    Fol lo wi ng    this our    crew were    called together            in

the    gy m .



After about         five minutes           I was   beckoned by a doctor who was asking                     for

oxygen,         I went and fetched a resuscitator w hi ch happened to be nearby

a nd took        it over       to him.       I had to show the doctor            how to get      the

oxygen to the mark whic h the doctor                       then used on a conscious         casualty.

This    casualty was a white male,                     early 2 0 ' s and was    being   given drugs

intraveniously.                 I c a n ’t recall      any other     details    of his appearance.

I helped         place   this     c as ualty onto an a mb u la n ce      trolley and      took    him to

an amb ul an ce as ma rk ed E on map.



I returned         to the gym and a ss is t ed to             place a casualty with what           I was

told was a back            injury onto an amb ul an ce             trolley,    I also   took him to

an ambulance.              This       casualty was       in his    late 30* s , a white male,          of

heavy build.             I c a n ’t remember what he was wearing.

              Our    crew had     re-grouped again at this time    in the gym, 'we mads     up a

              resuscitatxjr and          returned to our fire appliance.   We   left^the    ground

              at about        1630hrs.

  NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                    Date              19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.

3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
   >applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                          Re
     C.D. died from the industrial disease of

     C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
     on drugs.

     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                    Cause o f death
     care/self-neglect1).

  b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
    infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
    of the following forms be adopted:

     C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
     his/her mind was disturbed).

     C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
     induced abortion.                                                    Verdict
     C.D. died as the result of an accidenl/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.

  c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
    it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.
  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
    complete the remainder of the form.

       Dear Sirs,

       Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOV EMBER 1990.



       If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
       of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
       on the 19th of November 1990 at 10. a.m. Details of venue will be n o t i f i e d in
       due course.

       I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
       evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
       coronal investigation w hich you wi ll recollect is not adversarial but
       inquisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

       Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
       under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
       witnesses who wis h to give evidence.         I am at pres ent engaged in consi d e r i n g
       this and in determining who I w i s h to invite to attend.

       W i t h o u t prejudice in any way to m y rights in the matter, I a m w r i t i n g to you
       to give you an opportunity to d r a w to my a ttention the names and o t h e r
       appropriate details of any witness or witnesses w h o m you would like me to
       c o n si der calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

       May I please ask you in considering whether you w i s h to dr aw any names                     to m y
       attention, to bear in m ind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

       I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
       names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the d e c i sion as
       to who to call to give evidence is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

       I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
       h ear d from you by the end of September I w i l l assume you have no names to
       submit

        As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
        Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
        be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
        on the 15th of January 1990*

        I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
        has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
        behalf . In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
        Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

        I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
        Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
        he may wish to undertake.

        I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
        or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
        matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
        a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
        on this matter further.

         I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
         is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
         fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

        Yours faithfully,



         S.L.Popper,

I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem

              consslling of the deceased's relatives or for nroper
              legitimate purposes in connes&ion with any legal proceedings
              in which solicitors may be engaged.

            1991 RUGBY WORLD CUP: ALL SEATER STADIA
            1. You asked for advice on the attached letter from Ray Williams
            concerning all seater stadia.

            2. I have discussed this with David Peters in the Home Office who
            advised that although HO junior Ministers have agreed that the
            all seater stadia recommendation in the Taylor report should not
            apply to Rugby Football, the Home Secretary has not yet taken a
            final decision. The intention is to make the announcement on the
            wider application of all seater stadia through an inspired PQ,
            which Mr Peters thinks is likely to be some time in January.

            3. I attach a reply for you to send to Mr Williams which I have
            cleared with Mr Peters.

    Thank you for your letter of 10 December and for your kind words
    about the Working Group's contribution to RWC 1991. As I said at
    our wash-up meeting on 2 December, I am delighted that the
    tournament was such a success.
    With regard to your question about all seater stadia, the
    position is that Ministers are still considering the wider
    application of the recommendation in the Taylor report concerning
    all seater stadia. However, as my colleague David Peters
    mentioned at the above meeting, we are hopeful that Rugby
    Football will not have to comply with this recommendation, but I
    must stress that this is an informal view and not one which we
    would wish to receive public circulation. We are hopeful,
    however, of an early decision and I will ensure that you are
    among the first to know.

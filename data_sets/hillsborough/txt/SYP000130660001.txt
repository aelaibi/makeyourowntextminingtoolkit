The a d m i n i s t r a t i v e     system adopted was                based on the       former     County

of an Officer working Party at w hich bi-annual                                   inspections         of sports

grounds were                 carried out and m eetings                of the Working P arty           on other

Dccasions          to        discuss     various m a 1 1 e r s .

Also     i n atten d a n c e w ould             be myself       and    representatives of the Club.

Inspection          involved a            t h o rough check          of the stadia and the

i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of any        defects..          Any defects        found were brought         to   the

steps were then ag r e e d                 for     rectification.

The Officer             Working Party meetings                    comprised     representatives          of the

same    organisations but                  representatives of the Clu b or their technical

The Officer           Working Party,            post April         1986     <000486),        considered ail

consistent a p p r o a c h was m a i n t a i n e d to              current       issues.       For    example       the

could     cover      any   issue     in relation to safety                   of sports        grounds,        examples

of    issues     i n which the work i n g              party did make            r e comrne ndat i tins to the

the Panel,

Minutes        of the Officer             Work i n g Party were            takers by me due               to my

occasion d e m anded a l t h o u g h            in practice           this    did    not arise            very often,

owing      to the smooth o p e ration of the Working Party,

Re g a r d i n g   the       reduct ion of Barrier             144,    this arose at the                  bi-annual

1986      <070886>.            R e p r e s e n t a t i o n was made     by the Police           for two       sections

of the       barrier          in the S o u t h Central          Pen to be          removed so that            persons

e cite ri ng the         ter race     from the tunnel            would       not    be obstr u c t e d by it.

According          to the P o iice         some      difficulties          had a risen         in cn i s area,

During       the    course       of the      discu s s i o n    in regard to the reduction                        of the

barrier        1 am unable           to   recall whether any m e n t i o n was made                        on the

It will       be noted that                there are minor                di f f e r e n c e s    Detween the

The   signif i c a n t      changes aris i n g         from the    review were that          the Hea l t h

and Consumer Services                Depar t m e n t    now had a role,          the    inspection system

was made annual             (instead of bi-annual ) arid included                      inspections        during

s p ecified a c t i v i t i e s .     The     practical     effect     of the      change    to the

inspection system was                that writ t e n      reports     were      s u b mitted by each

author ity to Head            of A dmin arid Legal          Depa r t m e n t    following an

replaced       by the Sa f e t y of Sports             Grounds A d v i s o r y Group.        As    the     report

says;      Thiss-

"would f u n ction as a forum for disc u s s i o n                  between officers?             its most

regular      use w ould       probably        be the d i s c u s s i o n of     items    of advice        to the

Council      before      they are       finally formulated            by the appropriate

Authority.           Meetings     of the G roup would be held at                   the    request       of one

or more Author i t i e s         and on       receipt     of a request          the Head of

meeting a further             list    of    items would        be prepared and           the details        of

a c t i o n a g r e e d to be taken by each A u t h o r i t y w o u l d be              noted.     it     is then

a n t ic i p a t e d that   d e t ailed w r i t t e n advice w ould            be provided      by each

d iscipline and          be a c t e d upon as appropriate.

In a d d i t i o n   the Head of A d m i n i s t r a t i o n and Legal           D e partment     will     keep

copies     of all       relevant      correspondence w hich will                 be a v ailable     to all

The   roles of the various a g e ncies were also                       s i mplified       from those

previously           laid down      in the schedule         referred to          (Ref DMBb).        1hus the

Bu i l d i n g S u rveyors D e p a r t m e n t    had r e s po ns i b i 1 i ty relating      to the

I n t e r p r e t a t i o n of the         phrase     "routine m a t t e r s "    is a matter           for

individual             judgement        to be e x ercised          in the    ci rcurostances       of a

very similar              to that       in other       licensing       systems     operated       by the

Council.           It is       in no way exceptional.                  Taking account          of my

re s p o n sibilities            as Chief L i censing Officer,                I operated the bay to bay

As far as          I am       concerned        the members          of the Officer          Working F a r t y and

subsequently              the A d v i s o r y Group were           regarded as the C o u n c i l "s source

Bearing        in mind my          c o m m e n t s , issues       (a)    to   (g) are       technical          issues

nothing        to add.,          With     regard to        issues       (e) and      (f)    I am aware          that

allegations            have      been made       that      the    certificate         should       (for' example)

have     specified          capacities          for    the    pens on the           terraces.         At      no ti.me

prior        to April       1989       (000489)       has anyone         s u ggested       to me    that       capacities

should        be     imposed       in respect of the             pens.        Had such        a s u g g e s t i o n have

been made            I would have           taken approp r i a t e a c t i o n        (as     I did for         example

in relation to the S p i o n K o p ).                      Those       changes      that had been m a d e , in

that     annual       inspections        are appropr i a t e „           (Paragraph 4),

F rom    1 January       1988     (000 188)       two more duties were added to the                           list       by

The Home Office              issued st a t u t o r y guidance            on annual        i n s p e c t i o n s , see

Home Office Circular                 72/1987      (000087)      (Ref DM813)            (Ex            ) w hich       I

produce.            The Guidance       clearly       refers     to a limited            inspection,.

Bearing        in mind these          facts      there     is clearly       no oblig a t i o n on the

council        to    carry out        the    type of survey         en v i s a g e d    in the question.

Bearing        in mind that           the    same author i t i e s       personnel        were involved            pre

and     post    1 April       1988    (G00486)       it would also          have       been unre a s o n a b l e         to

carry out a survey.                  Also     no a u t h o r i t y has    indicated that            such a survey

would     be appropriate.

The me t h o d       by w hich    I arranged         for    reasonable         safety to be m o n i t o r e d at

Sports Grounds           in S h e f f i e l d    contained three main elements.                         The    first

element        is    inspections            of Sports Grounds       by professional              officers,

these are well           documented             x n the files.       line second element was                   me

written        c o m munications            to wo r k i ng party memb e r s         in early      iv8 7 <0 U 0 0 8 7)

asking     for       their    views         on sports ground safety             in Sheffield,            ali

c o m m unications are ava i l a b l e            if required.           The    third element was                  the

review of the Safety                  of Sports Grounds           sy s t e m   covered        i n the    report          to

the Gener al Pur poses                Fane 1 i nSeptember           1987    (000987)          (Ref DMB        /)

(Ex             ).

Had any of the experts                 identified any           issues      relating          to reasonable

safety then the system                 I nave outlined should have                      encou r a g e d them to

raise     them arid have          them       resolved.       There are         examples        of such        issues

on the A d v i s o r y G roup         notes.        It    is also    relevant          to note that           it    is

the duty of           profess ional         officers       involved       in any Lic e n s i n g S y s t e m         to

bring     safety       issues     to the a t t e n t i o n of the Lic e n s i n g Authority.                        I am




                                                                                                                   103
aware      that        the G r e e n Guide      does       have a relevance           to   reasonable         safety

issues as does                other    gui d a n c e .

Regardi ng a m e n d m e n t s         to S a f e t y Cert i f i c a t e s my view         is that       it    is    not

n e cessary to physically alter                       or a mend the original               certificate

document.              Where a m e n d m e n t s are made         by the     counci 1 in a c c o r d a n c e with

l egislation            it is sufficient            that     notice      procedures as          specified           tin

the Sa f e t y of Sports Grounds Regulations)                             are    followed.          inis      involves

not i f y i ng by letter              various     parties        involved a fid not i ces          i n the Press.

Wi t h    regard to the            increase       in capacity for           the Spion Kop this

procedure was              followed with the exc e p t i o n of the                   notice      in the      press.

As    part of the third element                     referred        to   previously the Sa f e t y

Ce r t i f i c a t e    conditions were           reviewed        on two separate            o c c a s i o n s , the

second and most d e t ailed                   draft      being    circu l a t e d    to the autnori ties tor

comment on 30 March                   1989    <300389),          I produce       trie letter,        to the Chief

Fire Officer,              together with          the draft         conditions        (Ref DMB 9)          (fcx            >.

occurring          on the       15 April       1989 <150489).

The Counc i1 as the               licensing a u t h o r i t y have a duty la enforce w i t h i n

I recall      that in February/March 1986 (00OHS6)                        (0003S6)    I spoke to Mr

VAUGHAN of the County Council who was then dealing with the Safety of

Sports Grounds,          at his offices           in Barnsley.          I also spoke to the Polic

and the Fire Service and Building Surveyors about Safety of Sports

Grounds.        I did not       receive any information to the effect that any

serious safety issues were outstanding.

In order to establish a framework within which Sheffield City Council

could exercise          its functions which would be acquired on 1 April                             1986

(0104-86)     I prepared a report which was submitted through the Head of

Department*        to the General Purposes Panel which was a sub committee of

the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee

(referred hereafter as MEGS) which is in turn a Committee of the City

Council.        The report was submitted to the Panel                         on 3 March 1986

At its meeting on 3 March             1986 (030386)   the Panel    resolved in

accordance with the report.              The minutes of the Panel were subsequently

approved by MEGS at its meeting on 17 March               1986 (170386).     In turn the

minutes of MEuS were approved b y            the City Council at its meeting on 9

April   1986 (090486),,         I produce an extract from the Council Summons

dated 9 April        1986 (09Q4fc>6) which contains these minutes         (Ref DMB2.1

(Ex         >.

As from the 9 April        1986 (090486)      the delegations approved by the Panel

came into full       legal effect.

All the County Council          files    (which consist of some thousands of

documents and plans)        ;i.n relation to Sports Grounds         in Sheffield were

handed over to me on the demise of the County Council.                   Consequently I

was able to examine their administrative system more thoroughly before

mak i ng a f urthe r report to the P a n e 1.

The Council       now having acquired the functions,          it was necessary to

establish an administrative system within which it could fulfil                    its

functions under the legislation.              To achieve this      I prepared a further

and more detailed report which was submitted via the Head of

Department to the Panel             on 6 May 1986 (060586).       I produce the report

(Ref D M B 3 ) (Ex         ).

The Panel    considered the          report at its meeting on 6 May 1986 (060586)

and resolved       (amongst other things),       "that

a5           the broad ou 1 1 1 nes of the administrative system organised by

             the former South Yorkshire County Council               under the Safety of

            Sports Grounds Act           1975 (000075)   be noted and authority be

             given for the continuation of such system for the time

             be ing ."

The   resolution also deals with other non material matters.

As the Panel          had fuli. de l9gated power to deal with this                      issue the

r e s o 3.u t io n t o o k e f f e c t x iviffied ia t e 1y .

As a matter of rout inf:? the minutes of the Panel meeting were seen by

MEGS and the City Council.                      I produce an extract from the Council

Summons dated 4 June                1986 (040636) which contains these minutes                   (Ref

D M 6 4 ) (Ex             ).

The -administrative system adopted was based, on the former County

Council      system and comprised two main components.                          These were meetings

of an Officer Working Party at which bi-annual                              inspections of sports

grounds were          carried out and meetings of the Working Party on other

occasions to discuss var ious mat,ters ..

Dealing with the bi-annual                    inspections these were carried out by

representatives of the Police,                       the Fire Service and the Building

Surveyors Division of the City Council.

Also    in attendance would be myself and representatives                           of the Club.

Inspection involved a thorough check of the stadia and the

identification of any defects.                         Any defects found were brought to the

attention of the Safety Certificate holder and/or his technical

representative            if present.           Depending upon the nature of any defect

steps were then agreed for rectification.

The Officer Working Party meetings                              comprised representatives of the

same organisations but representatives of the Club or their technical

advisors were not members of it.                          Dr EASTWOOD and/or a representative

of his firm and/or of the Club could of course be present during

inspections and during General Purpose Panel meetings when relevant

issues were being discussed.                        I do not recall        inviting Dr EASTWOOD,        et

to attend Working Party or Advisory Group meetings.

Examination of Officer Working Party minutes                              pre 1 April    '1986 (010486;*

show that on occasions either Dr EASTWOOD and/or his representative

and/or a representative of the Club attended meetings.                                  I am unable to

or Club representatives                in the Working Party system prior to 1 April

1986    (010486).

Ihe Officer Working Party,                  post April     1986    (000486 ) , considered -all

provision of disabled facilities                     in the North Stand at Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club,                which involved the construction of ramps etc.

In adopting the administrative system from the County Council the role

of the constituent agencies was divided and defined in accordance with

a schedule drawn up by the County Council.                          This gave responsibility

for "the       carrying out of inspections,                re inspections and making final

technical       recommeridat ions . . ." to 'primary author it ies * .                    I-or example

the    'Primary Authority'             for the spacing and strength of barriers and

strength jf perimeter walls arid terraces                       (structural) was the building

surveyor and for terraces                 (means of escape)          the Fire Service.

The Council was the prime authority for estimation of safe ground

capacity.         I produce the schedule which was in force until                            1987

(000087)       (Ref D M B 5 ) (Ex              ).

As part of the admi n.i s t rat ive arrangements the Officer Working Party i

addition to making "agreements"                     (for example         in respect of work to be

carried out)         could make        recommeridations to the Panel.                  Recommendations

could cover any issue in relation to safety of sports grounds,                                      example

of issues       in which the working                party did make recommendations to the

Panel     involved the South Stand roof and the Spion Kop (both of which

a r e a t t h e H i.11 s b o r o u g h B ta d iu m ) .

If the Working Party were unable to reach agreement on any matter then

it would be referred to the Panel.                       If the Club refused to implement

something agreed by the Working Party then this would be referred to




                                                                                                       168

Regarding the reduction of' Barrier                    144, this arose at the bi-annual

i.nspect ion attended by t i'ie various agenc ies at Hi 1 lsbor 0 ugh on 7 Augu.s

1986 (070386).             Representation was made by the Police for two                      sections

Following discussion it was agreed by the Officer Working Party that

the barrier be reduced.                   In attendance at the time that the discussion

were taking place were                  representatives of EASTWOODS on behalf of the

Club,    although I am unable to name the i ndi v i.dual (s ) .

During the course of the discussion in regard to the reduction of the

barrier     I arn unable to recall whether any mention was made on the

question of crowd capacity of this part of the ground.                                 My personal

notes taken at the time are not available.

So far as       I am      concerned the working party arrived at an"agreement"

which was wholly consistent with past practice and the administrative

procedures b r i e f l y      described in the report of 6 May 1986 (060586).

Such    'agreements*        were expires sly authorised by resolution 4(a/                     of the

General Purposes Panel meeting held on 6 May 1986 (060586).

In the period after May                  1986 (000586) a review was                carried out by my

department of the administrative system relating to safety of sports

grounds.       As part of this review consul tation took place with the

Police,     the Fire,       the Building Surveyors Department arid the Health and

Consumer Services Department                   (of the Council).           This      led to a draft

"would function as a forum for discussion between officers?                                its most

regular use would probably be the discussion of items of advice to the

Council       before they are finally formulated by the appropriate

Authority.             Meetings of the Group would be held at the request of one

or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the Head of

Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and.

despatch a list of items to be discussed.                          At the conclusion of the

meeting a further list of items would be prepared and the details of

action agreed to be taken by each Authority would be noted.                                  It is then

anticipated that detailed written advice would be provided by each

discipline and be acted upon as appropriate.

In addition the Head of Administration and Legal Department will keep

copies of all            relevant      correspondence which will be available to all

participants            in t h e Gr o u p .1'

The roles of the various agencies were also simplified from those

previously laid down in the schedule                       referred to (Ref DM85).            1 hus the

Building Surveyors Department had responsibility relating to the

Dealing with the de iegation given by the Pane A to the Head of

Administration and Legal Department                  in relation to “routine" matters.

Interpretation of the phrase                 "routine m a tt er s” is a matter for

i nd iv idua I. j udgeme nt       to h e   exercised, in the c i r cum stances of a

particular           case.     Generally the operation of this delegated power                    is

very similar to that- in other licensing systems operated, by the

Council.         It is in rto way exceptional.             Taking account of my

responsibilities as Chief Licensing Officer,                      I operated the day to day

runriing of the system on behalf of the head of Administration and Legal

De p ar tm en t.       Mr PEN3AM,     ’
                                      now retired,    was the Head of the Department

during      1986/89 (000086)           (000089) and his assistant Head of Department

was Mr WEBSTER.

This administrative system was in force at the time of the Hillsborough

Disaster on 15 April              1989 (150439).

As far as            I am concerned the members         of the Officer Working Party and.

subsequen11y the Advisory Group were regarded as the C ou n c i l ’s source

of professional advice                in relation to Safety of Sports Grounds matters,.

The methods of communi cat ion between the authorities                        comprising the

Advisory Group were genara 1 ones,                 te 1 ephone , meet ings , rriemos and

specifically recall any particular issues raised in the files and this

includes the erection of radial fences                               in the West      ie r races    in 1981

(000081) and 1983 (GOODS:;-) or the crushing                             in the terraces           in 1981

(000081).

On 1 April          1986 (010486)            bearing      in mind that the Safety of Sports

Ground system had been operated for a considerable                                    length of time by a

responsible body (.South Yorkshire County Counci 1 ) » I was entitled to

nothing to add.            With regard to issues                  <e > and   <f ) I am aware that

allegations          have been made that the certificate should                          (for example)

have specif ied capacities for the pens on the terraces.                                    At no time

prior to April          1989 (000489)          has anyone suggested to me that capacities

should        be imposed in respect of the pens.                      Had such a suggestion have

been made        I      would have taken appropriate action                      (as1 did for example

in relation to the Bpion Kop).                      Those changes that had been made,                        in

particular I am thinking of the erection of radial fences                                    in the West

T e r r a c e , in 1981    (000081) and 1983 (000085),                   which could have an effect

on capacity,         were not. brought to my attention either.

I have also been asked to comment on the questions,                                 "Did the Council

undertake a full survey of each sports ground in Sheffield after                                         1

Up to 1 January           1988 (010188)          the duties of the Council were set out                           in

the Safety of Sports Grounds Act                      1975 (00007b)          (as am e n d e d ) .   1 hese

                                                                                                          174
inspections.           The    1976    (000076)   edition of the Green Guide suggests

that annual         inspections are appropriate.            (Paragraph 4).

From 1 January 1988 <GOG 188 > two more duties were added to the list by

the Fire Safety and Safely of Places of Sport Act                     1987 £000087)„       These

The Home Office           issued statutory guidance on annual           i ns pect ions, see

Home Office Circular 72/1987                (000087)    (Ref DMB13)   (Ex        ) which I

produce«        The Guidance          clearly refers to a limited inspection.

Gearing      in mind these facts there is clearly no obligation on the

council      to carry out the type of survey envisaged in the question.

Bearing      in mind that the same authorities              personnel were involved pre

and post       1 April       1983 <000486)       it would also have been unreasonable to

carry out a survey.               Also no authority has      indicated that such a survey

The method by which I arranged for reasonable safety to be monitored at

Sports Grounds           in Sheffield contained three main elements.              The first

element      is inspections of Sports Grounds              by professional     officers,

these are well documented                in the files.     The second element was the

written communicat ions to working                 party members   in early 1987' (00008/?

asking for their views on sports ground safety in Sheffield,                       all

communications are available                if required.     The third element was the

review of the Safety uf Sports Grounds system covered in the report to

the General Purposes Panel                in September    1987 (000987)     (Ref DMB 7)

(Ex            ).

Had any of the experts                identified any issues relating to reasonable

safety then the system I have outlined should have encouraged them to

raise them and have them resolved.                   There are examples of such issues

on the Advisory Group notes.                 It is also    relevant to note that      it is

the duty of professional                officers    involved in any Licensing System to

taring safety issues to the attention of the Licensing Authority.                          I am

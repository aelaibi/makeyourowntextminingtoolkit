Paul,

Can you sort out the briefing the Minister needs for a couple of Hillsborough interviews? I suspect he may do them on
Monday afternoon. Thanks.

Phil

Phil,

On the 3 bids you put to me yesterday....

The Minister has agreed to do both Granada TV and the Liverpool Echo about the 10th anniversary of the
Hillsborough disaster. He has, however, requested a briefing detailing the developments which followed the
disaster/report and the recent statements by the Home Secretary on the campaign to re-open the enquiry.

The Minister is content with the draft message for the Community Sports Leader Awards, but has made the one
change to the end of the third paragraph. This should now read...."The Community Sports Leader Awards may even
discover another Ryan Giggs!1’

Thanks.

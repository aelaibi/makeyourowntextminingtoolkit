 FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL - PROGRESS



 The Committee completed its consideration of Part I of the B U J
 (Which provides for the national membership scheme), this
 morning. We are now on Part II, which is the Home Office's
responsibility. The guillotine provides for Committee to finish
at lunchtime on Thursday but the Opposition seems largely to have
lost interest and we may yet finish this afternoon.


Confidential. The Home Office is expecting to receive Lor*
Justice Taylor's interim report next week. If they do, they „ m
 ry to publish it before the Home Secretary goes on leave at the
end of the week. They do not know what will be in it but the
expectation    seems   to   be   that   the   emphasis    will   be   on   what
 appened at Hillsborough and on possible short-term measures that
football clubs might take.

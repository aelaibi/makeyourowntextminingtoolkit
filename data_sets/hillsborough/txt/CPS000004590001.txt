   Dear Mr Kennedy

   Enclosed please find the copy of a letter dated 23 May 1990 from Messrs Davies
   Arnold and Cooper Solicitors, acting for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
   concerning removal of the remaining barriers and safety fence to the Leppings
   Lane terrace before the start of the 1990 football season.

   I have already replied acknowledging receipt of the letter indicating that
   before I respond I would wish to consult you concerning any objections you may
   wish to raise.  In this connection will you please let me have your views in
   writing before mid July 1990.

    From my point of view, I can see no valid reason for objecting to the
    proposals.

    Yours sincerely

      YOUR REF           LS/SA


      Dear Sir
      Hillsborough Disaster
      Further to my letter of the 17th May, X have been informed, by
      the Club that it is their intention to remove the remaining
      barriers and safety fence to the Leppings Lane terrace
      immediately before the start of the forthcoming season.
      The Club have already agreed to the removal of a further
      barrier from the ground for testing in accordance with the
      agreement reached between the experts in the litigation at
      their meeting on the 5th April, it is anticipated by the end
      of July/beginning of August, that these experts will have
      completed their enquiries for the purposes of preparing a
      report, and therefore from that point of view, there is no
      need for the Leppings Lane terrace to remain in its present
      state as the parties to the litigation will not be prejudiced
      by such works being undertaken. I have informed the parties'
      Solicitors of the Club's intentions in this regard, and have
      said quite clearly that the whole matter should be reviewed
      once again at the end of July when we have a much clearer
      picture of any potential problems that may be caused by these
      intended works.
      However, I am of course extremely conscious of any continuing
      interest your investigation team may have in the terrace
      remaining in its. present state, together with that of H.M.
      Coroner and the Crown Prosecution Service. I would ask you to
      confirm whether there is any objection to these works being
      carried out.    As stated above, the position needs to be
      reviewed at the end of July, but at this stage X would be
      grateful if you would indicate whether there is any continuing
      interest in the terrace.


                                                                                                                        Contd..

Dear Sirs

ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

We refer to the writer’s telephone call to Mr Croston on 21 December. You advised
that you had in draft form a response to our request in our letter o f 18 December and
that you expected to provide this to us no later than close of business on 24 December.
You had earlier spoken to HFSG and also Mr Shepherd o f Hammond Suddards and you
indicated that you were inclined to the view that it was inappropriate to give disclosure
until such time as the conclusion of the Judicial Review proceedings, the application for
which will include (at the suggestion of the Stipendiary Magistrate) that the Magistrates’
Court proceedings be stayed pending determination of the application for Judicial
Review.

Yours faithfully

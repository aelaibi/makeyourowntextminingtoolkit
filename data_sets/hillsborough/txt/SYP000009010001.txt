                On the     15 April      1989 <150489), my tour of duty was           12 midday to 12

                midnight     covering the         *C2' Sub Division CID.



                At 3.12pm       (1512)    on that date     I was at Rawmarsh Pol Stn when a call

                was   received to the effect that            ’Operation Support*       had been

                implemented calling for all Officers to attend at Hillsborough
                                                                   iLz-ZZ    ------
                Football ground.   In company w i t h /JC 2263 CHANG (POL PC2263) , I

                travelled to Hillsborough in a CID vehicle arriving at the Leppings Ln

                end of the ground at the same time as other 02 officers.                      PC Chang

                then went to park the vehicle and I ran into the area to the left of
                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                  S805

the Lappings Ln stand and made my w a / t o w a r d s      the Police Room

travelling under the main cantilever stand.                As 1 did so I could see

that there were a large number of drunken youths              in the vicinity and

hostilities were being d/r-scted towards uniformed officers.



On my arrival at the area near to the G y m n a s i u m , I saw numerous

i njured           being   carried into the gym on makeshift stretchers.

I could see that there were a number of persons who were obviously

dead.   I assisted in taking the injured into the gymnasium and was
                              1   (fSf 4
then directed to accompany a doctor on a quick round up of all injured

persons    in the gymnasium to ensure that all were           receiving medical

attention.      I was then joined by P C - g y n KELLY,       (POL P C 2 5 Q 3 ) , PC

CHANG and Inspector WEBSTER./^       f   t   7 6   )


                                                  ta.5feA.ci
We all then proceeded to the area at the rear of the Leppinqs Ln stand

to the outer fence, where I saw about twelve bodies laid together.

An officer was assigned to each body.              I checked my body for any

signs of life which was fruitless.



I conducted a search of the body in order to identify the person and I

provisionally identified the body as Thomas Steven FOX of

       3irkenhead? Wirral.    This   identification was made using a

membership card which carried a photograph of the deceased.                     All

property taken from the deceased was          listed and placed in a plastic

bag.      The body was labelled by myself.



Mr FOX was dressed in blue dg'nim  jeans and a blue striped shirt.                      1
                                    ----------------------------------

         have been approximately 4.10pm          (i6 i Q ).            The first time I saw Hr FOX

         was when I arrived behind the Leppings Ln stand and he was                            laid at the

         side of the fence.        I cannot state how the body arrived at that

         1ocation.

         I remained with the body and shortly after                      conveying it to the

         gymnasium via an ambulance.



         I remained at that location with the body and at 11.15pm (1115)                            that
                                                                                  rv'L'^'tr)    SS-z,i>
         d a t e , Mr FOX was formally identified to me by Mr John Michael P L E A V I N ,

         a friend of the deceased.



         I then accompanied the body to the Medical Legal Centre                       in Sheffield

         in an ambulance and the body and property were handed over to the

w ;            On'Saturday 9th April,    1988 (090488) my tour of duty was 8 am (0800
L ' £ f oS-
               hrs)   :< 7 pm (1900 hrs) working the FA cup semi final at Hillsborough

               the match being between Liverpool and Notts Forest.             Throughout the

               day I was engaged in duties at the Leppings Ln end of the ground.                My

               duties were to patrol that area on crowd control which included the

               searching of fans on entering the ground.           This was done at random but

               the nearer the time to the kick off at 3 pm (1500 hrs) the build up of

               fans was so great that this was      impossible to conduct.        During the

               build up to the match commencing I was also engaged in the checking of



               that there were numerous      persons who had not tickets



               Also during the build up say between 12 midday          (1200 hrs) and 3 pm
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                5805A

         (1500 hrs)    I saw numerous fans in the locality of the Leppings Ln end

         who had no intention of entering the ground early.         In fact numerous

         stated to     me that they were going to find public houses     away from the

         ground in     order to consume alcohol.   I can state that I    warned a

         number of     fans in that time period that   it would be better for them to

         enter the     ground at an early stage rather than leave   it   to just before

         the kick off.



         At no time did Police offic               corffon ac/oss the entrance to the

          .eppinqs Ln area of the qroun\|.

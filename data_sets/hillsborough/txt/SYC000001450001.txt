Meeting between HM Coroner Dr Popper and legal representatives of persons
who died at the Hillsborough Disaster


At 2 pm on Tuesday, 6 March 1990, HM Coroner for Sheffield, Dr Popper,
held a private meeting in the Coroner's Court, Medico-Legal Centre,
Sheffield to discuss interim measures with interested parties.


Dr Popper explained that although the court-room was being used
a judicial process was not taking place, quite simply the room and the
layout was suitable for the numbers and business involved.


Dr Popper asked the various people present to identify themselves which
they did as follows:-


    Mr Fraser, Solicitor for the Steering Committee, Liverpool
     Solicitors.   He represents about 150 practices of which about 50 were
     directly involved in litigation.   All told these practices represent
     the families of 92 of the deceased.


     Mr Gregory, Solicitor representing Sheffield City Council.


     Mr Peter Doyle, Solicitor? representing Sheffield Wednesday Football
     Club.


     Mr Callaghan, Solicitor? representing Trent Regional Health Authority
     and South Yorkshire Ambulance Service.


     Catherine Thorpe, representing Eastwood and Partners.


     Belinda Norcliffe, Legal Assistant, South Yorkshire Police.


     .........     Hillsborough Support Group.


     .........     (The man who came in late.    Details not obtained)

                             N
Also present were members of Sheffield City Council Social Services
Department.


Dr Popper asked if there were any relatives in the room who were not
represented by a solicitor       No-one indicated.
                                                       /Cont'd....
ACC Jones sat on the right of Dr Popper and was introduced as the
"Coroner's Officer" for the purpose of the inquiry.


Dr Popper explained that the purpose of the meeting was to seek the best
way forward for the bereaved families bearing in mind that the inquiry was
nearly a year old and they had not received, in an official sense, clear
explanations of where their loved ones died, how they died (in a
pathological sense), what efforts were made to revive them and where they
were identified.     He   explained thatif the authorities could somehow hold
a    "mini-inquest", it   would provide an interim stage in the proceedings, so
that the healing process for the bereaved could be brought one step nearer
a conclusion and that this would be of enormous help to the relatives.


Dr Popper said that this proposal did not mean that the DPP had
informed him of any decision.    He reiterated this again and explained that
the DPP has not, indeed could not quite simply because, as yet he did not
have the papers and would not for some time to come.    Because of this
prolonged phase of the inquiry he was proposing an interim step.


He explained that this present course of action was brought about by a
letter from Miss Steel who highlighted the advantages of allowing the
relatives an official explanation (albeit limited) of what had happened
without compromising the criminal inquiry that was taking place
simultaneously.


Dr Popper adumbrated three scenarios that would have to be followed if an
interim measure was not adopted.      They were:


1.   If a prosecution for a major offence was commenced (such as
     manslaughter) then the inquests would be adjourned in accordance with
     Section 16 of   the Coroners' Act and after the criminal prosecution it
     would be open to the Coroner toresume the inquests. Regardless of the
     Jury's verdict this was a practice not followed in his jurisdiction.


2.   If the DPP declined to prosecute for whatever reason, but a private
     prosecution was commenced, then the post trial circumstances described
     in (1) above would also apply.


3.   The DPP decides not to prosecute and no-one else does, then inquiries
     would be completed in the normal way via an inquest with a jury.


                                                       /Cont'd
It was explained that whatever the case, these would be lengthy procedures
and so an interim solution had been sought.   The DPP had been consulted
and, subject to any comments made by the representative parties today, the
"mini-inquest" interim measure would seem to offer some relief to the
families.


The inquests would seek to establish:
a. How the person arrived at the stadium.


b. Where they were in the stadium.


c. When they died.


d. Cause of death.


The sequence of events at the "mini-inquest" could take the following form:


a.   Prior to the inquest the Coroner's officer would prepare a summary of
     the case that was factual and non-adversarial.


b. After approval by the Coroner the summary would be offered to
     representatives of the deceased for their comments.


c.   Subject to the approval of the deceaseds' representatives the summary
     would be presented at the "mini-inquest" by a Summary Officer after
     evidence - probably written - from the pathologist as to the cause of
     death and injuries.   It was anticipated that Dr Forest and Professor
     Usher would give general evidence covering most of the cases in the
     first day or two of the "mini-inquests" so that their time at the
     hearings was reduced to a reasonable level.   If possible eight cases
     per day would be the objective of the interim inquiry.


     Cases would not be taken in numerical or alphabetical order because
     listing was seen to be a difficult problem in terms of minimising the
     waiting time for the families involved. It was hoped, that where several
     deaths related to the same family, these would be dealt with
     together regardless of the order that the pathologist examined the
     bodies.


     The Coroner reserved the right to set the order of cases according to
     the best interests of justice and with due regard for the feelings of
     the bereaved.
                                                           /Cont'd....
d. Plans and "Ana-Kappa" diagrams would be available to the representatives
     prior to the hearing but it was likely that these would be viewed at a
     time and place suitable to the Coroner's officer and the
     representatives.


e. Witnesses may be called to assist the Coroner and the Jury, but
     specifically no member of the South Yorkshire police force will be
     called to give evidence.


f. The use of video tapes or photographs would not be used as they have
     already been seen by the families and their representatives.


g.   Transcripts of the hearings would be made available but they would not
     be immediately transcribed, there will be delay, and there will be a
     charge.


Dr Popper summarised his proposals to the representatives and families
by saying that he was asking their approval to hold a limited inquiry
taking evidence in a particular form that would not obstruct the DPP's
options.     He asked if there were any questions.


Mr Fraser asked when the summaries would be available?    Dr Popper said that
they would be sent out in a steady stream as and when they became available
to him.    It was anticipated that the first drafts would be available in
the very near future.


Mr Fraser asked Dr Popper to specify the time period covered by the summary
and was told that it was hoped that each report would span the period from
when the deceased left home to when he or she was identified in the
temporary mortuary.     In some cases it would be possible to extend that
time span.


Dr Popper was at pains to point out that the short inquests would not deal
with how or why each person died.     He took time to explain that the
hearing would not admit evidence of a controversial nature or which was
critical of any person or which would imperil the scope of action that
the DPP might want to take. He said that this was not a new approach to
such cases. There have been precedents set elsewhere.



                                                       /Cont'd
Dr Popper then asked for the views of all those present.     Mr Fraser
expressed "a warm feeling for the idea" and commended the Coroner on his
pragmatism and his empathy with the deceaseds' families.     Other persons
present also indicated their approval for the proposal.     There were no
objections made at all.


Dr Popper proposed that the "mini-inquests" begin at 10.30 am on Wednesday,
18 April and thereafter at 9.30 am.     Sittings would be from Monday to
Friday, there would be coffee breaks for the families and lunch would be
taken at about 1 pm resuming at 2 pm.     Early estimates tended to indicate
that this stage would be completed by the 4 May but a few days have been
set aside from the 21         to deal with difficulties encountered in the
early hearings.


As far as scheduling the cases was concerned the Coroner proposed to give
provisional warnings.     Re-scheduling may be a major problem and so the
representatives were given notice that non-availability to attend the
hearing would need to be for an extremely persuasive reason simply because
the knock-on consequences for such a large operation may frustrate a great
deal of careful planning not only of the Coroner's arrangements but also
of the families involved.


The venue was proposed as the Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre which would be
too small on the first day but once the initial rush of press interest has
subsided will be eminently suitable for the families. Arrangements were
in hand to ensure that the press were given as much access as was
reasonably possible in the circumstances and the question of the venue for
the first day would be considered further.


Mr Fraser asked the Coroner to curtail the activities of the national and
local press as some of their comments had caused a great deal of distress
to the bereaved.   Dr Popper said that he fully understood the problem but
the press would flout any requests he made and that it was probably the
best course of action to say nothing.


Mr Fraser queried the Coroner's view on representation stating that as far
as the solicitors of Liverpool were concerned he would represent them but
some families may want their own solicitor there on the day.     Dr Popper saw
no problem with this.


                                                       /Cont'd
Mr Fraser thanked Dr Popper for the way he had proposed a sensible
modus-vivendi and in particular the way the officers from the West
Midlands Police had shown care and sympathy for the bereaved families.
Dr Popper thanked him for his kind comments.


Mr Callaghan queried whether attendance at the meeting today carried with
it an automatic right for audience at the "mini-inquests."   Dr Popper said
it did.


Mr Peter Doyle expressed thanks to the Coroner and promised the full help
and support of the football club throughout the difficult times to come.


Dr Popper closed the meeting by sending Superintendent Starkey to see if
any member of the press required a briefing in the presence of all those
who had taken part in the meeting.   After returning from the foyer
Superintendent Starkey said that no member of the press were in attendance.
                                           <
The meeting closed at 3.05 pm.

              Dear Mr. Popper,

                          Thank you for your letter of 15th June, 1989 confirming our
              telephone conversation last week.

                          I have discussed the matter with my colleagues on the Steering
              Committee and outlined the matters set out in your letter. We are all
              agreed that post mortem reports should be sent to the solicitor direct.

                          In relation to the various reservations that you have, these can
              be put into the next bulletin that goes to the members of the consortium and
              also it would probably be best to remind people of the reservations when
              they are sent to the individual solicitors.

                          In relation to the inquest, I reported to my colleagues that you
              had not yet decided upon what form the procedure would take and the view was
              that until we know what form it will take it will not be possible to
              formally state whether families will be individually represented or
              represented by the consortium through the Steering Committee.

                          I have passed on a copy of your letter to Miss Steel and I have
              no doubt that you will ask individual solicitors to write to you to let you
              know which estates are represented by whom.

                          Thank you for your prompt reply and I look forward to hearing
              from you again once you have made the decision in principle as to whether or
              not to release the post mortem reports.

                                                                  Yours sincer

       Suddards. A useful meeting was had with Dr Popper outlining to
       Messrs Fraser and Metcalf the conditions under which a limited
       inquest could proceed. Dr Popper recorded this discussion and,
       nodoubt, he will have made a note at the meeting of which we
       will have a copy in due course. I made a note of a number of
       points that were raised during the course of the meeting.

       1.    South Yorkshire Police Solicitors intend to pursue their
             civil action against the Club, Engineers and City Council,
             in the Civil Court at Manchester on Tuesday 27 February
             1990. They would hope to be able to achieve an adjournment
             of the proposed trial date of October 1990 as they will not
             be in possession of all the facts.

       2.    There is no intention at these limited inquests to go into
             why people died.

       3.    Hopefully the evidence brought out at the inquests will be
             able to indicate pain and suffering levels before death.
             This will help settle compensation claims.

       4.    We agreed that Dr Popper would send summaries of the
             evidence both to solicitors for the families and also to
             Hammond Suddards representing South Yorkshire Police.

       5.    The actual pathology reports would also be formally
             released.

       6.    We discussed the appropriateness of having some witnesses
             rather than all precis/summary/documentary evidence.

       7.    Mr Fraser described the problems that they were having in
             respect of the meeting of costs of bloc representation at
             the inquests. It seems that the insurers for South
             Yorkshire Police will not pay for these services. It could
             mean that instead of having one solicitor, ie Mr Fraser, we
             would have a plethora!
                            Vs--..

                                     ''
       8.    The absence of bloc representation may mean that in
             dealing with the Social Services we have to do it direct,
             rather than through the solicitor which we would have
             preferred.

       9.    It was agreed that the inquests would take the form of
             non-liability and non-adversary.

       10.   Dr Popper stated that transcripts would be made of the
             proceedings and this would be available on payment of the
             usual fee.
11. A Jury would be called.

12.   The timing of the inquests was discussed with the
      possibility that a general opening would take place on
      Wednesday 18 April 1990 followed by individual inquests
      starting on 19 April. Hopefully we would manage eight
      inquests per day, having completed them all by Friday 4
      May 1990. If there were any inquests not completed for
      any reason these would be picked up in the week of Monday
      21 May 1990. It was agreed that in notifying dates/times
      of inquests we, as Coroner's Officers, would notify the
      Solicitor representing the family, the Social Services and
      the Hillsborough Steering Committee in Liverpool.

13.   The location of the inquests was discussed and the
      facilities available at the Medico-Legal Centre. A tour
      was made of the building.

14. We had a discussion on the press and its control.

15.   We discussed a letter that would be sent out to the
       relevant legal representatives as well as the nine parties
      given formal representation at Lord Justice Taylor's
       hearing.

The meeting was concluded at 1650 hours.

YJ'                           .■■                                   A*

 Counsel is asked to advise Her Majesty's Coroner for South Yorkshire (West)
 District on the following matters.      For convenience these instructions
 are divided into Part A and Part B.

 Part A proceeds on the assumption that the Director of Public Prosecutions
 will charge someone or more persons with an offence of Manslaughter.

 Part B proceeds on the assumption that the Director of Public Prosecutions decides:
 that neither Section (l) (a) or Section 16 (l) (b) of the Coroners*
 Act 1988 apply.

 Part A.   1. Counsel’s attention is drawn to Section 16 of the Coroners'
                Act 1988.

           2. For the purposes of this instruction, it is assumed that
                the charge under Section 16 (l) (a) (i) would be in respect
                of one or two of the deceased and not in respect of all
                95 persons who have died.

           3. It had been the view of Her Majesty's Coroner that in
                that event the Coroner would adjourn the Inquest under Section
                16 (1) (a) in respect of those persons of whom a Manslaughter
                charge had been brought and in respect of the remainder of
                the deceased, he would adjourn the Inquests under the provisions
                of Section 16 (l) (b) assuming that the D.P.P. made an
                appropriate request.
                This appears to be a commonsense view of looking at the
                inter-relationship of the two sub sections in a situation such
                as the Hillsborough Disaster.    This also seems to be the
                view of the Authors of the Law & Practice on Coroners, Thurston
                Third Edition, Section 22.20.    The attention of Counsel is
                also drawn to Jervis on Coroners 10th Edition Paragraph
                14.27.
           4.   The Coroner's attention was re-drawn to Section 16 because of
                the situation arising out of the Marchioness Inquest, v-here the
                skipper of the boat has been charged with an offence which
                does not fall within Section 16 (l) (a).    However, it is
                understood the D.P.P. has requested the Coroner to adjourn
                the Inquest in respect of all the deceased under the provisions
                of Section 16 (l) (b).

                On an examination of Section 16, what has concerned the Coroner
                is whether it is open to the D.P.P. to request an adjournment
                under Section 16 (l) (b) in a case where someone has been charged
                with Manslaughter of a particular person, and notice is given
                under Section 16 (l) (a).
The drafting of Section 16 (l) (a)     is not entirely clear.
Sub paragraph (i) ends with the word "deceased" whereas
sub paragraphs (ii) and (iii) end with the word "or".
It is not clear whether the word “or" particularly at the
end of sub paragraph (iii) merely applies to that sub paragraph
or to the whole sub section.    If the "or" only applies to the
sub paragraph then presumably it is possible for a person
to be charged under sub section (a) in connection with
the Manslaughter of the deceased 'X' and at the same time,
for the D.P.P. to implement the provisions of sub section (b)
(but see paragraph 6 below on this).    If the ^   i "or"
refers to the whole of sub section (a) then Counsel is asked
to advise on whether it is possible for sub section (b) to
be implemented at all.   One possible reconciliation would be
to argue that sub section (a) deals with a person charged
with the death of the deceased 'X' whereas sub section (b)
deals with other people, but in that case what is the purpose
of the word "or".   Hopefully the word "or" can be treated
as tautologous   or otherwise reconciled because its implementation
in the way outlined above would seem to produce a ridiculous
result.

The next point that arises is whether or not it is possible
for the provisions of Section l^l](b) to apply in a
case where a charge has been brought against a person in respect
of Manslaughter under paragraph Section 16 (l) (a).     Prime
 facie, this would seem to be the intention.    The difficulty
arising from the fact that the sub section (b) includes the
words "alleged to have been committed in circumstances connected
with the death of the deceased, not being an offence within
paragraph (a) above". If "the deceased" in sub paragraph (b)
is the same as "the deceased" in sub paragraph (a) then it would
 seem that one has the ludicrous situation that a Manslaughter
 charge negates the D.P.P's ability to avoid an Inquest being
held into the death of persons connected with the death of
 the deceased *X' but in respect of whom no charges have been
brought. On the other hand, if a lesser indi<$6able charge is brought,
 the D.P.P. can implement sub section (b).

 As it happens, this situation has already been explored
 by Mr. Sturt, the Coroner for the County of Kent, and I
 enclose copies of an exchange of correspondence between
 him and the D.P.P. dated the 12th of January 1990 and the
 16th of January 1990.   You will recollect that in the Zebrugge
 Disaster, following the Inquest several people had been
 charged with the offence of Manslaughter and are in fact at
 the moment awaiting trial.    Since then, a further death of
 a Mr. Singh has occurred.    The Coroner for Kent was concerned
                                              I



     whether or not he would have to have a full Inquest into
     his death.   You will see that in effect the D.P.P. has
     interpreted sub section 16 (l) (b) by in fact saying
     that somebody has been charged with the offence of Manslaughter
     in respect of 'X1, but that he is requesting the adjournment
     because that offence has been committed in circumstances
     connected with a death of 'Y' but the offence which has
     been charged is not the Manslaughter of 'Y1. In other
     words, the "death of the deceased" refers to the person
     or persons who have not been charged under sub paragraph
     (a).
8.   If this section can be interpreted in this way then the
     problem outlined in paragraph 6 would seem to have been
     overcome (subject to your advice on the point outlined
     in paragraph 5)*
     The interpretation applied by Mr. Sturt and the D.P.P. has
     a very marked advantage of making sense of the provisions.
     Counsel is asked to advise on this as soon as possible.
PART B.


1.   This section deals with the hypothesis that the D.P.P. will not
     proceeed under Section 16 either sub section (a) or sub section (b).
     In that event, as the Coroner sees it, the Inquests will have to
     be resumed, and concluded.


2.   Counsel is reminded that the Coroner has already sat with a Jury for
     about 2ijr weeks and taken evidence relating to 95 deceased and in particular
     has dealt with the questions of who, when and where they died, but has
     not dealt with the question of how.


3. Each individual Inquest was of course different, but they followed
     a more or less standard form and by way of background information a copy
     of one of these Inquests is attached to these instructions for information.
     (D.G. Godwin).

4 . Counsel is also reminded that a full public inquiry has already taken
     place before Lord Justice Taylor.


5. The issue that has to be determined then is how much further work has
     to be undertaken by the Coroner and his Jury with a view to reaching a
     verdict?


 6 . The Coroner is aware of the provisions of Buie 36 and 42 as well
     as the Rule dealing with self incrimination.    Counsel's attention
      is drawn to the statutory provisions, in particular Section 8 (2) (b),
      8 (3) (d), 11 (2),11 (5),11(6),and 13 (l) (b) of the Coroners’ Act 1988.


 7 . The issue that has to be resolved in determining the scope of the
      Inquest is:-

                a.   How large a"circle"does the word "how" encompass.

                b.   To what extent do the questions of "why did it happen
                     and "who is to blame" fall within the compass of the
                     word "how".

      These questions of course apply to all Inquests but are particularly
      relevant in Inquests associatedwifch a major disaster and where, as
      in this particular case, a public inquiry has/tai$?L T$.ace.
      In this connection Counsel's attention is drawn to E.B. Sturt
      H.M.Coroner for East Kent ex parte Peter Alan Spooner etc,
      ■^here this question to a certain extent was canvassed.


 8 . One view that could I suppose be taken is to restrict the question
      of "how" to the establishment simply of the fact that a . crush
      occurred within the terraces, but not to explore the reasons for
      this, taken together with the medical cause of death, the Jury
       could be invited to bring in a verdict.
                              -   2   -

   The difficulty with this is that:

              (i)     This it is unlikely that such a limited inquiry
                      would satisfy anyone.


              (ii)    Probably the decision would be appealed on the
                      grounds of insufficiency of inquiry.
              (iii) It would make it impossible for the Jury to consider
                    a verdict of Unlawfully Killed because the evidence
                    presented to them would not enable them to be satisfied
                    beyond a reasonable doubt that the criteria for such
                    a verdict haul been fulfilled.(see McCurbin case).


9 . If this is correct, one seems to be left with an alternative which is
    that a full inquiry is needed, notwithstanding the Public Inquiry
   which had already taken place or the fact that the D.P.P. has considered
    the papers and has come to a conclusion not to take any action (this
    if you remember is the hypothesis of this part of the instructions).
    Furthermore it would seem that to a large extent, the ground covered
    by the Public Inauiry would have to be re—canvassed. Counsel’s attention
    is again drawn to the case involving the Coroner for Kent.


10. It seems to the Coroner that if the latter view is correct, then by way
    of example at least the following aspects would have to be explored!


                 (i) The fans - time of arrival including possibly the reasons
                     for lateness of arrival.

                        Behaviour, demeanour and state of intoxication.

                 (ii) The site (including Club, Engineers---'  J v ’-*- 4''-
                      etc)— turnstiles, signs,access, stewarding and
                      possibly previous incidents in particular an incident
                      which occurred in 1981 when crushing occurred on these
                      terraces.


                (iii) The police - the police were severely criticised in Lord
                      Justice Taylor’s report. Their management of the game,
                      including command and organisation within and without
                      the ground, and management ranging from the Site
                      Commanders to individual officers, particulary those
                      •who have been the subject of complaint.


                    (vi) Others, e.g., licensing authorities, rescue organisations
                         etc.

                                                                   Executive
                     (v) Expert evidence from say Health & Safety/Engineers and
                         others regarding configuration. Reasons for breaking
                         of barriers. Explanations as to why the vast majority
                         of the deceased died in Pen 3 as compared with only
                         about 7 in Pen 4 (incidentally, Counsel might be
                         interested to know that more than half of the people
                         who died entered the stadium after 2 .30p.m. and about 22
                         are known to have entered the stadium when Gate C was
                         opened at or after approximately 14-52).
                -   3   -

One should perhaps mention that an Inquest conducted on these
lines is likely to be an enormous . task.   Lord Justice Taylor
sat for 31 days and examined about 174 witnesses orally.    In
the Zebrugge Inquest over 400 witnesses gave evidence (some by
way of documentary evidence).
                                             of deaths
In this particular case, although the number/ are less than
the people who died at Zebrugge, the number of people who were
present at the time of the disaster are of course very much
larger and thousands of statements have been taken by the West
Midlands Police.


Because of the enormous task, not to say the cost, Her Majesty’s
Coroner wants to be certain as he reasonably can be that his
assessment of the requirement for the scope of the Inquest as
outlined above is correct.   Counsel is therefore asked to advise
on the extent and scope of the Coroner’s Inquisition in the case
of the Hillsborough Disaster, and in particular, to advise on
the word "how" together with this overlap of "why" and "whom".


Counsel is asked to consider the matter as soon as conveniently
possible.   Would Counsel please note that Dr. Popper is not
available between the 4th and 22nd of July and would like the matter
dealt with either before the 4"th of July, if that is possible,
02? if that is not practical, as soon after the 22nd of July, as
it may be conveniently possible.


If Counsel feels, before giving an opinion, that he would want
to have a conference with Dr. Popper, then this can no doubt be
arranged.

                 DR. S. POPPER - CONFERENCE WITH COUNSEL

                         17th January 1990 at 2 p.m.

                      1 Paper Buildings, Inner Temple.




Present :                   Dr. S.L. Popper
                            Dr. M.J. Powers
                            R .B . Hammond


Counsel believed there were three          matters   outstanding,    which    he
identified as being the following

1.    The West Midlands Police Report to the Director                of   Public
       Prosecutions and the outcome of other reports by             the   Police
       Complaints Authority

2.    The   second part of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry

3.    The possibility of civil proceedings.    It was thought these
       claims would not be worth very much as a large proportion o
       those people who died were young and unmarried.    Damages would
       therefore be mainly limited to bereavement, pain and suffering
       and funeral expenses.     However,  it was thought     that the
       families may seek larger amounts by attempting to embarrass t e
       Police Authority, and this may affect the Inquest.

Counsel     thought   that the   following options were open to Dr.       Popper


1.     Resume the Inquest.    There had not been any pressure as yet
       from the families to do this, although there may be in t e
       future.   Under Section 8 of the Coroners Act 19     there is a
       basic duty on the Coroner to hold an         Inquest within a
       reasonable time, subject to certain exceptions.   Under Section
       16 (4) one of these exceptions is that a Coroner may be allowed
       to adjourn an Inquest pending a criminal inquiry.         Other
       exceptions are contained within Coroners Rules 26, 27 and 28.
       Under Rules 26 and 27, where the Coroner has been given
       information from the Police or Director of Public Prosecutions
       that a person may be charged with an offence, he must adjourn
       for a statutory period of 28 days.  Thereafter, the Coroner may
       keep the Inquest adjourned on his own discretion.   It was this
       discretion which Dr. Popper was exercising at this current
       time.
 2.    Counsel suggested that an alternative to holding a full Inquest
       would be to proceed with an Inquest on a limited basis.       e
       suggested that Dr. Popper could see each family as a unit
       separately and deal with the time, manner and mode of death and
       leave the how and.non-requisite,why in reserve.  It was thought
       that this would enable Dr. Popper to be seen to be carrying out
       his duties properly whilst at the same time not getting
       embroiled in arguments on the wider issues of the tragedy.

 After making these initial observations Counsel turned to the other
 issue which Dr. Popper wished to explore, being whether or not to
 release the documentation he had in his hands from the Police an
 Director of Public Prosecutions.    Counsel thought that ^the cases
 concerning Peach and Hicks showed that not only was the Coroner
 under no obligation to reveal documentation, he was under a positive
duty not to.        Counsel believed that should Dr. Popper release
documentation, he could" be subjected to judicial review and the DPP
may try to prevent him from releasing documents by injunction o r ,
alternatively, may follow up the release of documents with an Action
for breach of confidence.

Widgery J held in the Peach case, (1980)      WLR 496 at 503, that
there would be a clear breach of confidence if the Coroner were to
release Police documents.   He had no legal right to do so.   This
viewpoint was supported in ex parte Hicks, 26th January 1987, when
Croom-Johnson also held that there was      no right to call for
documents upon the Coroner.

Under the Rules of the Supreme Court there were provisions to order
discovery of documents from a non-party, who could conceivably be
the Coroner in a situation like this.  However, Counsel thought that
the Coroner should still not release any documents until the High
Court had made an Order, and in such a situation he would have the
advantage of getting his costs at the same time as being protected
from an Action for breach of confidence.

Counsel did think that there was an obligation under Coroners Rule
57 to disclose    the post mortem reports, and Dr. Popper indicated
that this hasalready been done, but    he  was pleased that Counsel
supported his action.

Counsel and Dr. Popper then returned to discussing the more general
aspects of Counsel's advice.   Counsel believes that his suggestion
of having a preliminary short form Inquest for each family would
have the advantage of leaving the general matters alone.        Dr.
Popper, however, felt that there would still be a need to examine
evidence in detail to ascertain the "where" of death.

Counsel felt that each family would benefit from getting the basic
information as to how their relatives died at an initial Hearing.
He thought that it would be beneficial to have a Senior Police
Officer present at the Inquest to summarise the non-controversial
evidence,   which  will  have   been  agreed   between   the  parties
beforehand.   Dr. Popper felt that this evidence would be difficult
to agree if, for example, the family solicitor wanted to see all the
witness statements and documents first.   Counsel accepted that this
would be a dilemma.   However, he thought that his suggestion would
still have its advantages as he was sure D r . Popper did not want 95
separate full Inquests.  Moreover, the family solicitors may want to
know at this stage the details of any pain and suffering for the
formulation of civil damages claims.

Counsel's strategy was to suggest resuming the Inquest in the form
of an administrative meeting where all parties would attend.      He
suggested Dr. Popper could then announce in open Court the course of
action he was taking and then take representations from interested
parties.

 The initial individual family Inquests could be dealt with without a
 jury.   If it was necessary to have a fuller Inquest at a later date
 to deal with general matters, a jury could be used.   There would be
 a problem with presenting the jury with the information from the
 initial Inquest,   but this could be perhaps achieved by merely
 showing them the documentation.   Counsel was particularly concerned
 that Dr. Popper should not have a repeat of the Taylor Public
 Inquiry,   as he did not have the resources       or the requisite


                                                  Cont/d
authority.   In the event that Dr. Popper decided to take Counsel's
recommended course of action, Counsel thought that Dr. Popper may
not even have to have a final Inquest as to the general matters, as
these would have been fully aired in the Taylor report, civil
proceedings and possibly criminal proceedings.

Dr. Popper welcomed Counsel's advice, but felt that if the DPP
decided not to go ahead with a criminal Trial, public pressure may
well come back onto him to explore all the wider issues at a full
and lengthy Inquest.  Counsel accepted this possibility, but thought
that it was a risk Dr. Popper may have to run.

Dr. Popper thanked Counsel for his kind advice and indicated that he
would think very carefully about his suggestions.

Dear Sir,

I refer to the 1 tter from H.lfo. Coroner addressed to you and ( |ted}the 3lst May
with regard to t le question o£ releasing the Post Mortem repot :s.

Counsel, Mr Hytn ir QC and Mr King, are briefed at the Inquiry ih bJhalf if the
bereaved and inj ired, the instructions coming from me and my   rm 6n behilf of
the Steering Com tittee of the Hillsborough Group of Solicitors

The Hillsborough Group of Solicitors (which infact is continue [ly fo'dwirig in
number as more arms are instructed on behalf of bereaved and Injured} currently
numbers 114 firn ) the majority of whom have supplied full detd Lis of the?1names
and addresses of their clients and as new clients are added tc their particular
list given us de ;ails so thatjour records - although probably’ few days' out -
ar.e -pretty well »pto date.

There are three lajor exceptions to this where firms al the m< pent'haVe Wrely
stated "numerous clients" 50 plus clients or given one name pJ is 40/50 nfore.

Therefore the i. formation as ifar as the deceased are concernel “ittayjnot     100%
accurate in tha' some familie^ who as far »b I am aware have        cdhfeulte’d
Solicitors may hfact be clients of one of the firms who have »iveh me
                                                                       ?    . (
incomplete infoi tiation.
                                                                       ;      i
With that Cavea€ X enclose herewith a copy.list of those victj tis whose families
have consulted i »licitors who* are part of the Hillsborough Sol Lcithra* droup.
As you will see there are 71 pf the 95 victims who fall into U s category.

As far as some     P the familiejB are concerned there has been aj ielay in tWir seeking
legal advice an<    four of the families concerned only consulted Solicitors within
the last week o:    ten days.      and when I receive notice of Sj Lici^ore doting
for any familiei    currently no|t represented 1 will of course lj yoli knb$.

The question of    the provisional death certificates and the re]            'further
information was    made at a conference with Counsel open to ai      Soiibitori  in the
Group and any c    ients of thoWe Solicitors.     We and Counsel ff>e tfeked €o put
forward that r«    uest on theiij behalf.                               I " I-
                                                                         t - ■;i
Whereas it is o    ' course a matter for yourselves and the Coroi [r it' may be appropriate
if he sees fit     ;© authorise ijhe release of the post, mortem re]forts on a*provisional
basis to the be    eaved families for this to be done through o' selves ifrrinly
because in some    cases there 4re two separate firms instructe Ln i^elatibn to one
individual wher    : for example !there may be two separate sets o! Defendants.
C/tnd.



If there ia any rurther information which you need please do     t hdaitatfe to get
in touch.

I will, be at the Inquiry In aj.1 probability on Thursday.   I    In London today
(Tuesday) but wij.1 be in the j|>ffice on Wednesday.

Yours sinocroly,




MISS E M STEEL

    Thank you for your faxed letter of 6th June.
      'Subiect to the views of the Coroner, I do not myself see any objection to
the post-mortem reports being released to the bereaved families on a provisional
hp.cii.«=! in the manner that you suggest.
     I have accordingly passed your request on to the Coroner, and he will no
 doubt be in touch with you direct.
                                     Yours sincerely,

     - V                                                                       ^~>Ci


       Counsel is asked to advise Her Majesty's Coroner of South Yorkshire
       West District in connection with certain aspects arising out of the
       Hillsborough Stadium Disaster which occurred in Sheffield on 15th
       of April 1989* and in which presently 95 spectators lost their lives.

1.     The main aspect of this tragedy will be of course well known to Counsel
       and it is therefore not proposed to give a detailed summary of the events
       except as follows

       1.1     The Match was scheduled as the F.A.Semi Final between Nottingham
               Forest and Liverpool Football Club, the same two clubs had met
               for the same fixture at the same venue in 1988.    It was an all
               ticket match and a sell out.   Liverpool had been allocated the
               West and the North end of the stadium whilst Nottingham Forest
               had been allocated the other end, which in fact could accommodate
               many more spectators
       1.2     The parts of the stadium relevant to this disaster are the
               Leppings Lane terraces.   These were fairly shallow, not particularly
               deep terraces which were divided into several pens or enclosures
               by radial fences.   There were bounded at the front by a
               perimeter fence which contained small gates, one gate per relevant
               pen.   The two centre pens were number 3 & 4-   Access to the
               terrace was by means of a tunnel which was prominently situated
               and clearly visible from the turnstiles.    It was also possible
               to gain access to the terraces around the sides of the building,
               but the signposting was not that clear.    In addition, the fans
               on the whole prefer to congregate behind goals rather than
               around the edges, which make pens 3 & 4 more popular.

       1.3     Although the pens were divided by radial fences, at the back
               of each fence there was a gate, which in this particular match
               was locked open.    The intention being that people would be able
               to move laterally from pen to pen in order to achieve a reasonable
               level of comfort and distribution.     There were no stewards
               or police on the terraces as such, it being the intention that the
               spectators should find their own levels.
               There was a large police presence and the operational plan
               was for all practical purposes based on the operational plan
               of 1988.    The police commander for 1988 was Superintendent
               Mi>le, but in 1989 it was Superintendent Duckenfield who had only
           ^   just been appointed to the division.

               C.S. Duckenfield was assisted by Superintendent T. Murray.
               Although it had been noted that there seemed to have been a short
               fall of Liverpool fans in the stadium, it was not thought appropriate
                to postpone the kick-off, as it was felt that all the fans could
               be got in.
 In the last half hour or so prior to the kick-off a large
 number of Liverpool fans presented themselves for entry-
 through the Leppings Lane turnstiles.      Because of the ground
 configuration and the large numbers who attended, serious
 congestion for whatever reason occurred and the police we^c
unable to control the pressure of people outside the turnstiles.
Superintendent Marshall in charge of that area feared for the
 safety of the people and after seeking authority, which he was
given in due course by Superintendent Duckenfield, a large
gate known as Gate C was opened.    This gate allowed a large
influx of people to enter the ground many of whom made their
way on to the terrace by going down the tunnel which opened
on to pens 3 & 4*   The tunnel was clearly visible and
invitingly situated in relation to Gate C.      It would seem no
attempt was made to control the mouth of the tunnel or to direct
the crowd after entry through Gate C.

As it happened, whilst there appeared to be a reasonable amount
of room in some of the adjoining pens, pens 3 & 4 possibly
because of their location were already full or maybe even
overfull at the time that Gats G was opened.     In addition,
at some point that afternoon, one of the crush barriers in
pen 3 broke.   Without going into precise details with regard to
timing at .ithio n i ^ ^ver a relatively short period^-severe
crushing occurred within pens 3 & 4 which unfortunately led
                                        ♦
to the death of 95 people as well as injuries to many others.

P eople attempted to climb out of the pens both over the perimeter
fence at the front and over the sides, but it was not immediately
realised that this was an attempt to escape severe crushing and
the initial thought was that this was a pitch invasion.         It
would seem that people at the back of the terrasewere also not
initially aware of the problems towards the front.

Once realisation had set in that this was a disaster, attempts
were made to rescue people within the pens.      The effectiveness
or otherwise of the attempted rescue has been questioned by various
people at the Public Inquiry.

Because of the enormity of the disaster a Public Inquiry was
ordered which was taken by Lord Justice Taylor and two assessors.
About 31 days of evidence later, an interim report was
published by Lord Justice Taylor.   A further report will be
prepared by him which is intended to deal with broader issues,
rather than with the Hillsborough Disaster in particular.

It is probably fair to say that virtually everybody who was
associated with this match has come in for iblaiite or criticism.
Without wishing to give an exhaustive list and in particular without
in any way taking any view as to the validity or otherwise of any
of the criticisms and purely to enable Counsel to obtain the flavour
of the situation criticisms were directed ats-

  a.     The F.A. for their choice of venue.

  b.     The Club for inter alia signposting, poor ticketing,
         inadequate turnstiles and lack of stewarding.

  c.     The police and individual officers for poor planning,
         for loss of control outside the gates, the failure to
         control the influx through the gates, for slowness in realisation
         of what was happening and for inadequate response to the disaster.

  d.     The fans for drunkenness, for attending without tickets,
         for abusive andyaggressive behaviour and possibly in the
         words of Lord Justice Taylor "for pressing forward in a
         single minded determination to get into the ground".

  6 . The Fire Service for some failure in responding quickly
         enough when called.



As has already been mentioned, a Public Inquiry has already taken
place.    This was serviced by the West Midlands Police, who sire
also undertaking the Coronal inquiries.

Following the Public Inquiry the Director of Public Prosecutions
decided to look into the circumstances of this incident with
a view to determining whether or not criminal proceedings
should be brought against any person or persons.      As a result,
The Vest Midlands Police are undertaking the servicing of the
criminal aspects of the D.P.P. inquiry and for the sake of
completeness they are also dealing it is believed with vari^ug^ understood
matters connected with the Police Complaints Authority.       In addition/
various other police authorities are looking at individual complaints.

At the same time, civil proceedings have been initiated and various
preliminary steps have been taken.    At the present time the
substantive hearing date has been fixed for the 19th of June 1990-

When this matter first broke, Lord Justice Taylor indicated
that he would prefer to complete his Inquiry before the Inauest
and quite apart from the logistics this seemed to be a reasonable
proposition.    Subsequently, it was decided that there was
no reason why one should necessarily wait for Part II of the
Public Inquiry's report, and it had been the intention to resume
the Inauest on the 15th of January 1990.       In the events when
the Director of Public Prosceutions became involved, it was decided
to postpone the proposed hearing date and at the present time the
Inquests remain adjourned to a date to be fixed.      Because of the
volume of statements and information that will be to be prepared,
presented, digested and thought over by^the D.P.P. though it is
highly unlikely that a decision as to the fixing or timing of the
Inquest will not be made until late 1990.
It seems to us that if the D.P.P. were minded to bring say Manslaughter
charges against some person or persons, then under the provisions
of Section     16 Coroners Act 1988 the Inquest will probably only
have to be resumed for the purposes of taking medical evidence and
then would be adjourned under the provisions of that Section.        In
accordance with normal practice, the Coroner would not expect to
have to resume the Inquest after the conclusion of the criminal
proceedings.
However, if the D.P.P. decides not to bring Manslaughter charges,
then the position would be that an Inquest would have to be resumed.

Because it is thought that the D.P.P. will not have announced
a decision prior to the scheduled civil proceedings date as well
as logistics and other factors such as availability of witnesses,
it is thought unlikely that it would be possible to resume the Inquest
before the date fixed for the civil trial.       This brings me to
the matter on which advice would be appreciated at this stage.

It is not the Coroner's practice to release statements and other
documentation, prior'to the. Inquest."••■In this particular] oase’the SopoAar
did in fact agree to release thepost mortem reports.       These were
not released directly to the bereaved but to their solicitors or
in certain cases doctors.   The object o£ such release being to enable
(subject to formal evidence) thebereaved to ascertain what the
post mortem report contained and          also    of course to assist any civil
litigation which was being contemplated.

Since then a number of queries on these reports have been received
but on the whole the numbers have not been very large.       The Coroner
was anxious that he should not in fact be conducting the Inquest by
way of correspondence.

The Coroner has now been approached both by the representatives
of the bereaved and also by solicitors acting for South Yorkshire Police
with a request to release or to authorise the release of the documentation
which is in the course of preparation by the West Midlands Police
in connection with the Inquest.    The representatives require this
information so that they can better prepare for the civil litigation
which has already been mentioned, is sbheduled for June 1990 and
almost certainly if that date is adhered too will pressed any Inquest
which may be held.

Whilst the Coroner does not want to be obstructive, he has been somewhat
concerned with regard to these requests.     Some of the reasons for this
include

     a.   That there is at present a criminal investigation going on
          and that there is an overlap between that investigation and
          the coronal investigation.     It is felt that to authorise
          disclosure whilst the D.P.P. Inquiry is not complete might be
          prejudicial to that Inquiry.
                                            - 5 -

                      Obviously if the D.P.P. were to take the view that he did not
                      object to the discl®s4£e of evidence in the police files
       'f
                      this would fall to the ground.

               b.     That the Coroner has not yet seen the evidence himself
                       and it was therefore difficult for him to form a judgement as to
                      whether it was suitable for release.

                c.    That release of the documentation would make the Inquest even
                      less relevant than it is already, bearing in mind the multitudinous
                      investigations and inquiries which have already taken place, are still
                      going on and are likely in any event to preceed the Inquest.

                d.    The rilling in the Blair Peach case as well as any other judicial
                      expressions of opinions which Counsel may be aware of.

   12.      We have already indicated that we do not want to be obstructive in this
            matter and whilst it would be nice to think that the Inquest,
            takes place, is a worthwhile activity, it is not thought that whosb is
            a consideration i.e., (c) above should be allowed to outweight release
            of the documentation if it were otherwise


   13-      As already indicated, the Coroner's initial reaction to the parties (and
            enclosed are copies of representative correspondence on this topic,
            so that Counsel can see what is being said and what the Coroner's attitude
            has been)has itb&§none of caution.   The more however the matter is reflected
            on the more he is inclined to the view that release would be beneficial
            to the parties subject to there being no legal impediment and all other
            interested parties^havin^* agreed. On the whole the Coroner thinks that
            direct release by the West Midlands Police might be the most convenient
             way.                                                                                t

  14-       The Coroner is however conscious that with a case as tragic and as
            notorious as the Hillsborough Disaster, it is very important that no step
            be taken which could be construed as wrong, and he is very anxious not
            to lay himself open to judicial review or even worse, adverse judicial
            review.

 15.        Counsel is asked to consider this matter as soon as possible and to
            advise. If it would assist Counsel a conference could I am sure
            be arranged.

16 .        Counsel is also asked to consider the following though the urgency
            for a reply is a little bit less.
   ..
16 1        We have already indicated that the position on the timing and the
            scope of the Inquest depends to a large extent upon the decision of the
            D.P.P.    If the D.P.P. decides to bring manslaughter charges then it
             seems to us that the proper course would be to resume the Inquest (almost
             certainly without a Jury), take the medical evidence in the way in which
             one would normally do so and possibly the evidence of where the deceased
             were found either alive or at death (the reason for this being that
             thiH mi cVfh ho the nnlv fnvirvn>whoi'o +.Vm+. asmfiCt of the matter Would be____
publicly aired), to then adjourn under Section 16 (l) Coroners Act 1988.
At the end of the criminal proceedings in the usual way, the Coroner
would not resume the Inquest.

If however the D.P.P. were to decide not to bring manslaughter charges
then presumably a full Inquest with a Jury would have tp„-take place.
'V       •; '   O   '   ■'   •.
The difficulty in this instance is that presumably the D.P.P’s
decision will displease at least some of the bereaved and they or-
their representatives are likely to wish to use the Inquest as a forum
to re-explore the whole question of the incident and may well wish to
or hope that a Jury will bring in a verdict of Unlawfully Killed.


On the other hand, this matter will already have been extensively explored
by Lord Justice Taylor, the D.P.P. possibly the civil Court, the Police
Complaints Authority and no doubt others and it seems to us that it is
at least arguable that the Inquest in the particular circumstances of this
case should be narrow,              and having established as far as possible who
the deceased were, where they died, when they died.              To restrict the "how"
                                                 medical cause of death or to an outline
of the incident that occurred on that fateful day.

It might also be appropriate to adduce evidence from the D.P.P. either
directly or through .an appropriate police officer that the matter of
criminal proceedings had been considered and that a decision not to
prosecute for manslaughter had been reached.              It is not thought appropriate
to entertain the reasons for these decisions.               Similarly if the civil
proceedings have been completed evidence of that fact could also be
given.

The alternative would be to virtually repeat the Inquiry conducted
by Lord Justice Taylor, together with the specifics as to the cause
of death and location which have already been mentioned.              There is no reason
to assume that an Inquest conducted in that way would take any less time
than the Public Inquiry and indeed would probably take longer as the
Inquiry set for six hours a day which is more than it is reasonable to
expect a Jury to do.              Any preliminary opinion which Counsel might have at this
stage as to the scope of the Inquest would be of value.              In this connection
Counsel is reminded of two recent examples which could be used as models.
The first is Mr. Sturt's Inquest in Dover in connection with the Zeebrugge
Disaster which was a very substantial and through going affair, whilst
the other was I think the Kings Cross Inquest which was a much more.,                nt\'Ln
restricted Inquest (though±1 fairness to that, -J knew very little^fa&out
the details of the Kings Cross Inquisition).

Discussion with Dr Popper in his office at the Medico Legal
Centre, Sheffield. Items discussed were as follows

He has not yet received his copy of the transcripts for Day
32 (the closing date of the Inquiry). Nor has he seen the
submission made by Counsel to the Inquiry or those
representing interested parties. (Police Sergeant Parkes to
arrange a copy of the transcripts to Dr Popper. Nechells to
arrange a copy of the submissions to Dr Popper).

We had a discussion with regard to the allegations made by
Counsel for the bereaved and injured parties concerning the
allegation of "unlawful killing", Dr Popper referred to
Section 16 of the Coroners' Act 1988 and the Coroners' Rules.
It was thought appropriate that Dr Popper, myself and
Detective Chief Superintendent Foster should meet with the
Director of Public Prosecutions, or his representative, at
the earliest opportunity. (I will arrange).

Dr Popper asked if we could find out what time he was first
telephoned by South Yorkshire Police on Saturday 15 April
regarding the disaster (I have established from the South
Yorkshire Police Log that Dr Popper was telephoned at 1616
hours. I have also established that PC Thompson arrived at
the mortuary at 1647 hours. Also that Dr Popper left the
mortuary at 1830 hours to go to the ground).

Dr Popper drew my attention to the Daily Telegraph of 15 July
1989 where he indicated the words used in a report on the
closing day of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry, which could be
construed in contempt of court. The relevant words used in
relation to the forthcoming Coroner's Inquests were
"..... is likely to return verdicts.of unlawful killing".
Dr Popper was raising this matter with the Attorney General.

 Note for diary - Dr Popper will be away on leave out of the
 country on 26 September and ,for the two weeks following.

 Dr Popper would like a full set of the statements taken.
 (I have already discussed this with Detective Chief
 Superintendent Foster and the matter is in hand).

 I advised Dr Popper that a copy of the Channel Four programme
 will be sent to him in the very near future. (Detective
 Chief Superintendent Foster to Action).

 I discussed security at the Medico-Legal Centre and other
 logistical matters with Dr Popper. Dr Popper has no
 objection to us providing appropriate locks and extra power
 points should we so require.
We had a discussion about the release of statements to
solicitors representing the injured and bereaved. Also the
request from Sheffield Social Services for a copy of the
compilation video. The principle that Dr Popper would like
to adopt is that which would appertain had this been a
straight forward fatality, ie material would not be released
until after the inquest had concluded. Given the
extra-ordinary circumstances Dr Popper understands the
difficulties and says he would like to release as little as
possible without being too unhelpful. At the present time
Lord Justice Taylor has permitted statements to be released
to solicitors representing the person who has made the
statement. This also can continue as far as Dr Popper is
concerned. However, requests for other statements will have
to be considered on their merits by myself, in consultation
with Dr Popper.

With regard to the compilation video, Dr Popper agreed that
this has already been in the public domain and that there
would be no objections by him for it being released to a
professional body such as Social Services. We have received
one request from Sheffield City Council - Hillsborough Task
Team. I intend to make the Chairman of that Team responsible
for one copy of that video which he may care to have copied
for other Social Services a3 he sees fit, placing the onus
upon him to ensure that its use is properly controlled and
that any copies made are properly accounted for. (I will
write to Sheffield Social Services on this matter).

I advised Dr Popper that Mr Benen Hytner QC had approached
Lord Justice Taylor through Mr Andrew Collins QC, for
permission to show some or all videos recorded on the 1989
Semi-Final. The reason for this was that the relatives of
the deceased wanted re-assurance that there was no cover up
and they felt that this can be best achieved by viewing of
the video material. Lord Justice Taylor had agreed that this
could take place and I have been advised accordingly by
Andrew Collins QC. I am decidedly unhappy about this aspect,
not least of all the distressing nature of much of that film.
I advised Dr Popper that Elizabeth Steel, the solicitor and
Chairman of the Hillsborough Steering Committee, had written
to me to follow up the earlier discussion with Mr Hytner.
(Letter at Policy Book Number 883). Elizabeth Steel will be
visiting Nechells in week commencing Monday 24 July 1989 to
discuss this in greater detail. Miss Steel also included in
her letter an indication that they would like copies of the
photographs in appropriate cases. Dr Popper and I agree
that this is rather like the statements and the request
should not be acceded to at this stage. A good point at
this time, made by Dr Popper, was that in the light of the
suggestions of "unlawful killing", it would be highly
inappropriate to release material during the course of an
investigation. Our views also coincide over the showing of
video material, although that may create a lot of
difficulties, should we refuse, now that the request has

Dear Mr Jones,

I confirm the request made initially by Counsel for the injured and bereaved
Mr Hytner QC, through Mr Collins QC, for arrangements to be made for the video
footage of the scenes on the terraces at the Leppings Lane end to be shown to
those bereaved families who wished to see the videos at Liverpool.

We are very much obliged to you for agreeing to this request and I will be in
touch to arrange a convenient date for the showing.

I have written in the last Bulletin to all Solicitor members of the Group
notifying them of the proposed showing, warning them that the scenes are
distressing and asking them to confirm whether their clients do wish to
attend.

Todate I have received positive replies from approximately 6 or 7 firms but
have given everyone a deadline of Friday this week to let me know whether their;
clients do wish to attend and if convenient to you I will get in touch in the
early part of next week to let you know numbers and so that a convenient date
and time can be arranged.

Some Social Workers are willing to attend with their clients which should help
and as agreed I have extended the invitation to Social Workers who are involved
in the "helpline" projects in the Merseyside area.     I also confirm that some
of the Groups clients have also expressed the wish to see the still photographs
which were exhibited at the Inquiry and if they can identify relatives have
a print.

I understand that there is a spare set of negatives and if you wish I would
be happy to take those and to arrange for prints to be available at Liverpool
for Social Workers and clients to see and then if they wish we can arrange to
take further prints for their use.

I look forward to hearing from you and again I am very grateful for your assistance

Yours sincerelyj

MISS E M STEEL

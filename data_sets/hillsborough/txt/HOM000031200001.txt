   Dear Mr.            Derricctt,
                                                   Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground
                                                     Capa cit y of North West Corner
                Please excuse the de lay in giving a detailed response to your
  letter of 6 December 1989.                                                            I needed to have some checks made on the
  measurements of the terrace.                                                                Arrangements were made for these
  measurements to be made on two occasions.                                                                                           Each time there was heavy
  rain all day.                             The work was completed just before Christmas.
               By way cf background,                                               you will no doubt be aware that we did
  not carry out a survey of the Leppings Lane end of the ground when
  the original Safety Certificate was applied for in 1978-79.                                                                                                                       The
  Club provided drawings p r e p a r e d by their previous consultants
  of the North stand,                                    the W est stand the North West corner from
 wh ich we made measurements.                                                            There were no drawings available of
  the older parts of the ground                                                               (the Kop and the South stand)                                                        and
 we were commissioned by the Club to make the necessary measurements
 on site,              for which we q u ote d a specific fee.                                                                                 This is all well
 documented in our correspondence with the Club at the time and in
 our report to them of January 1979.
              We have now measured the upper part of the North West corner,
 and there is a considerable discrepancy between the actual measure-

 .atrnts and tncse      scaled frcm the drawing based upon that
 provided by the Club.         Instead of the 2900 wh ich had
 notionalIv been considered to be the capacity of the upper
 -<or _ii West corner,     the total area available w o u l d only take
 -■ u42    on the basis of 54 spectators to 10m*
           The discrepancy between the drawing and the actual measurement
 is net in any way apparent from a visual inspection of the terrace.
 At the time when we were reporting in 1979,          we were made
 aware that in September 1970,        following a report by the Club's
          ious consultants the police had agreed a capacity for the
 ^ | v a t e d N o r t h West corner of 3,000 spectators.   That figure
 or a higher one had been used in all the ma no r games from the
 World Cup in 1966.         There was thus no reason for us to be alerted
 m     1978/79.    We enclose a copy of the 1970 report and the Chief
 Constable's letter to the Club dated 30 September 1970.
          O bviously we have been concerned about the possibility that
 the calculations for the terrace in front of the West stand might
 also have been based on a misleading plan.          Our check measurements
 have shown that the actual area is such that it could accommodate
 the      'notional'   number of spectators with a slightly lower density
 than 54 per 1 0 m 2 .

     Dear Councillor Butler
     ^ ft e f e r to the meeting of the General Purposes Panel held at the Town Hall
      on Monday 27 November 1989 and, in particular, to the report prepared by
      the Head of the Administration and Legal Department to the General Purposes
      Panel as anEMERGENCY ITEM relating to:-
               'Capacities of terrace areas at certificated football grounds and, in
               particular, the North West Upper Terrace, Sheffield Wednesday football
               ground'.
     Note 2.1 states:-
               'Mr Butler informed by Chief Licensing Officer (Sports Grounds), Mr Derricott,
               in a telephone conversation at approximately 10.30 am on 23rd November,
               that Mr Strange of Messrs Eastwood &Partners, Consulting Engineers,
               hadspoken to Mr Sherriff, Principal Structural Engineer, Department
               of Land and Planning, and suggested that the plan on which capacities
               had been calculated for the North West Upper Terrace of the West Terrace
               was incorrect'.
     My understanding is that the scale of the plan referred to showed the North
     West Upper Terrace as being larger than it actually is. Can you please confirm
     that fact or otherwise?
     Additionally, I am anxious to ascertain the accuracy of the plans and the
     subsequent calculation of the capacity for the Leppings Lane Terrace prior
     to 15 April 1989. Again, can you assist, please?
      Yours sincerely

 to be admitted.                                                                           V: - .•;
  During the game it was necessary for spectators comfort to remove a further
  350 from this terrace. Estimations are tnat once spectators had been removed
  about 1,700 people remained but they were still closely packed.
  As stated previously this was the first time since the Semi Final on 15 April
  1989 when the area had been a t capacity, and it was abundantly clear that
  the number of spectators shown on the certificate, ie : 2,300 could not be
  accommodated, but a t the time of the Semi Final the fixed capacity for this
  area was 2,800. immediate discussions took place between Chief Superintendent
  Nesbit and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Secretary, Mr Graham Mackrell,
  and tney agreed an emergency figure of 1,500 maximum. On 23 November 1989
  i wrote to Mr H M Webster - copy letter enclosed - the Head of Sheffield
  A d m in istra tio n and Legal Department advising him of our concern and a special
  meeting of the General Purposes Panel was called for 2.00 pm on Monday 27
  ftovemoer 1989.
  Between times, it was discovered from an officer of the Council, Mr John
  Derricott, the Safety in Sports Ground Officer, that the plans which the
  Local Authority used to determine the capacity for the North West Upper Terrace
  had been drawn to a scale which showed the terrace to be larger than It actually
  was.
4 Rl t the meeting on 27 November 1989 an emergency item was introduced which
   encapsulated the information contained 1n this letter to this point. A copy
   of the notes for this meeting are included.
  There was prolonged discussion as to the revised capacity for this area of
  the ground and Nr John Strange, who was representing Eastwood and Partners
  at the meeting, suggested that the capacity to be fixed at 1,400 will allow
  time for exact calculations to be made, but he was sure that the figure of
  1,400, whilst erring on the side of safety, would not be too far from the
  exact figure. So, on 15 April 1989 we had a capacity of 2,800 which has
  now been reduced to 1,400, a reduction of i00%!
  At the meeting, the question was never asked, or Indeed, considered relative
  to the accuracy of the plans for the Leppings Lane Terrace on which the c a p a c ity
  rtad Deen calculated, a question which I have now addressed to the local Authority
  In my letter, a copy of which is attached.
  i need not spell out the implications whlcn surround the facts now brought
  to light, but if I can be of further help to you in this matter, I would
  be pleased if you could contact me.

  Yours sincerely

The

I refer to your telephone conversation with Mrs. Hoo&heai on the 24th November,
1969. I confirm that the Chair of the General rurpomt V n e l % M authorised
that the safety certificate be anended to reflect the fact■tfeat the capacity of
the north west terrace should be reduced to £1,500 in T i n of ttoe crovd control
difficulties there were at the natch on the 21at 'Boveaher.    understand that
this accords with the new calculations you hare aade this week. 1 look forward
to bearing froa you with the revised plan you have prepared ot Oils portion of
the stadiua.

As you are avare froa the conversation with Mrs. Voodheai, the Building Surveyor
has advised me that the plan upon which the original calcalacfiaas was based was
Incorrect. In view of the fact that fresh calculations have lean aade in
respect of the north west corner, this appears to resolve the .problem in that
respect. However, I am concerned about the plana and calculations for the
reminder of the ground. With reference to the Kop area, 1 understand that you
are confident that these plans are correct. Z would be grateful if you would
confirm this.

            Capacity of Opper North West Terrace

            Subsequent to a meeting at Hanmerton Road Police Station on 22nd November
            to discuss various matters arising fran the match between Steffield
            Wednesday and Sheffield United on 21st November, I have had cause to
            revise the reoonmended holding capacity for this area of the ground.

            You will recall that the present capacity figures were produced within
            hours, on list August, 1989, and therefore only a paper exercise was
            carried out in that restrictive time.

            A site visit earlier today revealed the extent of the area of terrace

       •    partially blinded by the screen between the North West Terrace and the
            North Stand.

            Accordingly that area has been omitted from the gross available area of
            terra®.

            The holding capacity of the remaining areas has been re-calculated and
            modified in accordance with the Taylor reoartinendations, giving a resultant
            figure of 1,700.

            Eastwood aa3 Partners drawing number 1610/64E has been used for the layout
            of this area. In a telephone conversation between Mr Strange of Eastwood
            and Partners and my Principal Structural Engineer, late this afternoon, it
            was intisoated that this drawing may not be accurate, and that the gross
            available space may be slightly smaller than is shown on the drawing.

            Until the area has been resurveyed and revised drawings received, I would
            recommend that the holding capacity for the Upper North West Terrace be a
            maximum of 1,500.

                       SWPC v SHEFFIELD UNITED - 21 NOVEM3KR 1989


          Approximately five minutes before the kick off at 8 pm I went to the rear
          of the North West Terracing where I saw 200/300 people standing in the
          gangways and at the bottom of the stairwells being unable to gain access
          into the terraced area.   Having examined the situation I realised that
          there was no way this number could safely be acconmodated within that
          terraced area and I made inmediate plans to have them transferred to
          available seating within the North Stand.      Whilst carrying out this
          exercise I was informed by Chief Inspector Beal that a further 100/150
          spectators were still outside in Leppings Lane waiting to be admitted.

          On my instructions the turnstiles were closed and were not re-opened
          until the people who had been unable to gain access to the North West
          Terracing had been placed in the North Stand.        Having successfully
          achieved this I then arranged for the spectators who had been waiting
          outside to be also accommodated within the North Stand.

           I am concerned that the present Safety Certificate allows 2300 people to
           be acconmodated within the North West Terraces as a contingency, and
           having discussed the matter with Superintendent Sleath and Mr. Mackrell,
           Secretary of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, we are all agreed
           that this figure should now be revised to 1500 maximum.

      For the personal and urgent attention of
      Mr John Derricott




      Dear Sir

      HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND - THE NORTH WEST TERRACE

      As you are aware, on the evening of 21 November 1989 Sheffield Wednesday played
      Sheffield United at the Hillsborough Stadium. As a contingency the north west
      terrace was taken into use to accommodate the Sheffield United fans. The present
      capacity of this terrace is 2300 but, in the view of the officer in charge on the
      night - Chief Superintendent Nesbit 'F' Division - that number cannot be safely
      accommodated. Approximately five minutes before the kick-off there were 200/300
      people standing in the gangways and at the bottom of the stairwells, being unable
      to gain access into this terrace. Having examined the situation, Chief
      Superintendent Nesbit concluded that this number of people could not be safely
      accommodated within the terraced area and made pleas to have them transferred to
      another part of the ground. Whilst this exercise was being carried out it was
       seen that a further 100/150 spectators were still outside in Leppings Lane
      waiting to be admitted. These people, too, were accommodated in the north stand.

       It will be seen that around 450 people could not be accommodated and this was at
       a time when tickets had been sold which should have ensured that the capacity
       would not have been exceeded.

       It is the view of Chief Superintendent Nesbit that the capacity for this north
       west terrace should be reduced, and he has held preliminary discussions with the
       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Secretary, Mr Graham Mackrell, who has agreed
       that a realistic figure should be 1500 maximum.




                                                                                        Cont *d


                                                                                         3403

Clearly, urgent attention needs to be given to this matter since the fixture next
week on 29 November - Sheffield Wednesday -v- Liverpool - is expected to draw a
good crowd and it would seem that lessons had not been learnt if on that night
gates had to be closed before the official maximum capacity had been reached.

I await your early reply.

Yours faithfully

                                EMERGENCY ITEM

                SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 (AS AML.W ^ ,

     Capacities of Terrace Areas at Certificated Football Grounds and in
particular the North West Upper Terrace, Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground


1.    Introduction

1.1   On Wednesday, 22nd November, 1989 at the request of the South Yorkshire
      Police, Officers from the Administration and Legal Department, the
      Department of Land and Planning and the South Yorkshire Fire Service
      attended at Hammerton Road Police Station to view extracts from the
      Police video of the football match that had taken place at Hillsborough
      Sports Stadium the night before.

1.2   The Police highlighted the problem that had been experienced by a
      number of spectators in the North West Upper Terrace of the Ground and
^     the action they had taken to alleviate the problem.v {;tp £ g   ^ E c - X ia tJ




1.3   It was suggested that in the absence of further data, a revised
      capacity of 1,500 be placed in this area and that the General Safety
      Certificate in respect of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club be amended
      to reflect this. It was pointed out by the Police that the Club had no
      objection to this and the proposal was confirmed by Mr. Mackrell on
      behalf of the Club on Thursday, 23rd November, 1989.

1.4   The General Safety Certificate was amended with the approval of the
      Chairman of the General Purposes Panel on Friday, 24th November, 1989.
      I attach a copy of the amendment.

2.    Building Surveyor's Memorandum of 23rd November, 1989

2.1   Mr. Butler informed my Chief Licensing Officer (Sports Grounds), Mr.
      Derricott, in a telephone conversation at approximately 10.30 a.m. on
      23rd November, that Mr. Strange of Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,
      Consulting Engineers, had spoken to Mr. Sherriff, Principal Structural
      Engineer, Department of Land and Planning, and suggested that the plan
      on which capacities had been calculated for the North West Upper
      Terrace of the West Terrace was incorrect.

2.2   Mr. Butler confirmed this in a memorandum to me dated 23rd November,
      1989, and received by my Chief Licensing Officer at 11.30 a.m. on 24th
      November, 1989. I would draw your attention to paragraph 6 of the
      memorandum.

2.3   The capacity of 2,300 was incorporated into the Safety Certificate
      after I received a memorandum from the Building Surveyor dated 11th
      August, 1989 (copy attached). This amendment was authorised by the
      Panel at its meeting on 17th August, 1989.
                                        2.



3.     Messrs. Eastwood & Partners

3.1     My Assistant Solicitor, Mrs. Woodhead, telephoned Messrs. Eastwood &
        Partners on Friday afternoon, 24th November, 1989 at approximately
        1.00 p.m. and spoke with a Mr. Strange.

3*2 Mr. Strange pointed out that a revised plan was being drawn up based on
     calculations that had been made that day. He informed my Assistant
     Solicitor that the initial calculations for the area put the capacity
     at 1,594. This figure has not yet been confirmed by Messrs. Eastwood &
     Partners.

3.3    My Assistant Solicitor queried whether or not the plans for the Spion
       Kop Terrace area were correct. Mr. Strange   confirmed that the plans
       deposited with the Council for the Spion Kop were, as far as he was
       aware, up to date and correct.

3.4    I have written to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners confirming my Assistant
       Solicitor's telephone conversation and inviting a representative to the
       Panel meeting on 27th November (copy letter attached).

4.     Items for Consideration

       To confirm the actions of the Chairman in conjunction with the Head of
       Administration and Legal Department in authorising the amendment to the
       General Safety Certificate in respect of Sheffield Wednesday Football
       Club reducing the capacity for the North West Terrace Upper from 2 300
       to 1,500.

4.2    To consider what further action, if any, is needed in view of the
        forthcoming match on Wednesday, 29th November, 1989.

4 *3    To consider asking the Club to submit a full set of plans in respect of
       the Ground for the purposes of reassessing capacities.

5.     Documents Attached

5.1    The amended Schedule of Capacities incorporated into the General Safety
       Certificate for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

5.2    The Building Surveyor's memoranda dated 11th August, 1989 and 23rd
       November, 1989.

5.3    My letter to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners dated 24th November, 1989.

6.     Recommenda tions

6.1    The Panel is recommended to:-

       (a)   confirm the action taken by the Chairman in conjunction with the
             Head of Administration and Legal in reducing the capacity for the
             North West Terrace Upper of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to
             1,500;
     (b)     ask the Advisory Group to prepare a set of plans regulations which
             can be used by the Club to draw up a set of plans to enable
             capacities to be reassessed at the Sports Ground.

           The approximate holding capacities produced for the standing terrace
           areas do not take account of any turnstile ingress limitations, or
           those of egress or emergency egress limitations since it is my understanding
           that the Fire Authority will consider all these matters being that they
           have the primary function of estimation of terrace capacity.

           These figures therefore need to be carefully checked with those produced
           by the Fire Authority to ensure that account is taken of the need for
           any further limitations for the purposes of the proposed certificate
           amendment.

           My calculations based on the "green guide" modified by the Taylor Inquiry
           recommendations give the following

           1.   Spion Kop                     18,200
           2.   North West Terrace (Upper)     2,300
           3.   North West Corner (Lower)        680         (Pen   7)

           In accordance willh our consultations, figures have not been produced for
           Pens one to six of the West Terrace.

           I would appreciate the sight of the Fire Authority figures before the
           Certificate is amended.

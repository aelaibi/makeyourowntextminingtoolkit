B r ie fl y serials 36 and 37 were              r esponsible       during Phase          1 to work        in

c onjun ction wit h m ou nt ed officers and supervise Liverpool                            supporters

leaving       the trains at Wads 1ey S t a t i o n situated less than                     1 mile    from

the ground.



My original         orders     indicated that       during     this     phase,     serial    37,    was

to   remain s tat i c at       the R ai l w a y S t a t i o n and was NOT to escort

supporters         to the ground.



I e s t a b lished that        in fact only one train was expected                   (commonly

referred to as the service                train)    and this was a n t i c i p a t e d to arrive

at    1402 hours.



Serial       number 38 was       responsible       for   the supervising           and    parking     of

mini       buses   (containing Liverpool           supporters)        in W a r d s e n d R oad North,

w h ic h    is s i t uated near to the R a i l w a y Station.



Phase 2 referred to the               period during        the m atch w h i c h     included a

refreshment         period at C l a y w h e e 1s Lane.        Phase 3 involved similar

duties        to Phase    1,    ie.   s u p e r vising   supporters       returning       to the

R a i l w a y Station,    wit h the e xc e p t i o n of serial 38,            who were      to take        up

a position         in the ground       in front      of the N orth stand on the              perimeter

track.



Having       received the       briefing     I then briefed my three               serials as to

their       respective    duties,      f a m i l i a r i s e d myself with the      ground and        then

with Chief         Inspector P urdy at         11.00am a p p r o x i m a t e l y   I made my way to

the Wads l e y R ai l w a y S ta t i o n s i t uated on Pen i s t o n e Road N orth near to

its    c o n t i nuation with Halifax Road.               Almost     i m m e d iately supporters

began to arrive          in transit         type vans,       mini    buses and       private       cars.

                                                                                                  R 12



These were all L i v erpool               supporters and after about             1 hour    there had

been a c o n s i derable          buiId up of s u pporters and the area became                    quite

busy with both vehicular and                    p edestrian traffic.



It soon became a p p arent               that many s u pporters were walking              'Away'     from

the ground uphill               along P e nistone R o a d North towards H a l i f a x Road and

Foxhill      areas a pp ar en tl y        in search of alcohol.



Many v isited two              public    houses w i t h i n 50 yards     of my    location

a l t h o u g h these     public       houses were    closed to the general           public.        I

was aware        that the nearest            public   house    (apart from these          two)    was

the White Horse               public    house about 600 yards        up Halifax Road.             As a

result      I wa l k e d up Hali f a x Roa d to the a r e a of the White H orse                   public

house and s a t isfied myself                that   there were officers          patrolling       this

a rea also.         I then       returned to the R a i l w a y Station,          at Wadsley.

S up p o r t e r s were       still    walking a way from the Football            ground and we

were then        continually engaged a d v i s i n g          s u pporters   that    there was       no

p r ovision for them to obtain alcohol                    and that the       pubs were       closed

and that they should make their way                      to the ground.          This?    almost

without      e x ception had           little   effect and the supporters            nonetheless

continued to walk away from the ground some                         returning       during    the next

hour    carrying        cans and        packs of    lager and beer and were           s i milarly

a d v i s e d that they w o u l d n ’t be p e rmitted to take             it into the ground.

At a p p r ox i m a t e l y    1.45pm I observed a crowd of about                100 youths       sat     on

a grass verge           in Halifax R oad app r ox im a t e 1y 100 yards             from my

location,        all drinking what a p p e a r e d to be alcohol              in cans.        Many

others were mill i n g around.                  I felt   it necessary to         request a mobile

serial      to at t e n d this         location to supervise        these youths         in the    event

of trouble         but at this          time they a p p e a r e d well   behaved.        I then saw
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     R 12

two m ou n t e d officers        on their horses         positioned        i mmediately behind

these supporters and stood on the                    forecourt      of H a l fords Store.             After

a p p r o k imately two minutes            I heard a request        for a s s i s t a n c e a n d ' l o o k e d

immediately           towards Halfords and saw that the two officers                          on horses

had disappeared.             Supt.    Marshall      and Ch.     X n s p . Rurdy were walking

across the           road towards     the supporters.           I sent 6 men         immediately

towards H a l f o r d s w i th the         i nstruction to assist         the m o u n t e d    officers

a nd establ i s h e d     that there was an of f - l i c e n c e        facility       in the Gateway

supermarket          s i t u at ed at the    rear   of these      premises.



At S. O O p m the service          train a r r i v e d as scheduled.            I a s c e r t a i n e d that

there were 430 supporters                  on board.     With    the approval          of Supt.

Marshall        at    the scene,     and    in view of their being            no other        trains

arriving,        myself and serials 36 and 37 together wit h the assis t a n c e

of m ou n t e d officers,        m a r s h a l l e d the s u pporters    into P e n i s t o n e Road

N o r t h and then e s c orted them without              incident       to the L e p p i n g s Lane

e ntrance       of the ground a r r iving at 2 . 2 0 p m .          I, together w i t h Serials

36 and 37 then           remained at the L e p p i n g s Lane entrance and a g a i n with

the a s sistance         of moun t e d officers we        began to marshall             the

suppo r t e r s walk i n g along Leppings Lane                from the dir e c t i o n of

Peni stone Road N o r th and directed                them to the turnstiles.



After a period of about               10 minutes,       due    to the number         of s upporters

attending,           vehicular   traffic was        unable     to move along L e p pings Lane,

a l t h ou gh   I saw a black Capri           inching    its way through driven by a

w o ma n driver.



1' continually          received enquiries          from supporters         for d i rect ions         to

either     the N or t h S tand or L e p pings Lane             or West Stand.
-/It was at this          time     that    I was a pp ro a c h e d         by three men who        produced

 to me three           counterfeit        tickets      that    they stated they had purchased

 from a small           boy appro;;.      3 ’6" to      A-   feet     tall.     These were

 a m a t e u r i s h l y forged on an o r d inary            copying machine and had been

 h ast i l y    coloured       in ye l l o w   crayon.        I showed        to the men A p p e n d i x       ‘E '

 of my order           confirming       the    colour     coding       of    legitimate       tickets as

 brown,        red,    purple,     orange,      blue and green only.                  They    indicated        that

 the     boy had several           of these      tickets and that he h a d n ’t been able                       to

 sell    these        tickets    fast enough        to s u p p o r t e r s    coming    from the

 dir e c t i o n of C at c h Bar Lane           (ie.    the opposite           dir e c t i o n to where my

a t t en ti on had been           concentrated).             I a d v i s e d the men and they wa l k e d

 a way    in an attempt          to find the boy.



 I was     then aware          that   I had become           ov e r w h e l m e d by the sheer         volume    of

 suppor ters          though    I was stood       in the middle              of the    road.     I then

 s i m u l ta n eo u sl y began to receive             several        reports     from memb e r s       of the

 public that           people were        getting      crushed at the turnstiles.                      The

 latter        of these    reports were          from     people who were o b v i o u s l y frantic

 wit h worry and          concern and they were                having        to shout,       though only a

 few feet away from me.                   I mmediately        I began to seek           the a t t e n t i o n of

 the m ou n t e d Police          Inspector      on his       horse        nearby.     I could see           there

 were     horses       in the     crowd of people            i mmediately outside             the main gates

 in Leppings Lane.               The moun t e d officers were                 having great       d i fficulty

 controlling           their horses and they w e y L likewise                     i n d i v iduall y

 surro u n d e d by a huge            crowd of supporters.                  It was    difficult        to

 communicate           verba l l y and by radio due to the general                       noise and the

 lack of radio air              space,     however      I was able           to make my way to and

 shout     to the M ou nt ed          Inspector     (whose          name    I. did not know).           He was

 attempting           to re-group his men and                                         form a barrier

 across        the front       of the gates.           P e o F *c                 _nually a r r iving          from

both directions         in their       hundreds and a l t h o u g h         I was    still      in the

centre of L e p p i n g s Lane and          I was        still    surro u n d e d by supporters

there was no d i s c e rnible movement                   of the    crowd.     The t u rnst iles were

direc t l y    in front     of me though about 40 yards away and the masses                                of

people were       contin u a l l y a t t e m p t i n g    to filter      slowly towards          the

turnstiles.        I heard       repeated       requests         over the tannoy system from

the area of the t u rnstiles for                 people       to stop pushing,


                                                                                            /
At 2 . 30 pm a Lan d r o v e r     arrived driven by PC                 1863 Michael     Bux t o n and he

positioned his vehicle              at an angle           direc t l y    in front    of the

turnstiles       in L e p p i n g s Lane with the            roof mounted      public address

s ystem speaker       facing       the s upporters          trying      to enter     the turnstiles.



I heard him appeal           for    patience and           to stop pushing          but this      seemed

to have no effect.



In view of the        number       of queries        I had       received for       directions         I

thought       it w ould assist        if 1 was able           to direct      the    crowd visually

also    from the     problem areas,           and    I w o u l d obtain a better           vantage

point.        I climbed onto the           roof of the           landrover took       control         of the

mobile    public: address          system and        perso n a l l y began to advise             people

where    to go w i t h their        respective           tickets and to appeal           to them to

stop    pushing.



I saw that       the m o un te d Police had              in fact    formed a barrier across                the

front    of the mai n gates           between       the natural         barrier walls        on either

side    of the main gates,            I e s timated 6 horses at this                 stage.

My   initial     view from this vantage                  point    gave me real       cause      for

concern.        I could see that all a r o u n d me                people were       s t a t i o n a r y and

     >se together and as they neared the turnstiles                           they were         jammed

                                                                                                          R IS

 together       for    the whole w idth of the turnstiles and for a depth of

 several     yards.           All    I could see were heads             of hair.        Not   even their

 shoulders were          visible.         They were          so tightly       packed that      1 began to

 shout over       the     public address          system to stop pushing.                 I could hear

 people screaming:

                 “Get    the match delayed."

 and

                 "why don't you get the m a t c h delayed."

 I responded w i th more appeals                  over       the    public address       sys t e m and

 several     times a s k e d for         patience and          I. informed the       crowd that we

 were making          efforts        to delay the        'kick o f f ’ .      I could see      people

^frantically          s t ruggling      to get further             forward    past the barrier

 created by the horses.                  Some youths          I saw    run u n d e r n e a t h the horses,

 others    su c c e e d e d    in pushing       between them.



 There was       no idscernible           gap betw e e n the          supporters     on either        side of

 the horses and          I could see that a space                    had been provided         in the

 centre    of the horses              for the s upporters            to gain access.          This    I

 c onveyed to the supporte rs                  over    the    public address        system and

 visual ly d i r ected them also.                 This       should have       restricted access            by

 a p p r o x i m a t e l y 807. but the    crowd seemed to have been grip p e d by a

 m ania and their             only    intention a p p e a r e d to be to gain access                 to the

 gro u n d at any       cost        before the kick          off.



 1 was    c ontinually          looking at my w a t c h            in the    period between 2.50pm

 and 3.00pm.           I was        gripped with       real    concern that there was            serious

 danger    of    injury or           loss of    life.        I looked to my       left and as far as

  I could see down Leppings Lane                      (a p p r o x i m a t e l y 400 yards)   it was

  crowded wit h h u n dreds            of supporters w h i c h stretched from wall                    to wall

 and all were making                 their way to the          turnstiles.        The    s i tuation was
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                           R 12

similar       from the other                direction.



I continued my appeals                      to the    crowd and was         shouting above          the P.A.

system so loud that this                      caused me to          cough between messages.



I heard a cheer                from wi t h i n the ground w h i c h          I later a s s u m e d to be

the    players          entering       the field.        I became       i n c r e asingly anxi o u s as

people      ignored the           barrier       of horses.           I heard abuse        from supporters

direct ed at the m ou n t e d officers who were                         being a c c u s e d    of   preventing

them     gaining         entry.        1 saw that       the sit u a t i o n had w o r s e n e d     in that

there were          people       p r e c a riously b a l anced and tightly               packed on top of

the    row of narrow             railings w hich         ran down the           centre    of the a p p r o a c h

to the turnstiles.                    The    crowd was    tigh t l y     packed below them and                 it

was    though       these       people on the          railings       had c 1 imbed onto        them so as

to a v o i d being         crushed by the             crowd.        The y were    simply sat        there       for

the full        length of the               railings    facing       both sides as        if they had

climbed from both sides.                       There was no more            room for an y o n e         else on

the    railings a n d they were                 so tightly          packed they were          in danger         of

falling       off       into    the    crowd below.           The    scene was      by now so desperate

that     I looked at my watch again hoping that                             either     there w ould be an

a n n o u n c em en t    that    the kick       off was       dela y e d or that the a t t i t u d e           of

the    crowd w ou l d          change whe n they realised                that    their    objective        to get

in the ground before kick-off                        had not been achieved.                 It was       fifteen

seconds       to three.



Still      I could see           no signs       of the     crowd diminishing             d i r ectly     in front

of the turnstiles.                    I could see a Police Officer                  in the     corner and to

the far       left hand side of the turnstiles,                          he seemed unable           to move

due    to the sheer weight                   of supporters.           I could o c c a s i o n a l l y    see

other officers             on the       inside       of the    ground at the turnstiles.                   The
                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                    R 12

problems      continued       in this vain as s u pporters               continued to enter the

turnstiles.          The    next thing         I recall    is looking      towards     the

turnstiles a ga i n and to my surprise and                     relief     I saw that     there was

only a small         crowd about 3 yards            deep but      for    its whole width.            I had

not seen where the main bulk                    of s u pporters    had gone     to and my only

belief was that            they had somehow ente r e d           the ground quic k l y through

the    turnstiles.         What    1 wit n e s s e d then     I watched      in disbelief          and

amazement.        I saw the supporters              clambering        over the t u rnstiles any

way they      could.       They were a p p a r e n t l y not showing         tickets     or    paying

to enter.        Some      supporters      I saw    literally diving         over the turnstiles

as though a huge wave              of    panic had de s c e n d e d over     them to ENTER           the

ground a l t h o u g h there was          no    reason for this         behaviour.      I was

instantly      relieved at this stage               to see the        problem of entry had been

resolved before            there had been death or             injuries at      the turnstiles.



There    remained a p p r o x i m a t e l y 200     people     outside     the ground on the

L eppings     Lane    side of the         horses a p p a r e n t l y still    intent    on gaining

entry and      I heard one m ou n t e d officer              shout?

               "If you haven* t got tickets                  then get a w a y . ”

This    seemed to d i scourage            them m o m e n t a r i l y and they all m o v e d back

and some      began to move         position though they made no attempt                      to    leave

the area.        Some      still   a t t em p t e d to get    past his horse         into the

turnstile area.



I then a l i gh te d from the            roof    of the    landrover and having          spoken to

PC Bux t o n he then drove              his vehicle       into the      lane down the        right       hand

side    of the    turnstiles and w hich gives access                     to the ground and           in

particular to the S o u t h Stand.                 After a few seconds          I heard a message

over    the   radio     requesting all av a i l a b l e        personnel      onto    the field.           I

o bserved 25 to 40 officers                run    in the same      direction as a result.                  It
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     R 12

then became a p p arent          that      there was a serious em e r g e n c y and myself

and those      remaining at the entrance                  received urgent          i n s t r uctions    to

close the gates.



Immedi a t e l y the turnstile             gates were      slammed shut and           I then a s s isted

other    officers      to    close the forecourt and to                close the main steel

gates at the L e p p i n g s Lane entrance.                 We were       i m m e d iately    confronted

by anger and a gg re s s i o n from the man y supporters                      remaining and

demanding      entry to the ground.                I was    personally a p p r o a c h e d by a few

individuals       on separate           occasions who were arguing with disbelief

that anyone        could shut the g a t e s .            They were waving         their       tickets

wit h fury     in my face.             1 e x plained     that    the ground was         full    to    capaci

a nd had been closed because                 of safety      regulations.          The     supporters

seemed unable         to accept any explanation.                   I could u n d e r s t a n d a

persons anger at being                 refused entry having          purchased a ticket               but

this was more         than simple          protest and anger and             I could not

comprehend       the fanatical           behaviour       of these    supporters.             I had to

f orcibly     push awa y those           I was speaking          to and    I recall       shouting at

one    to take his       ticket        back to Liv e r p o o l    and that the gates were shut

and    closed.      It seemed that my final                remarks     registered w ith those

that    they were d i r e c t l y a i m e d at but         no sooner       had    I got      the message

across     I found myself          repeating       it to other       similarly angry

supporters.         Other     officers were         likewise       trying     to clear        the area       in

front of the gates.



At a p p r o x im a te ly 3 . 1 0 pm    I went    into    the Lane     leading      to the South

S tand where       I had seen other            officers     running.        1 saw several            other

officers      tending       to injured        persons     just    inside    the    lane?      near    to the

corner     of the south and west               stands.      Some    of the       injured were         laid

on the ground.           Some    had white        blankets       of a type       normally      carried       by
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                           R 12

a mbul a n c e s     over    their bodies and            covering        their     faces.      It was

apparent         that the re was an e m ergency and there had been a disaster

though       I was     not aware at           that time        the    extent      nor the

circumstances.               I reasoned that there w o u l d be man y officers                           inside

the ground and              I looked around and saw supporters                        leaving the

ground.         Man y were        injured or d i s t r e s s e d and were             s t aggering about           in

shock and disbelief-                    I realised that          this area w ould be a major

route for the e me rg e n c y services and my efforts and those                                     of the       few

remaining officers was a s s isting                      and    comforting         the    injured and

a tt e m p t i n g   to keep      people moving who were                 leaving      the ground,           I

observ ed a p p r o x i m a t e l y      10 covered        bodies and 20           or more injured

persons        sat    or    laid on the tarmac             amongst        them.     Whilst work i n g           I and

every officer was met with a wall                          of abuse        from    some     of these

s upportes a p p o r ti on in g          blame     to the Police.             Anger      like I had never

seen before was              being      directed at'us.



Man y    people were          being a g gressive           to the      extent      that    I anticipated a

serious disorder              problem        if we did not           receive a s s i s t a n c e    outside       the

g round and          I h ast i l y    requested further Police assis t a n c e                     over my

radio,         1 o b s erved      several       individual       officers and trying               to    restore

order.        Some     of these         supporters were          uncontrollable,            I unde r s t o o d

that this anger was                  p a r t ly/wholly a t t r i b u t a b l e    to something          they had

seen     in the ground and               in some      cases was a shocked                reaction.         1 found

myself       putting my arms             round man y of these              people and walking with

them to keep them moving,                     consoling        them whilst         I did so.         All    the

time other           officers and I were              being verbally ab u s e d            in a most

violent manner,               I fully expected being a s s a u l t e d at any moment,



I observed that              officers       had formed themselves                 into a line near to

and     protecting          the   injured and dead and                naturally       creating an avenue

in w hich suppo r t e r s          could    leave without         hinderanee        to the     injured.



1 saw one officer who was                   in full    u n i f o r m but without a helmet

remonstrating w ith violent and angry supporters at the m a i n gates.

In order       to quieten the situation and at serious                             risk to myself         I

went    into the middle              of these suppo r t e r s and took an unusual                    course

of ac t i o n and       instructed the Police Offi c e r                 to go awa y w h i c h he did.

This    seemed to appe a s e            them.



It was     now a p p a r e n t      that there had been a major                   disaster    but    still     no

one    could have            com p r e h e n d e d the extent     of   it.    1 easily       recognised

that    this was        no normal        s i tuation and that            it could not        be dealt with

or catered for by normal                   Police    practices.           The potential        for    public

disorder       outside         the ground at this           stage was        enormous.        In my

opinion,       one wrong word by a Police Officer                         could have     ignited a

s i tuation w hich w ould have become                   riotous.          I felt that        the Police

Officers       could do no other              than   remain       in their        positions,    taking        the

abuse and a g g r e s si ve ne ss w hich was               conti nually d i r ected towards

them.       I, as Senior Officer at the scene was                            primarily then engaged

keeping       control         of the situation.            The    line    of officers were

shielding and           protecting         the   dead and        injured and had the           crowd been

able    to see       clearly this scene              I felt      this alone        could have       caused

serious       problems          of disorder and        crowd      control.         I am unable       to

chro n o l o g i c a l l y    describe     the    sequence       of events from this           point as         1

was    continually            engaged     on various       duties,       w hich    included tending           to

the    injured.          I removed my           coat and    put    it round one        injured       person

after another as                each left the scene           or was      conveyed to Hospital                by a

fleet of a mb u l a n c e s w hi ch arrive.



I instructed officers                  to place      barriers and cover them wit h tarpaulin

sheets and             place    them ar ound the dead and              injured,




I directed a nurse                in civilian       clothes who          offered her         help to the

injured        people         lying   on the tarmac,          I consoled a P o l i c e w o m a n who was

u n a sh a m e d l y    crying    but nevertheless          she     remained        in the    line of

Police Officers.                 Some    officers were a s sisting               the   injured.



Supt,      Marshall           a rr iv ed and at his       request      I sent several          officers         to

clear      the Lane           for the a m bulances        so that      they may        continue     to arrive

at the Leppings Lane                  entrance a n d      leave via P e nistone Roa d North.                     I

later      sent more           officers to assist as more                people began leaving the

ground.         A photographer a rr i v e d wearing                a flourescent waistcoat.                     My

at te nt io n was         drawn to him when several                violent and a n g r y supporters

tried to attack him.                    Whilst    he did not say a word they a c c u s e d him

of taking         photographs.            So violent was          their aggression,            in my

opinion,        he was         in serious    risk    of    losing his          life had the supporters

not been prevented                by other       officers     from getting hold of him,                    I

litera lly frog m ar ch ed the               photographer          out of the way for his                own

protection.             He     did not appear       to a p p r e c i a t e    the seriusness        of the

sit u a t i o n he found himself             in and all         the time other           s u p p o r t e r s were

directing         their a gg re s s i o n at him.           I found          it nec e s s a r y to m a r c h him

hur r i e d l y 30 or 40 yards where                I gave him to the               custody of two other

officers         in Leppi n g s Lane and           i n structed them to take him as                   far away

as    possible.



Three a m b u l an ce s a rr i v e d and          in the absence             of the driver       I drove        the

foremost a mb ul a n c e          down the       line of    injured          people    to a l l o w access

for    the other ambulances.



Everyone at             the    scene had a task to           perform.          I recall      a Doctor
                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                  R 12

arriving and asking where                  he was    required.       Supt,    Marshall        deputed an

officer       to take       him to the gymnasium,           A short while         later another

D octor a rr iv ed and           1 sim i l a r l y deputed another      officer     to take       him to

the    gymnasium.



I   a s s i s t e d anot h e r   officer    to    console a|                 [man who    I know to          be

B rian A N D E R S O N    (approx,     30 years).       He was     sat on the tarmac at the

side     of his     father who was a p p a r e n t 1y d e a d .       Brian A n d e r s o n did not

want     to be _____________________________             s e p arated from his      father and          I

instructed a Police Officer                  to   remain wit h him.



As the time         elapsed       it became       clear as to the severity of the

disaster and a sombre mood befell                     the   crowd,     I continued with my

duties and shortly after                observed that        some officers were           in fact

performing         the task       of i de nt i f i c a t i o n of the deceased.



I then left         the scene with several             other   officers       together with Chief

Inspector P u r dy a n d we           returned to the R a i l w a y S t a t i o n and a s s i s t e d

wit h enquiries and gene ral dut i es                 in the area.



At a pp ro xi m a t e l y    1800 hours      I returned with 5 officers             to Clayw h e e l s

Lane.       More    officers arri v e d a short while afterwards.                       It was    clear

m a n y were     visibly shocked and u p s e t / d i s t r e s s e d and unfit           to    continue

duty.



I returned with these               officers      to R o t h e r h a m where we all      retired from

duty.



To summarise,            it is my genuine          belief   that   supporters      entering       the

t urnstiles        betw e e n    1450 and    1500 hours were         in imminent        danger    of
                                                                                                        PAGE    15
                                                                                                        R 12

being    killed or ser i o u s l y           injured as a result           of the huge          volume of

fanatical       supporters            arriving    eni-nasse, all        intent and a n x i o u s    to the

point of d e s p er at io n to get             into the ground at any              cost    before       the

kick    off.      This was           confirmed by the a n x i e t y of m any other               supporters

who were       f r a n t i c al ly    pleading    for   the kick        off to be dela y e d and for

the Police        to do something a l t h o u g h the s i tuation d e veloped so

q uickly and w ith the behaviour                   of the      crowd this was           impossible.



I am s atisfied          that the officers              1 could see behaved             in a

professional and ex e m p l a r y manner and did ail                       they    could       in the

circum stances          prevailing.



The M o u n t e d Police also a cted              in a professional           manner and         I was

impressed by the way they o r g anised t h emselves                          to form a barrier

under great and difficult                    circumstances       the     like of w h i c h      I have    not

seen since the miners                  strike.     Whilst      their actions may have              relieved

the    pressure for a short w h i 1e on the turnstiles,                           the   behaviour and

volume of the           crowd was such that             they were        unable    to sust a i n    it.

I was    not su r p r i s e d to find during             the     period    consoling       the violent

supporters        leaving       the ground after           the    incident       that m any of them

had been dr i nk i ng and s m e 1 led s t r o n g l y of alcohol.                   I consider          that

this    played a large               part   in the b e h aviour     of those acting

i r r e sponsibly and violently.                  Whilst    I was       in close    proximity to many

other HONE violent              persons       < i n c 1 us i ng those    injured)       none     of these

a p p e a r e d to have      been drinking.



I did not witn e s s any violent                  disorder as such           prior to the match

though this         seems      to have been d i v erted or released from the                       crowd

through efforts            to enter         the ground.        iiy conclusions were that m any

supporters        had    in fact a rr i v e d      in sufficient          time    but had       left the

            distance whe n        returning,     they had a r r i v e d   late.   This    resulted       in a

            situation w h e r e b y they were        unable to enter all at once.               The whole

            of Leppings      Lane at the        crucial    10 minute      period was one mass        of

            m oving     people.     In my opinion this w o u l d have been the queue                had they

            all      stood still.     It w ou ld have n e c e s s i t a t e d hundreds    of Police       in

            the      circumstances    to control      them and the m a j o r i t y w ould have       been

            unable to gain access wi thout missing                  part of the match.



            Those      supporters    at   the   rear w o u l d have been unaware         of the    problem

            of entry as      the t u rnstiles were         so far away and out of view.              The

            situation d e v el o p e d so quickly that we were              powerless     to    control    the

            huge      numbers and even with        re i nfo r cements     it w ould have       entailed

             crowd, control       similar   to that w i t n e s s e d   in the Miners St r i k e    to

             restore orderly        queues.

        I am a Police Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police at

        present stationed at C.l Sub Division, Rotherham.

        At 10.00 am on Saturday,                                       15 April 1989, I attended a briefing

        at Hillsborough Football Ground,                                                 Sheffield, together with

        other officers, in connection with the F.A.                                                    Semi-Final to

        be played at the ground at 3 pm the same d a t e .                                                      The match

        was to involve the teams of Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham

        Forest F .C ..

        I was designated sub sector 14 (call sign India 14)                                                             ,

        and detailed to supervise 3 serials, Nos.                                                     36, 37 and 38.

        We were part of a contingency commanded by Supt. Marshall

        (Sector 2) and Chief Inspectors Purdy and Waring.

        Each Serial contained 1 Sergeant and 8 men and our duties

        were split into 3 Phases.

Briefly serials 36 and 37 were responsible during Phase 1

to work in conjunction with mounted officers and supervise

Liverpool supporters leaving the trains at Wadsley Station

situated less than 1 mile from the ground.

My original orders indicated that during this phase,

serial 37, was to remain static at the Railway Station and

was NOT to escort supporters to the ground.

I established that in fact only one traing was expected

 (commonly referred to as the service train) and this was

anticipated to arrive at 1402 hours.

Serial number 38 was responsible for the supervising and

parking of mini buses           (containing Liverpool supporters)

in Wardsend Road North, which is situated near to the

Railway Station.

Phase 2 referred to the period during the match which

included a refreshment period at Claywheels Lane.                                 Phase 3

involved similar duties to Phase 1 i.e.                             supervising

 supporters returning to the Railway Station, with the

exception of serial 38, who were to take up a position

 in the ground in front of the North Stand on the perimeter

track.

Having received the briefing I then briefed my three serials

 as to their respective duties,                familiarised myself with the

 ground and then with Chief Inspector Purdy at 11.00 am

 approximately I made my way to the Wadsley Railway Station

 situated on Penistone Road North near to its continuation

 with H a lifax Road.

         Almost immediately supporters began to arrive in transit

         type vans, mini buses and private cars.

         These were all Liverpool supporters and after about 1 hour

         there had been a considerable build up of supporters and the

         area became quite busy with both vehicular and pedestrian

        traffic.

         It soon became apparent that many supporters were walking

         ’A w a y ’ from the ground uphill along Penistone Road North

        towards Halifax Road and Foxhill areas apparently in search

        of alcohol.



        Many visited two public houses within 50 yards of my

        location although these public houses were closed to the

        general public.          I was aware that the nearest public

        house    (apart from these two) was the White Horse public

        house about 600 yards up Halifax Road.                             As a result I

        walked up Halifax Road to the area of the White Horse

        public house and satisfied myself that there were officers

        patrolling this area also.              I then returned to the Railway

        Station, at Wadsley.            Supporters were still walking away

        from the Football ground and we were then continually

        engaged advising supporters that there was no provision

        for them to obtain alcohol and that the pubs were closed

        and that they should make their way to the ground.                            This,

        almost without exception had little effect and the supporters

        nonetheless continued to walk away from the ground some

        returning during the next hour carrying cans and packs

        of lager and beer and were similarly advised that they

        wouldn't be permitted to take it into the ground.

        At approximately          1.45 pm Iobserved a crowd of about

        100 youths sat on         a grass verge in Halifax Road                           approximately

        100 yards from my location, all drinking what appeared

        to be alcohol in cans.                      Many others were milling around.

        I felt it necessary to request a mobile serial to attend

        this location to          supervise these youths in the event

        of trouble but at         this time they appeared well behaved.                            I

        then saw two mounted officers on their horses positioned

        immediately behind these supporters and stood on the

        forecourt of Halfords Store.                              After approximately two

        minutes I heard a request for assistance and looked

        immediately towards Halfords and saw that the two officers

        on horses had disappeared.                             Supt. Marshall and Ch.      Insp.

        Purdy were walking acorss the road towards the supporters.

        I sent 6 men immediately towards Halfords with the

        instruction to assist the mounted officers and established

        that there was an off-licence facility in the Gateway

        supermarket situated at the rear of these premises.

        At 2.00 pm the service train arrived as scheduled.                                  I

        ascertained that there were 430 supporters on board.                                    With

        the approval of Supt. Marshall at the scene, and in view

        of their being no other trains arriving, myself and

officers, marshalled the supporters into Penistone Road

North and then escorted them without incident to the

Leppings Lane entrance of the ground arriving at 2.20 pm.

I, together with Serials 36 and 37 then remained at the

Leppings Lane entrance and again with the assistance of

mounted officers we began to marshall the supporters

walking along Leppings Lane from the direction of Penistone

Road North and directed them to the turnstiles.

After a period of about 10 minutes, due to the number

of supporters attending, vehicular traffic was unable to

move along Leppings Lane, although I saw a black Capri

inching its way through driven by a woman d r i v e r .

I continually received enquiries from supporters for

directions to either the North Stand or Leppings Lane

or West S t a n d .

 It was at this time that I was approached by three men who

produced to me three counterfeit tickets that they stated

they had purchased from a small boy approx.                          3'6" to 4 feet

 tall.     These were amateurishly forged on an ordinary

 copying machine and had been hastily coloured in yellow

 crayon.     I showed to the men Appendix                     'E' of my order

 confirming the colour coding of legitimate tickets as

 brown, red, purple, orange,            blue and green only.               They

 indicated that the boy had several of these tickets and

 that he hadn't been able to sell these tickets fast enough

  to supporters coming from the direction of Catch Bar Lane

  (i.e. the opposite direction to where my attentions had been

  concentrated).                     I advised the men and they walked away in

  an attempt to find the boy.

  I was then aware that I had become overwhelmed by the

  sheer volume of supporters though I was stood in the

 middle of the road.                         I then simultaneously began to receive

  several reports from members of the public that people were

  getting crushed at the turnstiles.                                   The latter of these

  reports were from people who were obviously frantic with

 worry and concern and they were having to shout, though

  only a few feet away from me.                              Immediately I began to seek

  the attention of the mounted Police Inspector on his horse

  nearby.                   I could see there were horses in the crowd of

  people immediately outside the main gates in Leppings

  Lane.                 The mounted officers were having great difficulty

  controlling their horses and they were likewise individually

  surrounded by a huge crowd of supporters.                                       It was

  difficult to communicate verbally and by radio due to the

  general noise and the lack of radio air space, however

  I was able to make my way to and shout to the Mounted

  Inspector                  (whose name I did not k n o w ) .                 He was attempting

  to re-group his men and I requested he form a barrier

  across the front of the gates.                               People were continually

  arriving from both directions in their hundreds and although

I was still in the centre of Leppings Lane and I was still

surrounded by supporters there was no discernible movement of

the crowd.       The turnstiles were directly in front of me

though about 40 yards away and the masses of people were

continually attempting to filter slowly towards the

turnstiles.        I heard repeated requests over the tannoy system

from the area of the turnstiles for people to stop pushing.

At 2.50 pm a Landrover arrived driven by PC 1863 Michael

Buxton and he positioned his vehicle at an angle directly

inf ront of the turnstiles in Leppings Lane with the roof

mounted public address system speaker facing the supporters

trying to enter the tur n s t i l e s .

I heard him appeal for patience and to stop pushing but

this seemed to have no effect.

In view of the number of queries I had received for directions

I thought it would assist if I was able to direct the

crowd visually also from the problem areas, and I would

obtain a better vantage point.                  I climed onto the roof of

the landrover took control of the mobile public address

system and personally began to advise people where to go

with their respective tickets and to appeal to them to

stop pushing.

I saw that the mounted Police had in fact formed a barrier

across the front of the main gates between the natural

barrier walls on either side of the main gates,                      I estimated

6 horses at this stage.

         My initial view from this vantage point gave me real cause

         for concern.           I could see that all around me people were

         stationary and close together and as they neared the

         turnstiles they were jammed together for the whole width

         of the turnstiles and for a depth of several yards.                              All I

         could see were heads of hair.                    Not even their shoulders

         were visible.           They were so tightly packed that I beaan

         to shout over the public address system to stop*                          I could

         hear people screaming:

                                "Get the match delayed."

         and

                                "Why don't you get the match delayed."

         I responded with more appeals over the public address

         system and several times asked for patience and I informed

         the crowd that we were making efforts to delay the                          'kick off'

         I could see people frantically struggling to get further

         forward past the barrier created by the horses.                          Some youths

          I saw run underneath the horses, others succeeded in

         pushing between them.

         There was no discernible gap between the supporters on

         either side of the horses and I could see that a space had

          been provided in the centre of the horses for the supporters

         to gain access.            This I conveyed to the supporters over the

          public address system and visually directed them also.

          This should have restricted access by approximately 80%

        but the crowd seemed to have been gripped by a mania and

        their only intention appeared to be to gain access to the

        ground at any cost before the kick off.

        I was continually looking at my watch in the period between

        2.50 pm and 3.00 pm.             I was gripped with real concern that

        there was serious danger of injury or loss of life.                              I looked

        to my left and as far as I could see down Leppings Lane

         (approx 400 yards)         it was crowded with hundreds of

        supporters which stretched from wall to wall and all were

        making their way to the turnstiles.                         The situation was similar

        from the other direction.

        I continued my appeals to the crowd and was shouting above

        the P.A.       system so loud that this caused me to cough between

        messages.

        I heard a cheer from within the ground which I later assumed

        to be the players entering the field.                              I became increasingly

        anxious as people ignored the barrier of horses.                              I heard

        abuse from supporters directed at the mounted officers

        who were being accused of preventing them gaining entry.

        I saw that the situation had worsened in that there were

        people precariously balanced and tightly packed on top of

        the row of narrow railings which ran down the centre of the

        approach to the turnstiles.                 The crowd was tightly packed

        below them and it was as though these people on the railings

        had climbed onto them so as to avoid being crushed by the

         crowd.     THey were simply sat there for the full length

         of the railings facing both sides as if they had climbed

         from both sides.             THere was no more room for anyone else

         on the railings and they were so tightly packed they were

         in danger of falling off into the crowd below.                         The scene

        was by now so desperate that I looked at my watch again

         hoping that either there would be an announcement that the

         kick-off was delayed or that the attitude of the crowd

        would change when they realised that their objective to

         get in the ground before kick-off had not been achieved.

         It was fifteen seconds to three.

         Still I could see no signs of the crowd diminishing

         directly in front of the turnstiles.                         I could see a Police

         Officer in the corner and to the far left hand side of the

         turnstiles, he seemed unable to move due to the sheer

         weight of supporters.             I could occasionally see other

         officers on the inside of the ground at the turnstiles.

         The problems continued in this vain as supporters continued

         to enter the turnstiles.             The next thing I recall is looking

         towards the turnstiles again and to my surprise and relief

         I saw that there was only a small crowd about 5 yards deep

         but for its whole width.             I had not seen where the main

         bulk of supporters had gone to and my only belief was that

         they had somehow entered the ground quickly through the

         turnstiles.        What I witnessed then I watched in disbelief

 and amazement.          I saw the supporters clambering over the

 turnstiles any way they could.                     They were apparently not

 showing tickets qr paying to enter.                          Some supporters I saw

 literally diving over the turnstiles as though a huge wave

 of panic had descended over them to enter the ground although

 there was no reason for this behaviour.                            I was instantly

 relieved at this stage to see the problem of entry had been

 resolved before there had been death or injuries at the

 turnstiles.

 There remained approximately 200 people outside the ground on

 the Leppings Lane side of the horses apparently still

 intent on gaining entry and I heard one mounted officer shout

                      "If you haven't got tickets then get away."

 This seemed to discourage them momentarily and they all

 moved back and some began to move position though they made

 no attempt to leave the area.                    Some still attempted to get

 past his horse into the turnstile area.

 I then alighted from the roof of the landrover and having

 spoken to PC Buxton he then drove his vehicle into the lane

 down the right hand side of the turnstiles and which gives

 access to the ground and in particular to the South Stand.

 After a few seconds I heard a message over the radio

 requesting all available personnel onto the field.                             I

 observed 25 to 40 officers run in the same direction as a

 result.      It then became apparent that there was a serious

 emergency and myself and those remaining at the entrance

 received urgent instructions to close the gates.

 Immediately the turnstile gates were slammed shut and I then

 assisted other officers to close the forecourt and to close

 the main steel gates at the Leppings Lane entrance.                           We

 were immediately confronted by anger and aggression from the

 many supporters remaining and demanding entry to the ground.

 I was personally approached by a few individuals on separate

 occasions who were arguing with disbelief that anyone could

 shut the gates.          They were waving their tickets with fury

 in my face.        I explained that the ground was full to capacity

 and had been closed because of safety regulations.                           The

 supporters seemed unable to accept any explanation.                           I could

 understand a persons anger at being refused entry having

 purchased a ticket but this was more than simple protest

 and anger and I could not comprehend the fanatical behaviour

 of these supporters.            I had to forcibly push away those I was

 speaking to and I recall shouting at one to take his ticket

 back to Liverpool and that the gates were shut and closed.

 It seemed that my final remarks registered with those that

 they were directly aimed at but no sooner had I got the

 message across I found myself repeating it to other

 similarly angry supporters.               Other officers were likewise

 trying to clear the area in front of the gates.

 At approximately 3.10 pm I went into the Lane leading to

 the South Stand where I had seen other officers running.                            I

 saw several other officers tending to injured persons                        just

 inside the lane, near to the corner of the south and west

 stands.      Some of the injured were laid on the ground.

 Some had white blankets of a type normally carried by

 ambulances over their bodies and covering their faces.

 It was apparent that there was an emergency and their had

 been a disaster though I was not aware at that time the

 extent nor the circumstances.                 I reasoned that there would

 be many officers inside the ground and I looked around and

 saw supporters leaving the ground.                     Many were injured or

 distressed and were staggering about in shock and disbelief.

 I realised that this area would be a major route for the

 emergency services and my efforts and those of the few

 remaining officers was assisting and comforting the injured

 and attempting to keep people moving who were leaving the

 ground.      I observed approximately 10 covered bodies and

 20 or more injured persons sat or laid on the tarmac

 amongst them.         Whilst working I and every officer was

 met with a wall of abuse from some of these supporters

 apportioning blame to the Police.                     Anger like I had never

 seen before was being directed at us.

        Many people were being aggressive to the extent that I

        anticipated a serious disorder problem if we did not receive

        assistance outside the ground and I hastily requested further

        Police assistance over my radio.                     I observed several

        individual officers attempting to keep the path clear for

        the emergency services and trying to restore o r d e r .

        Some of these supporters were uncontrollable,                      I understood

        that this anger was partly/wholly attributable to something

         they had seen in the ground and in some cases was a shocked

         reaction.       I found myself putting my arms round many of these

         people and walking with them to keep them m p v i n g , consoling

         them whilst I did so.           All the time other officers and I

         were being verbally abused in a most violent m a n n e r .                   I fully

         expected being assaulted at any moment.

         I observed that officers had formed themselves into a line

         near to and protecting the injured and dead and naturally

         creating an avenue in which supporters could leave without

         hinderance to the injured.

         I saw one officer who was in full uniform but without a

         helmet remonstrating with violent and angry supporters at

         the main gates.          In order to quieten the situation and at

         serious risk to myself I went into the middle of these

         supporters and took an unusual course of action and

         instructed the Police Officer to go away which he did.                         This

          seemed to appease them.

 It was now apparent that there had been a major disaster

 but still no one could have comprehended the extent of it.

 I easily recognised that this was no normal situation and

 that it could not be dealt with or catered for by normal

 Police practices.             The potential for public disorder

 outside the ground at this stage was enormous.                                         In my opinion,

 one wrong word by a Police Officer could have ignited a

 situation which would have become riotous.                                         I felt that

 the Police Officers could do no other than remain in their

 positions, taking the abuse and aggressiveness which was

 continually directed towards them.                                       I, as Senior Officer

 at the scene was primarily then engaged keeping control of

 the situation.          The line of officers were shielding and

 protecting the dead and injured and had the crowd been able

 to see clearly this scene I felt this alone could have

 caused serious problems of disorder and crowd control.

 I am unable to chronologically describe the sequence of

 events from this point as I was continually engaged on

 various duties, which included tending to the injured.                                           I

 removed my coat and put it round one injured person after

 another as each left the scene or was conveyed to Hospital by

 a fleet of ambulances which arrived.

 I instructed officers to place barriers and cover them with

 tarpaulin sheets and place them around the dead and

 injured.

 I directed a nurse in civilian clothes who offered her help

 to the injured people lying on the tarmac.                            I consoled a

 Policewoman who was unashamedly crying but nevertheless she

 remained in the line of Police Officers.                            Some officers

 were assisting the injured.

 S u p t . Marshall arrived anilat his request I sent several

 officers to clear the Lane for the ambulances so that they

 may continue to arrive at the Leppings Lane entrance and

 leave via Penistone Road NOrth.                    I later sent more officers

 to assist as more people began leaving the ground.

 A photographer arrived wearing a flourescent waistcoat.

 My attention was drawn to him when several violent and

 angry supporters tried to attack him.                            Whilst he did not

 say a word they accused him of taking photographs.                            So

 violent was their aggression,               in my opinion, he was in

 serious risk of losing his life had the supporters not been

 prevented by other officers from getting hold of him.                               I

 literally frog marched the photographer out of the way for

 his own protection.           He did not appear to appreciate the

 seriousness of the situation he found himself in and all

 the time other supporters were directing their aggression

 at him.      I found it necessary to march him hurriedly 30 or

 40 yards where I gave him to the custody of two other officers

 in Leppings Lane and instructed them to take him as far

 away as possible.

 Three ambulances arrived and in the absence of the driver

 I drove the foremost ambulance down the line of injured

 people to allow access for the other ambulances.

 Everyone at the scene had a task to perform.                         I recall a

 Doctor arriving and asking where he was required.

 S u p t . Marshall deputed an officer to take him to the

 Gymnasium.        A short while later another Doctor arrived

 and I similarly deputed another officer to take him to the

 Gymnasium.

 I assisted another officer to console a|                               man who

 I know tobe Brian ANDERSON (approx 30 years).                         He was sat

 on the tarmac at the side of his father who was apparently

 dead.      Brian Anderson did not want to be [

          separated from his father and I instructed a Police

 Officer to remain with him.

 As the time elapsed it became clear as to the severity of

 the disaster and a sombre mood befell the crowd.

 I continued with my duties and shortly after observed that

 some officers were in fact performing the task of

 identification of the deceased.

 I then left the scene with several other officers together

 with Chief Inspector Purdy and we returned to the Railway

 Station and assisted with enquiries and general duties in

 the area.

 At approximately 1800 hours I returned with 5 officers to

 Claywheels Lane.              More officers arrived a short while

 afterwards.            It was clear many were visibly shocked and

 upset/distressed and unfit to continue duty.

 I returned with these officers to Rotherham where we all

 retired from duty.

 To summarise,            it is my genuine belief that supporters

 entering the turnstiles between 1450 and 1500 hours were

 in imminent danger of being killed or seriously injured

 as a result of the huge volume of fanatical supporters

 arriving enmasse, all intent and anxious to the point of

 desperation to get into the ground at any cost before

 the kick off.             This was confirmed by the anxiety of many

 other supporters who were frantically pleading for the

 kick off to be delayed and for the Police to do something

 although the situation developed so quickly and with the

 behaviour of the crowd this was impossible.

 I am satisfied that the officers I could see behaved in a

 professional and exemplary manner and did all they could

 in the circumstances prevailing.

 The Mounted Police also acted in a professional manner and

 I was impressed by the way they organised themselves to

 form a barrier under great and difficult circumstances the

 like of which I have not seen since the miners strike.

 Whilst their actions may have relieved the pressure for a

 short while on the turnstiles, the behaviour and volume

of the crowd was such that they were unable to sustain i t .

 I was not surprised to find during the period consoling

the violent supporters leaving the ground after the incident

that many of them had been drinking and smelled strongly

of alcohol.            I consider that this played a large part in

the behaviour of those acting irresponsibly and violently.

Whilst I was in close proximity to many other none violent

persons          (including those injured)               none of these appeared

to have been drinking.

 I did not witness any violent disorder as such prior to

the match though this seems to have been diverted or

 released from the crowd through efforts to enter the ground.

My conclusions were that many supporters had in fact arrived

 in sufficient time but had left the area to consume alcohol.

Through having to walk some considerable distance w h e n 0

 returning, they had arrived late.                         This resulted in a

 situation whereby they were unable to enter all at once.

 The whole of Leppings Lane at the crucial 10 minute period

was one mass of moving people.                       In my opinion this

would have been the queue had they all stood still.

 It would have necessitated hundreds of Police in the

 circumstances to control them and the majority would have

• been/able to gain access without missing part of the match.

         Those supporters at the rear would have been unaware of

         the problem of entry as the turnstiles were so far away

         and out of view.               The situation developed so quickly that

         we were powerless to control the huge numbers and even

         with reinforcements it would have entailed crowd control

         similar to that witnessed in the Miners Strike to restore

         orderly queues.

               The      instraitysns                  which        i gave             over       the     public           address          system       were       fo r

               My      view        from        the    L a n d r o v e r roof          clarified               that        the          crowd was        divided

               into       3    sections.                Though          I         was unable             to        see    the     barrier separating

         the North and West            stands    there was a distinct             uniform        line   between

         the 2 sections         of    crowd.

         Several       days   later    I revisited the Leppings Lane                  t urnstiles and was

         puzzled when         I saw that       there was      no    longer a barrier            s e parating   the

         N o r t h s ta n a t u r n s t i 3.e s f r o rn the Wes t s t a n a t u r n s tiles.     My belief

         until    that moment         had been that        the     barrier    on the day of the match,

         is.    15 April,      1989    (150489)      nad been a substantial              and     permanent

I am a Police Insp in the South Yorkshire Police presently
stationed at Rotherham.


Further to my previous report regarding my duties at Hillsborough
Football ground I wish to add that whilst at the Leppings Lane
Turnstiles area I was aware that the turnstiles giving access to
the North Stand were seperated from turnstiles giving access to
the West Stand by a barrier.    Although I am unable to state the
type of barrier I distinctly recall that the area in effect was
divided into 3 sections.
1 section for access to the North Stand.
2 sections for access to the West Stand.
The barrier which I mentioned in my previous report and which had
supporters sitting on it was a permanent barrier approx 7 feet
high and which sub divided the turnstiles to the West Stand.
The instructions which I gave over the public address system
were for "North Stand Ticket Holders    to the Left" and "West
Stand and Leppings Lane Ticket Holders to the Centre and the
Right".
My view from the Landrover roof clarified that the crowd was
divided into 3 sections.    Though I was unable to see the barrier
seperating the North and West Stands there was a distinct uniform
line between the 2 sections of crowd.
Several days later I revisited the Leppings Lane turnstiles and
was puzzled when I saw that there was no longer a barrier
seperating the North Stand turnstiles from the West Stand turnstiles.
My belief until that moment had been that the barrier on the day
of the match i.e.    15th April 1989 had been a substantial and
permanent barrier.

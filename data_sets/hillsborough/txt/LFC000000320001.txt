Hillsborough was certainly a film that needed to be made for the sake o f the families.


Although the tragedy occurred seven^eaJ&^agOTthe^og^amme has brought home to the nation
the full reality of the human trag^dyof Hillsborough.


There are now many strong voices, including most importantly those o f the Hillsborough families,
who are calling for the matter to be re-opened, and we are pleased to hear that the Home
Secretary has already said that he will give full consideration to this.

              NOTTS          FOREST,             PLAYED        AT      HILLSBOROUGH                ON    9TH       APRIL        1988.




              On      the     date          shown          above,        I was         engaged               on    d u t i e s in c o n n e c t i o n w i t h

               the      FA    Cup          Semi       final,        Liverpool               v Notts          Forest.

              On      that        date.      I was          in a       serial          of    men,       mostly          comprising           the

              Rotherham                Area       Constables                led    by       PS    2171       Pat     Keenan.           Our     duties

               consisted               of    Policing             the       outside          area       of     the     Turnstiles            at     the

              entrance                to    the       ’L e p p i n g s      Lane'       stand.           The       area      concerned            was     a

               rough         triangle,                being       widest          at    the       road       and     narrowing           down       towards

              the       actual             turnstiles.                 We    understood                that       supporters           of    Liverpool           FC

              would          be       using       'our"        turnstiles.

              Prior          to       taking          up    our     duties         we       had    a         b r i e f i n g , g i v e n by C h i e f         Sup't

              Mole.

              We      took,       up       our    duties          at     the      turnstiles             around          ISnoon        and     at    that

              time       it       was       very       quiet.

              PS      Keenen           had       split       us     into       pairs,            each    pair        covering          one     turnstile

              entrance.

              As      time        progressed                towards          kick       off       (3 p m )     the     situation            got     far
                                                                                                                                                 PAGE         2

busier.            Liverpool                fans       arrived          by    the       coachful                and    upto       2.30pm          the

crowd        flow       was       heavy          but    without          trouble.                    The     atmosphere               was

generally              jovial          and        'tongue          in    cheeked'             and          I re-call that              we       had

built        up    a    fine           p i l e of      beer        and       lager          cans       (all      full) at          the          side     of

the     entrances,                taken          from     fans      entering                the       ground.

Between           30    mins          before        kick      off       upto       a    couple             of    minutes          after          the

kick        off,       the       situation             altered          dramatically.                        Hoards         of

Liverpuddlians                    arrived          amd       within          minutes             a    crush          situation             developed.

The     geographical                   lay       out    of    these          turnstiles                was       not       conducive             to

large        numbers             of    people          trying       to       get       through             them,       and       very       shortly,

all     of      the     officers             in     our      serial          had       been          pushed          back    firmly             onto

the     wall       where          the       actual        turnstiles               gaps          are.           We    were       fairly

helpless           to       re-act          to    any     situation               but       we       were       fortunate             in    that,

although           the       atmosphere                was    boisterous                and          reeking          of    alcohol,             the

general           mood       of t h o s e        people         remained               happy.

A    large        part       of        thatcrush             was    caused             by    people             trying      to     use          the

turnstiles              w h o ’s       number          was    shown          on    their             ticket,          when       in    fact       a ll

of     the      turnstiles              led       to    the     same         standing                area       within       the       ground.

The     stewards             on       the    turnstiles             were          told       to       l et      people       through             just

as     long       as    they          had    a    ticket        for      the       enclosure                 and      once       we    were       able

to     communicate                this       to    the       crowds,          they          quickly             and    safely          entered

the     ground.

At    no     time       did       we    operate           any      type       of       cordon          system          to    relieve             the

crush.            Such       a    system          would       have       been          totally             impracticable                   in    such     a

dense        crush,          one       just       gets       swept       along          with          the       crowd       until          one    hits

a    w a l 1.

At     no    time       were          any    of     the      main       gates          opened.               I do      not       know       whether

there        were       other          officers           inside         the       ground             directing             fans       to       various

enclosures,                 but       later       on    I saw       the       entire             crowd          in    the    Leppings             Lane

Stand        and       it    seemed          very       well       shared          out       albeit             full,       with       a    slight
                                                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                                                           R554

             excess       of    numbers          directly          behind          the    goal.

             During       the       match       itself,          our    serial         was    called       upon       ad-hoc       to    deal

             with    spontaneous                bits    of       trouble         but     nothing        related         to    mass      crowd

             trouble,          merely       minor       disputes.

             1 have       visited          82    football          league          grounds         in E n g l a n d .        I have      always

             considered             Hillsborough             one       of    the    safest        and    best.           I know         the

             ground       very       well       and    the       only       detremental           aspect        of    the     entrance

             facility          is    the    narrowing             triangular             forecourt         leading           to   the

             Leppings          Lane    Turnstiles.

             On   9 April           1988,       my    feelings          after       the      crush      I had        experienced           were

             of   relief        it    was       over.        It    was       hot,      breathless,           sweaty,          painful         and

             smelly,       ingredients                one    quite          readilly         accepts       on     semi       final      days,

             (viz    if    it       were    not       crowded          and       jostly      it   would      be      strange)        and      as

             such    I do       believe          that       no    one       from    my    serial        made      any

             representations                about       the       crush          situation.

             After    the       match       had       finished,             we   were     delegated          public          order      duties

             around       the       ground.           I did       not       witness       any     trouble.            I made       no

             arrests,          the    mood       of    the       crowd       remaining            carnival        like.




END   OF   REPORT
                             N l/Zf
      A REPORT FROM PC 1095 SLATER RE THE F.A. CUP SEMI
      FINAL: LIVERPOOL V NOTTS FOREST, PLAYED AT
      HILLSBOROUGH ON 9th April 1988 .




On the date shown above, I was engaged on duties in connection with the
FA Cup Semi final, Liverpool v Notts Forest#
On that date I was in a serial of men, mostly comprising the Rotherham
Area Constables led by PS 2171 Pat Keenan. Our duties consisted of
Policing the outside area of the Turnstiles at the entrance to the
'Leppings Lane' stand. The area concerned was a rough triangle, being
widest at the road and narrowing down towards the actual turnstiles.
We understood that supporters of Liverpool FC would be using 'our'
turnstiles.

Prior to taking up our duties we had a briefing, given by Chief Sup't
Mole.

We took up our duties at the turnstiles around 12noon and at that time
it was very quiet.

PS Keenan had split us into pairs, each pair covering one turnstile
entrance.

As time progressed toawrds kick off (3pm) the situation got far busier.
Liverpool fans arrived by the coachful and upto 2.30pm the crowd flow
was heavy but without trouble. The atmosphere was generally jovial and
•tongue in cheeked' and I re-call that we had built up a fine pile of
beer and lager cans (all full) at the side of the entrances, taken from
fans entering the ground.

Between 30 mins before kick off upto a couple of minutes after the kick
off, the situation altered dramatically. Hoards of Liverpuddlians arrived
and within minutes a crush situation developed. The geographical lay out
of thosex turnstiles was not conducive to large numbers of people trying
to get through them, and very shortly, all of the officers in our serial
had been pushed back firmly onto the wall where the actual turnstile gaps
are. We were fairly helpless to re-act to any situation but we were
fortunate in that, although the atmosphere was boisterous and reeking of
alcohol, the general mood of those people remained happy.

A large part of that crush was caused by people trying to use the turnstile
±ha& who's number was shown on their ticket, when in fact all of the
turnstiles led to the same standing area within the ground. The stewards
on the turnstiles were told to let people through just as long as they had
a ticket for the enclosure and once we were able to communicate this to
the crowds, they quickly and safely entered the ground.

At no time did we operate any type of cordon system to relieve the crush.
Such a system would have been totally impracticable in such a dense crush,
one just gets swept along with the crowd until one hits a wall.


                                                       Cont8 d..../
At no time were any of the main gates opened# I do not know whether there
were other officers inside the ground directing fans to various enclosures,
but later on I saw the entire crowd in the Leppings Lane Stand and it seemed
very well shared out albeit full, with a slight excess of numbers directly
behind the goal#

During the match itself, our serial was called upon ad-hoc to deal with
spontaneous bits of trouble but nothing related to mass crowd trouble,
merely minor disputes.

I have visited 82 football league grounds in England. I have always
considered Hillbborough one of the safest and best# I know the ground very
well and the only detremental aspect of the entrance facility is the narrowing
triangular forecourt leading to the leppings Lane Turnstiles.
On 9 April 1988, my feelings after the crush I had experienced were of
relief it was over. It was hot, breathless, sweaty, painful and smelly,
ingredients one quite readilly accepts on semi final day,(viz if it were
not crowded and jostly it would be strange) and as such I do believe that
no one from my serial made any representations about the crush situation.

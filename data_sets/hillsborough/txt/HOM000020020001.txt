Dear Bob,

                  3rd Visit, Ayresome Park, 14th October
                     Middlesborouqh v Plymouth Arqyle

     I met Mr. T. Hughes, Club Secretary, and Chief Superintendent
Tasker for a brief discussion before kick-off.   The Club,  Second
Division this season, enjoys a long tradition of loyal support in
the area.     Relationships between Club, police and emergency
services are clearly excellent.

     The Ground itself, however, has some way to go to achieve the
standards of best practice. The Club is aware of this, and is
seeking the means of improvement.    Counting at turnstiles,    for
example,  is carried out by hand; the running totals for given
banks of turnstiles are also accumulated by hand.  Perimeter fences
are conspicuously short of gates.  They also carry rather vicious-
looking spiked devices on their top-rails as deterrents          to
climbers.

     On the positive side, the proportion of seating accommodation
is favourable; arrangements for segregation of rival supporters
seems good;    enclosures for Club members are extensive,   and an
expensive fire warning system has been installed as protection for
the wooden stands.

     Capacities of the terraces were reduced by 15% following the
Interim Report, giving a ground capacity of 27,700 (Club membership
- free cards - is 24,521!).  Some disgruntlement had been caused by
the Club's beliefs that other Clubs'  capacities had been based on
initial densities substantially higher than Middlesborough's.
      The management of stewards and police-steward cooperation are
good.   The police box, although small, had the fire-officer and the
ambulance-officer in attendance during the visit. Its CCTV viewing
of the ground was good but its outside cover was limited - it is
intended to install additional cameras at entrances.           Fully
equipped ambulances were in attendance;        a general    hospital
occupies one side of the site, and there is a fire station within a
few hundred yards of the ground.

     Overall, I got the impression of a good managerial drive.   The
physical provisions for safety - notably emergency access to     the
pitch from the terraces and expeditious counting of entrants -   are
less good.

    A note on operational procedures is enclosed.

                         Yours sincerely,




                            L . Maunder

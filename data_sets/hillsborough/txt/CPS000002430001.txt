Thanks for your e-mail. I have copied it to Garry Patten, since he will be taking back responsibility for the Code
in due course - and probably for our policy on private prosecutions as well. Clearly, therefore, he will have an
interest in how we handle this.

Your approach seems sensible to me, but I have not been able to speak to Garry about it yet. We (Garry and I)
are due to meet on Tuesday morning anyway: we can discuss this then. In the meantime, could either you or
George have a word with Sue Ross, to ask whether she feels that your approach is attack-proof? I cannot see
why it should not be ... but who knows, these days?

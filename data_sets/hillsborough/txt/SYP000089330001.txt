               from Anfield.

               O n the mor nin g of the m a t c h             I went      to                              house together

               At S h e f f i e l d w e all went       to the Gate Pub lic Hse                        rear to the ground.

             pub.      We wa l k e d towards       th-e^ground after about             five minutes a r r i v e d at

             the L e p pi ng s Ln t u r n s t i l e s .    There w a s a mass        of    people all a r o u n d the

             tur ns ti le s     there were no queues.              We all     joined the       crowd and started

             to make      our way towards the turnstiles.                   There was more and more            people
                                         y''
             ar ri v i n g and the c rotid got bigger.

             It was a small »face for all                  the suppor ter s        to get    in and   I was    being

             pushed a r ouiyf and         crushed.        At this     point    I had      lost all my mates and

             was     os\ my*'own.    As    I got    closer and        closer      to the turnstile       it got

             more and more of a crush and                   I do not    remember any mor^ until            I woke

             up lying on the ground.               Inside the tu rns til es          near>to     the tunnel     that

             leads     to the Lep pi ng s Ln terrace.               I have     n e ve ry pa ss ed out before,       and
 a i y t t
             whe n    I came ar o u n d    I saw a

                       an d he told me       that/he        had carried             nside    the ground.       I was

                      stayed with me/Eluring this              time.

             As    I was sat on t*fe ground               I was facing      the    inside of the Le pp in gs Ln

             t urn sti le s and / a w a gate         near the turnst ile            had been o p e n e d , I do not

             know who operyid it,           but    people were        rushing      in an d   running towards        the

             tunnel     I wai/ sat by.         On seeing       this    I got up and went up the stairs

             to the star/d above the terrace,                  there was       no stewards       to check who was

             go ing    into the stand.            On reaching       the st and      it was    very crowded

             people were sat         in the ai sles          but   I made rny' M a y down to the front and
                                                                           X
             sh ar ed a seat wi t h two other men.                  At th*£s time the players were on

             the     pitch but they had not kicked o f fT.                  I looked down into the terrace

             ar ea    beh ind the L e p pi ng s Ln goal / m d          they were       packed in like sardines

             but the areas at either               side na^ar the       corner      flats were     not

             very     crowded there was           room Jror more       people      to go     into these areas.

The    next    thing    I saw was        people    climbing     over    the top of    peoples    heads

in the terrace below                                                                  the   pitch.

W h e n more and more          pe                                      the game was    stop ped and



the stand




On    looking    down into the terrace               ben ea th the stand I was        in I saw

bodies aga in st        the    perimeter      fence    liear to the gate.         I saw the bodies

were    blue and some had blood               coming from their mouths.

Bef or e   this wh e n I was          pulling     people up into the stand I looked down

and saw the       crowd su rging          for war d and falling         down I saw Pol ice and

fans    trying    to rip the fencing              down.

I remember       in pa rticular         one face a man or yo ut h who was             lying    there

wit h blood coming            from his m out h an d eyes,            he had dark hair,      I do not

remember a n y th in g        else about      him.

O n looking      down I saw                 and the o t h e r y /in a pen out towards           the

corner flag on my right.                  This    is the J w r s t    I had seen of them since

getting       split    up outside       the ground

Be fo re   the   crush sta rt ed         in the j/Irrace       I had seen                         in

the terrace       but then I did n o y s e e           him again,       until   I saw him being

st r e t c h e r e d off across       the p i tch.     After   this     I went down    into the

pitch and tried to\ fi nd £»im,               I was    told by the amb ul an ce me n that         the

people were being             tafcrgn to various       hospitals,

                  and my s e l f      then wa nd e r e d a r o u n d the ground and     into

players       tunel and       into the     players     lounge.        We were   took to the     press

box    by some men a n d we tried to ring home,                      an d then we had some food.

L at er we went to the              car a n d then to H a m m e r t o n Rd Pol Stn wi t h the

people     I had t r a ve ll ed to the game with.                Later    back at    the Pol St n      I

              saw                        name on the Royal Ha l l a m s h i r e Hospital      list.

              On seeing      this myself,                  and                 went   to the hospital

             where we saw                            for about    half an hour.       After   this we

             made     our way home,   a r r i v i n g at about   1.30 am   <0130).

              I did not      receive a n y serious    injuries but did suffer shock           for a

             while after.

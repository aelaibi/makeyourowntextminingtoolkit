Dear Nick,

Hillsborough Tragedy

The Executive of the Joint Branch Board met a couple of days ago and, as
usual, Hillsborough was discussed.

During the discussions the legal representation supplied by yourself and
                     was referred to by several members.  It was the unanimous
decision or us all that I, on behalf of the Board and all those who we
represent, should write to you and express our most sincere thanks for
everything that you did for our people.        We really do appreciate your
hard work, skill and dedication in looking after the interests of our
m e m b e r s . There is no doubt in any of our minds that had it not been
for the quality of legal representation supplied by yourselves to our
officers the outcome could well have been very different.

I would be most grateful if you would pass our remarks on to

Once again, mjirty thanks to you all for a job well done.

Yours sincerely,




Pa,          ri, Secretary

Dear

Now  that the P.C.A. have reported their findings into the Hillsborough
stadium disaster and the events of that day, for my part, appear to have
been concluded, may I take this opportunity to say thank you for your
professionalism and assistance during the lengthy inquest.

I trust you are working hard at the Law College and I wish you well in your
future studies and employment.

Thank you,

Dear

1 suspect by now, that Nick Holroyd has been in touch to pass on the
official thanks of the Joint Branch Board of the Police Federation of South
Yorkshire, for your work in connection with the Hillsborough inquest.

fey I, on a more personal note, take this opportunity to thank you for the
help, guidance and friendship you gave to my members and myself throughout
the lengthy inquest.  Your stand up battle with the Coroner on the issue of
protection for                   will be something I will remember for many
years to c o m e .

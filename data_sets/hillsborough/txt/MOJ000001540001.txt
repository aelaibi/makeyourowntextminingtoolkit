Facts1

17 Feb 1998              Home Office Circular 4/1998 came into effect (60-63).

27 Feb 1998              The First Respondent decided in principle to authorise its
                         clerk/treasurer to consider funding applications from the officers
                         (now reversed and replaced by the decision made on 5 February
                         1999) (80 and 129-130).

5 Mar 1998               A funding application by Mr Duckenfield was approved by the First
                         Respondent (81).

29 Jun 1998              A funding application by Mr Murray was approved by the First
                         Respondent (81).

10/13 Jul 1998           Informations were laid in the Leeds Magistrates’ Court for the
                         private prosecution of the officers (32-33).

20 Nov 1998              Mr Murray applied to the First Respondent for further financial
                         assistance to apply for judicial review of the DPP’s decision (134-
                         135).

18 Dec 1998              The DPP decided not to intervene and stop the private prosecutions
                         (137-138).

23 Dec 1998              A funding application by Mr Duckenfield in relation to judicial
                         review proceedings was made to the First Respondent (146-147).

22 Dec 1998/
5 Jan 1999               The Second Respondent wrote to the First Respondent complaining
                         that funding had wrongly and unlawfully been approved for the
                         officers (139-145 and 148-154).

             A more detailed narrative appears in the affidavit of William James Wilkinson
             for the First Respondent (74-86).
10 Feb 1999              Notice of application for judicial review was lodged (2-17).

12 Feb 1999              Mr Justice Latham granted leave to move, abridged time, joined Ann
                         Adlington as the Second Respondent and ordered expedition (73).

17 Feb 1999              Notice of motion.

1 Mar 1999               Home Office letter to the Chief Constable (592).

15 Mar 1999              Mr Justice Latham stood over (to be heard with the present case):
                         (1)     applications by the officers for leave to move for judicial
                                 review of the same decision that is challenged in the present
                                 case2; and
                         (2)     applications by the officers for leave to move for judicial
                                 review of the DPP’s decision not to take over and
                                 discontinue the private prosecutions.

19 Apr 1999              Private prosecution committal proceedings are due to start in the
                         Leeds Magistrates’ Court (on 1 March 1999 the Magistrates’ Court
                         refused to vacate the date (484)).


Submissions
The issues
1.           Two issues, both turning on the proper construction of the Police Act 1996 ("the
             1996 Act"), are raised by these proceedings:
             (1)         whether a police authority has power to provide financial assistance
                         to (serving or former) police officers to cover the costs of defending
                         private criminal prosecutions brought against them personally; and
             (2)         whether a police authority has power to provide financial assistance
                         to (serving or former) police officers to cover the costs of judicial
                         review proceedings launched by them personally.


2.           On 5 February 1999, the First Respondent (SYPA) decided that it had neither




             The grounds relied upon by the officers are almost identical to those relied upon
             by the Chief Constable.

                                               3
     power3.      It so decided without regard to the (de)merits of the funding
     applications made by the officers. In its view, there was simply no power to
     fund the officers in relation to such proceedings, regardless of how (undeserving
     the funding applications were on their facts. This is the decision which is under
     challenge.


3.   Accordingly, SYPA submits that the Court should not be concerned with the
     content or history of the officers’ funding applications. Rather, it should look
     at the legal issues as matters of principle.       They are narrow questions of
     construction. This was the approach deliberately taken by SYPA when it made
     the challenged decision.     SYPA recognises that if the Court finds that the
     disputed powers exist, consideration will then need to be given to whether to
     fund these officers in relation to their litigation. But that position has not yet
     been reached.


4.   Ann Adlington objects to the Court adopting such a course (164-184).            She
     complains that SYPA ought not to have divorced the question of principle from
     the content or history of the officers’ funding applications. But:
     (1)          SYPA considered, on advice, that it had no power to grant the
                  applications at all. Unless and until that view is overturned, it would
                  be wrong and potentially wasteful for SYPA to go on to consider the
                  (de)merits of the applications.
     (2)          Even if, contrary to (1), SYPA was wrong to separate questions of
                  principle from questions of fact, that is what it has done4. The
                  Court has to consider the decision-making process which SYPA
                  actually carried out, not that which Ann Adlington wishes had been



     This decision replaced and reversed a decision (to grant funding in principle)
     made on 27 February 1998. Accordingly, SYPA submits that the Court should
     not concern itself with the criticisms of that earlier decision made in the first
     affidavit of Ann Adlington (164). Given the complex legal issues involved, that
     decision was understandable but the present reality is that it has been superseded.

     It so decided on 1 February 1999 (84).

                                        4
                       carried out. The Court is unable to impugn SYPA’s decision by
                      reference to particular features of the content or history of the
                      officers’ funding applications because it does not know whether
                      SYPA would have considered those features to be factors relevant to
                      a decision on the applications’ merits. There has been no merits
                      decision.


Standing
5.         Paragraphs 83 and 84 of the affidavit of Ann Adlington (180) dispute the
           standing of the Chief Constable to bring these proceedings. SYPA makes no
           such objection.
           (1)        The Chief Constable has a close and legitimate interest in the extent
                      of SYPA’s powers to fund the police force under section 6(1) of the
                      1996 Act. He is the head of that force.
           (2)        An individual serving officer in the South Yorkshire force would
                      have a sufficient interest in bringing these proceedings. Even if no
                      legal proceedings had yet been brought against him, he would want
                      to know whether he could rely on the SYPA to fund him. As the
                      representative of all officers in South Yorkshire, the Chief Constable
                      has at least as much of an interest.
           (3)        The Chief Constable stresses that if SYPA’s decision is upheld by the
                      Court, this will have an effect on the morale of the police force in
                      South Yorkshire (and nationally). This is a matter of concern to the
                      Chief Constable.
           (4)        The Chief Constable made written and oral representations to SYPA
                      before it made its decision (84). This evidences his interest. Ann
                      Adlington (who also made representations (510)) did not object.
           (5)        In any event, the present case raises an important point of principle
                      for the funding of police forces. There is a public interest in it being
                      ventilated.   The Court should not be too prescriptive in applying
                      rules of standing, especially since the current trend is towards a
                      generous interpretation of those rules.


                                            5
           (6)         There are, before the Court, applications by the officers for leave to
                       move for judicial review of the same decision that is challenged in
                       the present case. Their standing cannot be questioned. If there be
                       any doubt about the standing of the Chief Constable, the Court is
                       invited to grant leave to the officers (so that they appear as applicants
                       not directly affected persons) and then to conduct the substantive
                       hearing on that basis.


The statutory scheme
6.         The Chief Constable’s challenge rests predominantly on section 6(1) of the 1996
          Act (56). In essence, it is said that section 6(1) empowers police authorities to
          do anything which maintains an efficient and effective police force (subject only
          to Wednesbury) and extended even further by section 111(1) of the Local
          Government Act 1972 ("the 1972 Act"). In SYPA’s submission, this is asking
          much too much of section 6(1).
          The role of section 6(1)
          (1)          Section 6(1) requires every police authority to "secure the
                       maintenance of an efficient and effective police force for its area"
                       (56). These words do not confer any powers, as such, (broad or
                       otherwise) on a police authority.      Instead, as its heading states,
                       section 6(1) sets out the "[g]eneral functions of police authorities":
                       that is, their broad overall duty. Police authorities must fulfil this
                       duty whenever exercising their powers.          But those powers are
                       conferred elsewhere in the 1996 Act and the 1972 Act5. Section 6(1)
                       performs a different role. It sets out the (proper) purposes which a
                       police authority must promote when exercising its powers6. Sections


     5    Section 6(1) can, of course, inform the construction of specific powers. One can
          test the legality of acts or omissions of police authorities by reference to section
          6(1). The 1972 Act is applied to police authorities by section 146A of the 1972
          Act.

     6    At common law, public authorities must always exercise their powers for proper
          purposes. Section 6(1) is a statutory statement of what those proper purposes are
          for police authorities.

                                                6
            6(2)-(4) support this approach. They, too, do not set out powers but
            describe other matters to which police authorities must have regard
            when discharging their functions. The approach is also supported by
            the slightly different wording of the statutory predecessor of section
            6(1): that is, section 4(1) of the Police Act 1964 ("the 1964 Act")
            (51). It provided:

                    "It shall be the duty of the police authority for every police
                    area ... to secure the maintenance of an adequate and
                    sufficient police force for the area, and to exercise fo r that
                    purpose the powers conferred on a police authority by this
                    Act."
                                                                 (emphasis added)


            In short, therefore, section 6(1) does not confer powers. It imposes
            a duty: a duty to strive towards broad objectives. The means by
            which these objectives are to be achieved are the specific duties and
           powers contained in other sections of the 1996 Act and the 1972 Act.
           This is underscored by the detailed division of powers within the
            1996 Act. Powers to control and regulate the police are conferred on
           three distinct persons/bodies: the Chief Constable7, the Secretary of
           State8 and the police authority. If section 6(1) is read as conferring
           broad powers on the police authority, it would disrupt the balance of
           powers exercised by these three persons/bodies. The police authority
           would be able to do/fund any activity, even if that particular activity
           were specifically the preserve of the other two persons/bodies9.



See section 10.

See sections 36-53 (examined in paragraphs 6(8)-(10) below).

The deliberations of SYPA on 5 February 1999 focused on the interaction
between section 6(1) and section 88 and between section 6(1) and section 111(1)
of the 1972 Act. The role of section 6(1), in isolation, was not specifically
considered. However, the issue in this case is one of legality. The Court is
examining whether there is power to fund the officers on a proper, objective
construction of the 1996 Act. The reasons for the Court’s decision need not be
the same as those for SYPA’s decision.

                                 7
The ambit of section 6(1) read with section 88
(2)        Read alone, section 6(1) contains extremely wide words.             They
           cannot, however, be read alone.         Like any statutory provision,
           section 6 must be read in context. In particular, it must be read with
           section 88(4) of the 1996 Act (59). Section 88(4) explicitly gives a
           police authority power to pay out of the police fund any damages,
           settlement monies and costs (incurred by or awarded against) an
           officer in tort proceedings brought against him. The 1996 Act is
           silent as to indemnities in any other type of proceedings. It is a
           fundamental canon of statutory construction that where Parliament
           specifies one particular matter, it impliedly excludes other allied
           matters: see Bennion, Statutory Interpretation, sections 390-395, and
           Halsbury’s Laws10, volume 44(1), paragraph 1494.
(3)        The Chief Constable contends that section 88 (and its predecessor,
           section 48 of the 1964 Act) was included to make Chief Constables
           vicariously liable in tort for the acts/omissions of their officers in the
           same way that employers would be liable for the acts/omissions of
           their employees. Police officers are office holders not employees.
           But, while this explains sections 88(l)-(3), it does not explain section
           88(4) which is not limited to cases of vicarious liability. The Chief
           Constable also relies on the past practice (before and after 1964) of
           paying officers’ costs generally. But the issue of the legality of such
           payments has never before been examined.
(4)        If section 6(1) were as wide as the Chief Constable contends, section
           88(4) would be unnecessary. Unless compelled to do so by clear and
           unambiguous language, the Court should not construe a statute so as
           to render part of it otiose.
(5)        If there be any ambiguity about the meaning of these provisions, the
           Court is referred to Hansard: see Pepper v Hart [1993] AC 593 at
           page 634C-E (per Lord Browne-Wilkinson). On 6 February 1964



Also written by Francis Bennion.
            there was a debate in the House of Commons Standing Committee D
            on the clause that later became section 48 of the 1964 Act, now
            section 88 of the 1996 Act, (92, column 620). Mr Brooke, the then
            Home Secretary and promoter of the Bill, emphasised that the clause
            did not cover criminal proceedings. He did not go on to say that the
            clause that later became section 4(1) of the 1964 Act would cover
            criminal proceedings.
(6)        In any event, even if the Chief Constable is correct to say that
            section 6(1) is wide enough to cover indemnities in tort proceedings
            and that section 88(4) was included only for the avoidance of doubt,
            it is quite another thing to say that section 6(1) is wide enough to
            cover indemnities in private criminal prosecutions.
(7)        Moreover, it is not clear that section 88(4) applies to former officers:
            see section 88(5). It would be very surprising if section 88(4) gives
            an explicit power to indemnify serving officers in tort proceedings yet
            section 6(1) gives an implicit duty11 to indemnify serving and former
            officers in criminal proceedings.
The 1996 Act absent section 88(4V2
(8)        Even if section 6(1) is a power-conferring provision13 and even if
           section 88(4) were to be absent from the 1996 Act, SYPA does not
           accept that section 6(1) would authorise the funding in question.
           Section 6(1) must be read with other sections of the 1996 Act,
           including section 50.      Section 50(1) and (2)(j) give the Home
           Secretary, not police authorities, the power to make regulations



Section 6(1) is phrased as a duty ("shall secure") but SYPA does not contend, if
the Chief Constable is right, that it would be required to accede to every
application for funding. In each case SYPA would have to consider whether
such funding would "secure the maintenance of an efficient and effective police
force for its area".

Again, this was not the focus of SYPA’s deliberations on 5 February 1999.
However, the issue is one of legality: see footnote 9 above.

See paragraph 6(1) above.

                                  9
            setting the pay, allowances and other conditions of service of serving
            officers14. An indemnity against the costs of litigation arising out
            of the performance of his duties by an employee of office-holder is
            an allowance15 or a condition of service. It is a common provision
            in a contract of service.
(9)         Suppose that the Home Secretary were to direct, by regulation, that
            police officers nationally should benefit from such an indemnity
            (payable ex post facto or only on acquittal) in respect of certain
            classes of litigation but not other classes16. It is submitted that it
            would not be open to police authorities to invoke section 6(1) to pay
            their own local indemnities inconsistent with the national arrangement
            (for example, payable "up front" or payable on conviction or
            acquittal). Regulations made under section 50 exhaustively set out
            the monies which can be paid to police officers. Neither section 6(1)
            of the 1996 Act nor section 111(1) of the 1972 Act17 can be used to
            supplement those monies.



The relevant regulations are the Police Regulations 1995 (SI 1995 No.215), as
amended. In relation to retired officers, see section 24 of the Superannuation Act
1972, section 1 of the Police Pensions Act 1976 and the Police Pensions
Regulations 1987 (SI 1987 No.257), as amended.

The meaning of "allowance" is amply wide enough to cover the funding sought
in the present case: see Mutual Acceptance Company limited v Federal
Commissioner of Taxation (1944) 69 CLR 389 at page 396 (per Latham CJ).

Indeed, SYPA submits that the Home Secretary could make a regulation under
section 50(2)(j) permitting or requiring an indemnity to be given to serving or
former police officers of precisely the type sought by the officers in the present
case. He has not done so. It would be surprising if SYPA has a local power to
do what the Home Secretary has refrained from doing.

See Allsop v North Tyneside Metropolitan Borough Council [1992] RVR 104
(CA) (no enhanced redundancy terms can be paid by a local authority because the
Superannuation Act 1972 contains a comprehensive code).               The Police
Regulations 1995 contain a very detailed code for all financial benefits payable
to police officers. See especially regulation 50 which prohibits allowances being
paid outside the Regulations except with the Home Secretary’s consent. See also
regulation K5(4) of the Police Pensions Regulations 1987.
     (10)        Similarly, SYPA relies on the following other provisions of the 1996
                 Act: section 49(5) (power of the Home Secretary to direct that the
                 costs incurred by any person for the purposes of a local inquiry be
                 paid out of the police fund), section 51 (which echoes section 50 but
                 in relation to special constables) and section 52 (which echoes section
                 50 but in relation to police cadets).
     Ex parte Wilson and Dalton
     (11)        The Chief Constable relies on the decision of the Divisional Court
                 (Lord Justice Ralph Gibson and Mr Justice Nolan) in R v Derbyshire
                 Police Authority, ex parte Wilson and Dalton (20 July 1989) (70-
                 72)18. But the funding power was there accepted by the parties and
                 assumed by the Court, not decided after argument. Moreover, the
                 Court relied on, without questioning, the Home Office Circular that
                 was then current (HOC 77/1987). As explained below19, no such
                 reliance can be placed on the latest Home Office Circular.


7.   The Chief Constable also relies on section 111(1) of the Local Government Act
     1972 ("the 1972 Act") (55). In SYPA’s submission, section 111(1) adds nothing
     to the debate.
     (1)         The Chief Constable contends that section 6(1) uses extremely wide
                 language.   It is difficult to understand how it could be usefully
                 widened by recourse to section 111(1) of the 1972 Act. If section
                 6(1) is not already wide enough, section 111(1) will not help. It is
                 a red herring. The Chief Constable’s difficulty is not the narrowness
                 of the words of section 6(1) but the relationship between section 6(1)
                 and section 88. Where Parliament has specifically enacted provisions
                 dealing with indemnities for officers, the general words cannot help.

                                      11
(2)         Section 111(1) begins:

                        " ... subject to the provisions of this Act and any other
                        enactment passed before or after this Act ... "20.


            Thus:
            (a)         if SYPA is correct about the proper construction of the 1996
                        Act, section 111(1) is overridden; but
            (b)         if SYPA is wrong about the proper construction of the 1996
                        Act, the Chief Constable prevails without relying on section
                        111(1) at all.
(3)        Where (as here) the primary statutory scheme is comprehensive,
            section 111(1) cannot extend it21. Thus, in Sutton London Borough
            Council v Morgan Grenfell & Company Limited22 the Court of
            Appeal held that section 111(1) did not confer on a local authority the
            power to give an additional indemnity to a local housing authority
            where the housing legislation dealt         specifically with the same
            subject.


The same reasoning applies to financial assistance for the officers’ judicial review
proceedings.
(1)        Section 88 is limited to tort. The arguments set out in paragraphs 6
            and 7 above apply mutatis mutandis to any non-tort proceedings.
(2)        The judicial review challenges are to be brought by, not against, the
            officers.
(3)        The judicial review challenges are closely linked to the defence of the
            private prosecutions. It would be surprising if SYPA could not fund
            the officers in respect of the main proceedings but could do so in

The Home Office Circulars
9.        The Chief Constable maintains that his position is supported by two Home Office
          Circulars each entitled "Financial Assistance to Police Officers in Legal
          Proceedings" (60-69). SYPA accepts that the Court should have regard to the
          Circulars. Departmental Circulars provide guidance on law and practice but, as
          they always stress, only the Court can decide what the law is. In any event, in
          the present case, SYPA submits that Home Office guidance supports its position.
          (1)        Circular 77/1987, dated 4 December 1987, clearly contemplates that
                     police authorities have power under section 4(1) of the 1964 Act to
                     pay the costs of officers involved in all kinds of legal proceedings,
                     including private and public criminal proceedings (64-65).
          (2)        But Circular 77/1987 was cancelled and replaced by Circular 4/1998
                     with effect from 17 February 1998 (60-63). This is the Circular
                     applicable to the challenged decision. It is very different from its
                     predecessor.
                     (a)     Paragraph 5 stresses that section 88(4) and (5) of the1996
                              Act apply to civil proceedings only.
                     (b)     Paragraph 5 says that police authorities         "may wish      to
                              consult their legal advisers" as to whether there is power to
                              provide    financial assistance in relation to criminal
                              proceedings.        Section 111(1) of the 1972 Act is then
                              mentioned and it is speculated that this could support the
                              very argument advanced by the Chief Constable in the
                              present case (if the officer is acquitted). Section 6(1) is not
                              specifically mentioned at all.
                     (c)     Paragraph 6 concludes that:

                                        "[i]t is for individual police authorities to decide in
                                        the particular circumstances of a case, and on the
                                        basis of legal advice, whether to make financial
                                        assistance available to officers in criminal
                                        proceedings."


                                             13
                                There is no mention of private prosecutions.
           (3)         Circular 4/1998 is markedly more hesitant than its predecessor.
                       Instead of reassuring police authorities that the funding power exists,
                       it merely mentions an argument that could be advanced and then
                       urges police authorities to take their own advice.          Insofar as
                       paragraph 6 assumes that the power exists for the right case, SYPA
                       submits that it is wrong.
           (4)         In correspondence arising out of these proceedings, the Home Office
                       has retreated even further from Circular 77/1987. By letter dated 4
                       February 1999 (159) it stated:

                                "Home Office Circular 4/1998 states clearly that section
                               88(4) and (5) of the Police Act 1996 apply to civil
                               proceedings only. The circular goes on to say that [s]ection
                               88(4) does not apply to criminal proceedings. There is no
                               provision in the Police Act 1996 enabling police authorities
                               to provide financial assistance to officers involved in
                               criminal proceedings. The circular does not purport to
                               suggest otherwise. Nor does the Circular proffer advice to
                               police authorities on whether section 111 of the Local
                               Government Act 1972 provides authority for the payment of
                               such financial assistance."
                                                                      (emphasis added)
           (5)         Parliamentary answers by the Minister, Mr Boateng MP, on 2
                       February 1999 (157) and 15 February 1999 (589) are to like effect;
                       as is the letter dated 1 March 1999 from the Home Secretary (592).
           (6)         The Home Office has been invited by SYPA to participate in these
                       proceedings but has declined (159).


Other considerations
10.        The construction of the statutory scheme advocated by SYPA does not produce
           unpalatable practical consequences.
           (1)         On the contrary, the law recognises a public policy that those who
                       are identified by the criminal law as the appropriate defendants23



           The prosecution here is for "individual" not "corporate" offences.

                                            14
            should not be permitted to transfer the consequences of their offences
            (whether a fine or the costs of the proceedings themselves) to
            another: see Askev v Golden Wine Co. Ltd. [1947] 2 All ER 35 at
            page 38C-H (Denning J). In SYPA’s submission, this explains why
            the 1996 Act provides for indemnities to be paid to officers for
            proceedings in tort but not crime.
(2)         Legal aid will (subject to means) be available to officers in the same
            way that it is available to others faced with a criminal prosecution or
            to others launching judicial review proceedings24. Mr Murray has
            apparently applied for criminal legal aid (484).
(3)         A defendant who is acquitted will normally obtain an order that his
            reasonable non-legally aided costs should be paid in full out of
            central funds, unless he was at fault in bringing suspicion on himself
            or was acquitted on a technicality: see Practice Direction (Crime:
            Costs) [1991] 1 WLR 498. The position is similar when a defendant
            is legally-aided. The Court can remit a contribution order or order
            that a contribution should be repaid where there has been an
            acquittal25. Clearly, where a defendant (whether legally-aided or
            not) is convicted, very different public policy considerations apply.
            The Chief Constable argues that the officers should have all their
            costs paid "up front" and in any event (whether they are later
            convicted or acquitted). SYPA submits that, whatever the proper
            construction of section 6(1), this goes too far. It does not accord


For the avoidance of doubt, SYPA does not accept that the availability of funding
for the officers from other sources (for example, the Legal Aid Board, the
prosecutor or central funds) would be irrelevant to the decision on the merits of
the officer’s applications for funding. The Chief Constable seeks a declaration
to this effect (4, paragraph (4)). The position of SYPA is set out in paragraph
39 of the affidavit of William James Wilkinson (85-86). Given that SYPA has
limited resources for the police fund, the availability of funding from alternative
sources must, it is submitted, be relevant in deciding what is needed for the
maintenance of "an efficient and effective police force" under section 6(1).

Regulations 1989 (SI 1989 No.344).

                                  15
                          with the public policy reflected in the Practice Direction, the Legal
                          Aid Act 1988 or Askev.
            (4)          Moreover, where there has been an acquittal and the criminal court
                          concludes that a private prosecutor was at fault in bringing the
                         proceedings, it may order that prosecutor to pay the defendant’s costs
                          (65).
            (5)          The Chief Constable contends that there are good reasons of public
                         policy why funding beyond that contemplated by section 88(4) of the
                          1996 Act should be given to officers.     It is said that, otherwise,
                         police morale would be seriously undermined. But, equally, there
                         are countervailing public policy considerations. It might be said that
                         a police authority’s funds should not be paid to an officer who is said
                         to be criminally liable in his personal capacity. An officer who is
                         later acquitted should receive an award of costs as set out above26.
                         An officer who is later convicted should not be funded by the police
                         authority.
           (6)           A Magistrates’ Court has an inherent power to refuse to issue a
                         summons or to strike out a prosecution if it is frivolous, vexatious or
                         abusive.
           (7)           This case concerns the comparatively rare situation where a police
                         officer sues or is sued/charged in his personal capacity. It does not
                         concern a representative appearance by a police officer in a court,
                         tribunal or inquiry. Such an appearance will be made in police time,
                         with police funding and with the help of police lawyers.


Legitimate expectation
11.        The Chief Constable seeks a declaration (4, paragraph (6)) that the officers have
           a (substantive) legitimate expectation that their costs and expenses of defending
           the private prosecution will be met by SYPA as and when they are incurred27


           Paragraph 10(3) above.

           The basis for the claim is elaborated only in paragraph 34 of the grounds (16).

                                              16
            (in other words, that the SYPA decision of 27 February 1998 is not null and
           void28 but should still stand). This is misconceived.
            (1)        The highest (legitimate) expectation that the officer could have is that
                       the earlier decision by SYPA should not be changed without giving
                       them the opportunity to comment.
           (2)        That expectation was met, not defeated. The representatives of the
                       officers addressed SYPA on 5 February 1999 orally and in writing
                       about whether the earlier decision should be altered (84).
           (3)        If SYPA is correct that it has no power to fund these officers, it
                       cannot acquire power through the creation of a legitimate expectation.
                       SYPA’s powers derive from statute, not from a promise29.
           (4)        Neither the fact that SYPA has already paid some money to the
                       officers nor the incurring of further legal expenses by them in
                       reliance on the previous promise to pay means that SYPA is obliged,
                       or indeed able, to continue to pay their expenses30.


Miscellaneous
12.        When granting written leave to move on 12 February 1999 (73) Mr Justice
           Latham ordered not only that Ann Adlington should be served with the papers
           but also that she should be joined as the Second Respondent. SYPA submits,
           with respect, that the second of these orders went too far. It is accepted, of
           course, that the HFSG is directly affected by these proceedings31 and is entitled
           to participate as an interested party. However, HFSG (still less AnnAdlington
           herself) is not a public body susceptible to judicialreview.Moreover,        HFSG
           (still less Ann Adlington herself) has not made any decision which is impugned
           by the Chief Constable.


      28   As SYPA decided, on 5 February 1999, that it should be.

      29   R v MAFF. ex parte Hamble Fisheries (Offshore) Limited [1995] 2 All ER 714
           (QBD).

      30   Cr6dit Suisse v Allerdale BC [1997] QB 306 (CA).

      31   RSC Order 53 rule 5(3).
13.          Accordingly, SYPA invites the Court to make it clear that Ann Adlington
             participates in these proceedings as an interested party rather than a Respondent.


Conclusion
14.          For these reasons, the Court is invited to dismiss this application for judicial
             review.

1.    Hammond Suddards should be told that a gremlin has crept into the bundle at
      pages 60-69 (the Home Office Circulars). The Circulars are in the wrong order
      (according to the leave index) and a page is blank. But all the pages are there
      so it is probably not worth changing anything.


2.   Quite a few of the pages of the Royal Commission Report and the statutes (37-
      59) are feint or chopped off at the margins. Better copies need to be circulated.


3.   Section 6 of the bundle (party-party correspondence will need to be updated by
      Hammond Suddards just before the hearing).


4.   Hammond Suddards should be invited to compile a composite bundle of
     authorities and materials for the Court and the parties (but not duplicating those
     that already appear in the bundle). The authorities and materials that SYPA wish
     to rely upon appear in its skeleton argument.


5.   I have not included anything objecting to the use of the Royal Commission as an
     aid to construction: see Pepper v Hart [1993] AC 593. Do we want to take this
     point? It is rather technical, since we are saying that we just want the Court to
     tell us all where we stand?     The answer may be to let the Court raise the
     objection if it wants to. In any event, the Applicants may say that they are
     relying on the Royal Commission not as an aid to construction, as such, but as
     a factual indication of previous practice.

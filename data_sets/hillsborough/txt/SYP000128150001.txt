             I am a married man and I 1 :i.v e at the above address with my wife

             I am currently employed a<               Security Officer and also work as a

             Steward at the Hillsborough Football                ground an the weekday night

             games and the Saturday games when work allows.

             I have been a Steward with Sheffield Wednesday for some nine years now.

             Originally       I was    posted in the West Stand,           at the bottom of the

             stairs,    which lead to the seated part of the West Stand.

             For the last four years            I have been posted to gate        *C* which is

             situated on Leppings Lane,           at the entrance to West Strand enclosure.

             My duties       involve manning the gate and allowing entrance and exit-

             through the gate on the orders of the Police and persons                   in authority

             at the ground.

             The Club policy however is that the gate should remain shut at all
                                                                             PAGE


times unless   circumstances dictate     it as necessary to be opened,

I began as a Steward by asking the Chief Steward,            Stewart THORPE for

a past and I was made a temporary Steward filling            in here and there,

Eventually I moved on to the posts previously mentioned.

Before every season starts a meeting          is called and a Policeman and a

Fireman come along to the ground and explain things about safety at

the ground.    We have seen videos of the Bradford disaster and also

Heysel Stadium and the fire and Police Officers explained what we

should and s h o u l d n ’t do and also explained the use of fire equipment

I have no knowledge of first aid and have never been given any

instruction by the Club on this or offered any facility to learn

basic first aid.

There are three Stewards assigned to gate          *C’ myself,      Ian MARSH and

man called           , I d o n ’t know his surname.

We are paid     12 for a normal    game and     18 for a semi final and work

from about    1,00 pm until 4,45- pm.    We work a system whereby one of u

mans the gate for fifteen minutes at a time whilst the others u*at.ch

the game and then switch about,       so that    I miss   fifteen minutes of

each half of the game.

We all   listen to the Tannoy and if the message          "Will Mr MEADOWS

please go to the Police Office" we all make our way back to our

alloted posts and assist    in any crowd dispersal         etc.

Last year    I was at my post for the semi final between Liverpool and

Nottingham Forrest and I experienced no problems whatsoever,               the

people all turned up early,       they were   in the ground at 2,55 pm and

following the game they all dispersed with no incident.

On Saturday 15th April    1989 I was again at work for the semi final

also between Liverpool    and Nottingham Forrest.

I arrived at Sheffield Wednesday football          club at about      11,00 am,     I

went upstairs,    signed on and then went to my post.             With me as usual
                                                                             PAGE


was   Ian MARSH and a mart called                 whose surname   I do not know.

Gate C was partially opened from about             11.10 am to allow Stewards and

ground staff to enter the West Stand area.

At around 11.30 am to       12.00 am     we were told that there    was to be a

briefing upstairs    in the seating area of the West Stand,

We    left the gate shut but unlocked M;ith a Policeman keeping watch and

aliowing ground staff       in and o u t ,

In the stand all of the Stewards             posted to the West Stand area were

assembled and we re being briefed by a Police            Inspector who was with

his Senior Officer,       I think he     was promoted from Inspector    last year,

so he'd be the next       rank along.

The Police    Inspector    I would describe as being white 5*8" to 5*9"

tall,   medium build,     he had a full beard which was trimmed tidily.

The Officer normally works the game and I think             is normally

responsible for the inside policing of that end of the ground.

The other officer also regularly works             in the ground and as I say he

has not    long been promoted.

The briefing was mainly about the manning of the fire exit gates.

The Officers wanted to know names of any Stewards on these gates so

that they could get hold of them if they needed to.

They said that we knew what        to do which we did and they also knew

that the gate    in our control would always be manned,.

Tickets were shown to us and the officers explained what we were

to look for and to tear off the corner of used tickets so that they

c o u l d n ’t be reused by the fans outside the ground.

The briefing was about twenty minutes             long and on its conclusion all

of the Stewards    returned to post.

The gate    *C* was then partially opened to allow persons into and out

of the stand area and whilst        there we were joined by a steward from

the Liverpool    football    club* who had travelled with the fans to assist
                                                                                PAGE


in ground control of their own fans.

The Steward was a white male,             aged 33-33 years and 5*5" to 5 ’6"

medium build with a slight midriff,              straight,   dark collar   length hair

which was receding slightly at the front.               He had no beard and 1 d i d n ’

think he had any moustache.              He had just a plain yellow bib on which

he wore over his clothes.

The three of us with the Liverpool             Steward manned the partially

opened gate until a Liverpool             fan came along and began moaning that he

had no ticket and could he get one from us.

The Liverpool Steward had words with the fan and after he had gone we

shut the gate although it still was not locked.                 This would have been

2.10 pm,

From this time until about 2.53 pm the gate              *C* was opened and closed

about half a dozen times         to allow officers      to eject fans.,

It became obvious to me that there was an unusually large build up of

fans outside the gate and queueing for the turnstiles as I could see

people outside through gaps in the gate and wall and mainly by the

numbers of people who were climbing over the wall to get in.

I saw Police eject about six fans M;ho climbed over and they were all

thrown out     into Leppings Lane side of the turnstiles            through gate

'C '> the     d oorwas t he n sh u t .

At about      2.53 pm we were standing        bythe gate when the Police

Inspector with the beard came over to us and said something that I

d o n ’t remember and then said "Open the gates".             One of us said

something     like "Do you know what you're doing" and he said "Open

the gates".

I ’m not sure who actually opened the gates on this occasion,                 it was

all   very quick,   it could     have been me,    it could    have been    Ian or

            or it   could even have been       a Policeman.

The gate allowed 2 or 3 people abreast              to surge through due to the
                                                                               PAGE


pressure of the c r o w d     behind them.     Comments    flew as about 200 to 300

fans    poured through the gate which was open barely a minute.

The    comments w e r e   quite evenly divided between people

saying on the one hand "If you d o n ’t open the gates th e r e ’ll be a

riot" and on the other hand "If you open the gates t h e r e ’ll be

bloodshed'1.

After    roughly a minute as I said previously the same Policeman told

us to shut the gates and with the help of Policemen on the outside of

the ground w e      slammed the gates shut.

At around 3 pm or so the same Police             Inspector came back to us and

said "Open the gates'1, there were several            hundred fans milling around

by the gates,      scores of fans       coming over the walls and at this stage

the Police were helping them down.

The gates were again opened             by which one of   us I c a n ’t recollect and

as they came apart I could see            there were a    lot of fans outside so

I pushed the right hand gate as you look at the West Stand nearly

fully open.       There was then a sudden       rush of fans pouring

through the gates,         at least     20 or 30 people   deep.   The front   runners

so to speak were running and also being pushed along by the force of

the crowd from behind.

The people milling around in the enclosure joined in with the masses

and there were people e v e r y w h e r e *   The crowd expanded some ran

straight at the tunnel,         others    ran right and left,- some tried to get

up the stairs to the seating area.

1' just stepped to one side,           if I h a d n ’t I would have been trampled fay

the crowd.

Within a few moments the vast majority of the crowd who had been

outside the stand entrance were            in the west stand area and one of us

shut the door again on the            instructions of someone     in authority,   I

d o n ’t remember who.
                                                                            PAGE


We then closed gate    *C* aver to about      18" wide and began letting

people   in as normal and checking tickets.

At about 3,10 pm a man came      round to where     I was standing from the

tunnel   side of the west stand.        He began complaining saying that he'd

been at Heysel and this was going to be another Heysel and that he

wouldn't be seeing any football.

I took him to the office and he asked for his money back but they

said he had to get it back from Liverpool          football    club.

This would has'e been around 3.23 pm when I returned and as I did I

saw people sat up against the fence which borders the river outside

the west stand.

Most were distressed and were struggling for breath,             some had blanket

on them and I presume were already dead,

I went to the tunnel    to see what      I could do but I was told by an

Ambulance man that there was nothing more          I could do and would I give

drinks and any aid I could to the         injured in the enclosure area which

I did.

I then went onto the     pitch and did the same sort of thing,         helping

out where    I could and trying to comfort       people.

I then met up with the Liverpool Steward who was posted to our gate

and he was    in an emotional   state    complaining about the C l u b ’s

organisation and saying     it was a disaster.

There was nothing more that      could be done so I went home.

I would describe myself as a white male,          5*3" tall,   medium build,     I

have   light brown side parted hair with a 2-3 inch scar on the left

side of my head above my ear where the hair          is missing.

I also have a moustache and I would say appear to be in my middle to

late twenties.

I was wearing a blue    red and white tracksuit top,          blue jeans and a

stewards    bib, yellow M^ith ’UMBRO*    on the back and the advertising
                                                                         PAGE


          logo   ’BINGHAMS W I N D O W S ’ on the back.

          I have entered my exact post on the plan of the Hillsborough

          ground,   which I enclose signed by myself.

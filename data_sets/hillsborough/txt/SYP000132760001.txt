 PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE GROUND ASKING FOR TICKETS.      I AM A REGULAR ATTENDER AT

 1420 I HEARD AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE LOUDSPEAKER ASKING LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS TO

  MOVE FORWARD IN THE LEPPINGS LANE STAND.     THEY REPEATED THAT REQUEST AT 1430

 AT ABOUT 1445 I COULD SEE THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG & I COULD SEE PEOPLE BEING

  CRUSHED TOGETHER.     I LOOKED FOR A STEWARD, BUT THERE WASN'T ONE NEAR TO ME,

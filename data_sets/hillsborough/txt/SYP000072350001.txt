            West S t a n d entra n c e           because                                                 a ticket    for    that

            stand.          We saw him t hr o u g h            the turnsti l e y a n d            then went        to our

            entrance.          There were           no    proper        queued/ a n d        there was       just a large

            crowd.          There were          no Po l i c e       or S t e w a r d s    giving     directions.           I knew

            w h i c h t ur n s t i l e    to go to because                I went         to the M a t c h    last year       but    I

            had great         d if fi c u l t y e n t e r i n g      the tur n s t i l e      because       of the    large

            crowd.          I e v e n t u a l l y made my way t h r o u g h a t u r nstile and handed                         in my

            ticket.

            Once     I got      into      the    gr o u n d    I saw no signs              dir e c t i n g me w h i c h way    to go

            but as      I had been          last year           I knew w h i c h w^y. to go.                 I ente r e d the

            g r o u n d at t he same            time     last year and y n e n               1 tried to go down the

            tunnel      I was      stop p e d and d i r e c t e d a / o u n d             the sides        by Police and

            S t e wards .      The       tunnel     was       not    cj/dfsed this         time     so    I went    thro u g h the

            tunnel-          I had an easy              passage        thro u g h the        tunnel       but as    soon as    I got

            into     the ground           it was        very tightly            packed       because       it was    so tight

                     an d    I d ec id ed to move              forward we did so and the                     crush became

       4"   easier.          We were       stand i n g        in Pen 4 in sq u are L..4,

            At a bout 2.4 5 p m           the    teams were            read out and           the    crowd became          tighter.

            At 2 . 5 0 p m whe n the            teams     came out onto              the     pitch and the          crowd surged

   V        forward.          I was       pushed        forw a r d a        p      to the front            fence    (K 8) r I was

            could see a white               girl        age^f about         18 to 20 years.                She had shoulder

            length straight               dark     ha/r and she was wea r i ng a da rk t o p .                        She was

            about 5*2"         tall      and/fas         a me d i u m build.              She was        being    crushed against

                                   She was        not moving            and did not appear                 to be b r eathing        her

            face     turned      blue.The         next        thing      I can remember             is falling       onto    the

            pitch.          I do not know           how       I got there.               After    sitting        on the    pitch for

            a w hile        I rec o v e r e d my senses and                 climbed        back up onto           the fence and

                and    carried him to an area                 behind the Np/rth Stand.

[Actions Consolidated by Order of the Honourable Mr.

justice Hidden dated 25th of June 1990]



              SKELETON ARGUMENT OF THE R ESPONDENT

                          PETER WRIGHT



1.    The analysis by the Court was correct       in fact and

in law and the conclusions,        properly arrived at, ought

not to be disturbed.



2.    The claims in each case are for damages        for

injuries alleged to have been suffered by the Deceased

 sisters Sarah Lo.-.ise Hicks and Victoria Jane Hicks and

 by the Deceased Colin Wafer according to the respective

 Endorsements on '-.Tit (respectively at bundle 1 pages            13

 and 27)
 and pleaded in irtcr.tical terms      in the Statements of

 Facts   in each case   (respectively at bundle 1 pages       14

 and 28 ) .



 3.      In neither Pleading were the claims expressed to

 be for injury a V - o . d to be the consequence of the

 apprehension of i n j u r y   to anouae}..



                                 -2-
4.      The direct evidence concerning Victoria and Sarah

Hicks    is accurately set out by the Learned Judge in his

Judgment    (see pages   38 and   39 of bundle 1).



5.      There was no evidence before the Learned Judge

concerning the Deceased Colin Wafer at the football

ground prior to his      being found dead   in pen 3.        Where

he had been in that      pen or for how long or how      he had

come to be in the position w h e n found was not        in

evidence.



6.      That of the 95 who died in the tragedy at

Hillsborough it was      in evidence that at least      16 and

probably 21 individuals came into the ground after Gate

C opened at 2.52 p.m.      see paragraph 108 of the interim

report of Lord Justice Taylor.         (Bundle 2 page 39).



7.      It was in evidence that comparatively late

arrivals made their way,       "wormed", well   into and in

certain instances towards the front of the crowds              in

pens    3 and 4.    See the evidence of for example:-



        Leonard    (bundle 2 pages 84/85)



        Hennessey    (bundle 2, page 120)



        Barnbrock    (bundle 2 page 126)



8.      There was medical evidence before the Judge,            in

particular from Drs.       Slater and Gumpert   (see


                              -3-
particularly bundle 2 page         145,   226,    227,    228,     229 and

230 - Dr.    Slater,    and 232 and 234 - Dr.           Gumpert) which

evidence the Judge accepted         (see the Judgment,            bundle 1

page 48)    of the immediacy of traumatic asphyxiation.



9.     What any individual in pens          3 or 4 experienced

depended upon the precise       location of that               individual.

Such was    conceded,    see the Judgment,         (bundle 1 page 38

D) and the experience and perception of the situation

did in fact vary according to the individuals whose

evidence was before the Court.             See for example:-



       Leonard    (bundle 2 page 85,       94 and       95.)



       Cruice    (bundle 2 page 105 and          106)



       Hennessey    (bundle 2 pages 121 and             122)



       Barnbrock     (bundle 2 page 126)



       Cl a rk   (bundle 2 pages   344 and       345)



 10.   In the circumstances the conclusion complained of

at Paragraph 1 of the Notice of Appeal was reasonable

 and warranted.



 11.   As to Paragraph 2 of the Notice of Appeal                    it is

 submitted that the judgment does not reflect any

 conclusion or direction that,            as a pre-requisite of

 finding    for the Plaintiffs,      specific evidence of the


                               -4-
exact extent of the D e c e a s e d â€™s suffering was required.



12.    As to Paragraph 3 of the Notice of Appeal it is

submitted that the conclusions which the Learned Judge

came to were properly arrived at and that such

inferences as the Appellants assert should have been

drawn could not have been drawn.



13.    For damages to be awarded nothing short of the

proof of injury,      (whether by inference or direct

evidence wil      suffice*.   In addition to being referred

to Behrens -v- Bertram Mills        1957 2 Q.B.   1 . (at pages

27 and 28), mentioned in the Judgment        (bundle 1 page

49)    the Judge had been generally referred to the

authorities discussed in the immediately preceding

nervous shock hearing, wh i c h included



        McLoucrhlin -v- O'Brian 1983 A.C.    410 at 418 D and

        431 G   and to Hinz -v- Berry 1970    2 Q.B.    40 at

        page 42 G.



 The common law gives no damages for emotional distress.



 14.    Where there may have been emotional distress

 preceding the suffering of some injury it is submitted

 that that which was not capable of being compensated by

 itself is not rendered capable of compensation by that

 subsequent i n j u r y .



 15.    If such inferences as the Appellants ask to be


                              -5-
drawn are to be drawn at all,        given the medical

evidence there is no basis for the inference to be that

the hurt was endured other than momentarily.



16.    At the hearing it was    submitted that it made

little difference to the submissions on behalf of the

Plaintiff whether the suffering started at 5 to 3 or at

10 to 3 (bundle 1 page 78)      and that it was wildly

unlikely that any figure that might be awarded would be

any different whether it could be shown that the

discomfort began at 2.35 or 2.45 or 2.40.         (bundle 1

page 58)



17.    If contrary to the Respondent's      submissions    in

respect of any of the Appellants'        cases any inferences

caflw be drawn enabling it to be found that any injury

was endured prior to unconsciousness         supervening   it

could not be concluded that such was         endured more than

momentarily and in the circumstances should be regarded

as de minimis and not such that should sound in

damages.



 18.    If contrary to the Respondent's submission any

 damages are to be awarded such should be minimal and

 regard had to the level of awards exemplified by the

 cases referred to in the submissions of the Respondent

 set out at pages 95,   96, 97 and 98 of the transcript

 contained in bundle 1 namely



        Keith -v- Tennents Kemp para 4-131/2


                               -6-
      Davis -v- Phoenix Hotel Kemp para 11-884



      Lawrence -v- John Laing Kemp para 12-0231



      King -v- Percival Kemp para 12-102



      James and Evans -v- Keenan Current Law March   19 90

      paragraph 146



19.   For the reasons given by the Learned Judge   it is

submitted no award should be made and that this Appeal

should be dismissed.

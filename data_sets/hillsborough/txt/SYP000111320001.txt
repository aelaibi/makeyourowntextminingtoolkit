                       At 8.15 am on Saturday,                        15 April     1989,       I came on duty at Arflithor p*e

                        Police S t a t i o n for duties at the F.A.                          Cup Semi-Final                m a t c h at

                       Hillsborough.

                        After     the briefing at H i l l s b o r o u g h              I was       detailed to serial 31                      under

/13 ,                   the su p e r v i s i o n of PS S881 Pearson.                        At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    10.30 am          I took

                       Smith      in front          of an area of waste ground.

                       At this          location the m a j o r i t y of people were Liverpool                                 fans.          On

                        several         occasions         I was a p p r o a c h e d by Liverpool               fans who w i s h e d to

                        know either where                 to go       in the ground,           whether any           public        houses were

          /A) (lcX      open and on o c casions                  if    I had any ^ p a T e ^ t i c k e t s         for     sale,

                        I advi s e d them that no                 public      houses were            open and        if they did not

                        have a ticket               they should         leave the v i c inity of Hillsb o r o u g h .                         The

                      ^/majority of the               fans      that    I saw had either              been d r i nking           or were

                        carrying         beer-^cans and were drink*rf§ out of them.                                  I w o u l d not say

                        that the fans were drunk                       but were      in very high spirits.

                        Fro m a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1.30       pm I was aware           of a large number                 of Liverpool

              I spoke to a C hief              Inspector and asked him what                  to do about          the

             youths who were              carrying alcohol.              He a d v i s e d me to a l l o w them

             through as          ’they will           be taken off them at the t u r n s t i l e s ’ .

             At S. 00 pm a large number                    of supporters         past my     location       presumably

             from the train.               These were a c c o m p a n i e d by only about SO                police.

             F r o m this      time onwards            the volume    of supporters           grew to thousands and

              I noti ced the fans who had been                     looking       for tiW«rt's^walk down w ith

             the swelling           numbers          to Hillsborough.

             At a p p r o x i m a t e l y S . 30      pm the traffic       travelling        down L e p p i n g s Lane
      sc/5
             was    h a 1 ted by my s e l f and PC S m i t h on the order of PS Pearson.

             ^     a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3.0 0    pm Leppings Lane was          ful 1 of suppo r t e r s        over

    Cd***

£ V          an    Inspector        came     past our       location and told us to go to L e p pings

             Lane and on arrival                at Leppings        Lane    I saw a large           number    of

             Liverpool         fans who wfe-r'g'^upset and hurling abuse at Police Officers.

             As    I went      through gaf^Tc            I saw several        bodies wit h         people    trying       to

             render       f a i d .            I then he 1 ped to move^n-j'ured peopie outside                           the

             gates.        A young        lady then        came to me and a sked for help.                   I together

             w ith PC      1900 Kent         followed the         lady    into    the snack bar.            I then

             he l p e d a young~''f>ens^le wit h clxfst injuries,                   as we      carried her across

             the ho 1ding area the Liverpool                      fans^r^iUised to get out of our way

             a l t h o u g h we shou t e d at them we were                forced to knock them out of the

             way.

             An    Inspector a t t e m p t e d to take            Charge of the sit u a t i o n and ordered

             myself a W         other      officers        to form a barrier         to shield the d e a d .              I

             received a gV^at              deal       of abuse    from the Liverpool             fans.

             A short while            laVer after          the arrival       of fire\and a m b u l a n c e        services

          A Superintendent          then deplo y e d our serial        on L e p pings Lane an d we

          were     directed to move        people a way to a l l o w      the ground to clear and

          for access       for e m e r g e n c y services.

          As the Liverpool          fans   left the g r o u n d   I received a lot of abuse        for

          what     had occurred.        We were    i n structed to     remain calm an d make      no

          arrests.        Once L e p p i n g s Lane had   cleared we were told to meet PS

          Pearson      in the N o r t h S tand at Hills b o r o u g h .    After a debrief Serial 31

          was     reunited a n d m e a l e d   before   returning    to D o ncaster   for 8.0 0   pm.

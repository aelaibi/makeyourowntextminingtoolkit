  Following the tragedy at the Hillsborough stadium on 15 April 1989 Mrs Joan McBrien
  made the following complaints against Superintendent R Marshall:-

       That he failed to prevent a build up of Liverpool supporters a t the turnstiles in
       Leppings Lane by inadequate policing arrangements:                   xurnsmes in

       He should not have requested Chief Superintendent Duckenfield to open the gates
       under any circumstances and thereby giving unlimited and uncontrolled access into
       the football ground by supporters.

  The matter, was referred to the Police Complaints Authority under Section 87(l)(a)(i) of
  the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The Authority decided to supervise the
  investigation under Section 89(l)(a) of the Act and approved the appointment of Chief

 The overall investigation has examined 9560 questionnaires, 5341 statem ents, 2392 sets
 of d o cu m en ts including 71 hours of video recordings, 2411 p h o to g rap h s and th e
 transcripts of the 174 persons who gave evidence to the Lord Justice Taylor enquiry.

 The Investigating Officer’s final report covering these complaints was received by
 Authority on 2 August 1990. The report was supported by 527 statem ents, video
 recordings of the events taking place, photographic evidence, plans of the stadium and
 its surrounds, together with copies of video recordings and transcripts of the interviews
 with Superintendent Marshall plus a written statem ent made b y him.

 The complaints have been thoroughly investigated to the satisfaction of the Police
 Complaints Authority.

                I am a married woman & I live at the above ad dress with my husband

                Brown who was born on 21.3.71 (21031971) died at Hillsborough football

                ground on Saturday 15th April,       1989 (150489).


                                         S
                I have handed to M PS Appleton two photographs of Carl, on today's

                date 20.7.89 (£00789), to assist the W Midlands Police in identifying

                Carl on any photographs or video tapes that they have in their

                possession.      I must stress that I want both of these photographs

                returned to me.



                On the 26th April,     1989 (260489) Car l ’s property,    clothing etc was

                returned to me.     Everything was returned there is nothing outstanding,
                                                                              PAGE

           but one thing was returned to us that definitely did not belong to

           Carl .    This was an aeroplane tie pin.   I have returned this to Ui PS

           Appleton.

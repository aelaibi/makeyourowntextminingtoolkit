Dear Lord Justice,

Thankyou for your undated letter of the beginning of this month.
A few days ago, I received at my request from one of your secretariat (Mike Ward), a photocopy of a
facsimile sent hy South Yorkshire police to the Home Office on the 3rd of March this year.
The document appears to he a statement given hy myself concerning the events of April 15th 1989.
Perplexingly, I have no recollection of having made this statement. The details seem correct, and perhaps
they are my words, hut I certainly never met the two officers whose names are typed at the bottom of all
pages as witnesses to my signature. I am sure it will not have escaped your notice that the statement does
not in fact carry my handwritten signature at all. This document has quite obviously been prepared
recently on a sophisticated word-processor, and was not typed contemporaneously.
The solicitor acting on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group was in touch with South
Yorkshire police yesterday in an attempt to obtain some kind of original document bearing my written
signature. Despite the fact that South Yorkshire police are in possession of written authority from myself
to release any statements to her, they seem unwilling to do so, and cite the recently announced scrutiny
as the reason. It is to be hoped that they are not being deliberately obstructive.
 For reasons which I am sure you can understand, I am very anxious to see any original documentation.
Whilst I am sure that S outh Yorkshire police are keen not to upset either yourself, nor the processes of
the scrutiny, I should be grateful if you were able to let them know that letting me see my original signed
 statement is unlikely to do either.

Yours sincere

  HILLSBOROUGH: MEETING WITH LORD FERRERS

  We received this morning the attached papers from Mrs Moody of
  F2 Division seeking a contribution to a response to a letter to
  the Home      Secretary   from George Howarth,         the MP     for Knowsley
  North.   I also happened to answer your telephone and took a call
  from Mrs Moody who was         anxious that      F8 be represented at a
^^meeting to discuss the letter from Mr Howarth which Lord Ferrers
  has called for 11.3 0 on Wednesday 13 November (when I shall be
  at Heathrow).


  2.    You will see that Mrs Moody has asked for a contribution to
  tack on to the end of the draft which she has already produced.
  I have asked Miss Pugh to consider what we might usefully offer.
  I have to say, though, that the note struck by Mrs Moody's draft
  seems to me somewhat off-key.             However valid the points          she
  makes,   they    could    perhaps   be   put   forward   in   a   rather   more
  sympathetic way given the very real and understandable concerns
  which Mr Howarth is expressing.


   3.   As to the meeting, I think it would be as well if you were
   to attend.     There is a rather uncomfortable history of our being
   asked to accept hot potatoes which their rightful owners in this
   part of F2 find somewhat indigestible.


   4.   I have advised Private Office that you (or, in your absence,
   Mr Mennell) will attend.      I have also suggested that Mrs Harrison.
   (E Division) be invited given the criticism of the coroner's
inquest sometimes raised by the Hillsborough families, as well
perhaps as someone from G2 given their interest in the safety
aspects of the Taylor Report.


5.      Mrs Moody would like to speak to you on the telephone before
10 . 0 0 .

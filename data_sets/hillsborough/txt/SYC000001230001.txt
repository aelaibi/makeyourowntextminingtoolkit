                            Thursday 22nd November 1990

                 Use of photographs, plans etc in Coroner's Court


Legal Representatives, as well as the Coroner, are frequently producing
exhibits in the above form to assist the Jury to understand.  This produces a
problem of everybody having sight of the object at the same time. After
discussion with the Coroner the following policy will operate forthwith.

A colour photocopier (capable of producing acetates) will be housed in the
Coroner’s room at the Town Hall with operational effect from Monday 26th
November 1990.  The copier will be kept locked at all times except when in
operational use under the instruction of DCC Mr JONES, Detective Superintendent
BEECHEY and Detective Inspector PERKINS. A log will be maintained indicating
the following

Date of copy
Description of original, reference number and ’C ’ number
Type of copy (paper or acetate)
Number of copies
To whom to be charged (if not H M Coroner)

The following procedure will apply if the Coroner produces visual evidence.   We
will produce twenty five copies and distribute; this should normally be
pre-planned.

Where a legal representative produces visual evidence, the Coroner will first
consider whether he intends to accept it. If he does a West Midlands Police
Officer will take the item and produce once acetate and two hard copies (one
for the Coroner’s binder and one for my file).   On return to Court the Coroner
will allocate a ’C ’ number and display the acetate.  If legal representatives
wish to have a hard copy, they may obtain such on payment (80p each) as per
transcript pages. An invoicing system will be developed by Admin.

Summary


This note discusses the evidence for associations between time of entry to Hillsborough football
ground/kftd alcohol consumption amongst spectators who died. There is some statistical evidence
that those victims who entered late were more likely to have non-negligible blood alcohol levels
than those who entered early. This association is in part due to the fact that the women and youths
who died had little blood alcohol and also tended to have entered the ground early. However, the
association between time of entry and alcohol levels persisted in men aged 18 or more.


The Data


Data was provided by HM Coroner on the probable time of entry to the ground and route of entry,
blood alcohol levels, and the age and sex of the 95 victim^ of the Hillsborough football disaster.




Results


1. Time of entry


The time of entry and route of entry were classified as shown in table 1, which also shows the age,
sex, and blood alcohol levels of those spectators who died. Nothing was known about the entry
times of 13 spectators. For a further 22 spectators the time of entry was assessed as being after
2.30 pm. but it was not known whether they entered via gate "C" after 2.48 or via a turnstile. The
remaining victims have been divided into two groups according to whether or not they entered
 before 2.48 via a turnstile, or at or after 2.48 (when gate C was opened). There are associations
 between both the age and sex of the victims and when they entered the ground. More than half
 (53%) of the victims who are known to have entered via a turnstile before 2.48 were under 20,
 whilst less than a third (31%) of those known to have entered after 2.48 were youths (table 2).
 Similarly, all 5 of the women whose entry times were certainly known entered before 2.30 (table 3)
 One woman was known to have entered cither through gate " C or after 2.30, and nothing was

 known about the entrance of the other woman who died.
 The age distribution of those who were known only to have entered cither through gate "C" or
  through a turnstile after 2.30 was the same as the age distribution of those known to have entered
  after 2.48; and quite different from that of those known to have entered before 2.48 (table 2).
  Furthermore, of the 7 victims known to have died in pen 4, three were known to have entered after
  2.48 (via gate ”C") and the other four were assessed as having either entered through gate C or
  through a turnstile after 2.30. This evidence suggests that those victims who were known only to
  have entered via gate C or after 2.30 may form part of the group who entered after 2.48; and they
  have been combined with this group in the main analysis below to form a group of 48 victims
  termed "late'entrants". The remainder are termed "carljfentrants" (34 victims), or "not known" (13
  victims).




1 -Blood alcohol levels


  Over half (54%) of the 95 victims had no blood alcohol or negligible traces (< l()mg/dl). Only 15
  (16%) had more than 80 mg/dl (the legal limit for drinking and driving). Blood alcohol was also
  associated with age and sex. Nearly three quarters (71%) of the victims under 20 years old had
  negligible blood alcohol, compared to under a half (42%) of those 20 or over (table 4). None of
  the women had any blood alcohol recorded (table 5).




3.Time of entry and blood alcohol level


  Approximately one-third (35%) of the "earl^entrants" had non-ncgligible traces of blood alcohol
  (>10m g/dl), compared to nearly two-thirds (63%) of the "latel entrants". The odds of having a
  non-negligible blood alcohol level for "late^entrants" were 3*1 (95% Cl: 1 • 2, 7 • 6) times as great as
  the odds for "early entrants”. Thus there is strong statistical evidence that "latc^cntrants" were
                                                                    l/'1
  more likely to have non-negligible blood alcohol levels than "early entrants".


  This association could have arisen merely because the young victims and the women tended both to
  be early entrants and to have negligible blood alcohol levels.        However, after excluding both
  women and young men from the analysis, the association between alcohol and entry time persisted.
   For men over 18, 45% of "early entrants" had blood alcohols in excess of 10 mg/dl (and 15% in
   excess of 80mg/dl), whilst 71%) of the "late'entrants" had blood alcohol in excess of 10 mg/dl (and
  29% in excess of 80mg/dl) (table 7). Amongst 'men over 18 the odds of having a non-negligible
   blood alcohol level for "late entrants" were 3*0 (95% Cl: 1*0, 9«3) times as great as for "early
   entrants", exactly as before.
This analysis is complicated by the fact that there were 13 victims whose entrance to the ground is
unrecorded^ and a further 22 who can be assessed only to have entered cither through gate C
(after 2.48 pm.) or through a turnstile after 2.30. The latter group have been included with the
"late entrants" after 2.48 on the basis of the similarity of their age distribution and the disposition
of their places of death. This may be wrong.        If, instead, the victims are split into two groups
according to whether or not they entered before or after 2.30 pm, then these 22 victims certainly
form part of the group of later entrants defined in this way.


The association between blood alcohol and entrance before or after 2.30 is shown in table 8, and,
again, there is some evidence that later entrants after 2.30 were more likely to have non-negligible
alcohol levels than earlier entrants before 2.30. The odds of having non-negligible alcohol levels
for these later entrants were 2*9 (95% Cl: 1 •(), 8«6) times as great as those for earlier entrants

defined in this way.




Discussion


Whether the alcohol levels and times of entrance in these 95 victims bears any relation to those in
the general body of spectators is difficult to assess. However, if their alcohol levels were related
to their deaths, in the sense of having increased their chances of dying, then plainly the alcohol
levels might bear no relation to those in the rest of the spectators who entered at the same time. If,
on the other hand, the alcohol levels in these victims played no part at all in their deaths and were
not a factor in the chance that they died, then it is at least possible that the victims’ alcohol levels
reflect those that were generally prevalent amongst the spectators who entered at the same times

via the same routes.


Since these are generally small levels of alcohol, it is perhaps unlikely that the level of alcohol was
a contributing factor in the deaths of any individual spectator. That is to say, it is unlikely that the
reason why one spectator died rather than another can be explained to any extenj^ataU /iy the
 victim’s blood alcohol level.   (However, this does not, of course, mean that alcohol may have
 played no part in the deaths. It would still be possible to argue, for example, that the general level
 of alcohol consumption amongst the spectators raised the general chance of there being some
 victimsjwithout being relevant to the deaths of any individuals).


 If it is the case that alcohol played no part in any individual deaths then it is possible that the
 alcohol levels in the victims entering at different times is a representative sample of the alcohol
 levels in the spectators as a whole entering at the same times. If this is the case, then there is some
 statistical evidence that a greater proportion of spectators who entered late (at or after 2.48) or

 latish (after 2.30pm) had been drinking before the game.

17.7      As for being born alive, the legal test is not whether the child has breathed,                        The penalty for murder is fixed by law, i.e. imprisonment for life,12 and
       but whether it was wholly expelled from the mother’s body before dying.4 If                           the judge has no discretion in the matter, although he is entitled to specify a

       subject to the law of murder and manslaughter. Whether an offence is                                  “involuntary” manslaughter. The actus reus of both kinds of manslaughter is

        the probable consequences of the continuance of the pregnancy would be to             set out in the Abortion Act 1967.
                                                                                                 Under this Act, an abortion is not unlawful if carried out by a registered                        17.36

        outright.50
17.32     The difficult (and crucial) words in the statute are “capable of being born         either: (1) that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk (a) to the
        alive” : it is clearly not necessary that the child be capable of surviving for a     life of the woman, or (b) of injury to her physical or mental health, or (c) of
        long (or indeed any) time after birth. For the purpose of proving that a child        injury to the physical or mental health of any existing children of her family,
        whose life is destroyed was “capable of being born alive” there is a statutory        greater than if the pregnancy were terminated; or (2) that there is a substan­
        presumption that a fetus aged 28 weeks or more from conception was a child            tial risk that the child would be born seriously physically or mentally handi­
        capable of being born alive.51                                                        capped.55
17.33     Contrary to popular belief, it is this statutory presumption, rather than
        some specific provision of the abortion legislation, that provides the effective                                       C om plicity in Suicide
        limit on legalised abortion. It is important, too, to notice that it is only a pre­
        sumption. In other words, if the prosecution can prove in a particular case           Despite the fact that suicide is no longer a criminal offence,56 it is nonetheless 17.37
        that a fetus of, say, 23 or 24 weeks development was “capable of being born           a distinct offence to aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide or attempted
        alive” then it is within the ambit of this offence. Given the development of          suicide of another person, and this offence is punishable by a maximum of 14
        modern medical science and technology, there must be few cases where this             years’ imprisonment.57 Thus, for example, a person who knowingly provides
        could not be proved. Conversely, if the defence were somehow able to prove            the means for a person to commit suicide is guilty of an offence under this
        that a fetus of 29 or 30 weeks was for some reason (e.g. a congenital defect)         section. It seems that a person who advises another as to how successfully to

       ever) would not have occurred. Although there are a few cases where this test       mind or body as to succumb more easily than a normal person,6 or if the vic­
       can be useful, as where a person administers poison to a person who dies of a       tim is of such religious or other beliefs as to refuse medical treatment and dies
       heart attack before the poison can take effect,61 for legal purposes it is not      where an ordinary person would have accepted treatment which would have
       generally much use, as it casts its net much too wide. There are a great many       saved him,68 then the defendant must nevertheless bear the criminal respon­

      would be unreasonable to ascribe criminal responsibility to the actors in each          Finally, we turn to a quite different topic in the area of causation, that of
       case. As a result, lawyers have searched for a closer cause (sometimes called       liability for omissions, rather than for positive acts. In general, for a person to
      an imputable or legal cause, or causa causans) amongst the “but-for” causes.         be held to have caused another’s death by omission, there has to be some duty

      the test for “legal” causes amongst all the “but-for” causes. Sometimes the          held to arise in 5 main sets of circumstances: (1) where the defendant is under
      question of “legal” causation is affected by a specific legal rule, such as that     a contractual duty to act69; (2) where the defendant is a parent who owes

17.41    In the final analysis what makes a “legal” cause is a value judgment that in      law is somewhaTwary ot attaching criminal responsibility to an omission to
      the particular circumstances the actor should bear responsibility for what           act, so it may be thought unlikely that these categories will be extended in the

      in which the courts are ready to ascribe this criminal responsibility. One is

      an effort perhaps to escape, or as a result of fright, takes some step which         There are a number of “defences” which a defendant may advance in a homi­

      degree of criminal responsibility that should be borne by the actor demon­
      strates itself in a second class of case. This is where, although the defendant

      that he did die, it was held that the original actor who stabbed the victim          much they are aware of what they are doing and that it is wrong. Children of

                   HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUESTS

                          OPERATIONAL ORDER



INFORMATION

On the 30 August 1990, the Director of Public Prosecutions announced,
that there was insufficient evidence upon which a prosecution for
manslaughter or any other criminal offence, could be brought against any
persons in connection with the disaster at the Hillsborough Football
Stadium in Sheffield on the 15 April 1989. Upon the announcement of the
decision, HM Coroner took up his duty to re-open the Inquests.

At the direction of HM Coroner, Doctor Stefan Popper, the Inquests will
resume on Monday 19 November 1990.

The Inquests will be held at the Town Hall, Sheffield and will reconvene
with the Jury of 11 members, who in due course will be invited to return
verdicts.  It is highly likely that these resumed Inquests will continue
until their final conclusion.  It is envisaged that these Inquests will
continue for a period of approximately 3 months.


INTENTION

Under the direction of Mr J M Jones, Deputy Chief Constable, Cheshire
Constabulary, assisted by Detective Superintendent S Beechey to service
the needs of HM Coroner during the Inquests.

To facilitate the presentation of all evidence gathered into the deaths
of the 95 deceased at Hillsborough within the parameters laid down by
HM Coroner namely; how and why the people died.

        arrangements have been made for the sign posting of rooms to be used by
        the Press to avoid unnecessary interruption to personnel attending the
        Court.

        On the first day the Press had been advised that the HM Coroner will

TO ALL PERSONNEL ENGAGED ON THE
HILLBOROUGH INQUIRY



HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - POLICY NOTE

The following information has been prepared to advise all officers, providing
coronal support to the resumed Inquests, of the conditions that will apply whilst
working away from the West Midlands.


Hours of Duty

Officers working in Sheffield, will be paid a standard 13 hour day, ie five hours
extended overtime.  This overtime payment recognises travelling time to and from
the hotel each day and refreshment periods which will necessitate liaison with
the Coroner and Mr Jones regarding progress of the Inquest.

There will be no requirement for rest day working, unless extreme weather
conditions prevail, travel to and from Sheffield will take place on Monday
morning and Friday evening.

Hotel accommodation will be made available for each officer, (Monday to Thursday
night inclusive).  If an officer wishes to return home for operational or
domestic reasons, Mr Jones and Superintendent Beechey will be advised.


Hired Cars Travel Allowances

Each officer will be provided with a travel allowance or a hired car. If hired
vehicles are used, they may be retained at the officer’s home during rest days.
They will be insured for all employees of West Midlands Police for work in
connection with the Hillsborough Inquiry and social purposes whilst deployed in
Sheffield.  They will also be insured for travel to and from the Centre.   (There
is no insurance cover for rest days in the West Midlands). Officers using their
own vehicles will claim the appropriate essential user rate, deducting normal
home to office mileage on journeys to and from Sheffield. There is no
requirement to deduct home to office mileage whilst resident in Sheffield.



                                                                  Continued ...




      PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
Radio Pagers

Officers in possession of radio pagers, will respond to calls between 8.00 am and
9.00 pm. Between 9.00 pm and 8.00 am the pagers will not be required to be
switched on. The only exception to this policy will be respect of the officer(s)
designated to respond to alarm calls from Furnival House. That officer will be
required to respond to pager requests on a 24 hours basis.


Allowances

Officers will be entitled to claim the appropriate subsistence allowance as
determined by Police Regulations. Officers dining with Superintendent Beechey or
Mr Jones will be entitled to claim at the superintendents’ subsistence rate. A
telephone allowance of   55p per night spent away (ie four nights) will be paid to
each officer in recognition of a telephone call home.

Reimbursement of expenses will be made on a weekly basis.


Fumvial House - Security

One officer plus a deputy will be identified for security of Furnvial House.
That officer will be responsible for opening the building each morning and
ensuring that the intruder alarm is set each evening. That officer will also
respond to any alarm activation (in conjunction with South Yorkshire Police).   A
private security company will be employed to respond to any intruder alarm
activations between 6.00 pm Friday and 8.00 am Monday morning.

                        FIRE INSTRUCTIONS - TOWN HALL



IF YOU DISCOVER A FIRE AND THE ALARM HAS NOT SOUNDED — BREAK THE NEAREST

                       over the Public Address System of the apparent area of
                       danger. STAFF in this area should make an initial
                       inspection of their surroundings as far as is

                       representative on extension 4537 any apparent cause
                       for the alarm. The area will subsequently -be
                        inspected by the Fire Officers, to whan such
                        assistance as is necessary should be given.'^
                        ALL STAFF not directly involved should retain at their
                        work stations at this stage.

 EVACUATION            Should it prove necessary to evacuate all or part of
                       the building, such instructions will be given over the
                       Public Address System and the EVACUATION SIGNAL may be
                       given. This is a CONTINUOUS SERIES OF SWEEP TONES

          "PUBLIC                 Sections containing members of the Public are asked to
                                  render any assistance necessary to speed the
                                  evacuation whilst preventing panic and injury.
                                  A responsible member of staff near each toilet block
                                  should, at the time of evacuation, check in them to
                                  confirm total evacuation, particularly of the invalid
                                  toilets.

          COLLATION               Each Section must report to its own Reporting Officer
                                  who will report anyone missing or unaccounted for to
                                  the appointed Departmental Collating Officer for that
                                  floor. He/she will, in turn, report anyone missing to
                                  the Fire Officer in charge of the incident or any
                                  Fire Officer wearing a white or yellow barred helmet.

                                 . DO NOT RE-ENTER THE BUILDING UNTIL PERMISSION IS GIVEN
                                   BY THE FIRE OFFICER.

          SMALL FIRES             Small fires m y be tackled by staff using the
                                  automatic hose reels and extinguishers provided, but
                                  no personal risk must be taken. Such incidents must
                                  be reported at once to the Town Hall Operations
                                  Manager on Extensions 4552 or 4537.

          FIRE DRILL PROCEDURE

           On evacuation it is the duty of all staff to proceed to the collection point
           with all possible speed for collation.

           On reaching the collection point, staff should group into their sections, at
           agreed locations, without delay and Reporting Officers should check the
           number in their own section quickly to account for those missing. Missing
           persons should not delay the procedure, anyone not present immediately
          -should be reported as missing - this may always be amended later.

          The Reporting Officers should then seek out their own appointed Collating
...   .   Officer who should stand in the agreed prominent position adjacent to the
■JQ       collection point. When all Reporting officers have reported, the Collating
          Officer should then report to the Fire Officer and remain with him, or in a
          place designated by him, until permission is given to re-enter the building,
          when he/she should relay this information back to his/her staff by the
           reverse process.

           Reporting Officers should know how many of their staff are present and where
           they are and Collating Officers should know how many Officers should report
           to them. Details of Reporting Officers and nominated Deputies are shown on
           the attached list.

           It cannot be stressed too greatly that fire drills are not only a
           requirement of law, but are of vital importance to the staff's own welfare,
           and familiarity with procedures is essential if life is to be preserved and
           drill times are to be minimised. .
                                                 "*'%r-"

           NOTE

           This procedure applies in the event of an actual evacuation of the building
           arising from a fire alert or any other cause.

    Humberside Factory and Agricultural Inspectorate of the Health and Safety
    Executive (HSE). Subsequently I was appointed to head the USE team
    investigating the incident following correspondence between the Court of
    Inquiry and the Deputy Director General of the HSE, Mr J D G Hammer.

1.2 This report contains details of examinations performed on site and in the
    laboratory. The work was carried out by me and by other staff of HSE
    working on my instructions and under my general supervision.


2   SURVEY OF PENS 3 AND 4

2.1 Using the drawings prepared by Ralph Brade & Associates, 1340/02 and 03,
    and cotparing with figures stated in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
    1986, the following assessments were made.

2.2 The heights of crush barriers should be 1.02m to 1.12m with a preferred
    height of l.lm. In Pen 3 four out of five barriers do not conform. In
    Pen 4 six out of nine barriers do not conform.

2.3 The alignment of gaps in successive rows of barriers on a terrace should
    form an angle of less than 60° to the barriers. Of the four 'paths of
    gaps' in Pen 3, two do not conform. Of the eleven 'paths of gaps' in Pen
    4, one does not conform.

2.4 Gaps in the line of crush barriers should be at least l.lm and not more
    than 1.4m in width. In Pen 3, four out of five gaps do not conform. In
    Pen 4, nine out of ten gaps do not conform.

2.5 For a terrace slope of approximately 14° the interpolated maximum
    horizontal distance between barriers is 3.9m. In Pen 3 only one spacing
    does not conform, in Pen 4 oily two spacings do not conform.

2.6 Gates or other access points should have a minimum width of l.lm. The
    gate to Pen 3 has a clearance width of 0.81 to 0.82m and the gate to Pen 4
    has a clearance width of 0.77 to 0.79m. Both therefore do not conform.

2.7 The aim is for every spectator on the terraces to be within 12m of a
    gangway or exit. If the perimeter gaps are not considered as exits then
    approximately 40% of the spectators in Pens 3 and 4 will not be within
    12 metres of an exit.


3 EXAMINATION OF THE BRQKFN BAKRTFR - MQ 124A

3.1 Barrier 124A was examined by HSE staff at Hillsborough Football Ground on
    17 April 1989. Various parts of this barrier and 3 core sanples of
    concrete were taken to the Sheffield laboratory on 24 April 1989 for
    detailed assessment.

3.2 it was deduced that barrier 124A had consisted of a continuous horizontal
    tube, made frcm wrought iron, and four vertical supports each made frcm
    two lengths of steel angle section joined at the top by a steel gusset

                                       1
         plate. Five of the eight support feet were reinforced by additional angle
         sections vouch appeared to be let into the concrete terrace steps. Ttoo of
             rear support legs were braced by further angle sections. A
         reconstruction is shewn in Figure l. The barrier had failed apparently by
         partial collapse and fracture of supports 3 and 4, and by fracture of the
          *              at supports 2, 3 and 4, as shewn in Figure 2. The portion
         of the tube which had been located between supports 2 and 3     been bent
         uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 133mn at midspan. The
         portion of the tube which had been located between supports 3 and 4 had
         been bent uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 200nm at
         midspan. Barrier 124A was estimated to be approximately 60 years old,
         although it had received a number of modifications during its lifetime.
 3 .3    Thetensile strength of the wrought iron tube material was measured at
                (23.6 tonf/in ) with an estimated elastic limit of 150MPa
         (9.7 tonf/in ). The tensile strength of the mild„steel angle used for

13.4
            tubefractures had occurred in areas which had been located under the
        metal straps designed to retain the tube. At these locations the tubes
        had not been painted, and the tube wall thicknesses, nominally 4.5nm, had
        been reduced significantly by corrosion. At the fracture surface
        corresponding to support 2 the residual thickness of the tube wall was
                ,Vary fratt °-4nin to 4.4mm around the circumference. Similarly at
        the fracture surface corresponding to support 3 the wall thickness was in
                            4,5lnn* At si^port 4, however, there was evidence that
        5"?           ^ been perforated by corrosion at two locations producing
        noies which wculd have been approximately lQmn and 2Qmn in           before
        tne collapse. Elsewhere, around the fracture corresponding to support 4,
        the wall thickness was in the range l.lsm to 4.5nm.
3 .5    In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of wrought
        ironJ*fch had fractured in a single-stage bending/tensile mode. Fracture
        of the tube adjacent to support 3 appeared to have initiated on the uphill
        side of the barrier at a position approximately 90° frcm top       centre.
        The other tube fractures had suffered some post-failure rfamarp and the
        origins were not readily identifiable.
1.6 2 ? failed,supports had been corroded, particularly at the junction with
    the concrete steps and/or reinforcement angles. In these regions residual
    thicknesses in the range 3.Ism - 5.9nm were measured ccnpared with a
    nominal thickness of 6.3mn.
3 .7    large amounts of metal had been lost by corrosion from supports 3 and 4
        near, what would have been, the original junctions between the support
        feet and the terrace. In one case (rear leg support 4) a ligament of
        metal 8nm wide was all that remained of the original angle section (50 x
        5Qnm). Oi two of the four feet this region had been reinforced by the
        addition of a length of metal angle which had been bolted on top of the
        original angle frcm which the support had been made. The height of the
        concrete terrace had been raised at some stage and this had nnwiMicrt the
        previous corrosion damage. The appearance of the concrete cores,
        extracted from near the support feet, was consistent with this
        observation.

4   INVESriGM TCN OF TURNSTHES AT TOR TEPPINGS LANE END

4.1 tti 25 April 1989 HSE staff made tests on turnstiles at the         tana
    end of the stadium to investigate how the application of a force to a
    'gate' affected the release of a turnstile. On 28 April 1989 tests Here
    made to assess the accuracy of the computerised system for counting and
    recording the admissions throucfi the turnstiles. Calculations were
    to ccopare the average admission requirements of turnstiles serving the
    designated zones of the stadium. Oounts of people passim through the
    turnstiles A to G were made frcm video recordings.
     THE EFFECT OF A HORIZONTAL PCRCE RUSHING OK THE 'GATE' OF A TURNSTILE
4.2 lUmstiles C to G appeared to be of the same pattern, whilst turnstiles A
    and B were of a different pattern. In the tests a known force measured by
    a load cell was applied to the 'gate' of the turnstile. Standard test
    weights were then placed gently on the pedal until the spindle was
    released. The tests shewed that turnstiles C to G were likely to be more
    difficult to release than turnstiles A and B.
4.3 A turnstile operator having a weight of 750 N (12 stone) or      mHght
    have difficulty in releasing turnstiles in the group C to G if a force of
    480 N (110 lbf) or more was applied to the 'gates'. The same operator
    might have difficulty in releasing turnstiles A and B if a force of 1340 N
    (300 lbf) or more was applied to the 'gates'.
     THE ACCURACY OF THE COMPUTERISED SYSTEM BCR COUNTING AND RECORDING
     ADMISSIONS

4.4 Turnstiles were checked by rotating the 'gate' a known nunfcer of timoe and
    then recording the count measured in the control room. Ttests of
    turnstiles in the group 9 to 16 indicated that they recorded the correct
    nunfcer of admissions.

4.5 Tests indicated that turnstiles A, B, C, D, E and F were likely to record
    the correct nunfcer of admissions, in my opinion turnstiles A to F, as a
    grcup, would indicate the correct nunfcer of admissions to within 1%.
4.6 Tests indicated that there could be a persistent error in the recorded
    nunfcer of admissions throucfri turnstile G. It is my opinion that t-hic
    turnstile might continuously register less them the correct number of
    admissions during a period of operation. It was concluded that the error
    was probably attributable to the roller of the roller-plunger micro-switch
    fitted to this turnstile only just making contact with the upper hn« of
    each 'gate'.

4.7 Additional detectors were installed across each turnstile passageway at
    positions above the gates. Examination of these devices indicated that
    sane appeared to be disconnected euid in some cases the wiring had been
    cut.

     * See paragraph 4.15

     Turnstiles A and B, D and E and F and G had cannon exits, and henoe the
     HSE and SWPC counts of these pairs of turnstiles have been oattoined.
4.15 Paragraph 4.6 of this report referred to a persistent error in the count
     obtained from turnstile G. This could result in no signed being sent to
     the catfxiter even though a person had passed thrcucpi the turnstile and
     oculd acocunt for the discrepancy between the HSE count of 2019 for F plus
     G and the SWPC count of 1632.

4.16 Based on the assumption that the SWPC ccnputer printout accurately
     recorded A to E and that the HSE count for F and G was lass than the
     ramtoer who actually passed thrcucpi F and G by a s i m il a r percentage to that
     obtained frcm A to E, the estimate for the total number of people that
     entered through turnstiles A to G is 7494. In my opinion the actual
     ramfcer is unlikely to have exceeded this value by more than 2%, i.e. 7644.
4.17 Ihe rate at which people were counted thrcu^i all the turnstiles is shown
     m Figure 4. The rate is for a 3 minute time period and shows the number
     of people per hour per turnstile. The rate increases rapidly at about
     1.40pm and remains fairly constant between 2.05pm and 2.50pm. The mean
     rate for this period was abcut 660 people per turnstile per hour. Between
     2.55pm and 3.00pm the rate increased and reached a maximum of about 1150
     people per turnstile per hour. This increased rate coincides with the
     time Gate C was opened and could therefore be a result of decreased crowd
     pressure allowing a faster flew through the turnstiles.
4.18 If the rate of 660 had been maintained frcm 2.50pm onwards and no gates
     had been opened I estimate that it would have taken until about 3.40pm to
     bring the total number of people admitted through turnstiles A to G to
     10,100. (Hie quoted capacity of the West Terrace standing area.)

* The number of spectators in the First Row was estimated frcm the plan area and
an assumed packing density of 10.0 spectators per square meter,       density has
been shewn to be the maximum achievable without undue discomfort in tests at HSE's
Sheffield laboratories and has been corroborated by crowd density measurements in
a selected area of the first row on photograph ER1/1QA.

7.6 Hie estimated total for Pen 3 of 1576 is about 55% greater than the value
    calculated frcm a packing density of 5.4 people per square metre.
7.7 An estimate of the packing density in Pen 2 was also made frcm photograph
    ER1/7A. The area selected showed an overall packing density of 5.0 nnrpio
    per square metre.

8 ESTIMATE OF POSSIRTF: NUMBERS OUTSIDE tor TEPPTTres IANE TORNS'TTTRg

8.1 I was asked to make estimates of the number of people which could have
    gathered outside the turnstiles at Leppings Lane but within the outer
    perimeter gates. The area between the Leppings Lane Bid turnstiles and
    the outer perimeter gates is illustrated in Figure 9. The Figure is based
    on Ralph Brade & Associates' Drawing No 1340/04. The area has been
    sub-divided into three separate areas (Area 1, Area 2 and Area 3) and the
    approximate area of each has been calculated by scaling frcm the Drawing.
8.2 The number of people that could stand in the areas has been cainiia^
    using a packing density of 8 people per square metre and also using 10
    people per square metre; the estimates are tabulated overleaf.

                             DRAFT OF PROPOSED SUMMARY OF AGREED FACTS



        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was formed in 1867 and elected to the
        Football League in 1S92, Sheffield Wednesday moved to their present ground at
        Hillsborough in 1899. Rubbish was tipped at either end of the pitch to form
        banking and a stand mcved from their previous ground was erected on the site of
        the present South Stand, This was replaced in 1913 by the exisitir.g South
        Stand, the Spion Kop being added in 1914, the North Stand in 1961 and the West
        Stand in 1965 following the decision to stage a number of World Cap games at
        the venue in 1966.

        Since 1912 30 FA Cup Semi-Finals, 19 International and 3 World Cup matches have
        been played at this venue. In addition the stadium has been used to stage
        religious meetings, a basketball display, world class tennis and schools
        display for the Queen in 1954. The record crowd for the ground is 72,841 in
        1934.

        Hillsborough Stadium was designated it. ;9?9 undsr the safety of Sports Grounds
        Act 19/5. Ar: inter-agency group known as the 'Officer Working P ar ty ’ was set
        up to monitor safety aspects of the stadium. They met twice annually or such
        shorter periods as were necessary. It was comprised of the following
        representatives <

        1.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
        2.   South Yorkshire Police
        3.   South Yorkshire County Fire Service
        4.   South Yorkshire County Council and later City of Sheffield
             Metropolitan District Council
        5.   Consultant Engineers (Eastwood and Partners).

        They would sometimes meet 'on site’ and discuss and approve alterations for
        example, the removal of barrier 144 from enclosure 3 (this has been referred to
        by many witnesses as Pen 3) in 1986.

        The Leppings Lane End of the Ground has been the focus of attention throughout
        the Inquiry. On 15 April 1989 this End was allocated to the Liverpool Football
        Club Supporters and in order to gain entry into the ground, whether it be to a
        seating or standing area, supporters first had to negotiate thf iron perimeter
        gates situated at the funnel entrance to the ground immediately before the
        turnstiles. These gates are set out in a bank of six d o u M e gates and are
        situated across the mouth of the entrance into the ground from Leppings Lane.
        They are made of wrought iron and painted blue.

        Having negotiated these gates the supporters would enter a courtyard. This
        area is shaped like a funnel between the outer perimeter gates and turnstiles 1
        to 16 and A - 0. In normal league matches access can also be given to
        turnstiles 19-22 and 23-28. This was not so on 15 April 1989.

        The courtyard is divided by a wall of metal construction running from the
        perimeter gates to the brick wall of turnstile 16. There is also a metal
        barrier running almost parallel to this From half way across the courtyard to
        the wall adjoining turnstile G. The effect of this is to divide the courtyard
        between the tw banks of turnstile 1 to 16 and A to G and create a funnel for
        people towards Lhe appropriate turnstiles depending on which part of the ground
        they wish to enter.

        The wall of metal construction was bull*: in 1985 to segregate home and away
        supporters. At abuat the same time proposals by Eastwood and Partners, which
        would have achieved enclosures having their own turnstile entrances and
        individual crowd capacities, were rejected by the Club.

           There are a total of 95 turnstiles at Hillsborough, 12 of which (Nos 77 - 88)
           were not in use for reasons of segregation on 15 April 1989. Nottingham Forest
           fans were allocated 60 and Liverpool the remaining 23 all from Leppings Lane.

           The 23 turnstiles in Leppings Lane contained in two sections 1 to 16 and A to
           G, are divided by the metal wall previously mentioned. They were designed in
           such a way that turnstiles 1 to 10 served the West side of the North Stand
           seated area, 11 to 16 the West Stand seated area and A to G the West Stand
           terraces. In actual fact turnfetiles 11 to 16 and A to G give access to the
           same concourse area at the rear of the West Stand. Confusion was caused by the
           turnstiles being signed from left to right A.C.B. The tickets given to
           supporters added to the confusion and the general layout once inside the iron
           perimeter gates caused congestion if a supporter needed to get from turnstiles
           A to G to 1 to 1(5 or vice versa.

           As a result if a supporter went, through the outer perimeter iron gates towards
           turnstiles A-G and found he needed turnstiles 1-16 he would have to return
           through the outer perimeter iron gates into Leppings Lane and then to the
           correct turnstile.

           Also in this area are three Exit Gates A, B and C. These Gates are large
           concertina type metal gates measuring 4.064 metres across and 2.184 metres
           high, except 'B' gate which is 3.2 metres high. They were built in 1985 during
           modifications to the turnstiles and concourse area. Both sides of the gates
           closed towards the centre and are operated from the inside only they were
           painted blue and were capable of being locked and bolted. In each pair of
           gates one was fitted with a non-opening glass observation panel at about eye
           l ev el .

           Looking from Leppings Lane Gate *A* is situated to the left of turnstile 1 and
           adjoins the outer perimeter wall of the ground running parallel to Vere Road.
           Gate ’B ’ i$ at the end of the metal wall across the courtyard and between
           turnstiles 16 and A. Gate 'C’ is located to the right In the wall running
           parallel with the River Don beyond turnstiles A to G.

           Emergency Gate *E’ is a small concertina type gate opening from inside only and
           located in the wall running parallel with the River Don, immediately before it
           joins the side of the South Stand and behind the Police Control Box.

           Beyond the turnstiles and behind the West Stand is a concourse area which is
           divided into three sections. Each of these sections serves a different part o£
           the West and North Stands and the West Terraces. The three sections are
           created by a metal fence and a brick wall. There was no access from the
           central concourse through the metal fence to the North Stand section but a
           gate in the brick wall did give access throughout the standing terrace
           concourse area.

           Entrance through turnstiles 1-10 would only give access to the North concourse
           area and thus the seated North Stand.

           There were a total of six portacabins on the concourse at the rear of the West
           Stand. Of these, two serviced the turnstiles in the northern part of the
           concourse at the rear of turnstiles 11-16. The portacabins were variously used
           for selling programmes or souvenirs and in one case by the Police to store
           property seized from supporters. One of these portacabins was positioned
           behind gate ’B ’ near to the brick wall giving access throughout the stand
           terrace concourse area.

           Having entered through one of the turnstiles A to G and on the southern part of
           the concourse, supporters could either go to their left through the gate in the
           wall and into the central concourse area giving access into enclosures 6 and 7
           or up to the West Stand seating area; straight ahead into the tunnel and
           enclosure 3 and 4,* or round to the right and either up another access into the
           seated area or alongside the West Stand into enclosure 1 and 2.

               That explained, the main sign for the standing areas, measuring 2.591 metres x
               .305 metres was immediately above the entrance to the tunnel and comprised of
               the word ‘STANDING* in .18 metres letter painted in blue on a white
               background. Positioned on both sides of this sign were the letters B + A
               respectively. In the normal course of events, following letter ’B ’ would take
               supporters along the left hand side of the tunnel and into enclosure 4.
               Likewise following the letter ’A ’ would take supporters up the right hand side
               of the tunnel and into enclosure 3.

               The only other sign on this concourse section indicating a standing area was a
               small one at a height of 3.658 metres in letters ,09 metres high on a concrete
               pillar to the right supporting the West Stand. This directs supporters along
               the side of the Stand and into enclosures 1 and 2. No signs existed on this
               part of the concourse to indicate that access to standing areas in enclosures 6
               and 7 could be reached by going to the left through the gate in the wall.

               The tunnel is 22,17 metres long and unlit. It is located under the seating
               atea of the West Stand and is used primarily by supporters entering through
               turnstiles A to G, Rising at first it then levels off briefly before
               descending towards the terrace's on a gradient of around 1 in 6.
               The recommended gradient from the Green Guide is 1 in 1 0 . The tunnel was of
               course built prior to the introduction of this Guide.

               As the tunnel opens out on to the terrace a radial fence divides enclosure 3
               and 4. Enclosure 3 is on the right and enclosure 4 on the left as you enter.
               Short walls on either side extend out into the enclosures. There are gates at
               the tunnel concourse entrance capable of being closed. In addition it is
               possible to close off each enclosure (3 and 4) by a gate to each at the
               enclosure end of the tunnel.

               At the rear of the terraces and where the radial fences finish are gates which
               provide access to those persons wishing to walk along the terraces. Thus there
               is unrestricted access to each enclosure if these gates are left open. Anyone
               entering enclosures 3 and 4 and wishing to then enter enclosures 2 or 5 would
               in effect have to take a couple of paces backwards to the rear of the pen and
               walk alongside the real wall.

               Running parallel to the goal line across the front of the West Stand seated
               area, are the terraces with a total of 7 enclosures, numbered by their gates
               from left to right as you look at them from the pitch, i.e. enclosure 1 is in
               the South West Corner, immediately under the Police Control box and enclosure 7
               is in the North West Corner. Both corners are banked higher than the rest of
               the terracing, with enclosure 5 being a sterile area or void, unused by
               spectators. The terracing gradient has been identified ss between 1 in 4 and 1
               in 4.5. on the West Terraces.

               There are 3 rows of barriers on the terraces in enclosures 3 and 4 running
               parellel with the goal line. The barriers are of two designs; those fitted by
               Husband and Co., the previous engineers, and those fitted by Eastwood and
               Partners the current engineers. In 1986 barrier 144 was removed from enclosure
               3 to facilitate easier crowd movements. This has been the only significant
               change in barrier configuration on the Leppings Lane terraces.

               Perimeter fencing was installed in 1977. At the front of the terrace this
               fence is 2.896 metres high, comprising of heavy gage metal wire supported at
               intervals by metal posts set in concrete which in turn are supported on the
               pitch side by metal frames, At the top of each of these fences .381 metres of
               wire folds inwards. This is designed to make it harder for fans to climb over
               the fence onto the perimeter track or the pitch, The wire is welded to the
               metal supports for strength and rigidity.

           In each of the enclosures there is a numbered gate to the perimeter track which
           is primarily designed for access to the enclosure in an emergency. Eastwood
           and Partners have measured the width of Gate 3 as 0.85 metres and Gate 4 as
           0.83 metres between the gate posts. These gates are smaller than the Green
           Guide recommendation (1.1m) but they were constructed before this minimal width
           was suggested.

           Originally the West Terrace was completely open. Radial fencing between the
           perimeter fence and wall of the West stand, and which created three large
           enclosures, was installed in 1981. Further radial fencing was added in 1985
           dividing the large centre enclosures into what are now enclosures 3, 4 and the
           void enclosure 5. This radial fencing is 1.68 metres high and comprises of
           blue painted metal bars and was erected at the request of the Police to
           facilitate crowd control. This was agreed by the Officer Working Party.
           Enclosure 1 and 2 and 6 and 7, are not further subdivided by radial fences. In
           fact they are still the large enclosures as orginally created in 1981.

           Schedule 2, Paragraph 3, of the Safety certificate specifies the number of
           spectators admitted to the stadium. Part 1 of Schedule 3 details the number of
           spectators permitted in various section of the ground, a figure which should
           not be exceeded. The relevant capacities ares-
                               West terrace         7,200
                               North West terrace   2,900
           In late 1989 some 6 months after the disaster it was discovered that the
           capacity for the North West Terrace was wrong having been calculated with the
           wrong scale. The result was that 2,900 was excessive. The revised figure is
           now 1,500. The figure is based on an amended Certificate issued by Sheffield
           City Council on the 24 November 1989.

           In 1981 when the first radial fences were installed on the terraces, creating
           the 3 large enclosures a crowd capacity of 2,200 was declared for the centre
           enclosure by Dr EASTWOOD based on calculations in the 1976 Green Guide. When
           this large enclosures was divided in 1985 into enclosures 3 and 4 and the void
           5, Eastwood and Partners split the capacities as followst- 1,200 into enclosure
           3 and 1,000 for enclosure 4. These figures were included on a plan of
           Eastwoods but the author of the figures has not been identifed. These new
           capacities were never referred, it seems, to the Council or the Club in order
           that the Safety Certificate could be amended.    Inany event the ability to
           restrict those enclosures to those capacities was not possible with the
           turnstile system in operation,

           It also appears that despite the introduction of these additional radial fences
           which created the void enclosure 5, no amendment was considered to the overall
           capacity of the West Terrace even though the barrier configuration remained the
           same (until 1986).

           Access to the West Stand which is all seating is by way of turnstiles 11 to 16
           and A to G, using the staircases off the concourse. The front of the West
           Stand overlooks the terraces, giving seated spectators a view of the terraces.
           The West Stand is divided by gangways for safety purposes. At the rear of the
           West Stand is a refreshment kiosk.

           The Police Control Box is situated in an elevated position in the South West
           Corner of the ground overlooking the Leppings Lane Terraces, a distance of 35
           meters from gate 3 and 47.5 meters from Gate 4. The control Box houses the
           Police Communications System and Video Monitors for the five fully remote
           controlled cameras which are operated from this location. There is also a
           facility for the Police to over-ride the ground tannoy system usually operated
           by the disc jockey.

           A Club Control Room is situated on the ground floor    at the rear    of the South
           Stand, close to the players changing rooms.

           There is no view of the pitch from this room. The occupants monitor the entry
           through the turnstiles around the ground, with a computer supplying ’print
           o uts’ for the ground management purposes. The room also contains the TV
           monitors from the various cameras located at turnstiles around the ground.
           Recordings are made on a bank of 16 video recorders. There is an ability to
           monitor any one of the five C.C.T.V.s being operated  by the Police from their
           control box on request to them. A telephone connects the Police Control to the
           Club Control Room.

           In addition this Club Control room, acts as the main base station for the Club
           personal radio scheme.   This rpdio system is used by Senior Stewards, Security
           Officers and Management on a talk-through basis.

           The Director's Box is centrally situated overlooking the pitch in the upper
           tier of the South Stand. There is access to the board room, the office complex
           below, the Nostalgia Bar and Steps Restaurant to the rear of the South Stand.

           The current tannoy public address system was upgraded in 1988 and broadcasts to
           locations in and around the ground, including the Leppings Lane turnstiles.
           Capable of being directed selectively to areas of the ground the system is
           operated from the South Stand near to the Police Control Box, by a Disc Jockey
           employed by the Club. Normally used for Club announcements and musical
           entertainment, the system can be over-ridden by the Police from their Ground
           Control Box.

           Situated to the right of the Police Control Box, when looking from the pitch
           above the Finlux TV and video sign is an electronic clock. A board is also
           located there being capable of displaying messages.

           The Police Room is located under the North Stand adjacent to the First Aid
           Room. It is used as the detention and documentation room for persons arrested
           or being ejected from the ground,

           A first Aid Room is required under Schedule 2, Paragraph 8(1) of the Safety
           Certificate. This room, which was upgraded in 1979, is manned by the St John
           Ambulance Brigade personnel during matches. St. John Ambulance Staff advise
           the Club on the purchase of equipment for the room which is located on the
           ground floor at the rear of the North Stand alongside the Police room. A
           gymnasium is situated at the rear of the North Stand.

           A purpose built commentary box is located above the South S ta nd .

           As previously mentioned, the Club have staged many large scale functions at
           Hillsborough. These can give some indication of the level of their experience
           and that of the other agencies involved. That said, during the course of
           enquiries in connection with the disaster evidence has emerged of crushing
           involving supporters in the West Stand terracing at previous F .A . Cup Semi
           Finals.

           The Semi-Finals concerned are 1956, 1981, 1987 and 1988.

           In 1956 a match was played between Birmingham City and Sunderland and took
           place on 17 March 1956, where a surge of people caused crushing on the West
           Stand terracing.

           On 11 April 1981 a Semi-Final toas held between Tottenham Hotspur and
           Wolverhampton Wanderers, This is the best document and the most serious of the
           previous incidents. Tottenham fans arrived late due to a combination of
           difficulties on the Ml Motorway and local diversions. There was crushing on
           the Leppings Lane terraces and during this match.

           The Police and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club held discussions following
           this incident and the evidence points to the later implementation of the radial
           fences forming initially five large enclosures (the centre enclosure being
           later divided into enclosures 3,4 and 5), being the action taken to prevent a
           similar incident.

           On 12 April 1987, a Semi Final between Leeds United and Coventry City was
           played, Evidence from one supporter suggests there was overcrowding on the
           Leppings Lane terraces.

           In 1988 the Semi Final took place between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.
           Evidence obtained suggested crushing occurred on the Leppings Lane terraces.
           There is no evidence, however, to show the 1987 or 1988 incidents were brought
           to the notice of the Police or Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

           The Hillsborough Football Stadium was designated under the provisions of the
           Safety at Sports Ground Act 1975, on 1 January 1979, the safety Certificate for
           Hillsborough was issued by South Yorkshire County Councul on 21 December 1979,
           on Sheffield Wednesday Football C l u b ’s promotion to the Second Division.
           Attached to the Certificate are a number of schedules. Schedule 1 deals with
           Interpretation; Schedule 2, the General Terms and Conditions! and Schedule 3,
           Crowd Capacity and Safety Stewards.

           South Yorkshire County Council, as the issuing authority, was responsible for
           the administration and supervision of the certificate until their demise in
           1986 when reponsibility was transferred to Sheffield City Council. The Officer
           Working Party, now called the Sheffield City Council Safety at Sports Grounds
           Advisory Group, at the time of this disaster comprised of representatives from
           Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Eastwood and
           Partners, South Yorkshire Police, South Yorkshire Fire Brigade and South
           Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

           At the time the County Council transferred responsibilty for licensing to the
           City Council, there was a prepared schedule of responsibilities under the
           Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 in existence. This document showed the
           responsibilities of the County, Police, Fire Brigade and Building Control
           Authority. According to correspondence this echeduule was adopted by the City
           Council which meant they then assumed the former County and Building Control
           functions.

           In July 1987, these responsibilities were re-drawn by the City Council in draft
           form in a document entitled 'Division of Responsibilities between Authorities',
           which proposed responsibilities being divided between the Building Surveyors
           (Department of Land and Planning) and the Director of Environmental Health and
           Consumer Services.

                                DRAFT OF PROPOSED SUMMARY OF AGREED FACTS


           The present road network from Liverpool to Sheffield, has a motorway road
           system around Manchester, which now provides a complete bypass to the south of
           the City which was incomplete on 15 April 1989. At that time the M63 finished
           at Fortwood roundabout, to the east of Stockport at the 'junction with the
           A560. The final part of the M63 providing the last link to the M67 at Denton
           was not opened until 28 April 1989.

           The recommended route published in the Liverpool Programme advised supporters
            o follow the M62 east out of Liverpool, north of Manchester, across the
           Fennines to Junction 42 of the Ml, It was then suggested that they travel
           south on the Ml, leaving at Junction 35 for Sheffield. Supporters who followed
           that route did not report any great delays.

           It is clear that many Liverpool supporters chose to follow the M62 or M56 east
           of Liverpool, then joining the M63 to the west or south of Manchester. This
           motorway terminated to the east of Stockport and supporters were then required
.A         to follow the A560 to Mottram in Longdendale, where they could join the A57
           over Snake Pass to Sheffield. Supporters who chose this route were the ones
           subjected to long delays. However, some of the accuracy of this evidence h s 9
           to be viewed in the context that many people are confused as to their correct
           location when they were delayed and also, they were frustrated by the hold-ups
           and may have understandably felt the period of the delay to be longer than it
           actually was.

           M62, WEST OF JUNCTION 15 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY

           At 1106 hours a damage only road traffic accident occurred between a motor
           cycle and a saloon car. The motorway, which at this point has four lanes, was
           reduced by two lanes for only about 15 minutes. No reports of serious delays.
           M62 JUNCTION 15 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY

           Between 0830 and 1345 hours, the   three lane motorway at this point was reduced
           by one lane, due to a third lane   closure for essential central barrier
           renovation. During the closure,    traffic was flowing slowly through the road
           works and was only delayed for a   maximum of 10 minutes.

           M62 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 21 & 22 BOTH CARRIAGEWAYS

           Contraflow, two lanes in each direction.    Long term work relating to widening
           scheme. No serious delays reported.

           M63 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 2 & 3 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY

           The three lane motorway at this point was reduced by one lane    todirect   traffic
           into a suitable configuration for approaching contraflow,

           M63 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 3 & 6 BOTH CARRIAGEWAYS

           Contraflow, two lanes in each direction. Long term work relating to widening
           scheme. Long delays reported by supporters and coach drivers.

           M63 END OF MOTORWAY PORTWOOD ROUNDABOUT

           At that time the motorway terminated at a roundabout, at the junction with the
           A560. Heavy congestion reported due to volume of traffic. This delay varies
           between a 1/2 hour and 1 hour 10 minutes between 1215 and 1325 hours.

           M 6 7 END OF MOTORWAY MOTTRAM IN LONGENDALE

           This is a traffic bottleneck caused purely by the combination of a heavy volume
           of traffic and the road layout. At this location the motorway terminated into
           a single lane carriageway, close to a crossroads controlled by traffic lights
           in a small village centre. The A560, which carried traffic from the M63, joins
           the M67 at a rounabout at the terminus of the motorway, just prior to this
           point and this further contributes to the bottleneck.

           As far as can be ascertained some 102 coaches containing Liverpool supporters
           travelled to Sheffield on 15 April 1989.

           To evaluate the number of supporter who travelled to the ground in mini buses
           and using their private vehicles is difficult, but all available parking within
           a radius of approximately 1 1/2 miles from the ground was utilised.

           Clearly the greater number of supporters travelled to the ground in this manner
           ana although traffic volume was heavy on all approach routes, traffic delays
           were not a significant factor in the late arrival of fans.

           A Map showing various routes from Liverpool to Sheffield and identifying
           trouble spots is produced,

           RAIL TRANSPORT

           Two British Rail Stations were used for the transport of supporters, the
           Midland and Wadsley Bridge. The former was used for both Liverpool'and
           Nottingham Forest supporters and the latter for Liverpool supporters only. One
           special train and three service trains from Liverpool conveyed a total of 825
           supporters, 430 to Wadsley Bridge, with service trains from other areas
           bringing this to a total of 1,337.

           LICENSED PREMISES

           Premises selling alcohol in and around the Sheffield area were identified and
           sub-divided into full On Licences, that is public houses, and Off licences,
           which includes shops and supermarkets. The general opening hours for licensed
           premises on this date were for public houses 11 am to 11 pm and off licences 8
           am to 11 pm.

            193 Public houses were visited in an attempt to identify those frequented by
           Liverpool supporters on Saturday, 15 april 1989, These can be graded as
            follows;-
            10 Public Houses remained closed on this date.
            72 Public Houses were frequented by local persons only.
           37 Public Houses reported having less than 20 Liverpool supporters.
           ;51 Public Houses reported having in excess of 20 Liverpool supporters.
           23 Public Houses reported having in excess of 100 Liverpool supporters.

           Seventy-four off licenses were identified as open, These were also visited and
           enquiries show that some of thoses closer to the ground were particularly busy
           prior to the kick off. It is not possible to quantify this further.

           POLICE ARRANGEMENTS

           A comparison of the South Yorkshire Police orders for the Cup Semi Finals 1988
           and 1989 has been made.

           ThiB reveals that the 1989 order was basically a repetition of the 1988 order,
           although there was a reduction in manpower in some areas.' Details are as

           An Inspector in charge of Serials 14 and 15, comprising 2 Sergeants and 20
           Constables, was posted to the concourse area behind the West Stand, one serial
           to the North and one South in Phase 1 (before kick off). There were no
           officers specifically posted to the central tunnel during this phase. In Phase
           Z (after kick off) Serials 14 and 17 should have taken up a position in the
           central tunnel but it appears they were overtaken by events.

           Initially there were 5 mounted officers posted to Leppings Lane area. At 1415
           hours approximately this was increased by the arrival of a further 8 mounted
           officers who had escorted Liverpool fans from Wadsley Bridge Railway Station,
           These can be sub-divided into 4 from South Yorkshire Police and 8 from
           Merseyside Police and i from the Nottinghamshire Constabulary. Between 1440
           and 1452 hours this was supplemented by an additional 8 mounted officers, 3

  Arrangements for dealing with Dead Bodies
  resulting from a Major Incident

  GENERAL PRINCIPLES

  Dealing with fatalities is a second priority to be considered after the protection and preser­
  vation of the living. If it is practicable, it is in the interests of proper investigation and
  identification that dead bodies and parts should be disturbed as little as possible in the
  first stage of attending to the incident. This is especially important when the incident is an
  air crash. Whatever the incident much time and trouble can be saved if all matters relating
  to the dead are dealt with methodically and carefully. H.M. Coroner and his staff are respon­
  sible for dealing with the dead and everything possible should be done to enable them to
  carry out their tasks as normally as possible, in accordance with the usual procedures. They
  have been asked to contact Force Control should they require any type of assistance.

  H.M .CORONER

 Where a major incident occurs involving a large number of victims the Coroner for the area
 and his staff will be informed by Force Control as soon as possible. A list of personnel to be
 called is maintained at Force Control.

 The Coroner will inform Force Control as to what premises he intends to use and if necessary
 will send a representative to liaise with the police commander at the site of the incident.

 TEMPORARY MORTUARY ARRANGEMENTS

 There is no need for the police to obtain the approval of the Coroner regarding arrangements
 for the temporary accorjlanodation of bodies at the site. Should it be necessary to set up
 temporary mortuary accommodation of a more permanent nature consultation will take place
 with the Coroner for the necessary arrangements to be made.
 It is essential that premis&s used as temporaiy mortuaries should have good access from the
 road and ideally should be such as to enable a vehicle to be driven into the building and
 away from public view. A'telephone is essential but if necessary a telephone can be quickly
installed by arrangement through Force Control. Emergency lighting can be arranged by
 reference to Part Two of the Major Incident Scheme.
 It is important that a 'waiting area’ should exist, with telephone, toilet facilities, etc., separate,
 but not too distant from t f e mortuary. It is to this area that relatives will be directed. Members
 of the public will not be directed to, nor permitted to attend at temporary mortuaries.
As far as possible, tempo|ary mortuaries and premises used for post mortems, etc., will be
staffed by members of H.%1. Coroners' Departments, supported by additional personnel as
necessary. Arrangements for personnel to staff mortuaries will be done through Force
Control. Mortuary personnel will be responsible for searching and preparing bodies, docu­
mentation, etc. Stocks of identification forms, casualty record forms, etc., are kept at H.M.
Coroners' offices.

Supplies of clothing and equipment suitable for use in connection with temporary mortuaries
are held at all Cororters' offices in the area. Supplies of rubber gloves, sheeting, coffins, etc.,
can be obtained in the manner set out in Part Two of the Major Incident Scheme.
Separate instructions for personnel working at mortuaries have been prepared and copies
are available at all Coroners' offices in South Yorkshire.

UNDERTAKERS

It will be the responsibility of Force Control, to arrange for undertakers to assist in the
transport of bodies from the site to mortuary accommodation, should such service be
appropriate. It is desirable that bodies should be accompanied by a police officer, but
circumstances may make this impossible.
The Coroner may request Force Control to arrange for the assistance of undertakers to
provide accommodation, personnel or transport.
                                                                         Section 2V
                                                                                            Page 2

 J . H. Kenyon Ltd. are a firm of international undertakers able to attend the scene of a major
 incident in less than four hours. Further information concerning this firm is given at Appendix
 'A'. In consultation with H.M. Coroners and the police, the Firm will deal with all matters
 relating to the dead, including the removal of bodies, identification, the return of property to
 relatives, funeral arrangements, etc. The firm is retained by all the large civil aviation com­
 panies and will deal with all air disasters involving those companies. Clearly the firm's
 expertise would be invaluable in dealing with any type of incident where there are particular
 difficulties or the number of fatalities is large.
 H.M. Coroners for South Yorkshire have agreed that the police should call upon the services
 of this firm if the circumstances of the incident justify this course. In the event of such a major
 incident occurring the officer in charge of Force Control, after consulting with the Site
 Commander will be responsible for asking the firm to attend. It must be stressed that H.M.
 Coroner or his representative must be consulted before this action is taken unless undue delay
 is likely to be occasioned. In cases of doubt, however, J. H. Kenyon Ltd. should be called
 even without prior consent from H.M. Coroner, since the firm have stated that they will
 attend a major incident even though their services may ultimately not be used and that
 having arrived they will consult with the Coroner prior to taking any action.


 LABELLING OF BODIES AT SITE
 Bodies and parts of bodies should not be removed without first being labelled and the
 position in which the body was found being marked. Photographs will be taken. Every body
 and every part will have a separate label.
 It is extremely important that only ONE person should be charged with the responsibility
 of allocating numbers to bodies, although the labelling, marking of location, dispatching,
 etc., will be done by a team using the specialist disposable clothing contained in the major
 incident boxes. The person allocating numbers will maintain a record of every body which is
 labelled, showing details of its condition and position at the site and the place to which it is
 taken. Contained in the major incident boxes is a 'Body Book' designed for this purpose.
 Body labels are contained in all major incident boxes and should be fixed as securely as
 possible to the body or part. If practicable the number should be marked on the body using
 indelible crayon.
 The location where the body lay should be marked with a stake or other suitable object and
 the stake labelled using the same reference number as the body.


 PERSONAL ITEM S FOUND W IT H BODY AT THE SITE
 Bodies should not be searched. It may be feasible to enwrap the body completely in plastic
*sheeting or in a plastic bag or place it in a coffin before removal and thus keep all personal
 items and effects together with the body to which they belong.
 An item of personal property (e.g. a handbag) found lying near a body, should not be
 assumed to belong to that body. Such property should be secured in a bag labelled 'Found
 near body labelled................. '. This property will go with the body.
 Larger items of property such as luggage will not go with the body but after labelling will be
 dealt with as detained property (see instruction card 'Lost and Found Property Office'.)


 DOCUMENTATION OF BODIES FOUND AT THE SITE
All bodies and parts of bodies should be labelled as set out above. All bodies should be made
the subject of a 'casualty record form’, books of which are contained in the major incident
boxes. This applies to bodies which are incomplete but does not apply to parts. In cases of
doubt a 'casualty record form' should be completed. As far as possible a 'casualty record
form' should be completed at the mortuary accommodation as the body is being dealt with
there. Property and effects may give valuable information as to identity.
Where circumstances indicate that it is desirable to complete a 'casualty record form' before
a body is removed to mortuary accommodation this should be done but the body should not
be searched. All 'casualty record forms' should include the body label number and any other
reference to the body.
                                                                                        *L J
                                                                                      Page 3

REMOVAL OF BODIES IFROM SITE TO MORTUARY ACCOMMODATION
When it is necessary to move bodies from the site, they will be taken to the local mortuary
or to a temporary mortuary. Where possible bodies should be accompanied by a police officer
but circumstances may make this impossible.
At the request of the Site Commander, Force Control will make the necessary arrangements
for transport to be used to move bodies.
Coroners have made arrangements with local undertakers for them to stand by in the event
of emergency.
Before a body is allowed to be removed from the site, a check will be made to ensure that
sufficient accommodation is available at the place to which it is being sent..

DOCUMENTATION OF BODIES AT HOSPITALS
Where a person is involved in a major incident and is removed to hospital but subsequently
dies, it is anticipated that the body will be lodged at the hospital mortuary from whence it
will be removed only on the direction of H.M. Coroner.
It is important for purposes of identification that all clothing and property accompanying the
body should be retained with it. The police officer acting as liaison with the hospital should
point this out to the staff and will complete a 'casualty record form' for every such body.
The form should include all hospital, ambulance and other references.

SPECIAL MORTUARY ARRANGEMENTS
Where large numbers of bodies are involved, or where investigation or identification is likely
to be difficult or protracted, it may be that the refrigerated accommodation which is normally
available at mortuaries, hospitals or undertakers establishments is insufficient. The Coroner
will make whatever arrangements are necessary regarding such accommodation and preser­
vation.

                                                                                A P P E N D IX 'A '

Arrangements for dealing with the Dead
J. H. KENYON LIM ITE D , FUNERAL DIRECTORS
This Company, who act on behalf of all major British Airlines and several foreign Airlines,
have proved to be invaluable at the scene of major air disasters. They work closely with the
pathological team, and their wide experience dating from the R38 airship disaster has enabled
them to perfect their procedures.
The Company is based at 45 Edgeware Road, London W2. Telephone number 01 -723-3277.
Telex number 265846.
They will arrive quickly at the scene with a field team, having been informed by the airline
involved, and should have with them a written authority to act on behalf of the airline to deal
with funeral arrangements and with any property handed over to them. The field team
normally consists of five members, but where the total number of casualties exceeds fifty
an additional two members are attached.
Amongst the major problems facing Police at the scene of an air disaster are those related to
property, identification, and the disposal of the bodies. Kenyon's procedure is divided into
five main operations :
1     Recovery of the remains;
2     Identification;
3     Arrangements for disposal;
4     Removal to the place of disposal, and finally disposal by burial orcremation;
5     Recovery, renovation, cleaning and identification of personal and other effects.
So far as the recovery of the remains is concerned, Kenyon's are well aware that this will
normally be carried out by the local Police and Ambulance Services who will remove bodies
to a mortuary, but they stress that every effort should be made to prevent personal effects and
clothing being moved from the bodies prior to the arrival of the investigation team. Kenyon's
staff are aware that permission must be obtained from the local Coroner and the Police before
any examination can be carried out.


IDENTIFICATION OF THE REMAINS
Much distress can be caused to relatives by delay in the identification of the bodies of the
victims, particularly where bodies are badly mutilated, and in nearly all cases, even if relatives
are available to view the remains, it is undesirable. However, relatives and friends who do
travel to the site will be dealt with very tactfully by Kenyon's field team, who base their
identification on the following:
(*)    Dental ;
w      Documents;
(c)    Clothing ;
(d)    Jewellery;
(e)    Physical;
if)    Photographs;
(g)    Fingerprints.


ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF THE REMAINS
Although Kenyon's are primarily Funeral Directors, they will make arrangements with
relatives who wish to use their own Funeral Directors, but as a first step 150 metallic lined
coffins are always held in readiness by Kenyon's in London and Birmingham for immediate
despatch to the scene of the accident.


r e m o v a l t o t h e p l a c e o f d is p o s a l

This is dealt with entirely by Kenyon's after a meeting with the local Coroner.
                                                                       Section 27
                                                                                APPENDIX'A*
                                                                                      Page 2

r e c o v e r y , r e n o v a t io n , c l e a n in g a n d id e n t if ic a t io n of
personal and other effects

Before leaving the scene of operations, Kenyon's obtain possession of all personal effects
removed from the bodies, or salvaged from the wreckage, where this is property of a non-
contentious nature. (Not-contentious in the sense that matters related to H.M. Customs or
suspected crimes do not arise.) This relieves the Police of the task of retaining and disposing
of property, and dealing with the heavy volume of correspondence in connection with the
same.
In the matter of identification, Kenyon's field team quite often know the pathologists con­
cerned, and the field team are equipped with forms which assist in obtaining medical or
dental evidence. It is advisable at an early stage to have a meeting between the Police
Officer in charge of the incident, a member of Kenyon's field team, the pathologist, and H.M.
Coroner, in order that arrangements for the disposal of the remains can be made.
From the foregoing it will be seen that the arrival of the Company at the scene of an air
disaster, to act on behalf of the affected Airline, can result in the relieving of the Police from
many otherwise burdensome tasks. However, it must be stressed that this does not remove
from the Police the task of making initial arrangements relating to the safeguarding, labelling
and preservation of bodies and property, providing temporary mortuaries, and having
available property lists for H.M. Customs and Excise.
It is advisable to have a Police Officer of supervisory rank available to liaise with Kenyon's
representative throughout the incident. Kenyon’s are well aware of the need to maintain a
close and friendly relationship with the local Medical/Legal and Police Authorities and
naturally they will require advice in localities where they have not previously worked.

                NOTTINGHAM UNIVERSITY, 9TH APRIL                      1989



THE r o l e o f t h e p o l i c e   in   emergency   procedures


     The intention is to split this presentation into four parts.  The
first will define a major incident, speak briefly of the history of an
Association of Chief Police Officers' Working Party and its progress to
date.

        The second will mention police responsibilities and address five
police operational phases.

     The third will look at the Police Casualty Bureau and finally I
will attempt to concentrate on those aspects of our work which are
carried out on your behalf.  Firstly then the definition of a major
inc id e n t.

DEFINITION AND WORKING PARTY HISTORY

     I am sure there are some policeman and certainly some lawyers w ^°
may or may not be Coroners who as a matter  of course would quarrel with
the definition, but suffice it to say that is the one we have used.
(Appendix 1).    You will see that we have in mind a large incident,
one which is likely to require us to have a standardisation of
terminology, procedures, documentation, for this will be essentia    1

 we are to cope with:-

         (a)      Mutual Aid

         (b)     A cross-border            incident.

         (c)     The process -of          comparison in order     to maximise etficiency
                  and further»Xearning.

      I would point out at this stage that whatever the legal     ^
 professional responsibility of others is and however crucial their ro e
 in a major incident their effectiveness is largely -determined by the
 degree of order or control at the scene, at its approaches or in the
 =rp* surrounding.  System must be brought out of chaos.   No one
 organisation can achieve this in isolation and the police role is to
  liaise, co-ordinate and control.

       Some two years ago the Association of Chief Police Officers rormed
  a working party which was given the brief that they s h o u l d attempt to
  find the best practice, look at new procedures and then publicise botn
  for the benefit of the remainder of the service in this country.

       In spite of the history of the last few years exp e r ie n c e _is in
  fact in short supply.   (Few deal with more than one major incident and
  the nature of each is likely to be very different.)   The working party
  has recognised that anything it attempts must not be seen as a panacea.
  It cannot be specific to all types of incident and suitable for a
  locations.   Its text is therefore generic rather than detailed,
  is the advice from which local contingencies can be prepared.
                                                                                  1

POLICE RESPONSIBILITIES

     The text, however, has particularly addressed a number of issues.

1.   Liaison                                 -   with other emergency services,
                                                 official bodies, voluntary
                                                 organisations.

2.   Administration and Management

3.   Specific Police Tasks                       In this section particular
     (Appendix 2)                                advice is given in some
                                                 detail on log or record
                                                 keeping, co-ordination, scene
                                                 preservation, investigation
                                                 (in liaison where
                                                 applicable), collation and
                                                 dissemination of casualty
                                                 details, property care and
                                                 the efficient management of
                                                 police staff.  Perhaps
                                                 you will notice that I have
                                                 not mentioned your specific
                                                 role, it is included in the
                                                 text I will return to it in
                                                 more detail later.

 ■IVE OPERATIONAL PHASES

     These are:-

                   1.   Occurrence
                   2.   Rescue
                   3.   Recovery
                   4.   Evacuation
                   5.   Investigation

      Firstly, I would point out that the occurrence phase in itself may
 be very short in terms of time and it is likely to have been completed
 by the time the emergency services arrive.  Nevertheless advice is
 given for the first arrivals at the scene in respect of their role on
 communication, assessment, alerting of others, and the need to
 constantly review.

      As indicated earlier I will not go into detail in respect of the
 rescue phase but suffice it to say that there is a caveat which reminds
 those involved in rescue work that continuity of evidence is important,
 and that some injured may subsequently die.  Advice is also given in
 respect of rescue from nuclear and chemical incidents.
                                          -   3   -




     In the recovery phase there are two initial basic guides, (a) the
body should not be moved unless to affect rescue, and (b) that death
cannot be presumed but must be certified.   Again, there is advice that
the police incident commander should bear in mind that there may be a
need for them to be seen in situ by (a) the Coroner, (b) a supervising
pathologist, and (c) the investigator.

     Subsequently great emphasis is continuing to be placed upon the
need for scene search, systematic recovery and documentation, and this
includes advice in respect of labelling, photographing of scene and the
making of an accurate plan.

     Again I emphasise that this advice is general and allows for
individual forces or areas to develop then own recovery systems.  It is
known that one contingency plan specifically mentions the probability
of body removal by underground train and others talk of possibly using
helic o p t e r s .

Evacuation

     This is not seen as the primary responsibility for the Police
Service, it may be an area for the involvement of the County Emergency
Planning Officers and the Local Authority but clearly there will have
to be a high level of police involvement in terms of arranging traffic
flow and possibly security of the area evacuated.

     I do not intend to go into details of investigation in the course
of this lecture for time does not allow but listing three reasons for
an investigation and three possible locations might assist the focus.

         (])          Identification      - Inquest
         (2)          Crime (Terrorism)   - Criminal Court
         (3)          Public Enquiry

POLICE CASUALTY BUREAU

A Problem

     The first problem of a Casualty Bureau is one of definition.
Most know the police open one after a Major Incident but what does it
 do ?

 A Definition

      I produce for you a visual aid which gives you some indication of
 the functions it performs (Appendix 3).  You will then see that only
 one part of it deals with the enquiries from the public, that part in^
 effect acts as a sponge soaking up the information, it does not give it
 out.  As you look at the other sources of information you will see that
 the Casualty Bureau itself receives data from a number of sources, the
 role is to match the information received from those sources with that
 of the enquiring member of the public and thus once having achieved a
 match or potential match, communicate it with the relevant person or
 a u t h or i t y .
                              -   4   -

     Following the Zebrugge incident a Police Casualty Bureau was
established by the Kent Police in their Headquarters in Maidstone, in
the first three days they received 10,619 enquiries, and at the peak
these numbered 380 per hour.  The result was that the businesses of
Maidstone, together with its private citizens found they were virtually
unable to make outgoing telephone calls as the result of the pressure
on the telephone system.  Other major incidents have resulted in a
similar pattern.  Currently each police force has a facility to open a
Casualty Bureau.

      Obviously with this amount of data flowing through a system there
must be a potential for computerisation, McDonnell Douglas in
collaboration with one of its associates produced a package for
Casualty Bureau work known as CRISIS following the Bradford fire
disaster.   Other companies are following suit.  Suffice it to say that
the much publicised HOLMES (Home Office Large Major Enquiry System) is
not entirely suitable for Casualty Bureau work, and neither at this
stage is the Police National Computer, although it must be emphasised
that it might be in the future and work is going ahead to investigate
this.   Therefore, as much of the problem of Casualty Bureau involves
the telephone system there has been considerable liaison with British
Telecom, and it was established that one possible answer was to utilise
their Telephone Marketing Services (TMS) (previously known as Telephone
Tan) which is a facility whereby all enquiry calls could be diverted
away from local exchanges to a central enquiry unit located at a much
larger telephone exchange at Bristol where TMS have the capability of
calling upon up to 500 staff as opposed to many of the individual
police forces bureaus which often have no more than 10 telephone
1 ines.

     As a result an exercise named COMTEST 89 was held on Thursday,
!2th January 1989, when the TMS equipment and staff were subject of a
field trial.  During the course of four hours 40 of their operators,
under some considerable pressure, answered some 1,600 calls and the
information thus gathered was transmitted to two Casualty Bureaus.   One
in West Yorkshire and the other in Bedfordshire.  The former of these
ran a computerised system and the other used a purely manual system,
the results of this trial are not yet complete but will be subject of a
completely independent validation team report in the near future.   The
objectives were to discover if TMS staff could accurately obtain and
record the necessary detail and then transfer it quickly to a Police
He a d q u a r te r s .



 CORONERS WORK

      Following consultation with the Home Office and some of your own
 number during the drafting of the ACPO document I can assure you that
 your role, and the significance of it to the overall police task is
 constantly re-emphasised.

      The initial guidance seeks to advise Forces to involve Coroners
 from the contingency planning stage and then throughout the whole
 practice.  (As an example - what are the realistic capacities of your
 local mortuaries, are temporary mortuaries or sites identified and, if
 so, have they the facilities which will be essential).  Whenever a new
 phase or point is raised which is likely to require consultation or
 approval the Senior Police Officer is reminded of the Coroners role.
The point is particularly made that experts who maybe essential to the
process will want paying, agreement needs to be made as to who pays
BEFORE they are called.

     Clearly central to the whole process is the problem of victim
identification.  Firstly, a general comment that officers are told to
establish with the coroner what procedures and criteria are to be
adopted and advice given, particularly where normal visual
identification is impossible or undesirable (Appendix 4).  The concept
of identification by exclusion is mentioned (e.g. one baby missing
- one baby's body found - reasonable assumption re identification).   A
suggested structure for the identification process is provided (see
Appendix).

     Two further explanations are perhaps necessary, one is the
mortuary documentation officer.  His role is to keep a separate file
for each body and that file should include details of the following:-

     1.    Clothing and documents.

     2.    Jewellery.

     3.    Description (including external and internal
           scars, evidence of diseases, and marks).

     4.    Teeth (although problems on accuracy of old
           dental records is recognised).

     5.    Fingerprints   (if possible).

     6.    D.N.A.   (if necessary/or achievable).

     The other concept which perhaps requires explanation is the ante
mortem team.  Their role is as follows

     (a)   Determine the missing person believed to be
           involved in the disaster.

     (b)   To establish evidence that such missing persons
           were likely to be involved.

     (c)   To complete a victim identification form in
           respect of each.

     (d)   Prepare a file for comparison purposes using
           information from (c) above for deliberation by
           the identification commission in consultation
           with the Coroner.

     (e)   To inform the next of kin when all identifications
           have been completed.

     (f)   To provide a point of contact for next of kin and
           render them all possible assistance.

LIAISON

      Following a large scale disaster there will inevitably need to be
a complex but hastily founded liaison network.   The Police Service is
prepared to act as the facilitator in this process and will offer to
serve

     1.   H.M. Coroners.
     2.   Carriers.
     3.   Companies or commercial organisations.
     4.   Other Police Forces.
     5.   Armed Services (where applicable).
     6.   Local Authorities and Social Services.
     7.   Health Authorities.
     8.   Voluntary organisations.
     9.   Official representatives of other countries
     0.   Other investigative bodies.

     The list is apparently limitless, dependent on circumstances,   and
therefore inevitably flexible.

COMMAND STRUCTURE

     I repeat the significance given to your role by showing a chart
of a typical major incident Command Structure (Appendix 5).   Finally
I introduce a comparatively new concept in police command circles it
was originally developed for Public Order situations (Appendix 6).   It
is being used by an increasing number of Forces and is a descriptive
system not tied to a particular rank and therefore enables a more
flexible approach dependant upon the circumstances.   Thus a more
senior officer can take on the Gold as an enquiry grows or relinquish
it as the operation scales down.   There will only ever be one Gold
but there may be several Silvers and certainly more Bronze Commanders.
I mencion this system in order that you have an awareness and under­
standing of another example of "in-service jargon".  I happen to
believe it to be a useful example.

(c)         The       handling    of     a    large      number     of    enquiries      likely   to

            be        generated   both        from      the    public     and     the   news   media

            usually to the Police.




(d)         Any incident that requires the large scale combined resources

                of the three emergency services.

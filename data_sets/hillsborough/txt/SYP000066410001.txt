At one      point     I i ntervened          in an a rg ument     between an     Inspector and

several      Liverpool        Supporters,         one of who m     I recortgnised as Dereck

HATTON.        One of the s upporters was a cc us in g               the Police      of   causing       the

deaths.        The    Inspector        ordered that       the s upporters      be e sc or te d away

from the scene,             Mr H AT T O N was      remonstrating w ith the         Inspector       to

keep his       cool,       I spoke      to Mr HATTON,       saying       that ws should all        try

Po li ce Officers         had been formed across                  the half way    line.   No bo dy

really knew what            they should be doing.                  All   the bodies had been

removed from the scene and those slightly                          injured were      receiving

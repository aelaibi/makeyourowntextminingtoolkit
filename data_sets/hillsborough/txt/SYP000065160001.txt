‘informed me that             he had a rr i v e d at about midday,                     dropped off his             fans

outside        She f f i e l d W e d n e s da y Football       Ground,          and he had gone          on to the

' W h i t e h o u s e ’ for a meal.          The Police        had    located him and             called him

out    due to smoke           coming       from his vehicle.

An e x a m in a t i o n     revealed a leak         in the fuel            pipe,       dripping       fuel    onto a

hot    exhaust        causing       smoke.

Wh i l s t    dealing with this             incident      it was      noticeable            that a large

number        of fans w e r e       walk i n g   four or five abreast                  along    the    pavement

a nd us       dealing with          our    incident were        causing an o b s t r u c t i o n to them.

This     resulting          in verbal      banter between five
                                                                      )CL       crew and f a n s .       The

m a j o r i t y of these          fans were      in high spirits and a few wal k e d                     past

m ind i n g    their       own business.         A pp ro xi m a t e l y    eighty       per    cent of these

 ans a p p e a r e d to h a v e been drinking                 but were          not drunk.        1 w o u l d say

the aver age age of these                  fans was mid twenties.                      We   remained at        that,

job from        14.37hrs          until    15.03hrs     (at    least).

During        that    time    the flow of fans did not abate and the traffic                                   flow

was    in     a similar       state with         fans att e n d i n g      the match,          it was    obvious

the    cars were           going    to the match due to scarves                    etc.       hanging    from the

windows.          It was also apparent              people were            still       looking    for    somewhere

to    park.

W hilst       en route       back to our home station,                    at    15,D7hrs we were             re­

d i r e c t e d to another          incident     not    connected with the football match.

As a result           of what       I ’d seen     prior    to three            o ’clock and shor t l y after

it was apparent              to me that       the fans w ould be                late    for the match.

At no time           did    I see any disorder            between Police and fans                     in that area.

I can also           produce a copy of            ’call    number         1416*     (Ex. No.             ) (Ref

         ) if required to show the time of the second                                   call.

In respect           of    call    no.    1403 this will        show a clearance                time of

14.58hrs a l t h o u g h          this    is time we were         free.          We did       remain until

13.03hrs,        hosing       down       rear window of        coach as the smoke had b l ackened

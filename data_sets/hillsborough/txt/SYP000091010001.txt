                     was     forced on my tiptoes.                   It was      so tight       that     I had my elbow             in the

                     neck of a man next           to me but            I c o u l d n ’t move       it.

                  w h i ch   I put    in his     face.    B l oo d    came    from his        nose and hgX&as           dead.          A

                  f ir s t- a id man a sked me to give               the k i s s- of -1 if e\ to brother man.                I

                  w o nd e r e d   why he did not do       it himself,            but   I tried to do it.               The man

                  was    sick over me and died.            I put my          coat       over    him.

                  I then started taking             boards     down to help the               injured     people.          Then    I

                  heard the voice           of           behind ms.           He said        'Pat   is d e a d . ’    My

                  feelings were         that     1 could have helped                PajX*but I d i d n ’t !ik         back and

                  didn't see         him.    I   tried to give Pat „ e k i ss-o-^-1 i f ^ b u t                 he    was dead.

                  I h elped        carry Pat     to a gymnafciurn,                           greyrblue     colour.          I then

                  sat w ith him w ith my           coat over         him.     I     event ua ll y t e le ph on ed home and

                  told my Dad what           had happened ~ I wasn't able to tell my Mam.

                  A fterwards,        I went     to a Centre and the                police a sk ed me some           questions

                  and w e r e n ’t very helpful.           Eventually,              a social    worker took          me to       the

                  st at io n and      I took the train home             that        night.

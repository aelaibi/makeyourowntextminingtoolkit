Dear Prime Minister

THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

I have been instructed by the Merseyside Passenger Transport Authority to bring to your
immediate attention the terms o f the following Motion which received all Party support at the
meeting of the Authority held on 24 February 1998, vis:-

       “That all Members of the Merseyside Passenger Transport Authority -

       (a)     deplore that the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, has failed in his duty to
               immediately order a full Inquiry into the tragic circumstances which
               claimed 96 lives in the Hillsborough Disaster;

       (b)     further, call upon the Home Secretary to reverse his decision and thus
               allow justice to be seen by such an Inquiry; only be the truth coming
               forth from this terrible tragedy, will friends and loved ones of the
               deceased find peace within themselves;

       (c)     support the Hillsborough families in their fight for an Inquiry through
               the European Courts; and

        (d)    request that a copy of this Motion be immediately forwarded to the
               Prime Minister.

        The Motion was then put,          and carried, and it was RESOLVED
        UNANIMOUSLY”

Yours sincerely

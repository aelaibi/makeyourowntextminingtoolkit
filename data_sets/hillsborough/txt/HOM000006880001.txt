Dear Lord Ferrers,
                                                                                        .         /

                                          JUDICIAL EN Q U IR Y

      The recent meeting of the Police Consultative C om m ittee for the J2 Sub
Division of the West Midlands Police Authority was concerned to learn of the
possibility that all, or part, of the huge costs of the Judicial Enquiry into the
Hillsborough tragedy may be borne by the West Midlands Police Authority.

      I understand tha t you received a delegation from the West Midlands Police
Authority on 25th May 1989 and th a t, whilst an undertaking was given th a t no
costs would be incurred by the A u thority, no decision has yet been published
with regard to the present drain on the resources of the West Midlands Police,
both financially and in terms of manpower.

      We are concerned th a t the e ffects of this enquiry are already being f e lt
in the manpower losses within the relatively small area of Brierley Hill and any
long term financial dislocation will have further e ffects on the amount of
overtime available to cover the policing within our area.

     I would be most grateful if you would consider this m a tte r with some
urgency in order to bring a speedy resolution to the problems.


                                            Yours sincerely,

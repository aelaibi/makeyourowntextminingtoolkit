 THERE WERE A LARGE AMOUNT OF POLICE IN EVIDENCE,      IN LINE ACROSS THE PI1

 A LINE IN FRONT OF THE BARRIERS.     INITIALLY THAT LINE WAS STOPPING PEOP

 GOING OVER THE FENCE.      PEOPLE WERE IN DISTRESS.    THE FANS THAT GOT 01

 WERE HELPING WITH THE DEAD AND INJURED BUT ALTHOUGH SOME POLICE OFFICER

 WERE HELPING THERE WAS AN AWFUL LOT OF OFFICERS JUST DOING NOTHING.         1

 CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT W A S N ’T APPARENT OBVIOUS THAT PEOPLE NEEDED HEL

 THE POLICE ARE A PROFESSIONAL BODY OF MEN I UNDERSTOOD THEM TO BE TRAIh

 IN THINGS LIKE THIS.      YOU TEND TO RELY ON THEM TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE I

 <354

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 •1.    IT STARTED BEFORE THE MATCH, WHEN HILLSBOROUGH WAS CHOSEN WE KNEW 1

 IT WAS THE WRONG GROUND.      WE HAD THAT END OF THE GROUND LAST YEAR AND

 THE CRUSH WAS TERRIBLE, PEOPLE WERE PULLED FROM THE TERRACES TO THE STA

 LAST YEAR.      IT HAD BEEN VOICED TO THE FA THAT THIS GROUND WAS NOT SUIT]

 THE CROWD NEEDS CONTROLLING IT NEEDED SOMEWHERE LIKE OLD TRAFFORD.        TH

 CROWD ALSO NEEDS ROOM WITH SUCH A LARGE FOLLOWING.        I FEEL THE FANS WE

 IGNORED.      PEOPLE DON'T THINK WE HAVE OPINIONS, THE FANS ARE THE EXPERT

 ON GROUNDS BUT NO ONE ASKS US.
 1.    I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BODY OF FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS INCLUDED IN

       DISCUSSIONS ON GROUNDS, SAFETY ETC.

 2.    THE GAP   IN THE FENCE IN THE PEN WHERE I WAS, WAS NOT OBVIOUS.        I

       CANNOT REMEMBER   IF IT WAS A GATE.     THERE WERE NO POLICE OR STEWARD^

       TO POINT IT OUT, WE ONLY FOUND IT BY CHANCE AND NOT MANY PEOPLE

       CAME THROUGH WITH US        THERE WERE NO SIGNS POINTING IT O U T »   ONCE

       PEOPLE WERE IN THAT MASS THEY JUST D I D N ’T KNOW WHERE TO GO IF IT

 W A S N ’T POINTED OUT TO THEM.

 IT MUST HAVE BEEN APPARENT THAT THE END TERRACES WERE EMPTY, SOMEONE

 SHOULD HAVE MADE THE DECISION TO BLOCK OFF THE TUNNEL AND DIRECT PEOPLE

 AROUND THE SIDES.       THERE APPEARED TO BE A LACK OF COMMUNICATION IN THE

 GROUND, TELLING PEOPLE WHERE TO GO OR NOT TO GO.            IT WOULD HAVE BEEN £

 EASY TO DIRECT SUPPORTERS ROUND THE SIDES.

 IT SEEMS A BIG DECISION TO OPEN A GATE, LETTING A FLOOD OF PEOPLE IN.

 THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHOUGHT AS TO DIRECTING THEM WHERE TO GO -

 THAT TUNNEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED OFF.

 I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN DEATHS OUTSIDE THE GRC

 IF THE GATE H A D N ’T HAVE BEEN OPENED, BUT I D O N ’T THINK THERE WOULD HAVE

 THAT MANY, ALTHOUGH THAT IS MO CONSOLATION.           SUPPORTERS SHOULD HAVE BE

 DIRECTED ONCE THROUGH THE GATES.

 THE FIRST THING YOU SEE ONCE THROUGH THE TURNSTILE IS THE TUNNEL AND Th

 MAJORITY OF PEOPLE GO FOR THAT.          I LEARNED MY LESSON FROM LAST YEAR.

 WAS A CRUSH, THERE WAS A DANGEROUS SITUATION LAST YEAR.            THIS YEAR WE

 DECIDED NOT TO USE THE TUNNEL/STAND BEHIND THE GOAL BUT WE COULD FIND N

  WAY INTO THE TERRACES SO WE HAD NO CHOICE.

 I WENT TO THE REPLAY YESTERDAY AND I WANT TO COMMENT ON HOW EASY IT WAS

 PUT THE KICK OFF BACK - IT WAS NO MAJOR PROBLEM.

                        If my experience was typical,          and I have no reason to

                        believe that it w a s n ’t, the problem lay in travel delays.

                        We left            at 11.00 1100 and travelled via the M57 and

                        M62.    Prior to the junction with the M63,        there were Police

                        signs which advised football fans to travel via the M602.

                        Since there was a stationary queue of traffic waiting to

                        join the M62/M63 this seemed to be sound advice.              Once we

                        left the M602 in Salford we hit a very slow moving line of

                        traffic on the A57 until we filtered onto the next section

                        of motorway     (The Mancunian Way).       This could have been
                                                             PAGE         2


anticipated because it was the result of long-standing

roadworks.        The next hold up was at tne end of the M67,    the

Hyde roundabout.        The queue started between 600-800 yds,

from the roundabout and continued up to the traffic lights

at Hyde.     We encountered three further queues before we

cleared Glossop.At none of these       points, which were all

predictable, was there a single policeman to ease the flow

of traffic.       We turned off the A57 shortly before Sheffield

and parked in Taplin St near Hillsborough town/village.             The

time was then 14.05 1405.        A journey of 81 miles had taken 3

hrs 3 m i n s .    It was 14.20 1420 before we got to the

turnsti1e .

Return journey.

We left Taplin St at 17.00 1700 as Sports Report began.             We

stopped at the first public telephone on the           and were

asked into                              by a young woman who let

us use her phone.        That was very good of her and we are very

grateful.     The traffic over the Snake Pass moved very slowly

and I d i d n ’t see much overtaking at all - trully funerial.

However,    despite this and the fact that we were diverted

off the last section of the M67 and had to drive in file,

through a built up area with several sets of traffic lights,

we arrived back i n ________ at 19.15 1915.     The difference was

that there were Police       in Glossop, at the foot of the hill

in Hyde and at the traffic lights at the top of the hill            in

Hyde.    Had this been the case for the outward bound journey,

I suspect that many more fans would have arrived in plenty

of time for the kick-off.

Fans travelling without tickets.

Undoubtedly,      many fans did travel without tickets.     However,
                                                                  PAGE      3


my son and 1 were in the West Stand (Row 8, Seats 127/128).

The two seats immediately in front of us were occupied by

two middle aged men with their 6 or 7 year old sons on their

knees.    The two seats   immediately next to me were occupied

by one man and 2 lads     about     11 or 12. Obviously,    3 of    those

people got in without     tickets.     as they were probably

younger ones,   I doubt   that they got in by scaling       the

walls.    1 suspect that they got in because the dads paid the

usual back-handers.

So long as fans know that they can get into big matches,

without tickets,    if they can just get to a "friendly’

turnstile they will    continue to journey in hope.          It is up

to the Police and the groundstaff to ensure that they do not

get away with it.     At Old Trafford there was a policewoman

at our turnstile checking tickets before we tried to gain

access.   That is the way that it should be.

Lack of explanation over the PA System.

Many of the criticisms of the organisation both inside and

outside the ground have already been covered at great length

in the media,   national and local.       Our personal     experience

may serve to indicate the problems that arose because of the

lack of information.      When we had been given neither

information nor advice by 15.45 1545 I asked the Police at a

gangway   ’what is ha ppe nin g?’    I was told that the match had

been abandoned and would I please leave quietly.            When we

left the Stand I tried to gain entry into Leppings Ln

terracing bee cause I wanted to look for a young woman             (17)

whom we had taken with us to Hi 1Isborough.        I was told that

I couldn’t go in through the tunnel and that I would just

have to wait outside.      That was ridiculous.     There was
                                                                PAGE


nothing remotely like an accident         centre where concerned

friends or relatives could obtain information.          Between

16.00    1600 and 16.30 1630 the organisation outside the

Ground was as bad as it had been before the match.

Worse was to come!         As we walked along by the park   (Middle

Rd/St)    towards Taplin St we were confronted by a manic

Forest suporter who was stalking between 2 lines of

stationary traffic screaming        'come on you bastards if you

want a f i g h t . ’   Just as we approached a path which cut

across the park,, there was a charge by about 12 Forest fans

(late teens early twenties).

Fortunately,      they charged passed us at some Liverpool

supporters who had bailed out of a car         (feelings were

running high at this point because of the rumours of people

dead)    but my son was hit in the back by an iron bar.         Had

there been an explanation over the PA system,         I think that

the Forest fans might have been sympathetic.          As it was,

they thought the scousers had just rioted again,         in keeping

with their reputation,        no doubt!   This misapprehension was

supported by a comment made by a Police Officer to a fan in

front of me as we left the Ground,         "That's the second time

you -S'**** have done this."       Ironical when one remembers the

sequence of events that led up to the stampede!!

            I am a single man living at the above address on Saturday 15th April

            1989 I went to Hillsborough Football Ground Sheffield on the occasion

            of a Cup semi final Liverpool and Notts Forest I support Liverpool.



            I didnt go in an organised party just with my mates

                                       in a private car, the only time we stopped on

            the journey was firstly at a service station to use the toilet,              then

           we hit traffic delays due to roadworks on the motorway we were held up

            for three quarters of an hour.



           On route 1 did see fans drinking beer but no more than a normal match

            day everyone was happy.       We got into Sheffield at approx      1.30pm    (1330)

           where we parked on a side road near Halifax Rd, after we parked we
                                                                   PAGE        2


walked up to the ground we didn't receive any police escort,     I didn't

see any disorder or any fighting or drunkeness by the time we got to

the ground it was 2.00pm (1400)   there was a few people about but I

went through the Leppings Ln standing terrace turnstile no crush no

mass of people there at that time I handed in my      6.00 ticket I had

bought from Anfield.



Outside the turnstiles there was about 8 police officers and I also

saw some stewards asking the crowd about tickets,     I didn't have any

difficulty getting through my entry point because I went to the same

match last year.    I knew which turnstile to use.



I entered through the turnstile handed in my ticket they ripped the

stub off and gave it me back but I havent got it now.      I didnt see

anyone getting in by north side meaning     I didn't see any other gates

being opened or already open.



Once I got in to the ground I d i d n ’t see any signs telling me where to

go I always stand behind the goal,     I went through the tunnel under the

stand it was a bit packed going thr ough I didn't see any police or

stewards at either end of the tunne 1, I didn't see any drinking      in the

ground there wasn't any trouble the re either.



Once through the tunnel and out the other end I went to the right into

Pen No 3 I have indicated my position on the grid,     I did not see any

barrier break where I was I wasn't near any barrier when it broke.        I

got into the pen at 2.25pm   (1425)   the pen was full but not that full      I

was still with my mates then.     I could see that the outside pens

were quite empty.
                                                                     PAGE      3


I could see the crowd crush around me,    just after 3.00pm (1500)    I felt

dizzy I couldnt move at all so I tried to climb out over the side

fence into pen No.2,    I felt a crowd surge and ended up being pushed

with my back against the fence    I was injured and had bruising to my

spine I didn't go to hospital.



I could see people around me against the fences    I dont know if they

were dead or not I did help a few people out of the pens by putting

them over the fence.



I believe when Gate C was opened allowing even more fans inside was a

main factor   in the deaths and injuries we were pleading with the

police to open the gates but they said it was alright.



I left the football    ground at 4.40pm (1640) after the loudspeaker

announcement saying the game was abandoned,    I didn't see any criminal

offences being committed, after the game as stopped I tried this time

successfully to climb into Pen No. 2.     I tried to get on to the pitch

via the exit gate but a policeman kicked me back in, the whole

incident was handled badly the ambulance took too long.



I feel the inquiry should know that,    the fences shouldn't be there

especially the side fences,    the ticket allocation was wrong and last

year the same game was policed a lot better,    this year there was no

control at all.



If the fences remain they should be able to be automatically opened,

the terrace should be raised to the same level as the pitch so we

could get out,    the game should have been delayed for 15 minutes so

everyone could get in and there shoiuld be more medical equipment

           I have been a supporter of Liverpool Football Club for several years

           and have attended several games.     I am not a season ticket holder,       but

           am a member of the Berwick Liverpool Supporters Club.        I obtained a

           ticket for the semi-final which was to be played on Saturday 15th

           April     1989 (150489 between Liverpool and Notts Forest from the local

           supporters club.     I paid 12 pounds for it and it was for a seat in the

           W Stand.On the morning of the match I was picked up in a mini bus

           from near my house in               . The driver of the bus was

                       and there was eleven people travelled in the mini-bus,       they

           were

                                                                         the son of

                                  do not know his name. After picking me up we went

           to                  house to pick him up before we started the journey to
                                                                   PAGE      S


Sheffield and Hillsborough Football Ground. We left            house about

10.30am (1030)-10.45am (1045) and stopped once at a garage on route

where I had some food, we were there for about 10 minutes.     I do not

know the name of the garage or its location.

We were not involved in any traffic hold-ups and arrived in Sheffield

at about S.30pm (1430). The mini-bus was parked in a side street and

it took about 15 minutes to walk to the ground. During the time I was

walking to the ground I did not see any trouble or any people drinking

outside public houses. The streets were very busy with fans going

towards the ground,   these were mainly Liverpool fans.

On reaching the turnstiles which lead to the West Stand I saw a large

crowd all around the turnstiles, all   pushing trying to get in. There

was no queues just a large crowd,   I saw two Police on horses and

some on foot. The Police were trying to sort the crowd out but because

of the numbers they couldn't do nothing with the crowd.

We had a l 1 walked towards the ground together but on reaching the

ground we all got split up and at this time I was on my own.     I joined

the mass of people and made my way towards the turnstiles.     I was

pushed towards the turnstiles,   even if you did not want to you had to

go because of the amount of people all   pushing towards the

turnstiles.

I got to the turnstiles after being pushed and shoved around a lot and

went through the turnstile and handed my ticket    in. After I had gone

through the turntile there wasn't any more   pushing,   there was more

room inside. When I was in the queue or crowd,    I saw a lot of people

being   pulled up and climbing over the turnstile into the ground.

Once inside the turnstiles   I made my way to the stand,   I found my way

by seeing the letter on my ticket displayed on the wall,     I went up the

steps to the stand,   I did not see any stewards and no-one checked

my ticket before I got to the stand.   I did not see any of the people I
                                                                         PAGE    3


    had travelled to the game with.

    On reaching the stand I saw a mass of people in the stand and it was
*



    very difficult to get to my seat. When I got to my seat there was

    someone sitting in it,    I did not move this person as I saw that people

    were being pulled up into the stand from the terrace underneath. There

    was just a mass of people in the stand,      standing on seats and in the

    aisles,    it was very overcrowded.   By the time I had got to my seat the

    game had been stopped but the players were still on the field. By this

    time I had been joined by                   and we were standing

    about the fourth row from the front of the stand on the right as you

    look at the pitch. From this point I could look down into the terrace

    behind the goal and I could see people were being crushed in the

    terrace.    I saw people being passed over the head of the people in the

    terrace and into the pitch,    some of these people appeared to be

    injured.At about twenty past three I decided to leave the ground with

               we sent down the steps at the rear of the stand,   the same way

    as I had entered. As I crossed the area at the rear of the stand

    before I got to the turnstiles    I saw a Policeman helping an injured

    lad he was aged about SO to S4yrs. The lad appeared to have an injury

    to his stomach,    he was in a lot of pain and his legs kept giving away.

    I took one of his arms and the Policeman held the other and we took

    him to an ambulance.    I do not know if I would recognise the injured

    youth again,    the only thing I can remember about his dress is that he

    was wearing jeans.

    After this           bind myself went back to the mini bus, and waited for

    the others to come back. We waited for over an hour before the others

    returned and then went home.

    Once I had seen people injured on the terrace I did not stay to watch

    as it was not a pretty sight to I left the ground pretty qui ck l y .

           On the day in question I paraded for duty at Ecclesfield Police

           Station at 0900 hours.          I was then transported by bus to Hillsborough

           Football ground where upon arrival         I confirmed that I was to be part

           of serial 49 patrolling the F o x h i 11 area of Sheffield in a Transit

           van. Tango 4.



           Myself and other members of this serial took our seats in the North

           Stand for the briefing by senior and intelligence officers before

           collecting our meals and commencing patrol at approximately 10.50

           hours.



           Our first port of call was The Fox public house situated on Foxhill

           Road.     This is a fairly large pub with a very Large Tarmacadam carpar
                                                                          PAGE   2


and grassed area opening onto the above road.           At about   11.03 hours

myself and Inspector ROBINSON visited the Landlord in the Lounge Bar

of the pr em is es .   He stated that he had five extra staff on duty and

had retained the services of "a big lad" as doorman.           He also said

that he had extra beer and lager on that he would be welcoming

Liverpool supporters.        At this time there were a few locals drinking

in the pub and about two "families" of Liverpool supporters with

young children.        These supporters were quietly minding their own

business.    The manager was advised that we would be patrolling the

area and calling by regularly and that we should           be contacted in the

event of any need for assistance.



We then resumed patrol,       checking visually other pubs in the area.

Most were either quiet or closed.        However,   during this time many

supporters began to flood into the side streets in this area and park

their private cars and vans.



At 11.30 hrs we again checked the Fox public house.           It was starting

to fill up with crowds of LFS cans standing outside drinking in the

sunshine.    The surrounding streets     in Foxhill and up towards Grenoside

were now very busy with the vehicles of arriving f a n s ? to the extent

that it made manouvering of our shortwheel          base transit van very

difficult.    We then observed that traffic flowing freely down Halifax

Rd from the North with many supporters arriving in private cars, vans

and hire minibuses.       These vehicles were turning off into the Foxhill

and Parson Cross estates?       presumably to park.



At 12.10 we again during our patrols checked the Fox pub.            The car

park was now full to capacity with people standing very close to each

other, sitting on cars and standing on the boundary wall? all drinking
                                                                             PAGE        3


al c o h o l .



At 12.30 we were          directed by control to attend at Mi 1 cox Rd,   F o x h i 11

where youth were          reported to be acting disorderly manner and     urinating

in peoples front gardens.             At the scene we liaised with PCs stationed

at the bottom of the road who stated that 3-6 Liverpool fans had

passed them being abusive and throwing down beer cans.             Some of this

team were observed to go up Wilcox Rd and urinate in gardens.                We saw

this group of youths walking up that road and stopped and spoke to

them.       All had been drinking        heavily and were in a very boisterous

mood.       They were     advised and pointed in the direction of the     ground.

We followed them          down the hill and near the bottom they all boarded a

SYPTE bus bound for the town centre.



At 12.50 we again visually checked the Fox public house.             By now the

car park was bursting to capacity and fans stood drinking some

distance up and down Foxhill Rd on the pavement on both sides drinking

alcohol          purchased from The Fox.    I would estimate the number in the

car park and walls alone to be in the region of about 300 to 400.

With a further 200 standing on the pavement and pull in on

the opposite           pavement.    There was in there number a large drunken,

rowdy contingent who cat called as we passed and who continued to do

so when we paused for observations.



At 1300 hours we checked the White Horse public house on Halifax/

Southey Green Rd.           This,   too, was full of LFC supporters and the scene

was very similar to that at The Fox.



At 13.05 hours we received a message from control to attend at

                                                            shop
                                                                    PAGE        4


      The manageress stated that six drunken LFC fans had come into

her shop and acted disorderly before stealing cigarettes and sweets.

She followed them outside where they were very abusive and threatening

and saw them drive off in a white Renault van registered number




At 13.15 hours I saw the van being driven on Halifax Rd.       We followed

to the car park of The White Horse pub where it parked up.       After a

short conversation the six occupants of the van were arrested by me

and placed in our police van.    They were then transported to EPS

arriving at 13.40 hours.



The prisoners were all Liverpool supporters ranging in age from 18

years to 37 years.   They had all been drinking both in the van on the

way over and at The Fox public house.    They stated that they had

arrived in plenty of time at about   12.15 hours.     When booking the

pristiners   property in it was found that not all of them had tickets

for the match.



It was ascertained that all six had attended Sheffield for the match

with only two West stand ticket between them.       They had managed to

swap one of these tickets for two Leppings Ln terrace tickets?      brining

the total held to three between six.    The prisoners told me that they

had heard that tickets would be on sale from touts at the ground and

that last year the officials at the ground had let some in without

checking tickets owing to the rush because of the match starting.          It

was further noted when booking in property that there was very little

cash between them.    And certainly come of those without match

tickets did not have sufficient funds to purchase tickets at TOUTS

prices?   indeed they only had loose change.
                                                                     PAGE        5




This was noted at the time and subject of discussion between myself

and the custody officer.      Obviously the full significance of this

information did not become apparent until     later?   but the custody

records corroborating this evidence re property are available for

examination at Ecclesfield Police Station.      It appeared to me at the

time that if these prisoners had insufficient funds to buy tickets and

that they were determined to get into see the match ( this was more

than apparent by the noise and complaints coming from the cells when

they were detained)      then they were going to attempt to gain entry by

some means.     This is again corroborated by the fact that they had

turned up on spec without money but with the knowledge that       people had

some how gained entry at the last minute last year because of the rush.



The prisoners were all held whilst     I liaised with CID regarding their

interview.     At about 15.15 hours I was in the CID office when PC 1242

ARMITAGE called me and told me that Operation Support were required at

the ground.     My transit had departed earleir so I was driven in a

police car to the ground in company with PC 1242 ARMITAGE, PS 2269

STRAFFORD and Inspector HUDSON.      We arrived at the Leppings Ln end at

about    15.30 hours.   We parked the car in a side street and all headed

towards the turnstiles.      Fans were pouring out of the ground some

confused,    some angry and others obviously distressed by something.



As I approached the gate in front of the turnstiles, a few paces

behind Inspector HUDSON,     I saw a LFC fan attack him and try to push

him.     HUDSON managed to restrain the youth who was upset and crying,

I assisted him and pulled the youth off and took him away from the

scene.     During the struggle I received an injury to my right foot?       it

was not serious and the bruise only lasted a few days.        I tried to
                                                                       PAGE        6


calm him down but he kept shouting "there is fucking dead bodies in

there".     I released the youth to the custody of friends and returned

to the main gates.



I had no personal      radio so I was unaware of the circumstances of the

incident however I assumed there had been some sort of crush,         perhaps

a wall    collapse.    A mass of people were pouring out of the gates at

Leppings Ln.     Most of them did not know what had happened either and

seemed mostly concerned with the fact that they had not gained entry

or wished to know if the match was abandoned.



However,    quite a few of their number informed me that some supporters

had been crushed because of a massive surge or that a gate had been

opened by the police or stewards.       I was on my own now so I tried to

move fans out of the path of oncoming emergency vehicles?      the progress

of which they were hampering.       I sensed that something very

disasterous had happened from the mood and tears of fans.          I continued

to try to clear the roadway but the mood of some fans was very

aggressive fuelled by the fact that they were heavily under the

influence of intoxicants.       I was jostled and abused by these drunken

fans and whilst attempting to move a large congregation from the path

of a fire engine,      I was punched on the right shoulder by an unknown

assailant and jeered and insulted by the rest of the group.         Some

still had beer cans in their hands.



The situation had become potentially very violent with all the

violence and abuse apparently directed at the police.       I was still       in

the dark about the incident or requirements as I was on my own without

a personal    radio.    After the task of keeping fans off the road became

fruitless and dangerous to my personal safety,      I looked further down
                                                                       PAGE     7


Leppings Ln and saw my serial      in their transit van.    PS 2207 SHAW saw

me and got me back into the van.         Crowds of LFC fans jeered and rocked

the van as they passed.       Several   police motorcyclists parked across

from us became very vulnerable to attack by fans and after a few close

calls had to move on.       The fans shouted "Murderers" to us and other

officers as they walked by.



The Sgt in the van had a personal        radio but the reception and

communication was very bad.       Inspector ROBINSON got out of the van to

go to Police Control to find out what assistance we could render or if

our vehicle could be of any use.        We heard over a domestic pocket

radio that fans had been killed.



Inspector   ROBINSON returned and stated that our van was needed as an

ambulance and that we were needed to assist at the mortuary area,

stuated in the gym.     We left the driver with the van and walked

through the extreme left hand gate at Leppings Ln and down along

behind North Stand towards the gym.



I was detailed by the Inspector to go to the gym to ask if any more

numbers were needed inside.       Luckily a Sergeant on the door stated

that there was enough help but asked that we keep fans looking for

lost family/friends as well as sightseers away.         Our serial along with

some men drafted in from Barnsley formed a cordon along a line between

the corner of the North Stand and some outbuildings        parallel to the

stand.



We allowed only stretchers bearing the dead and injured through as

well as Police,   nurses,    doctors,   ambulancemen and other officials.

Some fans carrying IPs were allowed to take them through.         Ambulances
                                                                           PAGE    8


reversed up to our cordon and IPs were taken away.           Many fans

approached our line a very distressed state inquiring after lost party

members.    Many became aggressive and violent at not being allowed to

look through the dead and injured        for them.     Again many of the most

aggressive and violent fans had been drinking and still smelled

heavily of intoxicants.        At one point I received a kick from a fan

being refused access,       to the back of my left knee.     He was removed

after a struggle with sober friends and other officers.



Inspector ROBINSON and PS SHAW then asked members of our serial to

assist with a makeshift casualty desk.        I took details and

descriptions of those missing from fans and asked them           to return to

their transport in case the missing       person was looking for them.

Some were bussed down to Hammerton Rd Police Station to give info

to the Casualty Bureau.



At about    1800 hours,    serial 49 was asked to return to their van at

Claywheels Ln,       pending further assignment.     Reunited with the van, we

had to attend several times at the Northern General Hospital             to deal

with fans fighting with pressmen.        Other officers were present at the

scene and we acted as back up.        We were eventually stood down at 2000

hours.     I had a    meal at Claywheels and went off duty at Ecclesfield

Police Station at 2030 hours.



On return to Ecclesfield I learned that my six prisoners had all been

released at about 18.15 hours with a warning but no further action to

be taken against them.

           I am a Police Superintendent of the South Yorkshire Police Force,

           presently performing duties as the Acting Divisional Commander of                ’D

           Division.       I am forty-three years of age,        being born on




           On Saturday,      15 April   1989 (150489)       I was the senior officer on duty

           within    5D° Division on the occasion of the semi final football match

           between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, a game that was taking place

           at the Hillsborough Football Stadium, which is in *F* Division.



           At 8.30 am.      (0830)   that morning,    I commenced duty at West Bar Police

           Station and at 9.00 am         (0900)   1 attended a briefing that was held in

           the Gymnasium at West Bar Police Station.              That briefing was conducted
by Acting Superintendent KING     (now Superintendent)   and was in accord

with a 'D’ Divisional Operation Order, Reference 3/89.        That Order had

been prepared by Police Sergeant JONES (now Inspector),       who had acted

as Liaison Officer between     'D9 and   *F* Divisions and also other

interested parties, and was authorised by me some time prior to the

match.



In simple terms,     the emphasis of that Order was that   *D’ Division

responsibilities were to ensure that fans arriving at the Midland

Railway Station,     within the city centre, were escorted to Hillsborough

on service buses and that every assistance was to be given to the Road

Traffic Division to ensure that fans,      travelling by road, were

assisted as freely and quickly as possible through the city area.



Following that briefing,     in company with Police Sergeant JONES, who

was to be my Staff Officer on that day,      I did a tour of the city

centre and spent some considerable time at Midland Railway Station,

Sheffield,   ensuring that supporters, who were arriving at that

1ocat ion on special trains, were effectively escorted to a fleet of

service vehicles and then escorted through to the ground by officers

who were actually travelling on the buses.       That aspect of the

operation went without any particular problems.



I then did a tour of the major     routes, within the Division,    checking

on the general traffic flow towards Hillsborough.        The traffic,   whilst

heavy, was flowing freely and,     during this route inspection,    I had a

discussion with Chief Superintendent NESBIT, who was carrying out a

similar exercise.



At S. 50 pm (1450)    I returned to West Bar Police Station satisfied that
supporters were moving through the city area,       towards Hillsborough,

without any particular       problems and aware that there had been very few

incidents of public disorder.       Officers had responded to a number of

public houses following       reports of rowdy and unruly behaviour by

supporters but matters were well       contained by the resources available

within my Div is io n .,



After   checking with the Control Room,     I made my way to my office on

the third floor of West Bar Police Station and was in my office, a

little after 3.15 pm (1515) when Sergeant JONES came and told me that

"Operation Support" had been implemented due to Liverpool         supporters

having invaded the pitch at Hillsborough and there was, apparently,

large scale public disorder taking place.        I was aware,   from the

Sergeant?   that other     resources from 'D' Division had been deployed and

we travelled immediately in a patrol       car towards Hillsborough,

arriving there a little after 3.20 pm.        (1520).



On arrival at the ground, we made our way round to the Penistone Road

entrance and I saw a large number of officers milling around the

gymnasium and also the point between the North Stand and the spion

kop.    I there saw Inspector SEWELL and Superintendent MARSH of the

Operations Division.       I made my way to these officers in an attempt to

establish exactly what was taking       place and to ascertain what

assistance I could be.



Inspector SEWELL advised the Control Room of my arrival and also the

fact that other officers from       ’D * Division were available for

deployment.     I looked towards the West Stand and could see a large

number of officers being deployed and I could also see both civilians

and police officers carrying people, who were obviously injured.
                                                                        PAGE   4


towards us.



Simultaneously, an officer,     whose   identify I am not sure of but

believe him to be Police Constable 773 ADAMS of D2 Sub-Division,

approached and told me that there were a number of casualties in and

around an ambulance by the Penistone Road entrance, adjacent to the

spion kop.    I went immediately with that officer and saw a number of

casualties milling around an ambulance and also a number of people

lying on the ground,    obviously distressed-     I then became even more

aware of the number of casualties and extent of those injured being

carried towards that end of the ground.



At that location,   I also saw two male bodies.         There was an officer

present with these bodies,     which were,   in fact,    being overlooked by

fans from the spion kop gallery.        I instructed an officer to shield

the bodies and remain with them.



At that point,   because of the difficulties we were having

communicating with the ground Control,       I instructed Sergeant JONES to

contact West Bar Police Station and implement the Force Casualty

Bureau.   By this time,    fans were running towards our location carrying

injured and people who were obviously dead.        Obviously, many of these

fans were distressed,     even bordering on the hysterical.



I was made aware,   very quickly,   by an officer whose identity I am not

aware of, that the gymnasium was being utilised as a temporary

mortuary/first aid reception area.        I was aware that there were

ambulance officers near my location checking these casualties, who

were being carried on makeshift stretchers.
                                                                     PAGE        5


However,    there was a distressing situation quickly escalating.

Casualties were being dropped or laid down on the ground in the access

area to the playing surface and there were also many people

congregating    in the area outside the gymnasium,   which was obviously

preventing ambulance staff getting through to the West Stand.        I moved

quickly towards the gymnasium,    realising that people could not get

casualties into it.     I instructed officers to form a clearway towards

the entrance doors and also to prevent obstructions being created

between the gymnasium, ambulances and Penistone Road.



I moved into the gymnasium,    there was obviously a lot of confusion,

people were distressed and,    in fact,   I witnessed a number of

skirmishes breaking out involving supporters.        In the gymnasium,   I saw

a number of senior officers,    including Superintedent McKAY of *F *

Division.



I called for a loudspeaker and microphone and asked that casualties be

divided.    Those that were in need of medical attention were

congregating to the left-hand side of the gymnasium       (when standing

with your back towards the North Stand), and people, who were

apparently dead, were being    laid on the floor to the right-hand side

of the gymnasium.



I instructed officers, who were accompanying these bodies,       to remain

with them for identification purposes and also called for medical

assistance to the gymnasium to examine the casualties.        Additionally,

I took steps to bring some sort of order to the situation and very

quickly witnessed the number of bodies increasing.        The injured were

clearly being identified,    prior to entering the gymnasium, and

transported to hospital by the Ambulance Service.
                                                                           PAGE




I saw a number of Inspectors    in the gymnasium and allocated them

tasks.     I was approached by an Inspector, who was in company with a

number of doctors.     I recall allocating doctors to individual

Inspectors and asking them to quickly move along the casualties,

determining those that were fatal and those that required urgent

medical attention.



Inspector COOPER    (now Chief Inspector), Chief Inspector CREASER I

believe,    Inspector MARTIN and also Inspector CHARLES       (now Chief

Inspector) were allocated such duties.        I saw Inspector TINGLE and

instructed him to obtain the major incident equipment and

mobile communication systems, and then deployed a number of other

officers to assist with casualties outside the gymnasium.



I recall    liaising with Mr HOPKINSON,    the Deputy Chief Ambulance

Officer,    on a number of occasions in relation to the supply of body

bags,    treatment of the injured and,    ultimately,    the transportation of

the dead.     I also had regular consultations with a number of doctors,

whose    identities I am not aware of, but I gave instructions that

their details be recorded by the respective Inspectors.



Some time later,    I was approached by,    I believe,    Inspector SEWELL who

advised me that a further eleven bodies were located in an area at

the rear of the Leppings Lane entrance and that these bodies were

being supervised by officers who were attemping to provide cover for

them.     I gave instructions that these bodies,    together with their

police escorts,    should be moved, at the earliest opportunity into the

gymnasium.
                                                                       PAGE       7


After some short time accompanied,    I believe,    by Inspector SEWELL,      I

made my way towards the Leppings Lane perimeter fence, where I saw a

number of officers supervising,    I believe,    eleven bodies.    I recall

that these were all males.     There was a van already at that location

and I recall that some bodies were being loaded into it.



I made my way to the Police Control Room, which was nearby, and,         on

reaching the steps,    I met a colleague, Superintendent MORDEW,      from D2

Sub-Division.     I approached the Control Room but was met, at the top

of the stairs,   by Superintendent MURRAY.      After a very short

conversation,    I returned to the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium

where I was joined by Detective Chief Superintendent ADDIS and Chief

Superintendent MOLE.



Mr ADDIS advised me that he would continue with enquiries         in relation

to the temporary mortuary, assisted by Mr McKAY.        Whilst we were

speaking    I was being advised that there was apparently outbreaks of

public disorder,    involving supporters making their way back towards

the city centre.



Conscious of the fact that I was the senior Divisional Officer on duty

that day,    I arranged with Mr ADDIS to leave the temporary mortuary and

return to the city centre to co-ordinate events there.        As I was

leaving Hillsborough I recall deploying Inspector DEWS (now Chief

Inspector) and his units to the city centre to quell any outbreaks of

disorder.     I then made my way, with Sergeant JONES to the city centre

to co-ordinate events.



I then spent some considerable time visiting junior officers of my

Division,   de-briefing them and counselling those that were in obvious
                                                                             PAGE    8


         need of counselling.     I returned to West Bar Police Station later that

         evening yjhere 1 had a discussion with my Commander, Chief

         Superintendent BRGOMHEAD      (presently performing duties as the Acting

         Assistant Chief Constable      (Operations)



         Further de-briefings took place and I retired from duty at about

         9.00 pm.   (2100)



                                                                    L BATES SIGNED

                                                                               PAGE      5


H o w ev er , there was a distressing situation quickly e s c a l a t i n g.

Casualties were being dropped or laid down on the ground in the access

area to the playing surface and there were also many people

congregating    in the area outside the gymnasium, which was obviously

preventing ambulance staff getting through to the West Stand.                  I moved

quickly towards the gymnasium,        realising that people could not get

casualties into it .     I instructed officers to form a clearway towards

the entrance doors and also to prevent obstructions being              created

between the gymnasium, ambulances and Penistone Road.



I moved into the gymnasium,       there was obviously a lot of confusion,

people were distressed and,       in fact,   I witnessed a number of

skirmishes breaking out involving supporters.            In the gymnasium,       I saw

a number of senior officers,       including Superintedent McKAY of *F *

Division.



I called for a loudspeaker and microphone and asked that casualties be

divided.    Those that were in need of medical attention were

congregating to the left-hand side of the gymnasium (when standing

with your back towards the North Stand), and people, who were

apparently dead, were being laid on the floor to the right-hand side

of the gymnasium.



I instructed officers, who were accompanying these bodies,              to remain

with them for identification purposes and also called for medical

assistance to the gymnasium to examine the casualties.              Additionally,

I took steps to bring some sort of order to the situation and very

quickly witnessed the number of bodies increasing.             The injured were

clearly being identified,      prior to entering the gymnasium, and

transported to hospital by the Ambulance Service.
                                                                             PAGE




I saw a number of Inspectors in the gymnasium and allocated them

tasks.     I was approached by an Inspector, who was in company with a

number of doctors.        I recall allocating doctors to individual

Inspectors and asking them to quickly move along the casualties,

determining those that were fatal and those that required urgent

medical attention.



Inspector COOPER (now Chief In sp ec to r ), Chief Inspector CREASER I

believe,    Inspector MARTIN and also Inspector CHARLES (now Chief

Inspe cto r) were allocated such d u t i e s .     I saw Inspector TINGLE and

instructed him to obtain the major incident equipment and

mobile communication sy st e m s , and then deployed a number of other

officers to assist with casualties outside the gymnasium.



I recall    liaising with Mr HOPKINSON,       the Deputy Chief Ambulance

Officer,    on a number of occasions     in relation to the supply of body

b a g s , treatment of the injured and, ultimately,           the transportation of

the dead.     I also had regular consultations with a number of doctors,

whose    identities    I am not aware of, but I gave instructions that

their details be recorded by the respective            Inspectors.



Some time later,       I was approached by,      I believe,    Inspector SEWELL who

advised me that a further eleven bodies were located in an area at

the rear of the Leppings Lane entrance and that these bodies were

being supervised by officers who were attemping to provide cover for

them.     I gave instructions that these bodies,         together with their

police escorts,       should be moved, at the earliest opportunity into the

gymnasium.
                                                                          PAGE       7


After some short time accompanied,       I believe,    by Inspector SEWELL,      I

made my way towards the Leppings Lane perimeter fence, where I saw a

number of officers supervising,       I believe,    eleven bodies.    I recall

that these were all m a l e s .   There was a van already at that location

and I recall that some bodies were being loaded into i t .



I made my way to the Police Control Room, which was nearby, and,            on

reaching the steps,    I met a c ol le ag ue , Superintendent MORDEW,    from D2

Sub-Division.     I approached the Control Room but was m e t , at the top

of the st a ir s, by Superintendent MURRAY.        After a very short

conversation,    I returned to the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium

where I was joined by Detective Chief Superintendent ADDIS and Chief

Superintendent MOLE.



Mr ADDIS advised me that he would continue with enquiries            in relation

to the temporary mo r tu ar y, assisted by Mr McKAY.       Whilst we were

speaking    I was being advised that there was apparently outbreaks of

public disor der , involving supporters making their way tosck towards

the city centre.



Conscious of the fact that I was the senior Divisional Officer on duty

that day,   I arranged with Mr ADDIS to leave the temporary mortuary and

return to the city centre to co-ordinate events there.           As I was

leaving Hillsborough I recall deploying Inspector DEWS <now Chief

Inspector) and his units to the city centre to quell any outbreaks of

disorder.     I then made my way, with Sergeant JONES to the city centre

to co-ordinate events.



I then spent some considerable time visiting junior officers of my

Division,   de-briefing them and counselling those that were in obvious
                                                                             PAGE      8


       , need of counselling.       I returned to West Bar Police Station later that

         evening where I had a discussion with my Commander,      Chief

         Superintendent BROOMHEAD (presently performing duties as the Acting

         Assistant Chief Constable       (Operations)



         Further de-briefings took place and I retired from duty at about

         9.00   pm.   (2100)



                                                                    L BATES SIGNED

            INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND

            SHEFFIELD ON SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1989 (150489)



            CLIVE WAIN     POLICE CONSTABLE 535   Cl, UNIFORM




            1 am a Police Constable of the South Yorkshire Police,             currently

            stationed at Main St Police Station, Rotherham.



            At 0830 hours on Saturday 15th April         1989   (150489)   I paraded on duty

            at Main St Police Station, Rotherham,        for the FA cup Semi Final

            football match between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC, to be

            held that afternoon at the Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield.
                                                                           PAGE       2


I was informed that I would be working       in Serial    number 39,    under

the supervision of Inspector MEAK and Police Sergeant DOYLE, and

shortly afterwards my Serial and others were conveyed to

Hillsborough by coach.



Once at the football     ground all Serials congregated in the North Stand

and at approximately 1000 hours, were briefed by Senior Officers.

Informed that Serial 3 9 ’s duties before the match were to supervise

the arrival,     parking and off loading of Liverpool         supporters coaches

on Halifax R d .



At 1113 hours,     in company with POL PC578 ROWLEY,      1   assumed position on

Halifax Rd outside the lower entrance to the         ’Wadsley B r i d g e ’ Working

M e n ’s Club.   Coaches slowly starting to arrive.



At 1415 hours,     coaches arrivng   in profusion.   Large number of fans

making their way to the Working M e n ’s Club? White Lion Public House

and                             Many fans appear good humoured and

abundance of canned beer carried by fans.        Many empty beer cans left

on coaches.



Large   numbers of Liverpool   fans appear to be under the influence of

alcohol, a number of which are spoken to regarding their behaviour by

myself and PC ROWLEY.      Throwing cans and beer at each other,         etc.



One youth who appears very drunk is advised by me for urinating in

the middle of Halifax Rd.      At 2.45 pm some fans are still making their

way to the Wadsley Bridge Working Mens Club.         News received from other

officers that I                           has shut shop due to the behaviour

of fans.     2.50 pm Liverpool fans escorted down Halifax Road towards
the ground.    Halifax Road is now a mass of beer cans and bottles which

are strewn on the roadside,    pavement and gardens.        One youth advised

by PC 2560 Ball    in the presence of myself and PC Rowley for urinating

in a front garden.     Fans at this time do not seem to be in a hurry to

get to the ground as they continue to drink from cans and beer

bottles.    Slowly making their way down Halifax Road.         2.58 pm fight

inside the gate public house on arrival two youths were outside the

pub.   One a Liverpool   fan the other a local.     Youths squaring up to

each other.   Separated and advised that they would be arrested should

they continue?    other officers present.     Many fans enquire regarding

the availability of match tickets,    informed none available at the

ground but they continue to make their slow journey to the ground.              3.
                                                                         J

00 pm at junction of Claywheels Lane liase with serials 39 and 40 in

preparation for meal break.     At 3.02 pm as a result of a radio message

received that their was a disturbance at the Leppings Lane end of the

ground serials 39 and 40 make their way to that location.           On arrival

large numbers of supporters are in the roadway completely blocking the

road and the entrance to the ground.        Ambulance seen to arrive and

slowly make its way through a mass of fans.        I made my way to the

turnstile entrance in company with other officers where a cordon is

formed in front of the turnstiles to relieve pressure on the gates.

Supporters are urged to retreat and cease pushing forward to effect

entry into the ground.     Many fans are abusive and large numbers appear

to be under the influence of intoxicants.        Horses also    in attendance.

Order then given for serials 39 and 40 to enter the rear of the

Leppings Lane Terrace through open gate and tunnel          into the middle

section of terracing behind the goal.        At this time    I saw bodies of.

Liverpool   fans laid in the tunnel and also many scattered on the floor

in the terracing section near to the front wall and fencing.           I made

my way through the tunnel down towards the fence behind the goal and
                                                                     PAGE        4


as I was doing so one supporter grabbed hold of me by the front of my

coat shouting,   "You black cunts.    Look at this,   this is your fucking

fault.5'   I do not make a reply to the youth but pushed him aside in

order to get to the front of the terracing where the bodies were

laid.   At this time myself and PC 14 Quayum were split up from the

rest of the serials 39 and 40 and I began to assist the human chain

of Police officers which had formed passing the bodies of supporters

to the back of the terraces and through the tunnel.        I assisted to

pass several bodies none of which     I could describe except to say that

they were all male and aged between 20 and 30 years.        The perimeter

fence was shortly afterwards forced open and I went on to the football

pitch to assist with the many bodies and injured supporters that had

been removed from the terraces.      Many fans at this time were very

aggressive towards the Police shouting,     "Murderers."   Most of which

appeared to be under the influence of intoxicants.       A large number of

supporters we re also helping the Police in their attempts to

resuscitate bodies and render first aid.      1 saw a youth aged

approximately IS yrs laid on his back                                      ind

face.   I placed this youth into the recovery position noticing that

his breathing was in order,    I also noticed that this youth smelled

strongly of intoxicants.    Many of the bodies that were beyond help

were covered with coats and I assisted with other officers and

supporters to convey these bodeis across the length of the pitch to

the rear of the North Stand.    Advertising boards from the sides of the

perimeter area of the pitch were used as makeshift stretchers.         I made

four journeys to the rear of the North Stand with bodes placing them

on the ground alongside the many that already lay there.        Injured

supporters   I could see had been moved to an area of the pitch near to

the players tunnel.   Two ambulances arrived and travelled the full

length of the pitch to get to the scene.      Police officers form a
cordon on the half way line of the pitch and a small number of

Liverpool   fans rushed at the cordon in an attempt to get to the

Nottingham Forest end of the ground.     The Fire Service also attend at

the ground.     A section of the crowd run and attack a photographer that

is present in the goalmouth at the Leppings Lane End and shortly

afterwards Kenny D a 1g 1ish the Liverpool FC Manager makes an

announcement over the public address system urging Liverpool

supporters to calm down and assist the Police and other emergency

services.     The victims of this incident by now appear to have been

removed from the terracing and football    pitch.     At 4,20 pm an

announcement was made to the effect that the game would be postponed

until further notice at a later date.     Suporters were asked to remain

seated and in their    respective standing positions for the time being.

On hearing this the supporters    cheered and started to disperse from

the ground,    large numbers of Police Officers also    left the ground to

supervise the large numbers of fans outside.        A short time later

serials 39 and 40 liaised on the pitch and made their way to the North

Stand where at 5.45 pm a de brief took place conducted by various

senior officers where the majority of the serials were stood down.

Along with other officers I was conveyed by bus from Claywheels Lane

back to Main Street Police Station,    Rotherham, arriving at 6.55 pm.

7.00 pm off duty.     Only sergeants and Inspectors and above had a

personal    radio during and before this incident.

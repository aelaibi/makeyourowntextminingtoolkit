A ccepting th e need f o r i d e n t i f i c a t i o n and evidence g a th e r in g f o r

Technical Considerations
(a)      At th e time o f i n s t a l l a t i o n , c o n s id e r a tio n should be given
         to th e s i t i n g o f cameras and c a b le s so a s to p re v e n t

(b)      As good video re c o rd in g r e q u i r e s good l i g h t and as most
         f o o t b a l l f i x t u r e s a r e played during w in te r months, th e
         need f o r adequate l i g h t i n g w ith in and around f o o t b a l l

         may be used as cover f o r d i s o r d e r l y b e h av io u r.                  Fans a re
         i n c r e a s i n g l y aware t h a t such behaviour i s m onitored by
         C.C.T.V. and they w i l l a tte m p t to evade d e t e c t i o n by
         seeking w hatever cover i s a v a i l a b l e .                        I t is therefore
         im p o rta n t t h a t cameras a r e s i t e d in such a way a s to
         minimise b l i n d s p o ts and t h a t f a c i l i t i e s a r e p rovided to

                          is E^ obably unique In the way that it Involves different Police
     ^ , “        9 with offenders who are from other Police districts. The key technique
     of hooliganism is the trouble that occurs in relation to visiting supporters- thev
     SnSlves?0^        ^ tar9St °f          ^                    ®
    The nature of the conflict is no longer simple if it ever was. We now find gangs
    organised about football clubs who will go out of their way to attack groups of
    supporters simply passing through their "territory". Hooligan gangs transfer their
                          fc°    eVBnt ^       primarily involved in disturbances when
    their Hcxne Club has no fixture and on other than match days*

    We have achieved a great deal to contain disorder and the regular conduct in the
    mainstream of football attendances.

    Whilst at most games the opportunity to make trouble is restricted, the atmosphere
    remains unpleasant and the potential for disorder fairly obvious. At the m i w time,
    outside the net of police control, football hooligans succeed in violent encounters.

^                          intelligence we have developed and particularly in
                           ¥ work done by covert teams it seems fairly clear that the
    worst of the^problem relates to persistent hooligan gangs some of which are well
    organised and who plan a strategy of violence.

    The strategy has got to be based upon the identification of persistent hooligans and
    gangs with a view to targetting Police efforts on them.

    The existing football liaison system is concerned with match information (numbers of
    travelling fans, modes of transport, train times etc.) rather than intelligence as
           Intelligence can be more properly defined as information as to the identity
    and background of persistent hooligans and hooligan gangs and their known strategies
    and future plans. (The general purpose of a National Football Intelligence Unit is
    to receive, evaluate and disseminate football intelligence of this kind and to
    promote the development of intelligence in participant Farces.)
    LOCMICN
    It is proposed that the National Football Intelligence Unit (N.F.I.U.) be irrat-afl in
    London. The reasons for this are as follows:

      (i) The major international football stadium is located at Wembley, within London.

     (ii) London las the largest concentration of Football League frinw* of any citv in
          the United Kingdom.

    (iii) London is the major nodal point for football fans travelling to and fron
          matches.

     (iv)    The British Transport Police Headquarters is situated within London. They
            have responsibility for both travelling fans and house the United Kingdom
            Permanent Correspondent in the TREVI organisation.

      (v) The offices of the Football Association are in London.

     (vi) Other inportant liaison bodies are also located here, e.g. D.O.T., Interpol,
          British Rail, etc.
      intelligence role of the N.F.I.U, would comprise three major elements.
(a)     Intelligence concerning known hooligans and hooligan       gangs.

(b)     General information concerning the hooligan problem.

(c)     Liaison batween police covert operations and other intelligence sources.
(a)     Intelligence Oonoerainq Known Hooligans

        A number of publications and complementary indices will require Tna-irvt-pfnanra to
        catalogue and order information in order that intelligence may be disseminated
        to those responsible for policing; as follows:

          (i) Index of target/main hooligans.

         (11) Index of known hooligan gangs.
        (iii) National team hooligan index.
         (iv) Rogue coach operators/vehicle index.

          (v) Register of Exclusion Orders.

         (vi) Criminal names index on P.N.C. to be flagged for interest of N.P.I.U.

        (vii) Publication of intelligence bulletins.

(b)     General   In£onmH«xt Qonopmlnq   the   HpWigan Pmhlem

          (i) Information regarding the travel movements of known hooligans to
              include their routes, Forces affected, mode of travel, numbers,
              flashpoints, previous listing and current plans.

         (ii)   Known hoEligan gang strategies including methods of ambush, weapons
                used, methods of secreting prohibited articles.

        (iii) A public ’phone-in* facility for citizens having information for the
              Police.

         (iv) Monitoring of international fan movements.

          (v) Monitoring of media reports.
         (vi) Maintenance of record of notable incidents, patterns, trends,
              anniversaries etc.
        (vii) Index of Coach Operators.
        TAalson Functions
          CD    Liaison with B.T.P./lMEVI (includes contact with European Police
                Farces).

         (ii) Knowledge of current and past covert operations and intelligence
              support to them.

        (iii) Liaison with Regional Criminal Intelligence Offices.
                                                  - 4 -
               (iv) To receive local intelligence reports.

                (v) Liaision with National Membership Scheme.

                      In light of the provisions of the Data Protection Act/ it would be
                      advisable if a condition of membership of the scheme was agreement that
                      the members' details would be made available on request by Police for
                      the purposes of crime prevention or the investigation of crime.

               (vi) Index of local football intelligence officers/officers or contact
                    points within United Kingdom Police Forces.
    STAFFING
    It is proposed that the Police staff be seconded from their home Forces to the Hone
    Office for duty in the N.F.I.U.

    A provisional structure might be as follows:

    Superintendent
    --       Officer in Charge of the Unit. In the early years of this Unit he will be
W            responsible for ensuring that the Unit is soundly structured and financed. He
             will have an important role visiting and liaising with other Police Forces to
             establish a national football intelligence network.

             It may be possible eventually for this post to be shared part time with other
             Home Office funded posts based at New Scotland Yard.
    Chief Inspector
             Responsible for the day to day running of the office.

    Inspector
             Monitoring and liaison functions. Deputy to the Chief Inspector.

    Detective Sergeants (3)
             Intelligence Officers.

    Intelligence Clerks (3)
             Assistants to the Intelligence Officers/Computer Operators.
i- \
    Administration Support
             Typist

    Hours of duty in this office may need to take into account the pattern and timing of
    football matches. Scxne shiftwork would be inevitable. A suggested format would be:

    MDNDAY            8.00 a.m. - 4.00 p.m.        One Officer (should be an Officer who
                                                   performed duty on the preceeding Saturday)

    TUESDAY           9.00 a.m. - 5.00 p.m.)
                      3.00 p.m. - 11.00 p.m.)
                                              )    Duties as required taking account of
                                              )    midweek matches.
    WEDNESDAY          9.00 a.m. - 5.00 p.m. )
                      3.00 p.m. -11.00 p.m. )
    THURSDAY          8.00 a.m. - 4.00 p.m.        Updating of intelligence, preparation of
                                                   bulletins etc.
  FRIDAY          8.00 a.m. - 12 midnight     Officers on duty to include a Supervisor.
                                              Anticipated collation of covertly gathered
                                              intelligence.
  SATURDAY        9.00 a.m. - 5.00 p.m.
                   3.00 p.m. - 11.00 p.m.

  SUNDAY          Duties as directed for occasional Sunday games otherwise this is
                  normally a rest day for the full office.

  DOCDMENT&TiaN
  It is essential that nationally recognised and standardised formats are adopted for
  the recording of all information and intelligence of interest to the N.F.I.U.

  This will enable the local Force football intelligence systems to mirror the national
  requirement and allow for efficient information exchange.

  The systems adopted should also be such that they may be readily transposed onto
  computer, since it is clear that computerisation of the information will greatly
          the evaluative process.
  The manual documentation system will require some wider consultation before agreement
  to ensure that indices are ccnplanentary and meet the necessary requirements.

  Some draft forms for this documentation are included at Appendix 'A'.



  Clearly, a computer with automatic cross indexing and random search facilities is
  highly desirable for the National Unit. Such a configuration already exists at
  S.0.11 Branch of the Metropolitan Police. Initial enquiries have indicated that the
  computer has ample capacity to absorb the workload and that the existing fields of
  search are largely compatible with the identified need.

  A decision to pursue this course would undoubtedly speed the process of
  inplementation.
  At a local Force level, it is unlikely that computerised intelligence systems would
  be necessary, except in the case of those Forces responsible for a large number of
vfootball clubs.

  Enquiry will need to be made with the Metropolitan Police regarding reimbursement for
  the use of the facility but any such cost would be only a fraction of that incurred
  through purchase of a new system.
  In addition to the computer, the provision of a FAX facility would clearly be
  beneficial for the accurate and quick transmission of information. It is
  particularly valuable in relation to receipt of information from abroad where
  language difficulties can create opportunity for mistakes and misinterpretation.

  nam es

  A recent meeting at the Home Office suggested that funding could be made available
  from central government to finance this unit.
  No total cost may be placed on the unit at this stage, however, a Metropolitan Police
  Finance Branch Ready Reckoner of costs is attached for guidance and an initial
  estimate follows:

d a t e , th e e x c lu sio n o rd e rs under S e c tio n 30, P u b lic Order A ct, 1986, have

proved a dismal f a i l u r e .          Courts have sometimes been r e l u c t a n t to impose

bans and,        where      they have, th e bans have been                         o f so s h o r t a d u ra tio n as to

make them i r r e l e v a n t . This i s an is s u e which c l e a r l y needs a d d re ss in g - a

complex le g a l power, on th e fa c e o f i t th e utmost le g a l sa n c tio n a g a i n s t

th e f o o t b a l l h o olig an , t h a t in some case s f o r example r e s u l t s in banning

him from games f o r th r e e months from th e l a s t game o f th e season (th e r e

                      Aside from th e s e is s u e s i t i s a ls o c l e a r t h a t hooliganism in

 Aggressive m a s c u lin ity , i f n o t c h an n e lle d elsew h ere, i s r e g r e t t a b l y more

 e v id e n t a s crim inal rowdyism and a s s a u l t in our d a ily l i v e s than c e r t a i n l y

which policeman have rec o g n ise d f o r a long time and which i t seems the

an u n b rid le d contempt f o r d ecent s tan d a rd s and law enforcement.



                     Consequently a s p e c i f i c s t r a t e g y a g a i n s t f o o tb a ll hooliganism ,

it    has       to        be   recognised as             a    p rio rity            by      P o lic e and Courts          alik e.

I r o n i c a l l y d i s o r d e r as such does n o t r e g i s t e r in n a tio n a l crime s t a t i s t i c s

and t r a d i t i o n a l l y , perhaps because o f th e \nay evidence has been p re s e n te d

(it     is      n o to r io u s ly     d iffic u lt          in      verbal          testim ony      to r e c r e a t e      th e

                     Recent even ts in Germany have i l l u s t r a t e d t o both p u b lic and

                   Whatever longer term measures in r e s p e c t o f th e r e g u la tio n o f

 foo tb all       become       a p p r o p r ia te     (and    of    course       they     are      under      activ e

                   During       th e      last       th re e   years,      th e ACPO        Sub-Committee           on

Hooliganism in S p o rt has developed a coirprehensive guidance document on

two a re a s a t l e a s t , we have n o t achieved as much as may be p o s s i b l e .                           CCTV

                      There a re probably two p o s s ib le o v e ra ll s t r a t e g i e s f o r d e a lin g

  w ith f o o tb a ll hooliganism which in a sense a re complementary.                                 The f i r s t

  is    'co n ta in m e n t' and th e second ' e x c l u s i o n '. The idea o f containment i s

  p re v e n tiv e     and pre-em p tive.          It    is     larg ely    embodied in         th e    document

 th a t i t    i s brought under re a so n a b le c o n t r o l .          Regulatory methods remain

 something           o f an enigma and may a t                b e s t be only p a r t o f th e          answer.

 A s s e rtiv e enforcment i s an o p tio n which we have begun to e x p lo re by viay o f

                     In s h o r t we have achieved containm ent,                i t s e l f a c o n sid e ra b le

much more to t a r g e t hooligan gangs and e n fo rc e th e law a g a i n s t them.



BEHAVIOURAL THRESHOLDS


                  P a ra d o x ic a lly , because they a re p r o te c te d by th e P o lic e , one o f

th e consequences o f containm ent i s t h a t r i v a l groups tend to be c o r r a l l e d
t o g e th e r so t h a t they can demonstrate t h e i r                            alleg ien ce            and ag g re ssio n

towards each o th e r w ith o u t r e s t r a i n t . Equally and r e g r e t t a b l y we have come

to a c c e p t and condone very low s ta n d a rd s o f behaviour p a r t i c u l a r l y in th e

obscene ch an tin g s and r i t u a l t a u n tin g o f hooligan groups.



                     A lso, w h i l s t i t i s o f te n argued t h a t s in c e the i n tr o d u c ti o n o f

                     Aside from th e is s u e o f t a r g e t t l n g hooligan groups th e r e i s a

            With      all these things in mind,                  the ACPO Sub-Committee on

Hooliganism        at        Sporting       Events     extended    its     work    in    football

videoing     and      a      Working       Party   was   set up to examine the legal,

technical,       professional and practical issues and to develop codes

of best practice and advice on usage.                          This report is now almost

complete     and recommends a wide and general usage of photographic

means in all aspects of police work.



            It    seems inevitable that ever greater demands will be made

to evaluate new equipment and examine or modify kit for specialist

purposes.         This        is    particularly       so as the state of the art is

changing,    such that there is now much greater versatility both in

terms of equipment and techniques.



PRIORITY




            On    a     weekly       basis for most       of      the year,       thousands of

policemen perform sometimes hazardous duty throughout England and

Wales.       Only some 30%of the cost of policemanpower is recoverable

and thereal burden in terms of                       lost opportunity for other kinds

of policing is immense.                The Service has achieved an enormous amount

and     in most       cases        successfully       contains     these    public       sporting

occasions,       but it has to be said that almost always there remains

a sinister potential for savage crowd violence.                             A great deal is

being    done      to        develop       intelligence    and     attack    the       organising

elements,    but        we    can    never be        satisfied     so    long     as    routinely

offensive    and        belligerent         behaviour     on the terraces is manifest

and blatent.          The effective use of CCTV taken far beyond what we

have achieved to date, allows for the possibility of the conduct

being    eliminated.           For these reasons,          support in all respects for

the   programme         deserves       a    high   priority.       If, admittedly over a

period of some years, a sea-change can be
e f f e c t e d in crowd behaviour th e savings f o r th e P o lic e S e rv ic e would be

enormous.              I f we do n o t make f u l l use o f t h i s o p p o tun ity i t i s l i k e l y we

w ill spend th e nex t decade assem bling e v e r l a r g e r nunfoers o f men to stand

 Safety Evacuation

The need for the annual inspection of grounds covered by safety certificates
had been strongly recommended by the Sub-Committee, this had been endorsed by
Mr. Justice Popplewell in his final report. There was also a need for an
 expert" in each force who was fully aware of the provisions of the Home
Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds,(Green Guide) to advise during the
certification process. Mr. Phillips strongly recommended annual inspection
both as to grounds and stewarding.

Questions were asked about the policy of full pitch perimeter fencing.
Mr* Phillips summarised the ACPO view and pointed out where there was good
crowd behaviour perimeter fencing was not mandatory.

Ground sharing meant a minimum of 50 matches per season at the club doubled
the commitment of local Police. An encouraging factor was that club favours
were beginning to be worn again. Derby matches where there was ground
sharing were particularly difficult as each set of supporters considered
themselves to be athome.       There were also stewarding problems      and
conflicting arrangements between the Clubs.

                      e)      Play-offs

1                            Two clubs (Crystal Palace, Birmingham) had experienced further
                             problems with the play-offs.        Neither club was directly
    I                        involved, but both their grounds had been selected for the
                              'finals'. At Crystal Palace no consultations had taken place
                             with the police and the game had been arranged for a Friday
                             night, a night that is never used for games because of joint
    II                       car parking arrangements with a local supermarket.            At
    H                        Birmingham the ticket allocation was split 50:50, giving 12,500
                              to both Leeds and Charlton fans, although Leeds alone requested
    ■                        30 ,000 .

                      f)     All ticket matches - the stipulation of an all ticket match
                             does not help policing unless a capacity crowd attends. Often
                              tickets are obtained by one team's fans for areas reserved for
    1                         the other team's fans with the consequent policing problems.
                             To reduce this problem itis essential to police the ticket
                             sales at both outlets.      For thefirst game of the season,
    1                        2/3,000 Leeds supporters arrived      at the Blackburn ground
                             without tickets and because of the public disorder potential
                             were allowed in. This set the tone for the season for these
                              fans and they frequently arrived at away grounds in large
        I                    numbers without money or tickets in an attempt to force the
                             police ground commander into allowing than admittance. The
        I                    meeting agreed that this was a difficult situation to resolve,
                             but felt that a firm stand should be taken and entry refused,
                              the consequent problems outside the ground being resolved by
                             prior planning. The police must be seen to 'win' in these
        1                     situations.

                     g)      Late kick-offs - another situation where supporters were seen
                              to be forcing the police into taking action against their
        1                    better judgement.    It has become increasingly apparent that
                              large numbers of spectators are arriving extremely late at the

        I                     ground, this may be related to the restricted access to alcohol
                              in grounds and the prohibition on taking alcohol into grounds.
                              Because of the potential for disorder amongst those waiting
                              entry, police ground commanders have occasionally requested
                              that the kick-off be delayed.      It was the opinion of the
            1                meeting that this pressure should not be acceded to in future,
                              the police should not be dictated to by supporters.

                      e)     Pitch Invasions - seen as a problem by some clubs (Coventry,
                              Charlton, Q.P.R.) and not by others (Arsenal, Watford, West
                              Ham) who do not have any pitch perimeter fencing.         After
                              discussion, it was agreed that whether perimeter fencing should
                              or should not be installed was a local decision to be made
            1                 after considering the ground conditions and the experience of
              fan behaviour. However, it was generally agreed that pitch
              invasions should be stopped as they have the potential to
              degenerate to major disorder.

      ^       Evacuation - evacuation exercises were practiced         at some
               grounds (Manchester United, Everton, Liverpool) where public
               announcements are made, emergency bells checked and all
               evacuation doors opened and checked by police. This does not
               involve the actual evacuation of the ground, but tests the
               mechanical parts of the system. At most grounds certain police
               officers are issued with universal lock keys.Leicester
               reported on the electrically operated exit gate system and
               exercises which are practiced there with the fire and ambulance
               services to test call-out times.

      k)      Miscellaneous - many representatives reported pressure from
               clubs to reduce manpower levels. Mr. Phillips pointed out that
               it was a condition of the General Safety Certificate that the
               responsibility to decide on manpower levels was the Chief
               Constable's.

              At one club (Arsenal) ticket sales were allowed immediately
              after a game, this was not recommended as both sets of fans
              mingled whilst trying to purchase these tickets with obvious
              disorder potential.

Safety of Sports Grounds

  • Phillips stated that ground commanders should inspect details of the
certificate annually and submit recommendations for work perhaps to be
carried out incrementally so that it doesn't overawe the club.    Safety
requirements varied in accordance with changing patterns of use.

ChiefSuperintendent Bruce, (Cleveland) stated that they had prepared a
maintenance and good practice schedule which he was willing to supply to
other forces. The meeting approved of the booklet and found it to be a
useful reference.

NOTE OF THE SECOND DIVISION FOOTBALL LEAGUE
8TH AND 9TH JUNE 1988
Closure of Public Houses

It was suggested that where trouble is anticipated at certain venues,
consideration should be given to liaising with breweries upon the closure of
public houses in the immediate vicinity of football grounds.       Licensing
magistrates in York had at the request of the police ordered the closure of
certain public houses where trouble had ensued in the past.

1^»   Bans Imposed by the Football Association and League
      Chief Superintendent Stainton (Cumbria) posed the difficulties in
      policing football grounds and fixtures which involve a visiting club
      whose supporters have been banned and arrive on mass. In order to
I
                                         -   4   -




I          maintain ACPO'S policy of keeping out banned visiting supporters, the
           cost of police resources were high. The repercussions from setting up
■          road blocks and keeping out banned spectators upon unsuspecting
■          neighbouring police areas, together with allowing the spectators into
           the ground were discussed at length. It was acknowledged there was no
■          easy solution to this problem but unless excluded supporters were
           confronted they would continue to travel. It was necessary to have a
           plan to deter and contain them.

£|   15-   All Ticket Fixtures Imposed by FA/League

           Chief Inspector Richardson (Durham) related experiences of difficulty

I          in policing football matches that had been declared 'all ticket' by fche
           FA/League without consulting the relevant police force as to whether
           such a restriction could be enforced successfully. Small clubs do not
           apply these restrictions rigidly because of their financial position.
I          Therefore he requested that ACPO consult with the authorities on this
           subject.

               after a game, this was not recommended as both sets of fans
               mingled whilst trying to purchase these tickets with obvious
               disorder potential.

Safety of Snorts Grounds

Mr. Phillips stated that ground commanders should inspect details of the
certificateannually and submit      recommendations for work perhaps to be
carried out incrementally so that it doesn’t overawe the club.        Safety
requirements varied in accordance with changing patterns of use.

Chief Superintendent Bruce, (Cleveland) stated that they had prepared a
maintenance and good practice schedule which he was willing to supply to
other forces. The meeting approved of the booklet and found it to be a
useful reference.

Closure of Public Houses

It was suggested that where trouble is anticipated at certain venues,
consideration should be given to liaising with breweries upon the closure of
public houses in the immediate vicinity of football grounds. Licensing
magistrates in York had at the request of the police ordered the closure of
certain public houses where trouble had ensued in the past.

      Bans Imposed by the Football Association and League

      Chief Superintendent Stainton (Cumbria) posed the difficulties in
      policing football grounds and fixtures which involve a visiting club
      whose supporters have been banned and arrive on mass. In order to
I
                                         - 4-

^          maintain ACPO'S policy of keeping out banned visiting supporters, the
I          cost of police resources were high. The repercussions from setting up
            road blocks and keeping out banned spectators upon unsuspecting
            neighbouring police areas, together with allowing the spectators into
            the ground were discussed at length. It was acknowledged there was no
I          easy solution to this problem but unless excluded supporters were
            confronted they would continue to travel. It was necessary to have a
            plan to deter and contain them.

£j   15.   All Ticket Fixtures Imposed by FA/League
           Chief Inspector Richardson (Durham) related experiences of difficulty
I          in policing football matches that had been declared ’all ticket’ by the
           FA/League without consulting the relevant police force as to whether
           such a restriction could be enforced successfully. Small clubs do not
m          apply these restrictions rigidly because of their financial position.
■          Therefore he requested that ACPO consult with the authorities on this
■          subject.

           I t was a n tic ip a te d t h a t th e club would have approximately 30,000

BRIGHTON
A 'S p o t t e r Squad' which was introduced l a s t season appears to
have reduced problems both a t home and away games.

Comment was made on th e stan d ard of behaviour by p la y e rs and o f f i c i a l s of

Obscene c h an tin g was s t i l l a problem and 1t was suggested t h a t CCTV and

I t was accep ted t h e r e was a need f o r d is c u s s io n s w ith th e FA on ground

The main is su e s d iscu ssed were

ALCOHOL ACT
Overall th e e f f e c t s of th e Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol) Act 1985
appear t o have been b e n e f i c i a l . Amendments t o th e Act contained 1n th e
Public Order B ill which widen i t s scope t o cover p r iv a te h i r e minl-coahces
were welcomed and should be on th e s t a t u t e books f o r th e s t a r t of th e new

I t should a ls o be noted t h a t , as f a r as a r r e s t s in d ic a te d , c o ntro l             of
alcohol a t grounds had produced th e same r e s u l t s as t o t a l bans.


CCTV
th e use o f CCTV had been pioneered through experiments a t Edinburgh,
Manchester and Birmingham and as a r e s u l t th e Sub-Comml t t e e had had a ^ t
major Input by way of advice t o both th e Department of th e Environment a n d ^ P
th e Football T rust regarding i t s i n s t a l l a t i o n and u s e . There was no
stan d a rd package as i t was recognised t h a t each ground had I t s own sp ec ia l
f e a tu r e s and each system had t o be ground s p e c i f i c .

The 'H oolivan' had produced lim ite d r e s u l t s and th e                  lack of speed 1n pan
and t i l t r e s t r i c t e d i t s v a lu e . W hilst i t may have         had some p re v e n ta tiv e

accepted t h a t 1 t was not designed f o r fo o tb a ll and                  t h a t I t s b e st use in
r e l a t i o n t o fo o tb a ll was probably a t s t a t i c p o in ts       such as bus and r a i l
sta tio n s.

IDENTIFICATION CARDS AND SCHEMES
Members of th e Sub-Committee had tak en p a r t 1n a Football League Working
Group on Membership schemes which had concluded t h a t t o t a l membership
schemes were f e a s i b l e . This had confirmed t h e p re v io u sly held ACPO view.
I t had a ls o been noted t h a t although 1n h is In te rim r e p o r t Mr. J u s t i c e
Popplewell had recommended such schemes t h e f i n a l r e p o r t recom ended 'some                        '
form* o f membership schemes. This f e l l I n to l i n e w ith t h e ACPO view t h a t
In c lu s iv e or family club schemes should be encouraged.
                                                    - 5-
There were several reasons why t o t a l schemes had been seen as unworkable
but th e most serio u s d i f f i c u l t y had been th e problem of member
v e r i f i c a t i o n . Only th e P o lice were in a p o s itio n t o v e r if y th e bona-fides
of a p p lic a n ts and determine who, because of c o n v ic tio n s say , should be
excluded, but c l e a r l y such inform ation was held c o n f i d e n t i a l l y .
I t was noted t h a t Luton Town a re t o in tro d u ce a t o t a l scheme f o r th e
1986/87 season and t h i s would be watched with i n t e r e s t .

SEARCHING
The Sub-Committee had f r e q u e n tly and c o n s i s t e n t l y voiced t h e i r d is q u ie t a t
th e lack of a s t a t u t o r y power t o s e a rc h . They had been supported in t h e i r
stan c e by Mr. J u s t i c e Popplewell in h is f in a l re p o rt although th e
Government had as y e t taken no a c tio n in re s p e c t of t h i s recommendation.
Whilst th e Football League had included search in g as a c o n d itio n of e n try
in i t s Ground R egulations le g a l opinion was t h a t Ground R egulations would
give l i t t l e p ro te c tio n in law t o th e o f f i c e r s . .

In a d d itio n t o problems a t grounds th e lack of a power t o search fans in
t r a n s i t or a t Railway S ta tio n s a ls o caused d i f f i c u l t i e s .

POLICE CHARGES
This m a tte r i s c u r r e n tly th e s u b je c t of a review by th e Sub-Consnittee as a
need had been i d e n t i f i e d f o r a move towards a common approach in re s p e c t
of c h a rg e s .  I t had been recognised t h a t Football Clubs do t a l k t o each
o th e r and in tim es of fin a n c ia l hardship were looking a t a l l ways of
cu ttin g c o sts.

The is s u e depended in p a r t on th e outcome of H arris - v - S h e ff ie ld United

SAFETY EVACUATION
The need f o r th e annual In sp e c tio n of grounds covered by s a f e ty

been endorsed by Mr. J u s t i c e Popplewell in h is f in a l r e p o r t .               There was

                     HELD AT R.A.F. CARDINGTON, BEDFORDSHIRE
                    ON WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY 1ST/2ND JUNE. 1988


The meeting was chaired by J.S. Evans Esq., Deputy Chief Constable, Surrey
Constabulary and Assistant Chief Constable J.D. Phillips, Greater Manchester
Police, performed the duties of Secretary.


The only club not represented was West Ham United.        Watford, Portmouth and
Chelsea (relegated from Division 1). However, Middlesbrough, Aston Villa and
Millwall (promoted to Division 1) had representatives at the meeting.

1.    Opening Address


      Mr. Evans opened the meeting, welcomed all present and introduced Chief
      Constable A. Dyer, Bedfordshire Constabulary.


      Mr. Dyer welcomed everyone to the meeting. He emphasised the need to
      critically examine the current method of policing football matches and
      expressed his disappointment in the lack of support and evidence given to
      the Luton Scheme which had been successful in diminishing the hooliganism
      element in the ground and in the town on match days at Luton, and asked
      for officers at the meeting to carefully consider whether the present
      method of policing football matches was right.      He conveyed his good
      wishes and hoped it would be a good meeting.


      Mr. Evans thanked Mr. Dyer for his warm welcome. He stated that the past
      season had been uncontraversial apart from the play-offs at the end of the
      season and the result of the trials of the covert operations in London.
      This presented a need for the police to address the way the hooliganism
      problem associated with football was policed, and gave an outline of the
      programme agenda which appeared to answer this point.


2*    Update of the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee Meetings on Hooliganism at
      Sporting Events


      Mr. Phillips related to the minutes of the last meeting. The first point
      concerned an examination of the membership scheme and alternatives like
      the Luton scheme.
He referred to John Williams of the research group at Leicester University
studying these methods and pointed out the merits and disadvantages of the
alternatives to the present system. He pointed out that the problems of
football hooliganism did not only relate to this country, but to other
European countries and even in China and Russia.


Mr. Phillips then expanded upon the options to policing football, i.e.,
continued containment and its cost; a far greater level of enforcement and
attacking target hooligans and gangs through intelligence methods, rather
than accept and condone the present standard of belligerance; the Luton
Scheme with exclusion of away supporters. Other points being considered
by the Sub-Committee were the membership schemes; reciprocal membership
schemes; and covert operations discussed in more detail later on in the
meeting. Mr. Phillips stated the Sub-Committee was preparing a document
on best practice in covert operations and the introduction of a National
Football Intelligence Unit which was presented later on in the meeting.
Mr. Phillips briefly outlined the progress of the working party on
C.C.T.V., hand-held video and still photography and highlighted the
practical legal issues. Photographic evidence gave dramatic results in
court and this was an area to be studied. He mentioned policing the
European Championships and B.T.P.'s involvement as the British
correspondent to the TREVI organisation; the Sir Norman Chester Centre for
football research which was largely funded by the Football Trust had
circulated a questionnaire which was supported by       the A.C.P.O. Sub-
Committee, concerning a membership scheme. Mr. Phillips then expanded
upon the work of the Football Trust and in particular in relation to
transport problems in which the Trust were willing to help the police. He
asked that Chief Officers should write to him if they had problems in this
respect.


Coach Operators


Inspector Provoost (G.M.P.) gave a brief overview of the structure of the
Traffic Commissioners and a resume of a sequence of events that led to the
publication of the A.C.P.O. conditions, circulated by the Traffic
Commissioners as a guideline to coach operators and later questioned the
effectiveness of the guidelines.
He stressed the importance of co-ordinating the responses from football
commanders on the problems of causing coach operators to comply with the
guidelines, in order that a concerted effort could be made to bring this
to the attention of the Traffic Commissioners who may then provide
effective enforcement against rogue coach operators.

Match Information and Intelligence


Mr. Phillips outlined the problems associated with football hooliganism
which related to "gang tactics" and "strategies" and questioned how well
the police knew unruly elements that attended football matches on a
regular basis. He emphasised the need to form an intelligence system and
identify the hooligans. This could be done by using C.C.T.V. systems
effectively with trained operators, and surveillance teams. He questioned
whether it was sufficient to rely solely on a match information officer
and stated that the hooligans needed to be photographed and identified.
Intelligence was about knowing the structure plans, tactics, and identity
of the organised gangs who were creating a serious problem.


The point was raised that the problem does not often occur with the home
team supporters on their own ground or town, but whilst at away venues and
enroute to and from these venues.


The use of spotters was mentioned but Mr. Phillips queried the
effectiveness of this if an intelligence system was not fully established.

Covert Policing


Inspector Exton (Q.M.P.), highlighted the problems and pressures
associated with covert policing and stressed the necessity of properly
trained officers for covert work. Also how essential a welfare oriented
programme was throughout the operation, and especially after the operation
before the officer returned to routine police work.


He related the hooligans perception of the police and how they obtained
operational information from police officers at numerous football matches,
and how they assessed the weaknesses of police operations under the
protection of relative annonymity.
Inspector Exton also emphasised the number of crimes committed by football
hooligans which were not related to football by the police because the
time and location of the crime was outside match times. Some incidents
exposed the vulnerability of police officers, poor communications and a
lack of interest of individual officers.


A video presentation showed an incident of a pre-arranged battle between
Manchester United and City factions some distance away from the football
match at half-time, which confirmed the organisation of hooligan gangs to
promote violence.


Constable Lloyd then gave a slide presentation on a hooligan gang who had
recorded their acts of violence and other crimes with photographs and
newspaper cuttings which had been siezed by the police.      The slides
depicted the gang engaged in "battle", photographing their victims, and
mixing with police officers. He also showed illustrations of how the
hooligans concealed their weapons emphasising the vigilance to be
undertaken by police officers conducting searches, particularly at
turnstiles.


Mr. Evans summarised on the importance of good match briefings with visual
aids and hard core intelligence. The merits of using police officers of a
particular standard for football matches and of using where possible, the
same officers in specific posts and areas of football grounds.


Superintendent Martin- (Metropolitan), apprised the meeting on the position
of the recent covert operations in the Metropolitan Police area and
reassured the meeting that covert operations would continue.

C.C.T.V. Operator’s Training Course


Chief Inspector Ross (West Midlands), gave a brief outline of the course
curriculum and explained the evidence gathering techniques taught on the
C.C.T.V. and hand-held video operator's course and the area of conflict
that is likely to occur when the ground commanders require the cameras for
purposes other than evidence gathering.      He pointed out that trained
camera operators were to focus upon a certain area until they were
satisfied they had recorded sufficient evidence. Ground commanders must
appreciate that incidents could not be captured in every part of the
ground at any one time and that it was better to record at least one
incident with good evidence. If the evidence was good, but insufficient
for an immediate arrest, then a strategy should be set out to record a
sequence of incidents committed by the same people on different occasions
in order to substantiate an arrest and be in a position to present the
evidence before the court.


Chief Inspector Ross then presented a video recording which illustrated a
comparison of video recording by untrained and trained operators which
illustrated the benefit of training. Another video presentation showed
how the action of certain people in the ground could be monitored and used
as evidence, also identifying targets at close range with a portable video
camera which could either be hand-held or mounted on a tripod in a
selected part of the football ground.     He stressed the importance of
training officers to analyse video tapes and photographs after each match
to detect various incidents and to establish the identification of the
perpetrators.


Quality and Assessment of C.C.T.V. Systems


Mr. Ford gave a video presentation which illustrated the faults and
deficiencies of C.C.T.V. installations at 55 football grounds in England
and Wales. This was a result of a questionnaire sent to each respective
police force at the request of A.C.P.O. in order to ascertain the
effectiveness of C.C.T.V. systems at each football ground.


The faults included interference from radio transmission, damaged film,
worn film, dirty lens, poor maintenance, inadequate lens.      Only one
recording was suitable for evidence gathering purposes. 69% were barely
adequate for command and control purposes and in most cases they were of
little value.


Mr. Ford suggested a number of ways to improve the existing systems. The
most important thing was to have the cameras properly and regularly
serviced. A number of cameras needed to be remounted and resited and the
majority required bigger lens. He emphasised the importance of the care
of video tapes, correct storage and a limit on maximum usage. He stated
that an answer to the problem, would be to use the portable video camera
on    display, for evidence gathering purposes and outlined the added
advantages of the camera.
C.C.T.V. Operational Systems


Mr. Phillips gave a brief resume of the history of the installation of
C.C.T.V. and the inadequacies of the present fixed systems outlining the
dangers of adding to these systems without expert technical advice. He
recommended the portable video camera equipment which was on view and
stated it would accomplish the pictures required for evidence that the
fixed systems failed to produce. The portable camera would not replace
the fixed systems but complement them.


He explained that the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee were in the process of
recommending to the Football Trust the formation of a technical committee
which would give advice on the best practical methods of enhancing
existing C.C.T.V. systems efficiently and economically.     Mr. Phillips
stated that it wasn't enough to rely upon improved video equipment and
trained operators. He suggested a strategy should be adopted by ground
commanders in setting roles and training staff. He emphasised the need
for a C.C.T.V. team with a director, (where possible the football
intelligence officer) a camera operator and a photographer for still
pictures. The team should be used in conjunction with an arrest strategy
by deploying an arrest team and a follow-up enquiry team for post match
analysis. The arrest strategy would be dependent upon the video evidence
and other related matters.


Mr. Phillips added it was necessary to sustain a reasonable level of
successful prosecution from video evidence to prevent the credibility of
C.C.T.V. diminishing.


Membership Scheme and Peat Marwick Report


Mr. Phillips gave a brief resumg of the membership scheme and of the Peat
Marwick Report of which the main recommendations in the report had been
circulated. He stated the main difficulty was the configuration of the
football grounds and also that reciprocal schemes meant that grounds had
to be divided into segments which each required toilets, refreshment bars
and other facilities which were not always available.


An open discussion on this subject then took place on the problems
encountered by various ground commanders. The points discussed were lack
of consistency in the schemes; financial implications? minimum
requirement; computerised turnstiles; logistical problems, suspension of
the scheme for major games; no interest from the clubs; the Luton Scheme;
introduction legislative measures and cost effectiveness.

Referees' Guidelines Violence On The Field


Mr. Phillips gave a brief summary upon the circulated paper containing the
guidelines which have subsequently been ratified by the A.C.P.O. Council.
The guidelines were produced as a result of a meeting with representatives
from the Football Association, Professional Footballers' Association and
the Referees and Linesmen Association in which concern was expressed as to
the different practices and standards adopted by various ground commanders
and that police officers needed to be cognizant of the Football
Association's disciplinary system. Mr. Phillips said he had pointed out
to the Football Association that the police would not allow any other body
to have the right to decide to investigate criminal matters at football
grounds in England and Wales.


The guidelines were welcomed as a measure of uniformity of police action.

Issues Relating to A.C.P.O. Document 'Policing Football'


Mr. Evans invited members at the meeting for their comments upon any of
the items in the Policing Football booklet and added that there would be
an update on the C.C.T.V. section incorporating the availability of
training courses.


Photographs


The question as to the authority for the police to take photographs of
persons ejected from football grounds was raised. It was suggested that
such authority could be incorporated in the club's ground regulations.

Spotters


Mr.   Evans statedthere was a mixed response to this aspect and advised
that they should only be used with the ground commanders approval.     He
believed the system had merit.
Briefing


Mr. Evans stated that there was a need to remind officers of their common
courtesies as complaints are made about the attitude of some officers.
Suggested that a plan of the ground and immediate vicinity should be made
available. Perhaps a laminated card with a plan of the ground on one side
and the ground regulations on the other.

Exclusion Orders


Problems were occurring, particularly in London where photographs were not
a requirement on the Court order. It was suggested that where possible,
photographs should be taken at arrest centres which would obviate the
requirement at court.


A recommendation be made for a minimum of 6 copies of the photograph to be
taken for distribution.


The meeting agreed that the exclusion orders should be for a minimum of
one season for them to be effective.


Derbyshire and West Midlands stated they had meetings with the magistrates
and Crown Prosecuting Solicitors reminding them of their powers under the
Act.

Debriefings


Mr. Evans pointed out that debriefings with supervisors was vitally
important in order to improve upon policing operations.

Coach Operators


Chief Inspector Jordan, (Metropolitan - Millwall), suggested the role of
the Traffic Commissioners should be included.
Safety of Sports Grounds


Mr. Phillips stated that ground commanders should inspect details of the
certificate annually and submit recommendations for work perhaps to be
carried out incrementally so that it doesn't overawe the club. Safety
requirements varied in accordance with changing patterns of use.


Chief Superintendent Bruce, (Cleveland) stated that they had prepared a
maintenance and good practice schedule which he was willing to supply to
other forces. The meeting approved of the booklet and found it to be a
useful reference.


The Football Supporters' Associations Suggestions


Inspector Hammond   (Greater Manchester)   informed the meeting of the
suggestions the Football Supporters' Association had referred to concern
about the policing of travelling supporters in respect of retention of the
away supporters after a match, and how it affected those who had to make
their own way unescorted back to cars and vans parked away from a ground.
Also a method of providing a liaison with the local police at the football
ground. These points were left for an open discussion. It was concluded
that travellers should write to the clubs for identified parking places
near to the ground and for the association to appoint a liaison officer
and identify that person with a tabard or armband.

Open Forum


Discussions took place on the problems of the membership schemes and the
Luton Scheme and also the cost of policing football matches and the
charges made to football clubs.


Difficulties in respect of charges to football clubs were related by Chief
Superintendent Holford (Nottinghamshire), who were aware of some clubs
seeking legal advice concerning the levels of policing at matches. West
Midlands stated they were to impose increased charges to each of the six
clubs in the force area. Chief Superintendent Newlands (Metropolitan -
Arsenal), stated they had reduced costs as a result of ground improvements
which reflected on a reduction in manpower to police the ground. Also a
vast increase in the number of stewards would replace policing at the
ground, whilst a police contingent remained on standby.         Derbyshire
explained their membership scheme and the positive effect on reducing
manpower. Mr. Phillips concluded that he would appreciate any ideas which
could be suggested to football clubs for them to take the initiative in
reducing hooliganism at the grounds.

Intercept


Inspector Payne, Northamptonshire, explained the 'Intercept1 operation
they had introduced at the Motorway Service areas and the motorway
junctions throughout Northamptonshire in response to the trouble they had
experienced with football supporters enroute to other destinations and
advised other forces of the information they required and also of the
benefits that could be reciprocated (telephone P.C. Spriggs 7 OO7 OO).


Mr. Evans suggested the operation should be included in the 'Policing
Football' booklet.


European Championships


Inspector Temporal, (B.T.P.), gave an update on the current position of
the championships and the policing operations.


Mr. Evans closed the meeting by conveying his appreciation to those
present for their attendance and participation and looked forward to the
meeting next year.

              POLICE COMMANDERS AND LIAISON OFFICERS
                  HELD AT THE GREATER MANCHESTER
          POLICE TRAINING SCHOOL. SEDGLEY PARK. PRESTWICH
            ON WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY 8TH/9TH JUNE. 1988.



The meeting was Chaired by J.D. Phillips Esq., Assistant Chief
Constable, Greater Manchester Police and Inspector     Hammond,
Greater    Manchester   Police   performed   the   duties    of      Secretary.


All the football clubs in the         second division       for    the   forth­
coming season were represented.



OPENING ADDRESS


Mr. Phillips opened the meeting and welcomed all present.         Copies of the
following papers were distributed and later referred to in the meeting:
Recommendations of the Peat Marwick Report; Police Involvement
concerning Player Behaviour; CCTV Operators/Intelligence Officers Course
Curriculum; Requirement for a National Football Intelligence Unit and
A.C.P.O. Public Order Guide Policing Football.


UPDATE OF THE A.C.P.O. SUB-COMMITTEE MEETINGS ON HOOLIGANISM AT SPORTING
EVENTS


Mr. Phillips related to the minutes of the last meeting in which the
membership scheme and various alternatives such as the Luton scheme had
been researched by John Williams at Leicester University. He pointed
out the problems of football hooliganism did not only occur in this
country, but also in other European countries, China and Russia.


Mr • Phillips stated the Sub-Committee was preparing a document on best
practice in covert operations and the introduction of a National
Football Intelligence Unit.     He outlined the progress of the CCTV
Operations and Intelligence Officers Course and highlighted the
practical legal issues. Photographic evidence gave dramatic results in
court and this was an area to be expanded. The Sir Norman Chester
Centre for football research which was largely funded by the Football
Trust had circulated a questionnaire which was supported by the A.C.P.O.
Sub-Committee, concerning the membership scheme.      Mr. Phillips then
expanded upon the work of the Football Trust, and in particular in
relation to the transportation of fans, with which the Trust were
willing to help the police. He asked that Chief Officers should write
to him if they had problems in this respect.

COACH OPERATORS


Inspector Provoost (Greater Manchester) gave a brief overview of the
structure of the Traffic Commissioners and a resume of a sequence of
events that led to the publication of the A.C.P.O. conditions,
circulated by the Traffic Commissioners as a guideline to coach
operators and later questioned the effectiveness of the guidelines.


He stressed the importance of co-ordinating the responses from football
commanders on the problems of causing coach operators to comply with the
guidelines, in order that a concerted effort could be made to bring this
to the attention of the Traffic Commissioners who may then provide
effective enforcement against rogue coach operators.

MATCH INFORMATION AND INTELLIGENCE


Mr. Phillips outlined the distinction between 'match information' and
'intelligence'.   The match information had reached a good standard.
This was based on match reports and liaison officers ability to forecast
crowd numbers, modes of travel and the demeanour of fans etc.
Intelligence was relatively poor, it should focus upon the
identification of football hooligans, their associations, strategies and
plans. Mr. Phillips pointed out the problems associated with football
hooliganism which related to "gang tactics" and "strategies" and
questioned how well the police knew unruly elements that attended
football matches on a regular basis. He emphasised the need to form an
intelligence system and identify the hooligans.   This could be done by
using CCTV systems effectively with trained operators, and surveillance
teams. He questioned whether it was sufficient to rely solely upon a
football liaison officer and stated that the hooligans needed to be
     photographed and identified. Problems with hooligans seldom occurred
     with the home team supporters in the home ground, but in the vicinity of
     the ground and at away venues and also enroute to and from away venues.

5-   CCTV OPERATORS AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS COURSE


     Chief Inspector Ross (West Midlands) expounded on the course curriculum
     and the development of the course, explaining the evidence gathering
     techniques to be learned using the hand held video camera and CCTV
     systems.   He commented on the likely areas of conflict between the
     ground commanders requirements in respect of deployment and that of the
     intelligence officer in respect of evidence gathering. Chief Inspector
     Ross pointed out that operators were trained to focus upon a certain
     area until they were satisfied they had recorded sufficient evidence.
     Ground commanders must appreciate that incidents could not be captured
     in every part of the ground at any one time and that it was better to
     record at least one incident with good evidence. If the evidence was
     good, but insufficient for an immediate arrest, then a strategy should
     be set out to record a sequence of incidents committed by the same
     people on different occasions in order to substantiate an arrest and be
     in a position to present the evidence before the court.


     Chief Inspector Ross then presented a video recording which illustrated
     a comparison of video recording by untrained and trained operators which
     emphasised the benefit of training.   Another video presentation showed
     how the action of certain people in the ground could be monitored and
     used as evidence, also identifying targets at close range with a
     portable video camera which could either be hand held or mounted on a
     tripod in a selected part of the football ground.     He stressed the
     importance of training officers to analyse video tapes and photographs
     after each match to detect various incidents and to establish the
     identification of the perpetrators.

6.   COVERT POLICING


     Mr. Phillips apprised the meeting on the position of the recent covert
     operations in the Metropolitan Police area and stated that the
     Metropolitan were determined to continue with covert operations despite
     recent set-backs.



                                            - 3 -
Inspector Exton (Greater Manchester) highlighted the problems and
pressures associated with covert policing and stressed the necessity of
properly trained officers for covert work. Also how essential welfare
counselling was throughout the operation, and especially afterwards
before the officer returned to routine police work and the rigours of
discipline.


Inspector Exton conveyed the hooligans perception of the police and how
they obtained operational information from police officers at numerous
football matches and how they assessed the weakness of police operations
under the protection and guise of relative annoymity.


Inspector Exton remarked on the number of crimes committed by football
hooligans which the police failed to relate to football, because of the
time and location of the incident occurring outside the stadiums and
often before and after match times.        Some incidents exposed the
vulnerability of police officers, poor communications and a lack of
interest of individual officers.


A video presentation showed an incident of a pre-arranged battle between
Manchester United and City factions some distance away from the football
match at half-time, which confirmed the organisation of hooligan gangs
to promote violence.


QUALITY AND ASSESSMENT OF CCTV SYSTEMS


Mr. Ford (S.R.D.B.) gave a video presentation which illustrated the
faults and deficiencies of CCTV installations at 55 football grounds in
England and Wales. This was a result of a questionnaire sent to each
respective police force at the request of A.C.P.O. in order to ascertain
the effectiveness of CCTV systems at each football ground. The faults
included interference from radio transmission, damaged film, worn film,
dirty lens, poor maintenance, and inadequate lens. Only one recording
was suitable for evidence gathering purposes. 69% were barely adequate
for command and control purposes and in most cases they were of little
value.


Mr. Ford suggested a number of ways to improve the existing systems.
The most important thing was to have the cameras properly and regularly
serviced. A number of cameras needed to be remounted and resited and
the majority required larger lens. He emphasised the importance of the
care of video tapes, correct storage and a limit on maximum usage. He
stated that an answer to the problem, would be to use the portable video
camera on display, for evidence gathering purposes and outlined the
added advantages of the camera.


Mr. Phillips gave a brief resume of the history of the installation of
CCTV and the reasons for the inadequacies of the present fixed systems
for evidence gathering purposes and the Football Trust's disappointment
in the systems being used for command and control. He pointed out the
dangers of adding to these systems without expert technical advice,
despite many claims that police forces were satisfied with what they
had.   He recommended the portable video camea equipment which was on
view and stated it would accomplish the pictures required for evidence
that the fixed systems were incapable of producing.        However the
portable camera would not replace the CCTV installation, but complement
them.


Mr. Phillips informed the conference that the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee
were in the process of recommending to the Football Trust the formation
of a technical committee which would give expert advice on the best
practical methods of enhancing existing CCTV systems efficiently and
economically at individual grounds and also the equipment required at
grounds where CCTV systems had not been installed.

REFEREES GUIDELINES VIOLENCE ON THE FTET.n


Mr. Phillips gave a brief summary of the document 'Police Involvement
with Regard to Player Behaviour on the Field of Play' which has
subsequently been ratified by the A.C.P.O. Council. The guidelines were
produced as a result of a meeting with representatives from the Football
Association, the Professional Footballers Association, the Football
League and the Association of Football League Referees and Linesmen in
which concern was expressed as to the different practices and standards
adopted by various ground commanders and that police officers needed to
be cognizant of the Football Association's disciplinary system. Mr.
Phillips said he had pointed out to the Football Association that the
police would not allow any other body to have the right to decide to
investigate criminal matters at football grounds in England and Wales.
 C.C.T.V OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS


Mr. Phillips reiterated the importance of using trained operators for
gathering evidence and identifying target hooligans. However it wasn’t
enough to rely upon improved video equipment and trained operators. He
suggested a strategy should be adopted by ground commanders in setting
roles and training staff. He emphasised the need for a C.C.T.V team
with a director, where possible the football intelligence officer, a
camera operator and a photographer for still pictures. The team should
be used in conjunction with an arrest strategy by developing an arrest
team and a follow up enquiry team for post match analysis. The arrest
strategy would be dependent upon the video evidence and other related
matters. Mr. Phillips related to a video film depicting belligerant
behaviour and offensive language where a female and a girl left the
ground because of the intollerable behaviour of nearby supporters. This
kind of evidence could be recorded on video and taken to court. It was
no longer necessary for us to accept a higher threshold of bad
behaviour.   If we set standards, we can arrange a suitable arrest
strategy.   Post match analysis was the key to tackling the growing
problem of unacceptable behaviour.


Mr. Phillips concluded it was necessary to sustain a reasonable level of
successful prosecution from video evidence to prevent the credibility of
CCTV deminishing.


Members of the Working Party answered questions appertaining to the use
of CCTV and portable video cameras for evidence gathering.
Mr. Phillips informed the conference of the working party preparing a
report into the police use of CCTV and still photography in which the
Director of Public Prosecutions had been consulted in respect of the
presentation of best evidence.


Mr. Phillips also informed the meeting of the functions of the proposed
Technical Committee of the Football Trust and stated that future
applications for CCTV enhancement should be made by the police on behalf
of the clubs through the Technical Committee who will give advice and if
necessary visit the grounds.
      It was suggested that the Football Summary reports include whether
      arrests involved the use of CCTV in order to assess the effectiveness of
      CCTV.


      Problems were being encountered in the reciprocation of video recordings
      for the police of the visiting football club.       The introduction of
      intelligence officers would probably alleviate this problem.


      Video recordings and video printer photographs to assist with
      identification of targets and incidents at railway stations were
      available from the British Transport Police.


      Mr. Ford suggested monochrome cameras were more effective in low light
      level video recordings. The Kodakchrome B 3200 film was good for covert
      photography in low light.


      The conference was made aware of the vulnerability of the camera
      operators when the hooligans realised they were being filmed. Where
      this was the case, it was suggested that the recommended portable video
      camera kit could be mounted on a tripod in a safe area of the ground.
      The kit was capable of presenting sufficient pictures for identification
      of any part of a football ground if positioned in the centre line area.
      If necessary negotiations should be made with football clubs to provide
      a platform in one of the stands where the camera kit could be set up.
      In many cases hard wiring could be laid from this point to the police
      control room.


      Mr* Phillips informed the conference that the Crown Prosecution Service
      advised officers to look at a video recording a number of times before
      writing notes in their pocketbook if this was practicable.

10.   OPERATION 'RED CARD*


      Chief Superintendent Mills (West Midlands) gave a brief account of the
      reason for establishing a covert policing operation. He pointed out
      that there was no evidence to identify any particular political
      affiliation.   Operation 'Red Card’ was staffed with C.I.D. officers
      because of the intelligence on the crime that was identified with
      football hooliganism.     The operation began in January, 1 9 8 7 , and
      concluded in October, 19 87 . when 183 officers were engaged in arrests


                                            - 7 -
and search of premises. The offences consisted of conspiracy to commit
affrays, public order offences and woundings. He stated lessons were
learned and two similar operations had been conducted since 'Red Card'.
Incidents had occurred at football matches in the City of Birmingham
that did not involve Birmingham City Football Club but did however have
a historical link which resulted in the Birmingham fans becoming
involved in a planned operation to attack the other clubs supporters
where serious wounding occurred.      As a result of the intelligence
system, in one particular case, an arrest was made within 24 hours of
the incident and a youth related to the 'Red Card' operation was now
serving a term of life in youth custody.


Detective Sergeant Layton (West Midlands) gave a commentary on a video
film which was an extract of the evidence used for Operation 'Red Card'.
He concurred the necessity of having trained camera operators and
pointed out a member of the Birmingham 'Zulu Warriors' using a camera
during an incident in the City Centre, when Watford played Tottenham at
Villa Park. He also explained how the gang organised and planned the
event.   Also a scene depicted the hooligan element in the football
ground staging a mock fight to draw an officer into an ambush.


Mr. Layton stated that tKe media were made aware of the 'Red Card'
operation and full coverage was given resulting in a lot of publicity
which unfortunately boosted the morale of the 'warriors’. Consequently
the media were embargoed for the Wolverhampton operation, with the
result of the Wolves hooligans being extremely disappointed in not
getting the same publicity.


Constable Lloyd (Greater Manchester) gave a slide presentation on a
hooligan gang who had recorded their acts of violence and other crimes
with photographs and newspaper cuttings which had been siezed by the
police. The slides depicted the gang engaged in battle, photographing
their victims and also their members mixing with police officers during
football match operations. There were also slides illustrating how the
hooligans conceal their weapons, particularly with the knowledge that
most officers use gloves when conducting searches at turnstiles.
Mr. Phillips added that this particular gang lived in Greater Manchester
and affilliated themselves to Leeds Football Club in particular and
visited other clubs as well and conducted many incidents in places
unconnected with football events and subjected the public to street
terror.


THE FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS' ASSOCIATION SUGGESTIONS


Inspector Hammond (Greater Manchester) informed the meeting of the
suggestions the Football Supporters' Association had referred to
concerning the policing of travelling supporters in respect of retention
of away supporters after a match, and how it affected those who had to
make their own way unescorted back to cars and vans parked away from a
ground. Also a method of providing a liaison system with the police at
the football ground. These points were left for an open discussion. It
was concluded that travellers should write to the clubs for identified
parking places near to the ground and for the association to appoint a
liaison officer, identifying that person with a tabard or armband. The
club should be made aware of the supporters suggestions and that extra
stewards be on hand to deal with enquiries and the liaison officer. It
was also acknowledged that police officers should be properly briefed
and familiar with the vicinity of the club.


MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES


Superintendent Jolly (Suffolk) related an incident concerning policing
the Ipswich -v- Millwall game where public service vehicles and mini
buses were stopped and searched on the A12 and Ak5 in pursuance of the
Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol) Act 1985.       Difficulties were
experienced concerning the interpretation of the Act in respect of the
adaption of transit vans carrying 8 or more passengers. There were
inconsistencies in various Magistrates decisions.


Superintendent Stuart (South Yorkshire) related a similar case in which
the Crown Prosecution Service withdrew the case. Two doubtful issues
arose. Whether the vehicle was carrying passengers for hire or reward,
and the interpretation implied with regard to adaption. It was agreed
that the Director of Public Prosecutions should be consulted.
Motorway Interception.       Chief Inspector Hogg (Northamptonshire)
explained the 'intercept' operation they had introduced at the Motorway
Service areas and junctions throughout the county in response to the
trouble they had experienced with football supporters enroute to and
from other venues and asked other forces to forward information on coach
and private transport routes. He enlightened the conference upon the
benefits that could be reciprocated from this operation each match day.
(telephone PC Spriggs 700700).


MEMBERSHIP SCHEMES/PEAT MARWICK REPORT


Mr. Phillips gave a brief resume upon the situation of the Membership
Scheme by referring to the Luton Scheme, the conclusion of a research
study conducted by John Williams at Leicester University and the present
membership schemes. He stated the main difficulty was the configuration
of the football grounds and also the reciprocal scheme meant that
grounds had to be divided into segments which each required toilets,
refreshment bars amongst many other facilities which were not always
available.


An open discussion on this subject then took place on the problems
encountered by various ground commanders. The points discussed were
lack of consistency in the schemes; financial implications; minimum
requirement; computerised turnstiles; logistical problems; suspension of
the scheme for major games; no interest from the clubs; the Luton
Scheme; introduction of legislative measures and cost effectiveness.

OPEN FORUM


Exclusion Orders


The Conference was in agreement that Exclusion Orders issued for 3
months were relatively ineffective.


Difficulty had been experienced in obtaining photographs. Mr. Phillips
stated that he would approach the Football League with a request for the
provision of photographing persons ejected from the football grounds to
be included in the football clubs ground rules.
Play-Offs


Concern was expressed at the minimal amount of notice given to police
forces concerning match play-offs.


Assistant Chief Constable Elliott (West Midlands) stated problems had
occurred in policing the play-offs matches at Walsall and asked that
this subject should be broached at the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee meeting in
September.


Closure of Public Houses


It was suggested that where trouble is anticipated at certain venues,
consideration should be given to liaising with breweries upon the
closure of public houses in the immediate vicinity of football grounds..
Licensing magistrates in York had at the request of the police ordered
the closure of certain public houses where trouble had ensued in the
past.


Mr. Phillips very briefly reiterated the main points of the conference.


Mr. Elliott remarked on the conference being very stimulating and of
enormous value and conveyed his appreciation on behalf of all in
attendance for a successful meeting.       Mr. Phillips expressed his

The Meeting was chaired by J.D. P h illip s Esq., A ssistan t C hief Constable
Greater Manchester P o lic e . Inspector P.J. H am nd, Greater Manchester
P o lice performed the d u ties o f Secretary.




Mr. Phillips opened the meeting by welcoming all present to the first
seminar to be held for Football Commanders and Liaison Officers of 3rd
and 4th Division Football Clubs. He gave a brief account of the purpose
of the conferences and outlined the format for the seminar. Copies of
the following papers were distributed and later referred to in the
meeting. Recommendations of the Peat Marwick Report, Police Involvement
concerning Player Behaviour; CCTV Operators'/Intelligence Officers'
Course Curriculum; Requirement for a National Football Intelligence Unit
and A.C.P.O. Public Order Guide 'Policing Football'.

 Mr. Phillips informed the meeting of the current situation concerning
 the Membership Scheme, the Luton Scheme and the area of research
 undertaken by John Williams at Leicester University.


He stated that the Sub-Committee had been commissioned with preparing a
document on best practice in covert operations and the introduction of a
National Football Intelligence Unit. He briefly explained the reason
for the development of a C.C.T.V. Operators and Intelligence Officers
Course and of the future courses to be held in Manchester. Mr. Phillips
informed the meeting of the Football Trust’s function and of the areas
in which they were willing to assist the police.




Inspector Provoost (Greater Manchester) gave a brief overview of the
structure of the Traffic Commissioners and a resume of a sequence of
events that led to the publication of the A.C.P.O. conditions,
circulated by the Traffic Commissioners as a guideline to coach
operators and later, questioned the effectiveness of the guidelines.


He stressed the importance of co-ordinating the responses from football
commanders on the problems and features of coach operators to comply
with the guidelines, in order that a concerted effort could be made to
bring this to the attention of the Traffic Commissioners, who may then
provide effective enforcement against rogue coiach operators.

co m POLICING
Mr. Phillips apprised the meeting on the position of the recent covert
operations   in the Metropolitan Police area and stated that        the
Metropolitan were determined to continue with covert operations despite
recent setbacks.
Detective Sergeant Layton (West Midlands) gave a brief account of the
reason for establishing a covert policing operation.       There was no
evidence to identify any particular affiliation. He enlightened the
conference on the problems and pressures associated with covert policing
and stressed that it was essential to use properly trained officers. It
was also necessary to monitor the welfare of the officers throughout an
operation, and for welfare counselling after the operation before the
officers returned to police work and the rigours of discipline.


He related the hooligans perception of the police and how they obtained
operational information from police officers at numerous football
matches, and how they assessed the weaknesses of police operations under
the protection of relative annonymity.


Sergeant Layton emphasised the number of crimes committed by football
hooligans which in the past have not been related to football by the
police, because    the time and location of the crime was outside match
times.   Some incidents and tactics at football grounds exposed the
vulnerability of the police and poor communications. In some instances,
a distinct lack of interest by individual officers was evident.


Sergeant Layton gave an example of the value of having a good football
intelligence system and how essential it was for it to link up to a
national network. He also gave a brief account of operation 'Red Card'
together with a video presentation of the operation and an extract of
the video evidence which emphasised the importance of having trained
camera operators.

FOOTBALL R M E D INCIDENTS
Constable Lloyd (Greater Manchester) gave a commentary on a slide
presentation concerning a hooligan gang in the Greater Manchester area
who affiliate themselves mainly to Leeds United and to a lesser extent
Liverpool and other clubs in the Football League. Some of the crimes
were unrelated to football.   The majority of slides had been reproduced
from photographs and newspaper cuttings siezed from the premises of a
member of the gang.     The gang had recorded on photograph acts of
violence, victims and their injuries, members mixing with police
officers during football match operations. Constable Lloyd also showed
examples of concealment of weapons on the body which were undetectable
when police officers executed body searches wearing gloves, particularly
at turnstiles.


HATCH INFORMATION A W INTELLIGENCE
Mr. Phillips outlined the distinction between ’match information’ and
 intelligence'. The match information had reached a good standard.
This was based on match reports and liaison officers ability to forecast
crowd numbers, modes of travel and the demeanour of fans etc.
Intelligence was relatively poor, it should focus upon the
identification of football hooligans, their "associations”, "strategies”
and plans.    Mr. Phillips pointed out the problems associated with
football hooliganism which related to "gang tactics" and "strategies"
and questioned how well the police knew unruly elements that attended
football matches on a regular basis. He emphasised the need to form an
intelligence system and identify the hooligans. This could be done by
using CCTV systems effectively with trained operators, and surveillance
teams. He questioned whether it was sufficient to rely solely upon a
football liaison officer and stressed the hooligans needed to be
photographed and identified.   Problems with hooligans seldom occurred
with the home team supporters in the home ground, but often in the
vicinity of the ground and at away venues and also en route to and from
away venues. An intelligence officer could be trained to analyse video
recordings, identify targets and administer follow up enquiries. The
officer could develop a port folio of known hooligans and collate
information from passive observers on surveillance at home and away
matches and prepare a professional match briefing programme.
 CCTV OPERATORS AND ITOLIfflira OFFICERS COURSE
                       f
Chief Inspector Ross (West Midlands) expounded on the C.C.T.V operators
and intelligence officers course curriculum and the development of the
course, explaining the evidence gathering techniques to be learned using
the hand held video camera and C.C.T.V. systems. He commented on the
likely areas of conflict between the ground commanders requirements in
respect of deployment and those of the intelligence officer in respect
of evidence gathering. Chief Inspector Ross pointed out that operators
were trained to focus upon a certain area until they were satisfied they
had recorded sufficient evidence.    Ground commanders must appreciate
that incidents could not be captured in every part of the ground at any
one time and that it was better to record at least one incident with
good evidence.    If the evidence was good, but insufficient for an
immediate arrest, then a strategy should be set out to record a sequence
of incidents committed by the same people on different occasions in
order to substantiate an arrest and be in a position to present the
evidence before the court.


Chief Inspector Ross then presented a video recording which illustrated
a comparison of video recording by untrained and trained operators which
emphasised the benefit of training. Another video presentation showed
how the action of certain people in the ground could be monitored and
used as evidence, also identifying targets at close range with a
portable video camera which could either be hand held or mounted on a
tripod in a selected part of the football ground0      He stressed the
importance of training officers to analyse video tapes and photographs
after each match to detect various incidents and to establish the
identification of the perpetrators.


QUALITY AND ASSESSMENT OF CCTV SISTERS
Mr. Ford (S.R.D.B.) gave a video presentation which illustrated the
faults and deficiencies of CCTV installations at 55 football grounds in
England and Wales 0 This was a result of a questionnaire sent to each
respective police force at the request of A.C.P.O. in order to ascertain
the effectiveness of CCTV systems at each football ground. The faults
included interference from radio transmission, damaged film, worn film,
dirty lens, poor maintenance, and inadequate lens. Only one recording
was suitable for evidence gathering purposes. 69 % were barely adequate
for command and control purposes which would complement the existing
system and in most cases they were of little value.


Mr. Ford suggested a number of ways to improve the existing systems.
The most important thing was to have the cameras properly and regularly
serviced. A number of cameras needed to be remounted and resited and
the majority required larger lens.   He emphasised the importance of the
care of video tapes, correct storage and a limit on maximum usage. He
stated that an answer to the problem, would be to use the portable video
camera on display, for evidence gathering purposes which would
complement the existing system and outlined the added advantages of the
camera.

CCTV OPERATIONAL SYSTEM
Mr. Phillips gave a brief resume of the history of the installation of
CCTV and the reasons for the inadequacies of the present fixed systems
for evidence gathering purposes and the Football Trust's disappointment
in the systems being used for command and control. He pointed out the
dangers of adding to these systems without expert technical advice,
despite many claims that police forces were satisfied with what they
had.    He recommended the portable video camera equipment which was on
view and stated it would accomplish the pictures required for evidence
that the fixed systems were incapable of producing.         However the
portable camera would not replace the CCTV installation, but complement
them.


Mr. Phillips informed the conference that the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee
were in the process of recommending to the Football Trust the formation
of a technical committee which would give expert advice on the best
practical methods of enhancing existing CCTV systems efficiently and
economically at individual grounds and also the equipment required at
grounds where CCTV systems had not been installed.


Mr. Phillips reiterated the importance of using trained operators for
gathering evidence and identifying target hooligans. It wasn't enough
to rely upon improved video equipment and trained operators.         He
suggested a strategy should be adopted by ground commanders in setting
roles and training staff. He emphasised the need for a C.C.T.V team
with a director, (where possible the football intelligence officer) a
camera operator and a photographer for still pictures. The team should
be used in conjunction with an arrest strategy by deploying an arrest
team and a follow up enquiry team for post match analysis. The arrest
strategy would be dependent upon the video evidence and other related
matters. Mr. Phillips related to a video film depicting belligerant
behaviour and offensive language where a female and a girl left the
ground because of the intollerable behaviour of nearby supporters. This
kind of evidence could be recorded on video and taken to court. It was
no longer necessary for the police to accept a higher threshold of bad
behaviour. Post match analysis was the key to tackling the growing
problem of unacceptable behaviour.


Mr. Phillips concluded it was necessary to sustain a reasonable level of
successful prosecution from video evidence to prevent the credibility of
CCTV deminishing.

REFEREES GDMLINES VIOLENCE ON HIE FEU)
Mr. Phillips gave a brief summary upon the circulated paper containing
the guidelines which have subsequently been ratified by the A.C.P.O.
Council. The guidelines were produced as a result of a meeting with
representatives from the Football Association, Professional Footballers'
Association and the Referees and Linesmen Association in which concern
was expressed as to the different practices and standards adopted by
various ground commanders and that police officers needed to be
cognisant of the Football Association's disciplinary system.         Mr.
Phillips said he had pointed out to the Football Association that the
police would not allow any other body to have the right to decide to
investigate criminal matters at football grounds in England and Wales.

M B S H I P SCHEME AMD M I WARWICK REPORT
Mr. Phillips gave a brief resume of the membership scheme and of the
Peat Marwick Report of which the main recommendations in the report had
been circulated. He stated the main difficulty was the configuration of
the football grounds and also the reciprocal schemes meant that grounds
had to be divided into segments which each required toilets, refreshment
bars amongst many other facilities which were not always available.


An open discussion on this subject then took place on the problems
encountered by various ground commanders. The points discussed were
lack of consistency in the schemes; financial implications; minimum
requirement; computerised turnstiles; logistical problems, suspension of
the scheme for major games; no interest from the clubs; the Luton
Scheme; introduction of legislative measures and cost effectiveness.

T.B.E.V.I.
Superintendent King (BTP) explained the composition and functions of
T.R.E.V.I. of which Assistant Chief Constable W.I. McGregor (BTP) is the
British correspondent.   He gave a brief overview of the information and
intelligence collated and disseminated by British Transport Police and
gave an update on the European Championships.


He urged intelligence officers and liaison officers to be aware of
travelling fans and targets in relation to international matches as they
were more difficult to identify, when in the main they attend matches in
London and other countries. He then gave a video presentation on the
T.R.E.V.I. organisation and B.T.P. involvement.
13   . EXCLUSION OF M Y SUPPORTERS
        Chief Superintendent Moore (Devon and Cornwall) related the experience
        of the exclusion of away supporters at Torquay United and the
        effectiveness and reason for this. The exclusion of supporters was an
        agreement reached with the club in exchange for reduced policing costs.
        Although there were a few weaknesses in the system for membership,
        overall, the scheme was a success and suggested similar agreements could
        be reached with other clubs.


i4. BANS IMPOSED BY THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION ill M E
        Chief Superintendent Stainton (Cumbria) posed the difficulties in
        policing football grounds and fixtures which involve a visiting club
        whose supporters have been banned and arrive on mass. In order to
        maintain A.C.P.O.'s policy of keeping out banned visiting supporters,
        the cost of police resources were high. The repercussions from setting
        up road blocks and keeping out banned spectators upon unsuspecting
        neighbouring police areas, together with allowing the spectators into
        the ground were discussed at length. It was acknowledged there was no
        easy solution to this problem but unless excluded supporters were
        confronted they would continue to travel.   It was necessary to have a
        plan to deter and contain them.


15.     ALL M E T FIXTOHES IMPOSED BY FA/LEACOE
        Chief Inspector Richardson (Durham) related experiences of difficulty in
        policing football matches that had been declared 'all ticket' by the
        FA/League without consulting the relevant police force as to whether
        such a restriction could be enforced successfully.   Small clubs do not
        apply these restrictions rigidly because of their financial position.
        Therefore he requested that A.C.P.O. consult with the authorities on
        this subject.

       A discussion took place on the effectiveness of the membership schemes
       which have been undertaken by the clubs. It was generally acknowledged
       that many of the schemes created more problems than they solved.           £

       Superintendent Finch    (Northamptonshire) explained the motorway
       'intercept' operations introduced at the Motorway Service areas and        I
       junctions throughout the county in response to the trouble they had
       experienced with football supporters en route to and from other venues
       and asked other forces to forward information on coach and private
                                                                                  I

       Superintendent McGinn related similar problems with football fans
       stopping off in unsuspecting villages and towns, in a force area that
       had no involvement with football, being subjected to hooliganism. He       1
       requested other forces to notify one another of routes fans are likely
       to take when travelling to away fixtures in the form of a pre-warning      1
       system. Prior warning would allow for police resources to be deployed
       effectively.    It was suggested that covert teams could help in this      1
       respect and also whenever the National Unit was in being.

                                                                                  I

It was concluded that the conference was a success.     However, it was
acknowledged that it would be of greater benefit if separate conferences
could be arranged for the two divisions as there was a lot of business
to discuss and to which more depth could have been given if the
conference had been extended another day.

(1)      The numbers o f people who may be s u b je c t to an o rd e r o f t h i s kind

Dear Colleague

                      FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL

You will be aware that the Football Spectators Bill which
contains  provisions   relating  to membership schemes is
currently being progressed through Parliament.

At   a  special   meeting  of  the   ACPO  General  Purposes
Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events, it was
agreed that I write a letter to Mr. Angel at the Home Office
indicating the views of the Committee in response to the key
elements of the Bill.

A copy of that letter is enclosed for your information.

Should there be any comment or observations you wish to make
on either the letter or the provisions of the Bill itself, I
would appreciate an early response.

                         You




                          Chief Constable
                   (Chairman - ACPO Sub-Committee
                 on Hooliganism at Sporting Events)




To All Chief Constables in England, Wales & Northern Ireland

                                           15 May 1989




Dear Mr. Goddard,
                         FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL
      I write In my capacity as Chairman of the ACPO Sub-Cowl ttee on
Hooliganism at Sporting events.
      Further to my discussion with Lord Ferrers and In pursuance of
discussions I know you have had with David Phillips I « now In a position
to write to you further about the "agency" role.
      We have taken Into account that the provisions of Part II were In
part at the instigation of ACPO (I had personal discussions with Graham
Angel and suggested that the Bill should include sane provision to deal
with the problems of hooliganism abroad). We recognise too that the
provisions can only be effective If they are backed by the sanction of
criminal liability and that therefore, those In breach of the system will
ultimately be subject of police enquiry.
      As a general rule Chief Constables are reluctant to accept new
policing responsibilities without additional resources and this was a
matter of concern. Equally however we are not convinced that the
alternatives to police responsibility In this area are attractive. On
balance therefore I am prepared to give guarded support to the notion of
the Police service accepting the "agency" role with certain substantial
provisos.
      In the first case, as I know you are well aware, 1t 1s essential that
the arrangements for registration and notification are dealt with centrally
and not at local Police Stations. It Is considered that the administration
system should be so geared that the only responsibility at local Police
Stations would be to check-in reportees and forward a record of their
attendance at material times. It may also be that Chief Constables should
be 1n a position to Instruct the Central Agency as to which Police Stations
will be available as "reporting" stations. In short the Central Agency
would receive Information 1n respect of those subject to "orders" direct
from the Courts; the reportee would be responsible for notifying to them
any change of address; the Central Reporting Agency would maintain an Index
and notify reportees of "designated matches”; and the reportee would be
required to present notification documents to a Police Station where
particulars would be recorded and returned to the Central Agency.
      Clearly the funding and organisation of the Central Agency whilst It
would be som kind of Police responsibility has yet to be determined and If
It Is to be a part of the proposed "National Football Intelligence UMt"
additional budgettlng will be required In due course*
      I an conscious that these natters are of sane urgency and you will
realise I have not had the opportunity to consult       colleagues widely
although the natter has been before the Sub-Committee. Nonetheless 1n the
clrcunstances I feel It appropriate to write In these terns and trust you
will recognise that we have cone some way to neetlng the requlrenents of
the Bill.
      I hope you realise that this compromise would very much depend upon
goodwill In ensuring that the conditions to which I have referred can be
accomodated.




                             YoursASlncerely

 I. I Tiie policing of profess lonai football matches nas
 been a major police commitment over many years. As the
game nas become more and more the targ et of hooligan;;
 tnere ha^ been a progressive increase in the manpower
and generai resource of tne service required                      to
maintain order.               EquaLly as Police t a c t i c s   and
precautions nave spe cialised to deal with the problem,
so perversely tne ' t a c t i c s ' of the hooLigans have
varied to find ways rounu those controls. Tnis nas tad
tne e f f e c t of spreading the problem such that in some
matcues policing begins as tne fans depart t h e i r nome
town and continue untiL tney return.                The pLanning of
such games is extensive ana wide-ranging, seeicing to
a n t i c i p a te the problems that may a r i s e with supporters
who use a v ariety oi routes and forms of transport and
who may be in t r a n s i t Lor most oL the day.           In tnese
circumstances the duration oi the game a t tne ground
i t s e l f is j u s t one aspect of the e n tir e operation.


1.2        The d i s t r i b u t i o n of League sides means tnat
policing fo o tb a ll is a problem which h i t s the Police
Service somewhat disp ro p o rtio n a tely .        Footbali Clubs
(.end to be concentrated in tne larger connurbatLons
wnich are anyway nard pressed by nigner rates o i crime
and simply the scale of demand for everyday police
s e i ^i^e8. Policing footbalL is a t l e a s t a nine monthly
commitment? hence for some forces tne demands made by
fo o tb a ll m aterially a f f e c t       the general   level of
policing.

1.3      I t is of course not the policing of football
crowds but the hooligans amongst tnem which are the
main problem and whilst perhaps obvious i t should be
s ta te d tnat i t is hooliganism in 'jport not crowds a t
sporting events wiixch takes up police time in such
large measure.

l.«t. Hooliganism itseL f is not too d i f f i c u l t to
c h a r a c te r iz e although ics causes may be complex and
much more d i f f i c u l t to analyse. Suffice i t to say that
the Police deal in r e a l i t i e s and for the Police tne
tasic i s f a i r l y c le a r cut - to maintain order and crowd
s a fe ty by reducing the p o t e n tia l for c o n f l i c t and
confrontation.

1.5. Some aspects of the phenomenon of hooliganism
however warrant discussion because t h e i r recognition
has consequences for policing t a c t i c s .   Of most
significance is that the overt a c t s of violence and
displays of drunken aggression, the obscene chanting
and gesturing by way of challenge to the opposition a l l
of which we recognise as fo o tb a ll hooLiganism, are
transgressions   committed  by young      males  loosely
organised but in common purpose and sh e lte red by the
cover of a large crowd.
             1-> tin s r e la t i v e anonymity afforded tne
 iiooligau by being part oi' a Large crowd, many oi. wnom
 aay have* no wi in to cause trouble, which is both the
 problem for tne Police a n d t h e opportunity col* t h e
 of fender.


1*7        I t .snouid ax-jo be said tuat within the larger
crowd of supporters there are groups, often formed
casually but some witii d e f in i te membership and e x is tin g
as 'u n o f f i c i a l supporters’ c i u b s ' , who c l e a r l y are bent
on trouble and have l i t t l e i n t e r e s t in tne game.This
nas been seen in the way they d e l i b e r a te ly get into t:ie
’wrong e n d ', or buy stand seats to avoid poLice
supervision and a f t e r tnc game commences create an
incident. Ihe important point is tnat tuese groups ace
not ca-suax aoolimans out pLan and organise to creatc
tr o u b le .

l.ii           A great deal has been done to contain tne
behaviour oi. crowds but tne manner in which violence
has s p i l l e d over the b a r rie r s in recent matches
suggests that there is a need to do more than reduce
tiie opportunity for c o n f l i c t and in po sitiv e terms
concentrate policing t a c t i c s to remove that sense of
r e l a t i v e immunity tiie hooligan depends upon by being
part of a large crowd.         Lt is p re c ise ly in these areas
muC'i of the AoPO current thinking i s d irected and this
report will seek to address these matters in d e t a i l .

1.9 Lastly by way of opening remarks i t Ls proper to
make the point that crowd trouble and crowd safety are
not issues that can be separated.            Wtiiist the t e r r i b l e
consequences of the Bradford t i r e are a t the front of
our minds the f a t a l c a s u a lti e s of the 'Heysel Stadium
d i s a s t e r ' were the victims of crowd disorder.              The
segregation of supporters may be necessary in tiie
i n t e r e s t s of crowd control but terrace violence lirce
f i r e can cause panic which in a crowd can be so
dangerous. The proper balance between policing and the
need to be able to evacuate large numbers in an
emergency has to be our objective.

area who may be fam ilia r with Likely offenders in tne
away supporters    and can help            Local  police   in

Away Supporters

2.1U       The Police generally sign and monitor car and
coacn parks intended for die use oi away supporters.
This       gives      early       inceliig en ce and  reduces    Che
poss i b i l i c y of c o n filc c s snoula home supporcers .seek to
damage cars and coaches. The Police generally maintain
a presence throughout.


2.11   Some groups of? supporters are escorted to and
from the stadium to lim it trie o pp ortun ities to
misbehave and to p ro tect      them from r i v a l fans.
Arrangements oi' t h is kind are almost aLways made In

confrontation between r iv a l fans may occur.              Equally
the     Police  have to     examine routes followed                 by
supporters and give a t t e u t i o n to any d e r e l i c t s i t e s

Regardless i t is always a matter of concern for the
Poiice th at hooligans may be armed with offensive
weapons and the instances of stabbing and slashing
p a r t i c u l a r l y t>y the use of Stanley knives and modelling
knives, has increased d istu r b in g ly in the l a s t year.
Entry i n t o trie Ground

2.15 The Police seek, to ensure that t u r n s t i l e s c l e a r l y
in dicate wnicii group of supporters they are intended to
accommodate.          T u rn stile s for tae popular parts of the
ground are often supervised by tne Police in an e f f o r t
to ensure segregation and to provide some f i l t e r
ag ain s t unruly elements.              Depending upon resources
av ailab le and tne lay out of tiie ground mounted
o f f i c e r s are often used in ensuring orderly queueing.

t u r n s t i l e t o t a l i s o r s and crowd movement around tne
ground to maintain these li m i ts and customary for the
Police to ensure they are adhered to.                                In co-operation
with the Clubs the Police have soughc to ensure
f a c i l i t i e s allow for the immediate segregation of r iv a l
supporters as they e n te r the stadium.                                    This is
generally by way of b a r r i e r s and i t Is important that

experience in d icates that i t may be desirable a t most

determine in conjunction with o thers under the terms of
tne Safety of Sports Grounds Act.

2.19 I t i s common p ractice for the Police to supervise
gangways, b a r s , refreshment areas and t o i l e t s .

2.20    Some o f f i c e r s are deployed in and around the
ground for the duration of t n e i r tour of duty and they
are generally charged to the Club.                   During tne course
of the game trie number of o f f i c e r s inside tne ground i s
increased by those on t r a f f i c points and other d uties

to e s c o rt c e r t a i n sections of tne crowd to RaiLway

to assemoie          them as a convoy and esco rt           them

a b i l i t y to manage tiie t r a f f i c problem may be severely
lim ited by the geographical layout about the ground.
Many fo o tb a ll grounds were b u i l t many years ago in the

SECTION THREE -RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

3.1.        Recent events marked by tragedy and diso rd er have
resu lted in raucii public and p o l i t i c a l concern and
debate.       Government has urged a i i those involved with
fo o tb a ll and i t s problems to examine ‘ new i n i t i a t i v e s
and ha* i t s e l f taken urgent Legislative steps. Many of
the suggestions that have been examined are matters
about        which the aCPO and the Police Service              have
already developed views in the li g h t of experience.
I

I
        Alcohol

I       3.2 The most strongly argued issue or a l l has been tae
        assertion     th a t raucn of
        associated witn drunkenness.
                                         tiie worst behaviour is
                                            The ACPO does not depart
        from t h i s general view although there are a number ot
R       reserv atio ns about how tiie problem is beat dealt with.

        3.3         F i r s t l y the popular reaction that alcoiioL a t tiie
I       ground should be                 barred andpublic houses
        v i c i n i t y closed is not considered eich er nelpful or
                                                                     in tiie

        eq u itable.              The problem of drunkenness a t Football
        Stadia is not as a r e s u l t of alcohol consumed a t tiie
I       ground but drinking en route.               The worst problems have
        aiways been witn 'away' support and p a r t i c u l a r l y chose

I       who have tr a v e lle d a long way. Before alcoholic drinks
        were          stopped        on Football    Special   trains
        d e f i n i t e l y the worst examples were from that source.
                                                                       quite


        3.4 AicohoL consumed a t the grounds has generally not
1       been the cause ot      the problem i f for no other reason
        than Lt is simply not possible to purchase s u f f i c i e n t

I       to get drunk in the time a v a ila b le .     I t should be
        pointed out that i t has always been common practice to
        ciose bars w nilst play i s in progress and never to open
        them a f t e r the match.   Puolic bars adjacent to open
        seating and terracin g are in a l l cases out of view of
1       the pitch.


I       3.5    The Association has argued that closing bars in
        grounds can be counter productive in tu a t i t w ill
        discourage some away supporters from enterin g tne
        ground u n t i l the l a s t minute in an attempt  to find
I       alcohol elsewhere.   I t has long been a police s tr a te g y
        by arrangements witn Coach Operators and B r itis h Rail
        for away supporters to a r r i v e a t the ground one hour

I       before kick o ff to ensure tnat the away supporters are.
        in the ground before the bulk of the home support
        arrives,   thus reducing che r i s * of confrontation
        outside the ground.
I
        3.6 Equally, r e s t r i c t i n g sa les in premises near to the
        ground can r e s u l t la groups of supporters wandering £ar
I       a f i e l d to find 'open' public houses and tuereby
        widening the area of poiice supervision.                Much can
        depend on the circumstances of a p a r t i c u l a r game and
        there are times when licen sees are encouraged to close
1       premises however.


I       3.7        The Police view is th erefo re very much directed
        towards the d e s i r a b i l i t y oc co n tro ls rather than
        o u tr ig h t bans a t grounds. The main problem r e l a t e s to
        excessive drinking whilst t r a v e l l i n g and tnat i s where
I       e f f o r t c l e a r l y must be concentrated.

success has led those elements against whom i t was
d ir e c te d to seek, other forms ox t r a n s p o r t, sue *1 as
coaches and s e l l - d r i v e hire vans.            This kind ot
displacement makes policing that much more d i f f i c u l t
with many more away supporters a r riv in g a t grounds much
e a r i i e r tnan scheduled and in smaller groups.

3.9         The Criminal J u s t i c e (Scotland) Act 19dU. whicli
was framed to tackle s im ila r problems i s considered to
have had a good measure or success and i t s term s. under
most conditions, ban alcohol to supporters on public
transpo rt and a t grounds.               Tne customs and ground
f a c i l i t i e s in Scotland are nowever somewuat d i f f e r e n t
to those of tne English Football League and a simple
extension or the Act tnrougnout tiie d.K.                 was not
considered appropriate by tne ACPO.

3.10           Tiie Sporting Events (Control ot Alcohol e t c . . )
B ill picks up most of tiie relevant provisions of the
S cottish Acc extending tiie ban on alcohol consumed by
supporters to tr a in s carrying supporters to and from
designated sporting events. ( S e n drive nirc vans nave
not been included.) There are sim ilar r e s t r i c ti o n .; at
grounds as to drunkenness; possession of ' co ntrolled
c o n t a i n e r s '; and possession oi alcohuL, but exemption
i s allowed under s t r i c t conditions.          The ACPO support
these provisions and the powers of enforcement but
there           is    some reserv atio n aoout      tne exten t of
r e s t r i c t i o n or sale a t grounds. Private Members boxes,
an        important       source    of    revenue    to Clubs   and
trouble free .arc tiie only parts ol the grounds cu rren tly
licensed wtiicii w ill be excluded from exemption.             Tins
nowever i s tooc-± a d i f f i c u l t y for tiie Football Ciuos as
tiie Poiice who would only be a f fe c te d 11 tnese
conditions r e s u l t in l o s t revenue to tne clubs many of
wnoni already struggle to meet tiie cost of poLicing.

3.11     In short excessive drinking ia considered a
contributory       factor         to  Hooliganism       and    tiie new
provisions should a s s i s t tne Police in c o n tr o llin g tne
problem.   The d e t a i i of tiie B ill however is questioned
and no doubt such d i f f i c u l t i e s r e f l e c t tiie speed with
which the l e g i s l a t i o n has been progressed.

Membersnip Card Scnemes

3.12   A good deal of con sid eration has been given by
the ACPO Sub-Committee on Hooliganism in Sport to the
question   of     'membership    card s'     and    'membership
schemes'.   In simple terms the theory Is that entry to
the FootbalL Ground would be r e s t r i c t e d to ' aona-fide
supporters wiio would iiave to apply for aembersiiip and
who would lose i t if g u ilty of misbehaviour.

3.13 Tae ACPO have no objection;.- to tne p rin cip les

questions as to the wording ot such schemes which would
have co be answered before they were seen as an answer
to hooliganism.

chey .tave to obtain s u f f i c i e n t iniorniacion to cancel
the membership of people who should properly be
excluded.

3.16 At the present time guidance to tiie Police Service
from tne Home Office on the d isclo sure ot c o n fid e n tia l
information would c e r t a i n l y prevent Cue poiice from
being tiie in te ll i g e n c e source or any such scheme run by
a private commercial in te r e s c .      I t i.s d i f f i c u l t to say
wnac other source of information would be a v a ila b le to
Che operators.

      There are a lo t of other questions

      a;       Would c a n c e lla tio n apply to those g u i lt y
               of acts of hooLi^anism outside the ground?

      b)       Would c a n c e lla tio n r e l a te to people charged
               with criminal otfences or only a f t e r a
               conviction?

      c)       Would there be a system of appeal? - in
               whicu case would police o f f i c e r s be c a lle d
               upon    to  su b s ta n tia te the      cause      for
               exclusion.

      d)       Would c a n c e lla tio n follow from breaches of
               ciuo ru.ies? - i f so. how would tne breach
               be e s ta o lish e d and information passed to
               the operator?

     e)         Would any system be of value unless i t was
               universal? - tue main problem r e l a t e s to
               away support.
       i)       d o w would such a system accommodate those
                attending for tiie f i r s t time? - any section
                of tue ground reserved for none card
                aoiders wouLd defeat tne purpose of tae
                scneme.

3.17 Having made these observations there does seem
scope however cor club* to consider membership scneiaes
lo r p a r t i c u l a r parts of the Ground e.g . family
anciosures.

Ail Ticket Matches

3. id        A il- t i c k e t matches have been canvassed as one
way oi. achieving segregation and c o n tr o llin g to some
extent tiiose attending a game.              P a r t i c u l a r l y in Cip
competitions when t ic k e t sa les are stric c o d to voucaer
holders or supporters club members tiie police find a l i -
t lc k e t matches worthwhile but only wiiere a capacity
crowd can reasonably be expected.                        Otherwise, i t
r e s u i t s in open t i c k e t sa les on raatcn days which
weakens c o n tr o lle d segregation and runs the r is k of
r iv a l supporters being mixed together in ttie same
sections ot tiie ground.


3.19              All- t i c k e t games impose fu rth e r problems for
tiie police in that queues have to be policed to
maintain              order     and   to   prevent   opposition    fans
i n f i l t r a t i n g on the prescribed days Cor tic k e t bales.


3.20    I t remains the view of the ACPO that a l l - tic k e t
games are only su ita o le for capacity games.

E arly Kick- Offs

3.21          The Football League have considered arranging
matches with an e a rly kick- o f f (g en era lly 11.00am)
with a view to diminishing, the opportunity for
supporters to obtain alcohol.        I t has been considered
that a game played a t th at time would be less li k e l y to
a t t r a c t nooligans or to develop tne rowdy atmospnere
tnat goes with excessive drinking.

3.22 The proposition seems reasonable and some games
have been played on th is basis. The problem has a r is e n
though that ou some occasions the nooiigan element
having attended tiieir own f ix tu r e have then gone to
another game being played in the afternoon with the
sole in te n tio n evidently of causing trouble.

3.23     Sucn schemes are therefore supported provided
tiiey are arranged in co n s u lta tio n with tiie Police to
avoid possible clashes of th a t kind or other local
considerations
3.24    A number of other ideas have been suggested
particularly    tiie development of family    facilities
and/or the idea of f o o tb a ll being played before an
exclusively nome crowd.

3.25 Ail e f f o r t s to improve the environment and the
atuiospnere a t a f o o tb a ll ground are to be encouraged.
If   the club provides good f a c i l i t i e s   and makes
professional use of the public address system and other
entertainment      a co n trib u tio n can be made to tne
atmosphere a t a game.            Ine development ot' family
enclosures is equally to be supported.

3.26. The ' a i l home f i x t u r e ' however, w niist probably
desirab le in p r in c i p le , r a is e s d i f f i c u l t i e s .    Sucn a
f i x tu r e       may provide a challenge              for         the   'away
sup po rters' and prove d i f f i c u l t to Police.                       This
i n i t i a t i v e however, i f i t were to be supported by the
League, would have to be c a r e f u ll y considered and each
matcu being assessed in che context o£ other games
wnich mignt be affec te d .

CCTV

3.27   Most of the foregoing issues r e l a t e one way or
another to ways in wnicn access to a f o o tb a ll ground
can be limited or co ntrolled .  The development of CCTV
nas as i t s primary purpose co ntrol of behaviour once
people are inside the stadium, and as they en ter or
leave.

3.23 A good deal of c a r e f u l consideration lias already
been given to th is question and in 19d4 the Football
Trust        funded   experimental   schemes     in  Greater
Manchester, the West Midlands, and Edinburgh.          These
schemes are s t i l l in tne process of being evaluated and
mucn has been l e a r n t .       In ad d itio n the use of
individual video cameras a t some matches such as tiie
f i x tu r e between Huddersfield Town and Leeds United has
shown that ex cellen t evidence capable of persuasive use
in the Courts eau be obtained.

3.29 The ACPO Sub-Committee on Hooliganism in Sport has
been monitoring these developments and as a matter of
policy has taken tiie view that the development of CCTV
for both management information and evidence gathering
is b en eficial and should be pursued.

3.30 The ACPO'.-3 Sut>-Comraittee rep resentativ e to the
Football Trust has attended a number of meetings
concerning tne funding of such scnemes and a t present a
Wording Party has taken on the job of developing a
s p e c i f i c a ti o n as a matter of urgency.
 J.Ji. rad S c i e n ti f ic Research and Development Srancn ac
 Che Home Office are party co these discussions and use
 oc a vehicle for observing crowd behaviour which has
 been developed by S.R.D.3. i s also being evaluated.

 SECTION FOUR - INTELLIGENCE

 4.1 Most of cue foregoing coament relaces to issues
  t!lac uave oeen s p e c i f i c a l l y raised by Government and
 outside agencies.            P rior co cue racenc croubies wuich
 h a V a . £o.cused a c te n tio n ,    Che ACPO Sub-CommieCee on :c.:e
 i n i t i a t i v e of the Chairman had sougnt to re-examine the
 Police I n te llig e n c e network for dealing wich fo otball
 nooiiganisu.           A s tr u c tu r e   based on local     li a i s o n
 o f f i c e r s is already in being and nas proved oi great
 value over Cne years but Che Sub CommiCtee f e i t tnat
 the information being fed to them needed to be improved
 and the system of in te ll i g e n c e gathering made more
 comprehensive.

4.2        Since that time a l l Poiice Forces have been
consulted and the framework for a new in te llig e n c e
system based on tiie comprehensive documentation of
crowd behaviour a t eacn match nas been drawn up. I t is
a n tic ip a te d tnat the new i n te llig e n c e system wilL be
operating from the commencement ot the coming season.
SECTION' FIVE - POLICE POWERS

5.1         T a c t i c a ll y the Poiice have a number of options
open to tnea when dealing witn d iso rd erly behaviour a t
fo otball matches.               One option i s to e j e c t individuals
whose conduct may have f a ll e n short of taac which
c o n s t i t u t e s a criminal offence but is nonetneless in
breach of ground rules and regulations.

 5.2 Generally speaking however where there is evidence
01 _ a substantive offence, offenders are charged.
Offences of ' a s s a u l t ' ( 'woundings', ' a c tu a l bodily
aarm', 'P olice A s s a u l t ') , 'possession of offensive
weapons' and 'crim inal damage' are weU e s tab lish ed in
the criminaL .aw and subject to the q u a lity of evidence
Poiice powers to deal with these circumstances are not
ia^ question.      There are however some d i f f i c u l t i e s of
enforcement in respect of Public Order offences and
recent decisions of tne Courts nave made Section 5 of
tae Public Order Act 1936 more d i f f i c u l t to prove.        It
i s recognised tiiat the old common law offences are
unwieldy although the preventive powers av a ila b le to
the Police for breaches of tiie peace are valuable in
some circumstances. However, in the l i g n t of ttie White
Paper - ‘Tne Review of Public Order Law1' - there i s no
great merit in arguing current legal i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of
public order offences.          By and large tiie ACPO gives
support to the new proposals for offences of Riot;
VioLent Disorder and Affray.          Some of these offences
have a c l e a r relevance to the prooiea of hooliganism.
Tne Wilkie Paper also        refers  to an offence or
' Disorderly Conduct’ whicn as yec i s not c l e a r l y
worded.        The ACPO will Look for wider discussion on
t n i s point.

5.3     The powecs conferred on tiie Poiice in the new
Sporting Events (ControL ot Alcohol etc. ) BiLj. nave
been b rie fly referred to. They allow for the searcn of
puolic tran sp o rt used by fans in t r a n s i t where there
are grounds to suspect there may De oifences; powers co
search l’or alcohol and 'c o n tr o ll e d c o n ta in e rs' such as
bottles,      cans e t c . , and to deal with people who are
drunk ac sporting events.

5.4          I t is ii^eLy that the turnstLLes w ill be Che
t e s ti n g ground for the effecciveness of a good part of
t h i s l e g i s l a t i o n in Che coming season. The Policing of
cu rn sciies is always imporcanc and                  Che powers and
offences under Che new B ili w ill axiow for e ffe c tiv e
policing.                 if chere i s a constrainC ic i s of course
Cnat these provisions will require more police o f f i c e r s
Co make them e i r e c t i v e .         The problem ot resource and
 finance i s dealc wicii elsewhere (Paragraph 7 . i ) .

5.5. Customarily supporters iiave been searcned by
poiice for ofienaive weapons or m issiles as Chey have
thought necessary before they enCer C:ie gcound.               In
almost a l l cases th is has been with consenC and has
been largely uncha I longed.              However t;ie Police and
Criminal Evidence Acc 19£>4 has laid down precise
guidelines regarding police searches which in essence
require an o i r i c e r Co have reasonable grounds for
suspecting cliac he w ill find sto len or proiiibiCed
a r t i c l e s before he c a r r i e s ouc a. search and in a l l
cases a wriccen record of ciie seaccii must be made and
handed Co Che individual concerned.

5.6         Ic     i s Cne ./lew of the ACPO CnaC      routine,
preventive searches of f o o tb a ll supporters are not
adequately catered for in Che PACE Acc notwitnstanding
Cue proviso in che AcC's Codes of PracCice wnicn
seemingly exempts from i t s           provisions searches a t
Sports Grounds witn consent or as a condition of encry.
The ACPO take Che view that an 'a u th o r i s a t i o n ' to
search on t h i s basis cannot be recommended because ic
enjoins a police power coo c lo s e ly Co che          fo o tb a ll
clubs and could            chere fore place    in jeopardy a
c o n s ta b le 's posicion in law shouid nis ac tio n be
cnallenged.

5.7     As to the enforcement of 'Public Order Law' a t
major sporting events the Police Commaudec a t the sceue
has always to be aware of p r a c t i c a l con sideration s.
Every a r r e s t takes one or more o f f i c e r s from the line
and a r r e s t s made a t tiie wroug time may worsen the
situation.
None the Les.-> ic is the strong view of tae ACPO that
e f f e c tiv e in terv en tion in che face oi Delligerent and
abusive behaviour rather than nere contaiaiaent should
be policy in tue coining season,

5.3.   As noted e a r l i e r in the report (paragraph 1.6)
the hooligan depends upon being anonymous in a Large
crowd.


SECTION SIX - SAFETY OF SPORl'S GROUNDS ACT 1975

Safety C e r t i f i c a t e s

6.1 Since the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 came
into force in September 1975, a .system of sa tety lias
been es ta b lish e d whicn provides that designated sports
sta dia must comply with a i l the terms and conditions of
a c e r t i f i c a t e issued by the Local a u tn o r ity . To date
tiie Act has applied to a i l f i r s t and Second Division
Football League grounds and w ill soon be extended to
include Third and Fourth Division grounds in the coming
football season.              The Government has said tnat i t
intends aLso to extend i t s provisions to Rugby League
Club grounds sometime in the near future.

6.2 An issuing Local a u th o r ity is required to eou^uit
witii the Chief Constable of the area in which the
ground i s located regarding the terms and conditions to
be included before any such c e r t i f i c a t e i s issued.
Although tnere is no lim it or r e s t r i c t i o n on tne
conditions whicu a local a u th o r ity may impose on a
s a fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e , tiie Act requires that c e r t i f i c a t e s
contain conditions about numbers of sp e c ta to rs , number
and siz e s of entrances and e x i t s ,                f i r e escapes
maintenance and numbers and strengtli of crush b a r r i e r s .

6.3   Whilst tne imput into sa fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e s i s a
matter for local a u t h o r i t i e s a f t e r co n s u lta tio n with
Chief Constables and other i n t e r e s te d p a r t i e s , the aCPO
has made recommendations to Chief cconstables that, meet
many of the needs of poiice and should be catered for
in safety c e r t i f i c a t e s .

6.4   The following recommendations are pubiisued in
ACPO's notes of guidance for senior police o f f i c e r s : -

       ( i ) I t is cousidered e s s e n t i a l that a separate
             police o f f i c e , c l e a r l y signposted, shouid
             be avaiLable a t the ground.. The o ffice
             should provide adequate accommodation for
             e n qu iries and rep orting, and the processing
             of p riso n ers. There should be a secure
             detention roon for the short term
             accommodation of prisoners. The o f f i c e
             snould be s it a d so that there i s adequate
             vehicular access for the unobtrusive removal
             of prisoners.
I

I             I t wuuiu be desiraole io. eituec
              a post o ffice telephone line or a d i r e c t Line
              co the nearest poiice s t a ti o n were a v a ila b le .
I   (ii)      I t is e s s e n t i a l that a control room is
              provided to oversee poiice operations in tne
              ground. Provision should be made for a base
I             s t a t i o n to control tae u'.H.F. poLice radio.
              I t shouid be possible co nave a dicecc access
              to the ground public address system and a
              telephone line co the local police s t a tio n .
I
    (iii)     Before the stadium is used on any occasion for
              a sp e cific a c t i v i t y the c e r t i f i c a t e holder
I             consult with the local poiice concerning
              tiie attendance ot s u f f i c i e n t number of
              police o f f i c e r s for che purpose of
I             maintaining lawful and orderly behaviour
              among persons attending the stadium.


I   (iv)      The holder sh a ll agree with the Chief
              Constable 14 days before each occasion wnen
              the sp e cified a c t i v i t y takes place on the
I             method of admission ( a i l - t i c k e t ) and the
              methods to be used for tae segregation ot
              home and away supporters.
I   (v)       ALL containers for the :>a Le of drinks s n a i l be
              of p l a s ti c or paper material.

I   ( v i)    The hoider in co-operation
              witn Police is to take reasonable steps to
              ensure no person en te rs or remains in tiie
I             stadium with any g la s s , b o t t l e ut can.

    (v ii)    No accumulation of rubbish, bricks, stones or
              other mate r i a l 3 which in the opinion oc the
I             Chief O fficer of Police are capable of use as
              m issiles sh a ll be permitted to remain in any
              p art of the stadium to whicn sp e ctato rs have
I             access.

    (v iii)   Portable t e le v is io n cameras and' equipment
I             s h a ll be placed in such a p o sitio n as may
              be agreed between the holder and tiie Cnief
              Constable.
I
    (ix)      No vehicles other than emergency ( p o lic e ,
              f i r e , ambulance) shalL be parked iu any

              plan oc as agreed v itn ttie Chief Constable
              or the senior police o i f t c e r .

I
I
(x)           The Ciiief Constable or his
               representative must be informed as soon as
               possible or any re-arranged f o o tb a ll fix tu r e .

(x i)         When, owing to tne condition of the ground, a
              c a n c e lla tio n .of tne match i s l i k e l y , a police
              rep resen tativ e should be preseat when the
              ground i.s inspected.


Stewards

6.5    Whilst tiie police have no d ir e c t control over the
employment of stewards a t fo o tb a ll grounds, they can
exert i n d i r e c t control by means of conditions inserted
in sa fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e s issued under the Safety of
Sports* Grounds Act, 1975. I t is most important tnat
stewards are s u f f i c i e n t in number, s u ita b ly deployed,
weii trained and capable mentally and physically of
carrying out t n e i r routine and emergency functions.
Again there is s u b s ta n tia l ACPO guidance as follows :-

        Tiie number of stewards employed by tiie management
        of the ground should be determined in con su lta tio n
        with the police and should be based on tiie
        requirement d ic ta te d by tiie s t r u c t u r a l p rop erties
        of the ground in r e l a t i o n to an average crowd for
        a p a r t i c u l a r f i x tu r e .

        One method of i n d i r e c t control i s provided by the
        bafety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 a t tnose grounds
        which are required to be c e r t i f i e d .    The Local
        Authority, before issuing a Safety C e r t i f i c a t e , is
        required to consult the Chief O fficer of Police
        regarding the terms and conditions to be included
        in the C e r t i f i c a t e .

        Persons employed as stewards a t f o o ta a ll grounds
        should be c l e a r l y i d e n t i f i a b l e by armbands, coat
        or other distin g u ish in g featu re.            They should, at
        ali   times, be under the d i r e c t con trol of
        supervisors whose i d e n t i t i e s should be made known
        to the police o f f i c e r s on duty a t the ground.

        Stewards snould be d is t r i b u t e d throughout tiie
        ground in accordance witn a d e ta i le d pre-arranged
        schedule, agreed between tne police and management
        of the ground.

        Tneir duties             may   be   divided   into    four    main
        c a te g o r i e s : -
 (a)    c o n tr o llin g or d ire c tin g members of the public
        who are entering or leaving tiie fo o tb a ll ground.

 (b)    p a t r o l lin g tiie ground to deal with any emergencies
        e.g . raiding alarms, extinguisning t i r e s e t c . ,

 (c)    manning entrances, exit.s and other s tr a te g ic
        po ints, p a r t i c u l a r l y e x i t doors, gates and rolLer
        s h u tte r s which are not continuously open whilst
        tiie ground is in use;

 (d)    undertaking sp e c ific duties r e l a ti n g to emergency
        and evacuation procedures.

In p a r t i c u l a r they may have to undertake the following
duties

(a)     man any f i n a l e x it door or gate which i s locked
        during the game and ensure th a t a t l e a s t one
        steward manning any gate has the key to the gate
        continuously on his person during th at time.

(b)     open these doors or gates to permit evacuation in
        an emergency, o r, in order to c le a r the ground a t
        Cull time, a t a time pre-arranged between tne
        police and tiie management oL the ground.

(c)     ensure that a i l means of entry and e x i t are kept
        free from obsta cles;

(d)    ensure that mobile sa les s t a f f do not p o sitio n
       equipment so as to o b stru c t e x i t routes.

Stewards play a v i t a l part in tiie maintenance of public
sa fe ty standards a t f o o tb a ll ground and accordingly
must be physically and mentally f i t to assume th is
r e s p o n s i b ili ty . They should receive tr a in in g in f i r s t
aid and f i r e fig h tin g and snouid also be rehearsed in
emergency procedures.


The importance of the provision of formal emergency
procedures a t each gro„und cannot be over emphasised.

     should be given to providing b rie fin g cards to stewards
     relevant to p a r t i c u l a r points
I    Stewards who p a tro l the ground in order to deal wlch
     emergencies may be cLassifed as 'Emergency Stewards'.
1    If an emergency a r i s e s in any section ot tne ground i t
     snould be tae r e s p o n s ib i li t y of the Emergency Steward
     to immediately n o tify           tnc police ground control
     operator and the section supervisor where appropriate.
     I f the emergency i s a Eire or suspicion of a f i r e the
     Emergency Steward snould also operate tae nearest f i r e

     nearest avaiLabie c o rre c t f i r e e x tin g u is u e r . Other

     On hearing t h is broadcast tne Emergency Stewards and
     t h e i r supervisors who are on duty in the se c tio n (s )
     concerned should proceed to the Emergency Assembly
     Poinc (wnich w ill have been designated in the w ritte n
     in s tr u c t io n ) and await d ir e c tio n s .   Other steward-s
     should remain a t t h e i r p o sitions.          If the emergency
ff   passes witnout there being a need to evacuate, a
     s u ita b le message w ill be broadcast and a l l stewards

I    snould resume normal d uties.




I
I i i t ls necessary to evacuate any s e c t i o n s ) of tae
grounds, an appropriate i n s tr u c ti o n should be given to
tue Einergency Steward or hia supervisor by the senior
police o f f i c e r and to stewards employed oil e x i t s by a
su ita b le          metaod or metnods.        On receiving th is
i n s t r u c t i o n tne e x i t stewards should open t h e i r e x i t
gates and the supervisor snould notify the police
ground co n tro l room immediately t h is i n s t r u c ti o n has
been complied with.                Emergency Stewards and stewards
employed on general du ties should a s s i s t the public in
leaving the ground in an orderly manner and check, a l l
t o i l e t s and puolic places to ensure tnat they have been
evacuated.             When the evacuation of the se c tio n (s ) is
completed a l l stewards should report to tne designated
Assembly Point.             In the event oL t o t a l evacuation of
tiie ground a general Assembly Point for stewards
should be designated.

I t i s e s s e n t i a l that a l l stewards have a complete l i s t
of a l l Assembly Points.

Stewards are v i t a l components of the public safety
system a t fo o tb a ll grounds.               They should t>e well
trained in emergency procedures wnicu should be c l e a r ly
defined.                Steward.s should be adequate in number,
physically and mentally capable of performing t h e ir
d u t ie s , e f f e c t i v e l y deployed, e f f i c i e n t l y supervised
and         readily           identifiable.            Police       nave    a
r e s p o n s i b i li t y to advise and encourage the management
of fo o tb a ll grounds in the e f f i c i e n t and e f f e c ti v e use
of stewards. 'Although t h e i r employment i s not d i r e c t l y
c o n tro lled by p olice, i n d i r e c t control is f a c i l i t a t e d ,
in many cases, by means of conditions in se rte d in
Safety C e r t i f i c a t e s .


6.6 Whilst ACPO guidance is comprehensive perhaps one
issue needs to be addressed. There is a t present no
general system of inspection of stewarding and i t          is
considered that a condition should be w ritte n into
Safety C e r t i f i c a t e s requiring Police inspection.

SECTION SEVEN -THE COST OF POLICING

7.1 The cost of policing fo o tb a ll is perhaps one of the
most important issues for the ACPO. I t can be argued
that the sport i t s e l f should foot the            b i l l but t h i s is
simply not a p r a c t i c a l answer.      A good deal of the
policing of f o o tb all takes place away from the ground
and there i s no basis Cor making charges.                          The
f i n a n c ia l s ta tu s of most footbalL clubs themselves is
such anyway th a t any major increase in policing co sts
would make them insolvent.              In stark, r e a l i t y i f the
Police were to i n s i s t upon f a r g r e a te r l e v e ls of
policing a t games(or indeed charge the clubs for a i l
the o f f i c e r s that now a tte n d ) the whole s tr u c t u r e of
the p rofession al sport would have to change.
I
I    i. l   In fact Cue Police generalLy charge tue Club for
    those o l f i c e r s designated to ground d uties to r t n e f u l l

I   laatch.       I t is usuai. practice for the o f f i c e r s on
    outside duties to return to the ground during t.is game
    where they lona a s u b s ta n tia l reserve - these o f f i c e r s
    are not generally charged for.
I   7.3 Recent enquiry by tne ACPO Sub Committee in dicates
    tiiat 36 o z the 92 Canon League Clubs were tnen
    experiencing d i i t l c u l t y in paying police b i l i s . 22
I   Clubs a t the time of enquiry weve more tuan three
    months in a r r e a r s and 14 clubs more tiian 6 months.

    7.4 The legal o b lig a tio n to maintain a proper level of
I   policing i s c le a r and i l foo tb all clubs sougnt to
    continue with f ix tu r e s without policing the power under
    Section   10 of Safety a t Sports Grounds Act could be
I   invoked to prevent tae game taking place.

    7.5 Whilst both the Police and Clubs are making e v e r y
    e f f o r t to deal with th e i r f in a n c ia l d i f f i c u l t i e s the
I   problem remains.

    7.6        Perhaps tae g re a te r f in a n c ia l problem for tiie
    Service        Is the sheer cost or policing foo tb all which
    cannot be o f f s e t against fo o tb all clubs. As sta te d
    earlier        In tills report (paragraph 1.2) the burden f a l l s
    unevenly - Appendix A shows d i s t r i b u t i o n of clubs as
    a g ain s t nost police forces.          I t snould also be said
    that i f tiie Police are to take new i n i t i a t i v e s and seek
    for powerful enforcement of            new l e g i s l a t i o n t h is will
    in i t s turn t r a n s la te into policing co s ts.

    There are presently two p o s s i b i l i t i e s :

    e i t h e r policing f o o tb all is Specially provided for in
    Police budgets p a r t i c u l a r l y by way of an increased
    provision fo r overtime; or fo o tb a ll is policed oy
    reducing the levels of policing elsewhere.

    7.7   I t is the view ot tiie ACPO tnat tills problem is
    not s a t i s f a c t o r i l y resolved and that Forces having a
    considerable            commitment     to  footbaLi need special
    provision.

    SECTION EIGHT - GUIDANCE TO CHIEF POLICE OFFICERS

    B. 1 The Association of Chief Police O fficers througn
    i t s system of Committees is                    involved in examining
    c r i t i c a l issues of P olicing policy where there is a
    need for common standards or where tiie problems cross
    geographical             boundaries.               Whilst   operational
    r e s p o n s i b ilit y is e n t i r e l y in the hands of the local
    Chief Constable guidance formulated by the Association
    is generally achieved by consensus and forms tiie oasis
    of much common p ractice.

  SECf ION NIKE - CONCLUSIONS Ai\D RECOMMENDATIONS

  9.1 Section One - Football Hooliganism

          (i)      Hooi.Iganisra i.s v iolent group behaviour
                   using tae cover or large crowd.; to avoid
                   individual r e s p o n s ib i li t y . Police
                   i n i t i a t i v e to counter tne Hooligan are
                   aimed a t making t ie individual accountable
                   ( I n t e ll i g e n c e and CCTV) and a t c o n tr o llin g
                   group misbehaviour (segregation, planning,
                   ground c o n tr o ls ) .

          ( ii)     ' Safety and emergency procedures' and
                   crowd c o n t r o l ' are comp Leiaentary and tiie
                   rig ht balance between containment fencing
                   and emergency e x i t f a c i l i t i e s tias to be
                   found.




9.2       Section Two - Current P ractice in Policing
                       fo o tb all.

         (1)      Current advice by tne ACPO to Chief
                  O fficers in respect of fo o tb ali is
                  conprenensive. well t r ie d and sound.
                  I t is presently being reviewed in the
                  l i g h t ol new l e g i s l a t i o n and new
                   i n i t Latives.

         ^ii)     P ublicatio n of guidance is in tne process
                  of being prepared for wider c i r c u l a t i o n
                  within the Service.

‘J . 3   Section Three - Recent Developments

         (i)      Drunkenness is a m aterial factor in
                  hooliganism and the problem largely r e l a t e s
                  to consumption by 'away support1 whilst
                  en route ana not alcohol consumed ac tne
                  ground.

         (ii)     The new ' B i l l ' is generally supported by
                  the ACPO and provides powers to deal with
                  many aspects of the problem.
               The ACPO are however concerned a t some
               issues and observe that the speed of
               enactment has noc allowed for d etailed
               consultation .
               ( P a r t i c u l a r l y the need to include private
               hire mini buses In the r e s t r i c t i o n s ; and
               to widen tne exemption to include private
               viewing boxes.)

      ( iv )   Membership card schemes are not seen as
               an answer to hooliganism because of the
               p r a c ti c a l and legal d i f f i c u l t i e s of making
               a scheme e f f e c ti v e . There may be some
               benefit however in trie development of
               family enclosures within grounds.

      (v)      'A il - tic k e t f i x t u r e s ' are only s u ita b le
               for 'c ap acity games' and require close
               supervision ot. tic k e t sa les.

      (vi)     "Early kick- o ffs" probably a t t r a c t less
               problems but must not be arranged without
               considering the p o s s i b i l i t y of the rowdy
               element attending otner fix tu res
               afterwards.

      (v ii)   The ACHO recognise tiiat tiie Home Club can
               do a good deal by providing amenities to
               promote a friendly atmosphere and tiie
               Police are keen to co-operate where
               appropriate.


      ( v i i i ) The ACPO strongly supports the development
                  of CCTV for evidence gathering and
                  providing management information.
                  Evaluation of e a r ly sciiemes iias led to
                  modifications and the ACPO i.s in
                  co n s u lta tio n with tiie riome Office 'SRDB'
                  and the Football Trust to develop a
                  s p e c if i c a t io n and extend usage.


9.4 Section Four - In te llig e n c e

      (i)      In te llig e n c e gathering aas been reviewed
               and refined and a far more comprehensive
               and systematic scheme has been designed
               and w ill be operative next season.
9.5 Section Five - Police Powers

      (i)      I t i.* generally Police p ractice to
               pre fe r charges wiiere there is evidence of
               a substantive offence although 'e j e c t i o n '
               may be appropriate in some instances such
               as breach of ground ru les.
        (ii)      Proposal* tor ciianges in the Public Order
                  L,aw may be of advantage tor policing
                  hooliganism. The Power under Che Sporting
                  Events (Control or Alcohol) B ill will
                  allow for more e f f e c tiv e policing
                  p a r t i c u l a r l y a t t u r n s t i l e s but taere w ill
                  be resource im plications.

         (iii)    Police powers of search remaia a d i i 'i i c u l t y
                  and the ACPO is not convinced tiiat the
                  terras of tae guidance to the Codes under
                  the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
                  resolve th is issue. Police powers based
                  on a condition of entry are not considered
                  a.i appropriate.

         ( iv )   The ACPO look for support in the positive
                  policing of hooliganism in the coming
                  season and emphasise the need to curb the
                  rowdy and intim idating behaviour from
                  which the violence springs. I t is
                  a n t i c i p a t e d that developments in CCTV and
                  In te llig e n c e w ill make a signiLicaut
                  con tributio n.

    9.6 Section Six - Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
1
         (i)      ACPO guidance on Safety C e r t i f i c a t e s
                  and Stewards Is comprehensive and
I                 up to date. The Act provides tor
                  local conditions in C e r t i f i c a t e s as
                  necessary, but tiie ACPO ta;ce tae
                  view th at routine police inspection of
I                 stewarding should be a condition.

    9.7 Section Seven - The Cost of Policing.
I        (i)      The cost o f ,p o lic in g whicn i s chargeable to
                   Footbali Clubs is only a pare of the t o t a l
f                  c o s t. A number of Football Clubs are
                   finding great d i f f i c u l t y in paying the
                   Police although i t i.s noted tiiat tnese
                   charges cnanot be avoided and tae Police
I                  would have the power to seek tiie closure of
                   a ground i f i t was not adequately policed.

e        (ii)     The burden of poLicing fo o tb all f a l l s
                  heavily on c e r t a i n forces, p a r t i c u l a r l y
                  those ia large connurbations where other

 C onsid era tion should be given to making i t a

The q u a l i f y i n g phrase (e) excludes people in such a

Such an offenc e would r e q u i r e a s p e c i f i c power to

                                  as an example of th e s o r t of problem we sought to

                                  There i s a need f o r a general law t o deal with:

PROVISIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

1)    I am minded t o recommend t h a t in England and Wales t h e P o li c e should be
      given t h e u n f e t t e r e d r i g h t of search be fo re e n tr y t o f o o t b a l l grounds

      Searching was a l s o d e a l t with in th e ACPO response t o th e White Paper
      as a s e r io u s d e f i c i e n c y in t h e crimin al law.        There i s a c l e a r

 The new complaints procedure and a proper i n s i s t e n c e on c o r r e c t
 procedures emphasised by t h e P o li c e and Criminal Evidence Act have made

 Some p ro v is io n has been provided in t h e P o li c e and Criminal Evidence

 but not "unless he has re aso nable grounds f o r s u sp e c tin g t h a t he w ill

While such a p ro v is io n may be j u s t adequate t o deal with i n d i v i d u a l s or

The i n g r e d i e n t s of a power t o search need t o be c a r e f u l l y balanced t o
provide a p p r o p r i a t e backing f o r p o l i c e a c t io n with adequate safeguards

                 confirmed in w r i t i n g as soon as p r a c t i c a b l e .

The aim i s to a u t h o r i s e p o l i c e o f f i c e r s to make s e l e c t i v e searches

2)   I am minded t o         recommend t h a t Section 10 of t h e F i r e P r e c a u tio n s Act,
      1971 should be         amended with a view to giving t h e F ir e A uthority power

      Matter f o r t h e    Fire Servic e and Home O ffi c e .

3)   Linked to t h e above I am minded t o recommend t h a t c o n s i d e r a t i o n should
     be given to in tr o d u c in g l e g i s l a t i o n giv in g powers f o r t h e F ir e
     A uth ority t o apply t o t h e High Court f o r an in j u n c t i o n under Section 10

     Matter f o r t h e F ir e Se rv ic e and th e Home O f f i c e .

4)   I am minded to recommend t h a t Section 10 of t h e Safe ty a t Sports

     P r ec a u tio n s Act and an a p p l i c a t i o n t o t h e High Court f o r an i n j u n c tio n
     should be an a l t e r n a t i v e remedy.

     This recommendation i s intended t o provide Local A u t h o r i t i e s with
     g r e a t e r ease of access to t h e Courts than what i s provided by Section
     10 of th e Safe ty of Spor ts Grounds Act under th e heading "Emergency

     Access to th e High Court might well prove exped ien t in an emergency.

v i)    Running on t h e p i t c h

The ACPO view i s t h a t i n d i v i d u a l s who run onto th e p i t c h do so e i t h e r
because they a re p ro p e lle d by f e a r of viole nc e on t e r r a c i n g or by a
s p i r i t of e x h ib itio n is m or v i o l e n t i n t e n t . The use of d i s c r e t i o n w ill
i n v a r i a b l y d i s t i n g u i s h between th e two kinds o f i n d i v i d u a l s . Sometimes
an a c t           of encroachment on th e p i t c h can provoke a p i t c h in va sion by
r i v a l fans i n t e n t e i t h e r on a t t a c k i n g each o t h e r or pre v e n tin g t h e
match from c o n tin u in g .                In th e e v e n t , such behaviour i s d e a l t with
either             bye j e c t i o n f o r breach of ground r u l e s or by a r r e s t f o r an
o ffence of breach of t h e peace. In Scotland such conduct f a l l s w ith in
th e d e f i n i t i o n of a coironon law breach of th e peace which covers a very
wide range of circum stances from a p u b lic nuisance t o r i o t i n g , and
u nlike England, where t h e M a g is tra te s can only make a binding over
o r d e r , in Scotland th e p e n a l t i e s are l i m i t e d only by th e powers of th e
Court he arin g th e c a s e .

I t i s a n t i c i p a t e d , however, t h a t with improved s e g r e g a tio n  and
p e rim e te r fe n c in g , running on t h e p i t c h may not be q u i t e t h e same
problem as b e f o r e . Nonetheless such behaviour ought not to be t r e a t e d
l i g h t l y in view of th e s e r io u s consequences which might flow from i t .
Therefore th e ACPO f e e l s t h a t should t h e r e not be a general off ence
which encompasses such behaviour i t should lend support t o any
recommendation t o make running on t h e p i t c h a s e p a r a te o ff e n c e .

NOTE:       The Popplewell Report (para 6.65) makes th e
            following p o in t when a ddre ssin g th e questi o n
            of p i t c h encroachment, "In Scotland i t may
            c o n s t i t u t e th e coiranon law off en ce of breach of
            t h e peace."

            The common law in Scotland has developed
            r a t h e r d i f f e r e n t l y than in England and Wales.
            The common law p ublic ord e r o ffences in
            Scotland a re breach of t h e peace and mobbing
            and r i o t i n g .         Breach of th e peace covers a
            very wide range of circumstances from a minor
            p u b lic        nuisance           off en ce  to    off ences
            approaching r i o t i n g in s e r i o u s n e s s .

            I t i s defined t h u s :          “Breach of t h e peace is
            c o n s t i t u t e d by one or more persons conducting
            themselves or themselves in a r i o t o u s or
            d i s o r d e r l y manner t o t h e alarm, annoyance or
            d is tu r b a n c e of th e l i e g e s . "

            The p e n a l t i e s f o r both breach of t h e peace and
            r i o t i n g a re l i m i t e d only by th e powers of th e
            courts.

Popplewell Report (para 6.48) recommends t h a t urgent c o n s i d e r a t i o n
should be given to in tr o d u c in g a membership card system so as to
exclude v i s i t i n g f a n s .            This i s based on t h e assumption t h a t “i f

s e r i o u s l y undermined.

The primary purpose of any membership scheme must be t o exclude th ose
who become i d e n t i f i e d as hooligans e i t h e r a t t h e enrolment s ta g e or
because of t h e i r subsequent behaviour.                      Those r e s p o n s ib le f o r

The c r i t i c a l q ue stion t h e r e f o r e , i s from which source would they obta in

p o l i c e a re an obvious c h oic e, but they a re p r o h i b i t e d by s t a t u t e from

To r e s t r i c t admittance t o "home11 s u p p o rte rs might deprive t h e clubs o f
an important source of revenue which could prompt severa l clubs t o get

scheme which provides f o r casual non-members t o be admitted in
p a r t i c u l a r s e c t i o n s of t h e ground puts a t r i s k any plans t o seg r e g a te

Another important c o n s i d e r a t i o n i s what kinds of behaviour w ill lead t o

All of which a re t a r g e t s fo r th e f o o t b a l l hoo ligan.

The ACPO fe e l t h e r e i s much t o commend a number of a l t e r n a t i v e measures

 Experiments a t grounds in G re at er Manchester, West Yorkshire and West

 a)     in re c o rding i n c i d e n t s of d i s o r d e r , th e r o l e played by

         area of evidence g a th e rin g coverage be fore and a f t e r each

 The c o u r t s have found th e evidence produced by video and photographers
 t o be of g re a t value in s ec u rin g t h e c o n v ic tio n of o ffende rs who
 otherw ise would avoid p r o s e c u ti o n .

The Football Trust which i s adm iniste re d independently of t h e Football

I t i s t h e r e f o r e , of some         concern t o t h e ACPO t h a t t h e Act omitted any

         There a r e ,    of course, r e c o g n isa b le d i f f i c u l t i e s with enforcement, but
         i t is also      th e view of t h e ACPO t h a t t h e s e a r e not insurmountable and
         would be         outweighed by t h e d e t e r r e n t value were t h i s loophole
         effectively       plugged.

         The p a r t i c u l a r q ue sti on of consumption in " p r i v a t e viewing boxes" i s
         covered by Section Two of t h e Act, which p r o h i b i t s t h e p osse ss io n of
         alcohol in any area of th e ground from which th e event may be d i r e c t l y
         viewed. According t o t h e ex p la n ato ry memorandum accompanying t h e Act,
         such a r e a s inclu de t h e s t a n d s , t e r r a c e s and t h e r e s t a u r a n t , s p o n s o r ' s
         boxes and o th e r rooms which overlook t h e p i t c h .

         The Act goes on t o s p e c ify th e terms and c o n d itio n s applying t o

         premises from which th e event may be d i r e c t l y viewed.

         In essence t h e r e f o r e , p r i v a t e viewing boxes may well prove t o be th e
         only p a r t s of f o o t b a l l grounds which p r e v io u s ly enjoyed drin king

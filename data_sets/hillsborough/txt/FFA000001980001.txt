15. TICKETS SOLD AT ENHANCED PRICES - CUP FINAL 1983 A Sub-Committee
       consisting of Mr. J.F. Wiseman and Dr. J. O'Hara was appointed
       to deal with reports received regarding the sale of tickets at enhanced
       prices. Although the investigations into tickets sold at enhanced prices
       was time consuming and did not always appear to produce the desired results
       it was felt important that such investigations should continue and that
       The Football Association should be seen to be taking action in respect of
       this problem. The question of whether consideration should be given to
       lifting the restriction imposed whereby Cup Final Tickets could not be
      used as prizes in raffles and lotteries was raised and it was agreed
       that the matter be deferred for discussion at a later meeting.


16.   SCOTLAND v. ENGLAND - 26TH MAY, 1984 Following the recent England v. Scotland
        Match reports had been received from various bodies, including London
        Transport and the Police, that they were happy with the arrangements that
        had been made in respect of the holding of this match and felt that they
        had proved very successful. It was, therefore, decided that an allocation
        of saleable tickets for the Scotland v. England match be applied for
        to The Scottish Football Association in accordance with the demand that
        existed.


17.   CHALLENGE CUP SEMI-FINAL TIE VENUES A report was received that crowd control
        problems had been experienced around the ground of Aston Villa F.C., on the
        occasion of the Manchester United v. Arsenal Semi-Final Cup Tie on 16th
        AprilK 1983. A brief discussion was held during which the possibility of
        staging both semi-final ties at Wembley Stadium was again referred to.
        It was not thought that any change should be made at present but that the
        matter should be kept under review.

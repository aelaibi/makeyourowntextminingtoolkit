I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police,    at present in the
Divisional Intelligence Office at Ecclesfield Police Station.   Prior to 24
April 1989, I was stationed at Hammerton Road Police Station in the same
capacity.

At 6.50 a.m. on Saturday 15 April 1 9 8 9 , I commenced duty at Hammerton Road
Police Station.   I was engaged in Divisional Intelligence duties and confined
to the office at that Station until 3-00 p.m. the same day.

At 3.20 p.m. a number of prisoners were brought to Hammerton Road Police
Station from Hillsborough Football Ground where the semi final between
Liverpool and Notts Forest was taking place.    After completing my Divisional
Intelligence duties I was immediately engaged with other officers in the
process and verification of the prisoners from the football ground. I remained
on the Station in connection with those duties and completed my tour of duty at
11.00 p.m. that day.    At no time during this particular tour of duty did I
leave the Station.     I was not directly involved with the incident which
occurred at the Hillsborough Football Ground that day.

I a m a Pol ice C o n s t a b l e w i t h South Yo r k s h i r e Police at present
sta ti on ed at H a m m e r t o n Road Police              Station,    Sheffield.      I am at      <-he
present        time w o r k i n g beat duties         on    *B'   gr ou p but also have
responsibility operating                   the static video sy s t e m wh ic h is installed
      Hillsborough         F o o tb al l   Stadium,     Sheffield.
 On a pe rs on al       level     I have vi si te d H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m on many
 occ as io ns    as a s p e c t a t o r    st anding on the ter rac e at the Spion Kop
 end of the gro und and the Leppings                       Lane terrace.        I have also
 wo rk e d     in all parts       of the ground as a pol ice officer during my

 past 8 years         service.
 In Sep te mb er      1987     I took over duties            re la tin g to the video sys tem
 w o rk in g    from the Po li ce Control Box and since that time I have
 a tt en de d a 3 day cou rs e             in re la tio n to the use of video systems               for
 Co mm an d and Cont rol          and as a me th o d of ev id enc e gathering.               The
 original        sy s t e m in s t al l e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h was   laid out as a Command
 and Control         Sy st e m giv i n g a basic all round vi ew both inside and
  out sid e the ground.             Wh il st   I have been involved with the duties
  that empha sis has s h if te d             from Com ma nd and Control to evidence
  ga th er in g and wi th that end in min d several                      improvements have been
  made the most recent being a survey of the Leppings Lane end
  camera,       the 'intention being to mov e the camera from its present
p os i t i o n a t t a c h e d to the roof of the West Stand bringing                   it dow n to

a position          just a bo ve        the tu rnstiles.         The survey was carr ied out

using a hand h e l d v i d e o ca me ra m o u n t e d on the pl at fo rm of a

hydraulic         lift.         Two p o s i t i o n s w ere considered,       the first mou nt ed

on a p o l e            at the       far most co rne r of the Leppings           Lane turnstiles

the    se co nd p o s i t i o n       just above gate       'B'.    It was dec id ed    that the

best p o s i t i o n w o u l d be above            'B\ gate.      This posit ion giving good

all a r o u n d views           a lo ng Le ppings     Lane,    to the turnstiles       be low and

the c o u r t y a r d at the rear of the Leppi ngs Lane terrace.                        The system

in st al le r Roger H o l d s w o r t h ag re ed to complete a costing for the

imp r o v e m e n t s    and    if the cash was av ail abl e             from the football trust,

he w o u l d at te m p t        to install       the ca m e r a in it's new po si ti on in time

for the Semi             Final.

U n f o r t u n a t e l y the c l e ri ca l     side of this operation could not be

c o m p l e t e d q u i c k e n o u g h and      the pla nn ed m o v e     for the camera was

s u s p e n d e d until        the    summer     break.

On S a t u r d a y 15 April            1989,     I c o mme nce d duty at 10 am atten din g at

the po lice r o o m at Hillsbor ou gh ,                 c oll ect ing     the hand held VHS radio

w h i c h I used to m o n i t o r tr an s m i s s i o n s via Operations           Room.    On this

p a r t i c u l a r day channel          1     had been des ig na te d for all VHF

t r a n s m i s s i o n r e l a t i n g to     the Semi Final.

After c o l l e c t i n g the radio             I made my way to the Leppings Lane

terrace w he re           I saw that Roger Ho ld sw or th was working on camera

number 5 w h i c h o v er lo ok s              the Leppings Lane        terrace pens. The

picture q u a l i t y had been                 su bs ta nd ard for a number of weeks       and Mr

H o l d s w o r t h was ca rr y i n g out some last minute alterations                  to upgrade

the picture.              After he had compl et ed the work the picture was
indeed be t t e r      t ha n it had been a l t h o u g h not up to the correct

standard.       I then m a d e my wa y to the Con tr ol               Box w he re I met wi th

S e r g e a n t G o d d a r d and PC Ryan.        Af ter a brief c o nv er sa ti on     I began

to c he ck the v i d e o s y s t e m op e r a t i n g ea ch of the five cameras             in

turn.     We w e r e    later    joined by Su p e r i n t e n d e n t Mu rr a y and it was

ag r e e d b e t w e e n us that S e r ge an t G od da rd wo ul d ope rat e the personal

radio,     PC Ryan the ta n n o y and te le pho ne and I in ad di t i o n to my

du ties    as c a m e r a o p e r a t o r w o u l d m o n i t o r the VHF set using it if

necessary.          These duties were no di f f e r e n t to what w ou ld be carried

out on a normal m a t c h day.

Around     10.55 am that date,               S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Cha pma n contact control

re g a r d i n g a g r o u p of Li v e r p o ol   su ppo rte rs wh o were wai ti ng outside

the     5 Ar ches    pu b l i c house.        There was at this time no trouble but

the i n f o r m a t i o n was   pa s s e d   just so that officer could be aware that

 groups of s u p p o r t e r s had ar ri v ed and were intent on getting a drink

 before    the match.           Several other pe rs ona l radio me ss ag es were then

 rece iv ed r e g a r d i n g the same topic.

 About    11.20     am Se rgeant Go dd ar d car rie d out radio checks some

 perso na l    radios did not reply and the sector                     Inspectors were asked

 to make checks w h e r e ap propriate.                 Th rou gho ut this time various

 mes sa ge s were co mi ng in regard ing traffic problems                      the city side of

 the ground,         Ml mo torway,       Parkway,      etc,   di ver sio ns were in force.

 This     i n d i c a t e d that the N o t t i n g h a m supporters were en route in

  numbers and could be e x pe ct ed at the ground for the turnstile

  ope nin g time of 12 noon.
Just a ft er     noon    I i n s e r t e d the   2 VHS vi deo tapes      in the two vi deo

re corders.       The time and dat e s y s t e m was checked and set pos si bl y

using the gr o u nd       lock m o u n t e d above the North Stand or by a time

c he ck w i t h o th er o f f i c e r s   in the control        box.   The tapes were set

to run at no rmal         speed,     m y int en ti on being that around 2.30 pm the

same date      I would       inset    2 new tapes w h i c h w ou ld then include the

build up to the m a t c h t h r o u g h o u t      the game and the su ppo rte rs

leavin g the ground.             A r o u n d this time it was noti ced that persons

had e n t e r e d the ground.

A short     time later        it was d i s c o v e r e d that some of the Penis ton e

Road t u r n s t i l e s we r e not m a n n e d due to an a d m i ni st ra ti ve error this

was c o r r e c t e d by d e p l o y i n g one of the spare serials.          Some time

betw ee n   1.00 pm and 2.30 pm there was                concern ex pre sse d regarding

the L i ve rp oo l    fans    p u r c h a s i n g Kop tickets    from touts at Leppings

Lane tu rnstiles.            This w o u l d mean of course that a m i xt ur e of fans

would have to be s u p e r v i s e d wi th in the Kop terrace.

During this         same pe r i o d pro ble ms     began arising in various public

houses near to tHe gr ou nd ones that                 spring to mind were the Horse

and Jo c k e y and the Royal.              The c om pl ai nt s were that fans were

d r i n k i n g h e a v i l y out on the street,      ur ina tin g in gardens and being

a gen er al     nuisance.        Some time be tw e en      1.30 pm and 2.00 pm I began

 to no tice that on the Kop several Live rpo ol                    fans had been placed

 in the tria ng le area near to the No rth Stand end supervised by

 several police officers.                 I set camera     4 to monitor the situation

 no t ic in g that se veral arrests were made and that ma np owe r was

 ge tt i n g low.       I r e m e m b e r e d that there had been some trouble at last

 Years    m at ch in the       same lo cation and I questi one d Super int end ent

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y then c o n t a c t e d   Inspe cto r   Sewell re ga rdi ng the

manpower         s i t u a t i o n and he c o n f i r m e d that      2 coaches each contai nin g

40 men w o u l d be on s t a n d b y             in Pe ni st on e    Road.

Around      2.00 pm S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mu rr ay and Chief             Supe rin ten den t

D u c k e n f i e l d went to speak to the m a t c h referee.                    Thro ugh the

afternoon         complaints          had been e x p r e s se d r e g ar di ng the quality of

pe r so na l     ra di o t r a n s m i s s i o n s    to the control     staff.

Around      2.00 pm I o v e r h e a d on VH F that Li ve rpo ol                 supporters had been

spoken to on a c oa ch w h i c h had di s p l a y e d a N o t t i n g h a m Forest

s u pp o r t e rs p a r k i n g ticket.              The coach and suppor ter s were spoken to

by t r af fi c of fi c e rs         and advised.

About      the     same time        there was a report of tr ou bl es om e Liverpool

fans on a coach r e g i s t e r e d number                 9995 RU.      This number was

c i r c u l a t e d and the c oa ch was               checked by one of the mobile serials.

Ar ou nd    2.20 pm the ACC Ja ck so n was                  in the control box when he

not ice d a man on the L e pp ing s Lane terrace south pen.                              He dropped

his tr ou se rs and be gan foo li ng about.                         His be ha vio ur was such that

it was b e l i e v e d that he was drunk and the ACC asked for something

to be done about him.                     I set the camera to mon it or his behaviour.

Ab out     2.15 pm all the control room staff dis cu ss ed that it was

apparent         the L i v ep ro ol       fans had not begun to arrive as yet.                      The

Nor th Stand had vast                 spaces altho ugh the Leppings Lane terrace was

filling up at a normal                    rate.        Just after this the personal radio

t ra n s m i s s i o n s became worse and the civilian radio repair man came

 into the control box to attempt a repair.
A bo ut   2.30 pm my a t t e n t i o n was d ra wn to the                large crowd outside the

Leppings      Lane     tu rn st il es .     I w o u l d es ti m a t e around 3,000 people and

it was a p p a r e n t      that   the nu mber was          in cr e a s i n g by the volume of

foot p a s s e n g e r s    in L e p p i n g s Lane    itself.

Chief     Superintendent           D u c k e n f i e l d as ke d about the large crowd and it

was   said that a l t h o u g h        it was more than normal,                 it was no more than

was e x p e c t e d for       such a fo otball match.

About     2.35 pm the c i v i l i a n r ad io repair man stated that he could

not    fix the p e r so na l       radio    s y s t e m and it was necessary to resort to

us in g the ra dios on a back to back                    system.

About the          same     time Chief    S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Du ck en fi el d   came   to the

 back of the control               box and asked me if the crowd scenes at the

 L e p p i n g s Lane were       b ei ng r e c o r d e d and X replied             Yes

 A p e r so na l    radio on Le pp i n g s Lane r e q u e s t e d more manpo wer to

 the South Stand car park.

 A pe rsonal        radio m e s s a g e then came in stating that the gates were

 being forced,              the"y we re be nd i n g and buckling.              In my mind       I

  b e l ie ve d that        the gates r e f e r re d to were           'C' gate and I kept          the

  Lep pi ng s Lane ca m e r a set to that sort of area.

  About     2.40 pm Chief          Su p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k en fi el d and Superintendent

  M u r r a y r e q u e s t e d that   I contact Op er at io ns          Room so that a traffic

  car with a PA sy st em could at te nd in Le pp ing s Lane and advised the

  crowd w h i c h were by this time b e c o m i n g app ar en tl y more hostile.                          I

   also r e m em be r ar ou nd this time that Sergeant Goddard picked up the

   personal        radio t e l ep ho ne    style ha nds et and after trying to use it,

   threw it down onto the desk bec au se                      it was not working and the
pers on al    r ad io t r a n s m i s s i o n s   were very poor.     I can re me mbe r seeing

about     5 or 6 o f f i c e r s     stood on b a r r i er duty     just past the gate    'C'

to wa rd s   the    South     Stand.

About     2.40 pm I r e m e m b e r       se ei ng    'C' gate open and a number of

su pp or t e r s   enter the ground.               I then said words like     'They've

br oken d ow n the g a t e 1 .          At the same time        I indicated to the staff

in the con tr ol box to w a t c h the Le pp i n g s Lane monitor.                  After about

20 se conds        I n o t i c e d that the gate was          closed and it seemed that a

m o u n t e d of fi c e r alone had p r e v e n t e d a big rush of people through

the open gate.            I remember          seeing m o u n t e d officers trying to clear

space     in the crowd.

The re qu e s t     for a d d i t i o n a l   o f f ic ers to be sent to Leppings Lane was

made to I n s pe ct or        Sewell and I re me mbe r him offer ing two Serials,

one of w h i c h was        the    'F' D i v i s i o n Crime and Vandal,     they were

d i r e c t e d to the L e p p i n g s Lane end of the ground.

I saw Li v e r p o o l    fans c l i m b i n g the walls of the ground onto the

turns ti le roofs and I in p a r t i c u l a r rem em be r several being sat

astride      gate     'B' w i t h po li ce of ficers         stood below.    I think at this

time a pers on al          radio m e s s a g e was      sent regarding the climbers and

an off ic er r e p l i e d that he could not reach them.

Around 2.45 pm I reme mb er a personal_ radio message                       from

Sup er in t e n d e n t M a r sh al l    to the effect       'We must open the gates or

 someone      is going to be killed,                 please open the gates.'

At this time Chief              Inspector M c R ob bie       is in the control box wea ri ng

 ci v il ia n clothing.

 I r e m em be r   seeing an officer on the top of the turnstiles at

 Lep pi ng s Lane end and Chief                   Sup er int end ent Duckenfield made




                                                       19
enquiries         as to the o f f i c e r ' s       identity.     Ano th er personal      radio

message      was    received        f ro m S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall,   his voice was

ve r y di s t r e s s e d ,     'You must open the gates,              open the gates'.       Chief

Superintendent             D u c k e n f i e l d se em ed to pa use    for thought and then

said     'Right      if lives       are at risk,         then open the gates'.            Sergeant

G o d d a r d the n t r a n s m i t t e d    'Open the gates,         open the gates'.       Just

pri or to this          I remember           seeing of fi ce rs    behind     'A' gate,   they were

set out       in two lines           form ing a funnel.           Sergeant Higgins of        'F' C&V

transmitted          on pe rs o n a l       radio   'There are people being crushed

outs ide      'A' gate we mu st open                'A' gate'.

I r e m e m b e r that ab ou t        the time the gates were orde red to be opened

mo u n t e d of fi c e r s o u t s i d e Leppi ngs Lane tu rns til es had managed to

cr eat e a void b e t w e e n the tur ns ti le s            and the outer perimeter

railings,         in fact,        I be li ev ed that at one time the officers man ag ed

to close        the outer gates,              however,    the crowd outside          forced its way

 t h ro ug h the outer gates and ran into the ground via                            'C' gate at

 least.        I re me m b e r    seeing crowds at the rear of Leppings Lane

 ter rac e     just be hi n d the turnstiles,               they were      just stood about not

 d oi ng a n y t h i n g      in par tic ula r.

 About      2.55 pm Chief           Su pe ri nt en de nt D u c k e nf ie ld told control room

 staff to get some m a n p o w e r to the N or th Stand to stop any possible

 rush onto the pitch.                   It was at this time that we began to notice

 L i v er po ol    fans c l i m b i n g up into the West Stand from the terrace

  area.     They were as si s t e d by people             in the stand and the same

  p r o b l e m had oc cu r r e d the previous year.               A short time later fans

  were    seen to climb the perim ete r track fence.                         Officers on the

  track seemed to be tel lin g the                    fans to get down from the fence.               At




                                                       Oo
this point         the staff       in the       control       box and I thought that the

s i t u a t i o n was p u r e l y p u b l i c order.          No in fo rm at io n was coming in to

the ef fe ct that pe o p l e w ere g e t t i n g hurt.

A c r o w d g a t h e r e d on the         p e r i m e t e r tr ack an d Chief Sup eri nt en de nt

D u c k e n f i e l d o r d e r e d that    they     should be m o v e d as quickly as

p os s i b l e to the w i n g      s e c t i o ns    of Leppi ngs      Lane terrace where       it

could be seen that              there was           space.     Chief    Supe rin ten den t

D u c k e n f i e l d was a n g r y ab ou t     of fi cer s    stood aro und the track near to

the Kop and the N o r t h Stand.                     A pe rs ona l   radio mess age was sent to

the of fi ce rs and they were d i r e c t e d to the                    front of the North

Stand.       Ar o un d this time C hie f             In sp ec to r Mc Ro bb ie was   sent to the

pitch to get things               so r t e d out.        One p r o b l e m was a WPC stood on the

p er ime ter     track     just b e l o w the control            box.     She did not app ear to

be m o v i n g people off the t r a ck and in fact at one stage opened the

p e r im e t er gate to the t r a c k then w a l k e d off leaving the gate open.

Chief       Inspe ct or M c Ro b b i e      too k charge       of the po li ce wo ma n and began

us he ri ng people         from the track.               By this time there were people on

the pit ch and the p e r i m e t e r track gates were open allow ing people

out of the centre pens.                     Still at this        stage no one in the control

 box was aware that the p r o b l e m was more than a pitch invasion

 situation.

 Just after the m a t c h was                sto ppe d ACC Jac ks on was        in the control box
        a

 and he ordered me to co nt act Op era tio ns                        Room and call operation

 support.         It was at this point that                   I deci ded to concentrate on

 opera tin g the V H F radio rather than the camera system.                              Very

 su ddenly it became a p p a re nt                  that there were injuries and at that

 time       I co ntacted O p e r a t i on s         Room for ambulances to be sent to the

 Lepp ing s Lane end of the ground.                          There were people all over the
c itc h   in front      of the    goal mouth,         p e rs on s were    laid across    the

floor w i t h pe rs o n s    g i v i n g m o u t h to mouth.       Xt was only then that we

be gan to feel that          there might          be deaths.       A personal     radio mes sa ge

was   sent to co nt r o l      asking      for bolt cutt ers an d Serg ean t God da rd

co n t a c t e d C l a y w h e e l s Lane asking     if they had cutters on the bri -ma c

tr ans po rt er .      The r e p l y was negative.           He tur ned to me and I told

h im that I w o u l d c o n t a c t     the     fire s e r v i ce w h i c h I did via

Operations         Room.    -I ma d e    it clear that we re qu ire d cutting

e q u ip me nt    for the m et al       fences.      I re me mb er someone     instruc tin g PC

Ryan to use the t a n n o y te ll i n g people              to stay calm.         I can remember

 seeing bodies         being m o v e d towards        the tunnel on the Leppi ngs          Lane

      jgce   from the c e n t r e       pens.     I believe     that     it was police

 officers w h o were m o v i n g the bodies              from the area.        Liverpool       fans

 who were on the p i t c h st ar t e d to run tow ard s                the Kop.     Officers

 m a n a g e d to stop the charge and split up several groups of fans who

 were     fighting.        A line of officers were then formed across                    the

 Ditch     just the Kop side of the centre line.                         I recall the fire

 service a r r i v i n g at L e p p i n g s Lane and their men running onto the

 pitch.          I then sent a m e s sa ge to Ope ra ti on s        that we did have

  fa talities at the         g r o u n d alt ho ugh when      I sent this message no

  details had been p a s s e d by personal                radio.     It was all done      from

  observation.          F u r t h e r contact     from O p er at io ns Roo m regarding the

  number of a m b u l a n c e re qu i r e d and they said wou ld it be more than 20

  and I said so m e t h i n g to the effect that we need as ma n y as

  possible.

  Tra f f i c m o t o r cycles were ordered to cover the routes to both

  hospitals and I made a request for the senior ambulance off ic er to

   at te nd the control          box.     He did not arrive.             The senior fire
o f f i c e r a t t e n d e d at the co nt r o l   box and liaised with senior

o f f i c e r s and he too a s k e d to spe ak to the            senior am bu lan ce officer.

Another       req ue st was m a d e       for that o f f i c e r to att end the control box

via O p e r a t i o n s    Room.

About     3.35 pm I c h e c k e d the v ide o tapes and d is co ve re d that one had

s t o p p e d a n d the s e c o n d had been s w i t c h e d to operate in the 18 hour

mode w h i c h      in ef f e c t     speeds up the a c t i o n of the scene being

record ed.          This       I can only think was caught by me whilst standing

at the rear of the v id eo control                   area.     The videos are set at knee

height      and I b e l i e v e that as I leant           forward this is how I altered

 the time mode            setting.

 I i n s t a l l e d two new tapes and set th e m runn ing at normal speed.

 Mr C l o u g h and Mr D a l g l e i s h en te re d the control box and offered

 their     se rv ice s         once they had e s t a b l i s h e d that the m at ch was off.

 Mr D a l g l e i s h w a n t e d to speak to the        fans and he was asked to use

 the ta n n o y      sy s t e m in the DJs control           box below the police control.

 S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y then later ask ed     for details of transport so

  that preparations- -could be made                  for empt yin g the ground.      I

  re me mbe r     some time af te r this Su pe ri nt en de nt Murray saying to PC

  Ryan that he w a n t e d a me ss a ge pas si ng over the tannoy telling the

  L iv erp ool      fans to stay calm and remain where they were until the

  a mb ul an ce s     had left the Stadium.

  Some tim e      later the ground was empt ied and around 5.30 pm I removed

   the vi de o tapes and made my way to the gym to offer assistance.                           I

   was    later "sent to HQ with the video tapes and I there saw Chief

   S up er i n t e n d e n t    Duckenfield,    Se rgeant Booth,    ACC Jack son and Chief

   S up er in t e n d e n t     Denton.

   About      11.00 Det e ct i v e Sup eri nt en de nt McKay attended and he
i n s t r u c t e d me to re t u r n to H a m m e r t o n Road,        book the video tapes

into the p r o p e r t y       store and a wai t       the arri val of AVA,       Sergeant

Foster,         was   to a t t e n d   so that copies       of the vi deo tapes     could be

made.

Ab out   11.30 pm S e r g e a n t        Fo ste r a r r i v e d at Ha mme rto n Road Police

S t at io n a n d I e x p l a i n e d the faults         on the v id eo tapes.      He as ke d if

I c o u l d get h ol d of the v id eo re co rd er used wi th the 18 hour mode

se tt in g so that he c o u l d tr an s f e r the tape action at the correct

speed.          I then went        back to the gr ou nd and removed one of the video

recorders         from the po l i c e co ntr ol        box tak ing it to Ecc les fi el d

Tr ai n i n g    School w he re        I han ded   it to Sergeant Foster.          My immediate

the    fans b e f o r e / d u r i n g or after the incident.               I cannot relate any

i n f o r m a t i o n r e g a r d i n g the s t ew ar di ng of the ground and I had no

I am a Police            Constable with            South Y o r k s h i r e P o l i c e        at p r e s e n t

On a p e r s o n a l     level      I have visited Hillsborough                       S t a d i u m on m a n y

pa s t   8 years        s e r vice.
In S e p t e m b e r    1987     I took over duties               relating to the              video       system
working       f r o m the       Police Control          B o x and s i n c e t hat            time    I have

a position         just     above        the    turnstiles.             The    s urvey was          c a r r i e d out

the   c o u r t y a r d at the         rear     of the L e p p i n g s        Lane    terrace.           The s y s t e m

he w o u l d    attempt         to i n s t a l l     the c a m e r a    in it's        new position           in t i m e

U n f o r t u n a t e l y the    clerical          side of this           operation           could    not be

completed quick enough and                         the p l a n n e d m o v e         for the c a m e r a was

suspended until              the      summer       break.

On    Saturday         15 A p r i l     1989,      I commenced           d u t y at       10 a m a t t e n d i n g at

the p o l i c e    r o o m at H i l l s b o r o u g h ,       collecting            the    hand held VHS radio

particular         day channel             1 had       been designated               for all V H F

After      c o l l e c t i n g the r a d i o       I m a d e m y w a y to the             L e p p i n g s Lane

number      5 which overlooks                  the     L e p p i n g s Lane t e r r a c e     pens.     The

picture quality had been                       substandard           for a n u m b e r of w e e k s         an d Mr

H o l d s w o r t h was     c a r r y i n g out      some     last m i n u t e      alterations          to u p g r a d e

indeed better             than     it h a d b e e n a l t h o u g h not              up t o t h e      correct

standard.            I t h e n m a d e m y w a y to the C o n t r o l                  Box where        I met with

Sergeant          Goddard      and     PC Ryan.            After a brief               conversation          I began

a g r e e d b e t w e e n us     that      Sergeant          Goddard would operate                     the p e r s o n a l

out     on a n o r m a l m a t c h day.

Around       10.55      a m t h a t d ate,          Superintendent              Chapman         contact      control

the     5 Arches       public         ho u s e .      T h e r e was    at thi s         time     no t r o u b l e but

the     information was               passed        just so that o f f i c e r             c o u l d be a ware that

groups       of s u p p o r t e r s    h a d a r r i v e d and w e r e          intent       on g e t t i n g a d r i n k

before       the m a t c h .       Several          other personal              radio messages             were      then

received regarding                 the     s ame topic.

About      11.20      am Sergeant            G o d d a r d c a r r i e d out r a d i o c h e c k s         some

personal          radios     d i d not       r e p l y and the s e c t o r             Inspectors were asked

to m a k e    checks where             appropriate.               Throughout            thi s    time various

messages were             c o m i n g in r e g a r d i n g t r a f f i c        problems         the c i t y side of

the     grou n d ,    Ml m o t o r w a y ,     Parkway,         etc,        diversions          were    in force.

T his    i n d i c a t e d tha t      the N o t t i n g h a m s u p p o r t e r s w e r e        en r o u t e   in

o p e n i n g t i m e of 12 noon.
 Just     after      noon    I inserted             the    2 VHS video tapes               in the        two v i d e o

recorders.            The    time      and    date        system was checked               a n d set p o s s i b l y

u s i n g th e    ground      lock moun t e d             above    the N o r t h S t a n d      or by a t ime

check with           other    officers            in the     c o n t r o l box.        The    tapes were          set

to r u n at       normal      speed,         my     intention        being that          around         2.30 p m the

s ame d a t e     I would       inset        2 new tapes which would                     then    include        the

b u i l d u p to th e m a t c h t h r o u g h o u t          the     game a n d the          supporters

l e a v i n g th e g r o u n d .      Around         this    tim e    it was      noticed        that p e r s o n s

had e n t e r e d    the     ground.

A short       time      later      it w a s       d i s c o v e r e d that   some      of the P e n i s t o n e

Road     turnstiles          were     not m a n n e d d u e        to an a d m i n i s t r a t i v e     e r r o r thi s

was     c o r r e c t e d by d e p l o y i n g one of          the s p a r e    serials.          Some t ime

between       1.00 p m a n d        2.30      p m t h e r e was       concern expressed regarding

the L i v e r p o o l   fans       purchasing Kop tickets                    from touts          at L e p p i n g s

Lane     turnstiles.            Thi s w o u l d m e a n       of c o u r s e    that      a m i x t u r e of     fans

would have          to be     supervised within                 the K o p t e r r a c e .

During this          sam e p e r i o d     problems          began arising            in v a r i o u s p u b l i c

houses      near     to the        g r o u n d o nes      t hat s p r i n g to m i n d w e r e          the H o r s e

d r i n k i n g h e a v i l y out on the            street,       urinating          in g a r d e n s    and b e i n g

a general        nuisance.           Some      tim e b e t w e e n     1.30    p m a n d 2.00 p m I b e g a n

to n o t i c e t h a t on the K o p s e v e r a l             Liverpool        fans h a d b e e n p l a c e d

several      police officers.                  I set c a m e r a 4 to m o n i t o r the                 situation

noticing that several                  a r r e s t s w e r e m a d e a n d t h a t m a n p o w e r was

years match          in the      s ame    location and I questioned Superintendent

Murray      re th e n u m b e r of o f f i c e r s          available         fo r d e p l o y m e n t on the

Kop.
Superintendent            Murray       then     contacted         I n s p e c t o r Se w e l l   regarding          the

manpower         situation        a n d he c o n f i r m e d    that     2 coaches         each containing

40 m e n w o u l d be on s t a n d b y          in P e n i s t o n e    Road.

Around      2.0 0    pm Superintendent                Murray      and C h i e f S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Du ckenfield went             to s p e a k    to the m a t c h r e f e r e e .          T h r o u g h the

afternoon          complaints         h a d b e e n e x p r e s s e d r e g a r d i n g the      quality       of

personal         radio     transmissions             to the     control       staff.

Around      2.0 0      pm I overhead          on V H F t h a t L i v e r p o o l     supporters           had been

spoken to on            a c o a c h w h i c h h a d d i s p l a y e d a N o t t i n g h a m Forest

supporters          parking ticket.              The      c o a c h and s u p p o r t e r s w e r e     s p o k e n to

by t r a f f i c    officers        and a d v i s e d .

About      the     same    time     t h e r e wa s    a r e p o r t of t r o u b l e s o m e     Liverpool

fans    on a c o a c h r e g i s t e r e d      number        9995     RU.    This      n u m b e r was

circulated          a n d the c o a c h wa s         c h e c k e d by one of the m o b i l e            serials.

Around      2.20       p m the A C C     J a c k s o n wa s    in the c o n t r o l b o x w h e n he

noticed a man             on the      Leppings Lane            terrace       s o u t h pen.       He d r o p p e d

his    trousers         and began        f o o l i n g about.          His b e h a v i o u r was      such that

it w a s    believed         that he w a s d r u n k a n d the A C C a s k e d for s o m e t h i n g

to be d o n e       about     him.       I set the c a m e r a to m o n i t o r his               behaviour.

About      2.15     p m all     the     control       r o o m staff d i s c u s s e d t hat        it was

apparent         the    Liveprool        fans h a d not b e g u n to ar r i v e              as yet.          The

North Stand            ha d vas t     spaces      a l t h o u g h the L e p p i n g s    Lane     terrace       was

f i l l i n g u p at a n o r m a l       rate.        Just     a f t e r this     the p e r s o n a l     radio

transmissions             became worse          and the        civilian radio repair man came

i n t o the c o n t r o l     box to attempt              a repair.
About      2.30     pm my    attention           was   d r a w n to the         large      crowd outside            the

Leppings         Lane    turnstiles.             I would       estimate         around       3 ,000 p e o p l e     and

it w a s     apparent       that    the    number was            i n c r e a s i n g by the v o l u m e       of

foot    passengers          in L e p p i n g s    Lane      itself.

Chief      Superintendent           Duckenfield             asked about            the     large crowd        an d it

was    said      that    although       it w a s m o r e       than normal,              it was    no m o r e      than

was    expected         for s u c h a f o o t b a l l match.

About      2.35     p m the c i v i l i a n r a d i o r e p a i r m a n s t a t e d          tha t he       could

not    f i x the     personal       radio        s y s t e m and it was            necessary       to r e s o r t      to

u s i n g the r a d i o s      on a b a c k to b a c k system.

About      the    same    time     Chief     Superintendent              Duckenfield            came     to the

b a c k of    the    control       bo x a n d     a s k e d me    if the c r o w d          scenes     at the

Leppings         Lane were       b e i n g r e c o r d e d and I r e p l i e d           'Yes'.

A personal          radio on Leppings               Lan e     requested more manpower                   to

Leppings         Lane    turnstiles.             Sergeant        Sorsby despatched                 2 horses        from

the    S o u t h S t a n d ca r park.

A personal          radio message            then      came    in s t a t i n g t hat the          gates were

being      forc e d ,    they were        b e n d i n g a n d buc k l i n g .         In    my mind     I

believed that            the    gates     r e f e r r e d to w e r e      'C'      gate     an d   I k e p t the

Leppings         Lane    camera       set t o t h a t       sort of area.

About      2.40     pm Chief       Superintendent              D u c k e n f i e l d and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Murray requested               that    I contact         Operations          R o o m so tha t a t r a f f i c

car w i t h a P A s y s t e m c o u l d a t t e n d           in L e p p i n g s    Lane     and advised           the

c r o w d w h i c h w e r e b y this         time      becoming apparently more hostile.                               I

also remember             a r o u n d this    tim e tha t S e r g e a n t          G o d d a r d p i c k e d u p the

personal          radio telephone            style handset            an d a f t e r t r y i n g to use            it,

t h r e w it d o w n      o n t o the d e s k b e c a u s e      it w a s not w o r k i n g a n d the
personal       radio transmissions                      were    v e r y poor.        I can r e m e m b e r      seeing

about     5 or      6 officers            s t o o d on b a r r i e r d u t y     just pas t        the    g ate     'C'

towards       the     S o u t h Stan d.

About     2.40      pm I remember             seeing         'C'    gate o p e n a n d a n u m b e r       of

supporters          enter     the    ground.             I then      said w o r d s     like      'They've

broken down           the    g a t e '.      At    the     same     time    I i n d i c a t e d to the       staff

in the       control        bo x to w a t c h       the L e p p i n g s L a n e m o n i t o r .       After       about

20 s e c o n d s    I noticed that                the    gat e w a s c l o s e d and        it    s e e m e d that       a

mounted       officer        alone        h a d p r e v e n t e d a big r u s h of p e o p l e           through

the    open    gate.         I remember            seeing mounted officers                   t r y i n g to c l e a r

space    in the        crow d.

The    request        for a d d i t i o n a l      officers        to be sent         to L e p p i n g s L a n e was

made    to    Inspector         Sewell        and       I r e m e m b e r h i m o f f e r i n g tw o S e r i a l s ,

one of w h i c h w a s        the     'F*     Division Crime and Vandal,                         they were

d i r e c t e d to the L e p p i n g s        Lane       e n d of the ground.

I saw Liverpool              fans    climbing            the w a l l s of the         g r o u n d o n t o the

turnstile          roofs     and    I in p a r t i c u l a r r e m e m b e r       several        b e i n g sat

astride       gat e     'B' w i t h p o l i c e         officers       s t o o d below.          I t h i n k at this

t im e a p e r s o n a l     radio message               was    sent r e g a r d i n g the c l i m b e r s        an d

an o f f i c e r    r e p l i e d t hat he         c o u l d not r e a c h them.

Around       2.45 p m I r e m e m b e r           a personal         r adio m e s s a g e    from

Superintendent              Marshall         to the e f f e c t        'We m u s t    o p e n the     g ates or

someone       is g o i n g to be k i l l e d ,             please      open the       gates.'

At    this    time     Chief       Inspector McRobbie                  is in the       control        box w e a r i n g

c ivilian clothing.

I remember          s e e i n g an o f f i c e r        on the t o p of the t u r n s t i l e s at

Leppings       Lane end and Chief                   Superintendent             Duckenfield made
enquiries        as    to the o f f i c e r ' s           ide n t i t y .    Another       personal         r adio

message        was    received from Superintendent Marshall,                                     his    v o i c e was

very distressed,               'You m u s t          o p e n the    gates,       o p e n the      gates'.        Chief

Superintendent             Duckenfield               s e e m e d to p a u s e    for    thought         an d then

said    'Right        if l ives       are       at    risk,      t h e n o p e n the     gates'.           Sergeant

Goddard        then transmitted                 'Open the          gates,       o p e n the      gates'.        Just

prior    to t h i s      I remember             seeing officers              behind      'A'      gate,     they were

set out        in t w o l ines        f o r m i n g a funnel.               Sergeant       H i g g i n s of     'F' C & V

transmitted           on p e r s o n a l    radio          'There are p e o p l e        being crushed

outside        'A'    gat e we m u s t          open       'A'   gate'.

I remember           that a b o u t    the       time      the     g ates w e r e      ordered         to be o p e n e d

mounted        officers outside                 Leppings Lane turnstiles                      ha d m a n a g e d to

create    a v o i d b e t w e e n the            t u r n s t i l e s a n d the      outer perimeter

railings,        in      fact, I b e l i e v e d that              at one t i m e       the o f f i c e r s m a n a g e d

least.         I remember         s e e i n g c r o w d s at the rear of L e p p i n g s Lane

terrace        just b e h i n d the         turnstiles,             the y w e r e      just      s t o o d a bout    not

doing anything             in p a r t i c u l a r .

About    2.55 p m C h i e f         Superintendent                 Duckenfield told               control       room

ru s h o n t o the pitch.                It w a s at t his time that we                       began      to n o t i c e

Liverpool        fans      climbing up               i n t o the Wes t S t a n d        f r o m the      terrace

were    s e e n to       c l i m b the     p e r i m e t e r t r a c k fence.          Officers         on the

track    seemed          to be t e l l i n g         the    fans to get d o w n          f r o m the       fence.         At

Duckenfield            ordered that           they      s h o u l d be m o v e d     as q u i c k l y as

box was aware             that     t h e p r o b l e m wa s m o r e t h a n a p i t c h           invasion

Jus t     after     th e m a t c h w a s      s t o p p e d AC C J a c k s o n w a s      in the c o n t r o l        box

suddenly       it      be c a m e a p p a r e n t    that    there w e r e     injuries           and at that

ti m e    I contacted Operations                     R o o m for a m b u l a n c e s    to be sent to the

Leppings Lane             e n d of     the    ground.          There were          people        all o ver the
pitch    in f r o n t        of the    goal mou t h ,      persons          were     l a i d a c r o s s the

b e g a n to    feel      that     there might         be d e a t h s .       A personal         r adio m e s s a g e

was    sent     to c o n t r o l    asking      for bolt        cutters        and Sergeant Goddard

contacted Claywheels                  Lane    a s k i n g if t h e y      had cutters           on the b r i - m a c

transporter.              The    reply was         n e gative.       He     t u r n e d to m e     and I t o l d

h i m t hat     I would         contact      the    fire      service which             I d i d via

Operations           Room.       I made      it c l e a r that we           required cutting

equipment           f o r the m e t a l    fences.         I remember          someone       i n s t r u c t i n g PC

R y a n to use         the    tannoy telling people               to s t a y calm.              I can r e m e m b e r

seeing bodies             being moved         t o w a r d s the   tunnel          on the L e p p i n g s      Lane

terrace        from the centre             pens.       I believe          t hat    it w a s p o l i c e

officers who were moving                     the    bodies      f r o m the area.            Liverpool          fans

who were        on the p i t c h        s t a r t e d to run t o w a r d s        the Kop.        Officers

managed        to    s t o p the    charge      a n d split up s e v e r a l            groups    of fans w h o

were    fighting.             A line      of o f f i c e r s wer e     then       f o r m e d a c r o s s the

pitch     just       the K o p side        of the c e n t r e      line.          I recall       the fire

service        a r r i v i n g at L e p p i n g s Lan e a n d t h e i r m e n r u n n i n g o n t o the

pitch.         I then        sent a m e s s a g e    to O p e r a t i o n s    that we d i d have

fatalities           at the      ground although when                I sent        thi s m e s s a g e no

details        h a d b e e n p a s s e d by p e r s o n a l     radi o.        It wa s all        done     from

observation.              Further       contact      from Operations               R o o m r e g a r d i n g the

and I said            s o m e t h i n g t o the e f f e c t    that we        n e e d as m a n y as

possible.

Traffic motor             cycles were          o r d e r e d to c o v e r     the r o u t e s    to b o t h

hospitals           and   I made      a request        for the       senior ambulance               officer        to

a t t e n d the c o n t r o l      box.      He d i d not arri v e .              The    senior     fire
officer      attended         at the      control       bo x a n d    liaised with              senior

officers       and     he t o o a s k e d to s p e a k to t h e           senior      a m b u l a n c e off icer.

Another      request was made                for that o f f i c e r       to a t t e n d      the    control         bo x

via Operations             Room.

About     3.35    pm      I c h e c k e d the v i d e o t a p e s     and discovered                that one ha d

at the     rear      of the        video control          area.       The v i d e o s        are    set at kne e

the t i m e m o d e       setting.

I installed two new tapes                     a n d set t h e m r u n n i n g at         normal        speed.

Dear                 di c W w

I am sorry it has n ot b ee n pos si bl e to contact y ou d i r e ct ly before now.
This has b ee n due to p e r s o n a l r e q u es ts for c o un se ll in g from of ficers
inv ol ve d at Hillsborough.

It is now more w i d e l y u n d e r s t o o d that pr of e s s i o n a l s i n v o lv ed in helping
others durin g a disaster, are t he ms el v es also 'victims' and at risk of
p s y c h o l o g i c a l disturbance. In the fo ur weeks since H i l l s b o r o u g h
app ro x i m a t e l y 200 poli ce officers, of all ranks, in South Y or ks hi re Police
have be en scre en ed for symptoms of p o s t - t r a u m a t i c stre ss d i s or de r by the
Force Welf ar e Off ic er s and the Force Psychologist.                     Those s c r ee ne d ap pear
to have r e s p o n d e d wel l and ge n er al ly s pe ak i n g are u n l i k e l y to n e e d further
intervention.

If you are e xp er i e n c i n g any of the symptoms l isted below, please con si de r
contac ti ng the We lfare D ep ar t me nt to arrange for a c heck up appointment.
There is no stigma a t t a c h e d to u s in g the s e r v i c e , and I n de ed it is thought
likely that early support s hould era di c at e the n e e d for more in depth
counse ll in g at a later date, if things are left.

TREVOR BICHARD
POLICE CONSTABLE 1370
33 YEARS(bn.          )
HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION
HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD.
TEL: 852211

I am a police constable with South Yorkshire police at present stationed at Hammerton
Road police station, Sheffield. I am at the present time working beat duties on »B»
group but also have resposibility operating the static video system which is installed
at Hillsborough football stadium ^Sheffield.
On a personal level I have visited Hillsborough stadium on many occasions as a spectator
standing on the terrace at the Spion Kop end of the ground and the leppings Lane terrace.
I have also worked in all parts of the ground as a police officer during my past 8 years
service.
In September 1987 I took over duties relating to the video system working from the police
control box and since that time I have attended a 3 day course in relation to the use
of video systems for command and control and as a method of evidence gathering#
The original system installed at Hillsborough was laid out as a command and contol system
giving a basic all round view both inside and outside the ground. Whilst I have been invol­
ved with the duties the emphasis has shifted from command and control to evidence gathering
and with that end in mind several improvements have been made the most recent being a
survey of the Leppings Lane end camera, the intention being to move the camera from its
present position attached to the roof of the West stand bringing it down to a position
just above the turnstiles. The survey was carried out using a!»hand held video camera mount­
ed on the platform of a hydraulic lift. Two positions were considered, the first mounted
on a pole at the far most corner of the Leppings Lane turnstiles the second position just
above gate ’B*, It was decided ’that the best position would be above *B* gate. This position
giving good all round views along Leppings Lane, to the turnstiles below and the court yard
at the rear of the Leppings Lane Terrace. The system installer Roger Holdsworth agreed to
 complete a costing for the improvements and if the cash was available from the football
 trust, he would attempt to install the camera in it’s new position in time for the semi­
 final. Unfortunately the clerical side of this operation could not be completed quick
 enough and the planned move for the camera was suspended untill the summer break.
 On Saturday 15th April 1989 I commsnced duty at 10am attending at the police room at
 Hillsborough, collecting the hand held V.H.S. radio which I used to monitor transmissions
 via X.S. (operations room). On this particular day channel 1 had been designatidifor all
 V.H.P. transmission relating to the semi-final#
 After collecting the radio I made my way to the Leppings Lane terrace where I saw that
 Roger Holdsworth was working on camera number 5 which over looks the Leppings Lane terrace
 pens# The picture quality'ihad been substanded for a number of weeks and Mr Holdsworth was
 earring out some last minute alterations to upgrade the picture. After he had completed
 the work the picture was indeed better tha* it had been although not upto the correct
 standard, I then made my way to the control box where I met with Sgt Goddard & P.C. Ryan
 afier a brief conversation I began to check the vidoe system operating each of the five
 cameras in turn. We were later joined by Supt Murray and it was agreed between us that
 Sgt Goddard would operate the personal radio, P.C. Byan--the tannoy & telephone and I in
 addition to my duties as camera operator would moiitor the V.H.F. set using it if necessary#
 These duties were no different to what would be carried out on a normal match day.
 Around 10.55am that date Supt Chapman contact control regarding a group of Liverpool
 supporters would were waiting outside the 5 Arches public house, there was at this time
 no trouble but the information was passed just am that officer could be aware that groups
 of supporters had arrived and were intent on getting a drink before the match. Several
  other personal radio messages were then received regarding the same topic.
 About 11.20am Sgt Goddard carried out radio checks some P.R.*s did not reply and the sector
 Inspectors were asked to nake checks where appropriate. Throughout this time various
 messages were coming in regarding traffic problems the City side of the ground, M 1 motor­
 way , Parkway etc diversions were inforce. This indicated that the Nottingham supporters^
 were on route in numbers and could be expected at the ground for the turnstile opening time
  of 12,00 noon.
                                     -  2 -
Just after noon I inserted the 2 V.H.S. video tapes in the two video recorders. The time
and date system was checked and set possibley using the ground clock mounted above the
North stand or by a time check with other officers in the control box. The tapes were set
to run at normal speed, my intention being that around 2.30pm the same date I would insert
2 new tapes which would then include the build up to the match throughout the game and
the supporters leaving the ground. Around this time it was noticed that persons had entered
the ground.
A short time later it was discovered that sons of the Penistone Road turnstiles were not
manned due to an administrative error this was corrected by deploying one of the spare serials
Some time between 1.00pm and 2.30pm there was concern expressed regarding the Liverpool fans
purchasing Kop tickets from touts at Leppings Lane turnstiles. This would mean of course that
a mixture of fans would have to be supervised within,^the Kop terrace.
Curing this same period problems began arising in various public houses near to the ground
ones that spring to mind were the Horse and Jockey and the Royal. The complaints were that
fans were drinking heavily out on the street, urinating in gardens and being a genral
nuisance. Sons time between 1.30pm and 2.00pm I began to notice that on the Kop several
Liverpooldfans had been placed in the triangle area near to the North Stand end supervised
by several police officers* I set Camera 4 to monitor the situation noticing that several
arrests were made and that manpower was getting low. I remembered that there had been
some trouble at last years match in the same location and I questioned Supt Murray re the
number of officers available for deployment on the Kop. Supt Murray then contacted Insp
Sewell re^irding the manpower situation and he confirmed that 2 coaches each containing
40 men would be on stand-by in Penistone Road.
Around 2.00pm Supt Muri^tand C/supt Duckenfleld went to speak to the match referee.
Through the afternoon complaints had been expressed regarding the quailty^of P.R. trans­
missions, to the control staff*                                                                 j
Around 2.00pm I overheard on V.H.F. that Liverpool supporters had bees spoken to on a coach
which had displayed a Nottingham forest supports parking ticket. The coach and supporters
were spoken to by traffic officers and advised.                                                 j
About the same time there was a report of troublesome Liverpool fans on a coach registered .’fed
number 9995 RU. This number was circulated and the coach checked by one of the mobile 3erials.
Around 2.20pm the ACC Jackson was din the control box when he noticed a man on the Leppings
Lane terrace South Pen. He dropped his trousers and began fooling about. His behaviour was
such that it was believed that he was drunk and the ACC asked for something to be done about
he* I set the camera to monitor his behaviour*
About 2.15pm all the control room staff discussed that it was apparent the Liverpool fans
had not begun to arrive as yet. The North stand had vast spaces although the Leppings Lane
terrace was filling up at a normal rate. Just after this the ?.R. transmissions became
wors6 ?'and the civilian radio repair man came into the control box to attempt a repair.
About 2.30pm my attention was drawn to the large crowd outside the Leppings Lane tiirnstiJ.es
I would estimate around 3*000 people and it was apparent that the number was increasing
by the volume of foot passengers in Leppings lane itself.
C/supt Duckenfield asked about the l&rgs crowd and it was said that although it was more than
normal, its was no more than was expected for such a football match*
About 2.35pm the Civxlia* radio repairman stated that he could not fix the P.R. system and it
was necessary to resort to using the radios on a back to back system »
About the same time S/Duckenfield came to the back of the control box and asked me ifthe
crowd scenes at the Leppings Lane were being recorded and I replied *XES*.
A personl radio on Leppings Lane requested more man power to Leppings Lane turnstiles.
Sgt Sorsby dispa&ehed 2 horses from the South stand carpark.
A P.R. message then came in stating that the gates are being forced, they were bending and
buckiing. In my mind I believed that the gates referred to were ’C ’ gate and I kept the
Leppings Lane camera set to that sort of area.
About 2.40pm S/Duckenfield & Supt Murray requested that I contact X.S. so that a traffic
car with P.A. system could attend in Leppings Lane and advised the crowd which were by
 this time becoming apparently more hostile. I also remember around this time that Sgt
Goddard picked up the P.R. telephone style hand set and after trying to use it threw it
down on to the desk because it was not working and the P.R. transmissions were very poor.
I can remember seeing about 5or6 officers stood on barrier duty just pasted the gate ’C*
towards the South stand.
About 2.40pm I remeber seeing ’C' gate open and a number of supporters enter the ground
I then said worfts like * THEY’VE BROKEN DOWN TIE GATE*. At the same time I indicated to
the staff in the control box to watch the Leppings Lane Monitor* After about 20 seconds I
^«S~3Ss»'
noticed that the gate was closed and itseemed that a mounted officer alone had prevented
a big rush of people through the open gate. I remeber seeing mounted officers trying to clear
space in the crowd •
The request for additional officers to be sent to Leppings Lane was nade to Inspector Sewell
and I remeber him offering two serials one of which was the *P* Division crime and vandal
they were directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
I saw Liverpool fans climbing the walls of the ground onto the turnstile roofs and I
in particular remeber several being sat astide Gate ’B ’ with police officers stood below.
I think at this time a P.R. message was sent re^rding the climbers and an officer replied
that he could not reach them.
Around 2.45pm I remeber a P.R. message from Supt Marshall to the effect * WE MUSI OPEN THE
GATES OR SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE KILLED, PLEASE OPEN THE GATES.*
At this time C/insp McRobbie is in the control box wearing civilian cltfthing.
I remember seeing an officer on the top of the turnstiles at Leppings Lane end and C/supt
Ducenfield made enquries as to the officers identity. Another P.R. message was received
from Supt Marshall his voice was very distressed * YOU MUST OPEN THE GATES OPEN TIE GATES*.
C/Supt Duckenfield seemed to pause for thought and then said * ‘RIGHT IP LIVES ARE AT RISK
THEN OPEN THE GATES.* Sgt Goddard then transmitted ’OPEN THE GATES OPEN THE GATES.*
Just prior to this I remeber seeing officers behand *A* gate, they were set out in two lines
forming a funnel. Sgt Higgins of *F* C&Y transmitted on P.R. * There are people being crushed
outside 'A* gate we must open 'A* gate*
I remember that about the time the gates were ordered to be opandd mounted officers out-
side Leppings Lane turnstiles had managed to create a void between the turnstiles and the
outer perimeter railings, in fact I believed that at one time the officers managed to
close the outer gates, however the crowd outside forced its way through the outer gp.l£ 3
and ran into the ground via *C* gate at least. I remeber seeing crowds at tbsrear of
Leppings Lane teriace just behind the turnstiles, they were just stood about not doing
anything inparticular.
About 2.55pm C/supt Duckenfield told control room staff to get some man power to the North
stand to stop any possible rush onto the pitch. It was at this time that we began to notice
Liverpool fans climbing up into the west stand from the terrace area. They were assisted
by people in the stand and the same problem had occured the previous year. The sole purpose
was so that flans with standing tickets could get into the seated area of the west stand*
A short tiro later fani were seen to climb the perimeter track fence. Officers on the track
seemed to be telling the fans to get down from the fence. At this point the staff in the ^   *
control box and I thought that the situation was purely public order, no information was
coming in to the effect that people were getting hurt.
A crowd gathered on the perimeter track and fl/Supt Duckenfield ordered that they should be
moved as quickly as possible to the wing sections of Leppings Lane tereace where it could be
seen that there was space* C/supt Duckenfield was angry about officers stood around the
track near to the Kop and the North stand. A P.R. message was sent to the officers and they
were directed to the front of the North stand. Around this time C/Insp Me Robbie was sent to
the pitch to get things sorted out. One problem was a W.P.C. stood on the perimeter track
just below the control box she did not appear to be moving people off the track and in fact
 at one stage open the perimeter gate to the track then walk off leaving the gate open.
C/Insp Me Robbie took charge of the police woman and began ushering people from the track.
By this time there were people on the pitch and the perimeter t«ack gates were open allowing
people out of the center pens. Still at this stage no one in the control box was aware that
the problem was more than a pitch invasion situation.
Just after the match was stopped ACC Jackson was in the control box and he ordered me to
contact X.S. and call operation support. It was at this point that I decieded to concentrate
on operating the V.H.P. radio rather than the camera system. Very suddenly it became
apparent that there were injuries and at that time I contacted X.S. for ambulances to be
sent to the Leppings Lane end of the ground. There were people all over the pitch infront
of the goal mouth, persons were laid! across the floor with persons giving mouth to mouth
it was only then that we began to feel that there might be deaths. A P.R. message was sent
to control asking for bolt cutters and Sgt Goddard contacted claywheels Lane asking if they
had cutters on the bri-mac transported. The reply was negative. He turned to me and I told
him that I would contact the fire service which I did via X.S. I made it clear that we
required cutting equiptraent for the metal fences* I remenber someone instructing P.C. Ryan
to use the Tannoy telling people to stay calm. I can remember seeing bodies being moved
towards the tunnel on the Leppings Lane Terrace from the center pens. I believe that it was
police officers who were moving the bodies from the area. Liverpool fans who were on the
several g r o u p s affan*'who were fighting. A line of officers were then formed across the
pitch just the Koj^sidii of tbs center line.                                       ^ ^      ^
I recall the fire serfioe arriving at leppings lane and their men running onto the pitch
I then seht a m e s s a » t © operations that we did hare fatalities at the ground although
when I sent this m b ^ | a , d « 1»ila^bad lieen passed by P.R. it was all done from observation.
Further                               n8       number of ambulance required and they siid would it
be more than 2 <*^*ii^3fii®#Ibiething t^ the effect that we need as many as possible.
Traffic motor cycl4^^wer«^rtIew4J» cffTOr the routes to both hospitals and I made a request
for the                                   attend the control box. He did not arrive. The senior

to speak                                         Another request was made for that officer to
attend the oontrol^b«ijrvla              I'**,".

I installed twe^nwr tapes and set them running at noimal speed.
Ma Clough and Mr Dalgleshentered the control box and offered theirservicesonce they            had
established that the match was off. Mr Dalglesh wanted to speak tothe fensandhe was            asked
to use the !Tannoy system in the D.J.s control box below the police control.
Supt Murray theft later asked for details of transport so that preparations could be made
for emptying the ground. I remeber some time after this Supt Murray saying to P.C. Ryan
that he wanted a message passing over the Tannoy tee ling the Liverpool fans to stay calm
and retrain where they were untill the ambulances had left the stadium. Sometime later
the ground was eaptyed and around 5.30pm I removed the video tapes and made my way to the Gym
to offer assistance. I was later sent to H.Q. with the video tapes and I there saw C/supt
Duckenfield, Sgt Booth, ACC Jackson and C/supt Denton* About 11.00 D/supt Mckay attended
and he instructed me to return to Hamraerton Road, book the video tapes into the property
store and await the arrival of AVA, Sgt Poster was to attend so that copies of the video
tapes could be made.
About 11.30pm Sgt Poster arrived at Bammerton Roafl police station and I explained the
faults on the video tapes. He asked if I could get hold of the video recorder used with
the 18 hr mode setting so that he could transfer the tape action at the correct speed.
I then went back to the ground and removed one of the video recorders from the police
control box taking it to Ecclesfield training school where I handed it to Sgt Poster.
My immediate supervisor would by Supt Murray. I had no contact with the fans before/
during or after the incident. I cannot relate any information regirding the stewarding
of the ground, and I had no contact with the bodies.
These 4 pages are not complete but are just a resume of the main points of the day.

We must     a l w a y s r e m e m b e r that it is easy, in h i n d s i g h t , to suggest

Du r i n g the last t hree w e e k s e v i d e n c e has been gathered, on behalf
of the C h i e f Cons t a b l e , f r o m m e m b e r s of the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e P o l i c e

and a re p o r t p r e p a r e d for C o u n s e l r e p r e s e n t i n g the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e

some u n c e r t a i n t i e s a bout the p u r p o s e of the i n t e r n a l enquiry, and
ma y no w feel a little u n i n f o r m e d about its p r o g r e s s - h e n c e this
update.

The re p o r t that is w i t h C o u n s e l for the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e Poli c e ,
Mr. W i l l i a m W o o d w a r d Q C , paints the overall p i c t u r e of our p o l i c i n g
the m a t c h at H i l l s b o r o u g h on 15 April 1989.                It c o n tains an o v e r ­
v i e w of the Force; a d e s c r i p t i o n of the Stadium; a r e v i e w of all
the l e g i s l a t i o n c o n c e r n i n g the p o l i c i n g of football; d e t a i l s of
the p l a n n i n g of this p a r t i c u l a r m a t c h and m a t c h e s in general; an
e x a m i n a t i o n of the q u a l i t y of c o m m u n i c a t i o n s that e x i s t e d on the
day and, finally; a s u m m a r y of the events that occurred, d rawn
from officers' s tatements.                    It is this p i c t u r e that we hope t o _
pr es e n t w h e n g i v e n the o p p o r t u n i t y to put our case to the Inquiry.

P o l i c e e v i d e n c e will be c a l l e d from W e d n e s d a y 24 M a y 1989, b e g i n n i n g
with those senior o f f i c e r s r e s p o n s i b l e for p l a n n i n g and c o n t r o l l i n g
the p o l i c i n g o p eration.        Fol l o w i n g on fro m that, i n d i v i d u a l o f f i c e r s
wil l be c a l l e d to give t heir acco u n t of a p a r t i c u l a r part of the
events in w h i c h they w e r e involved.                Over 1,100 o f f i c e r s p e r f o r m e d
duty at H i l l s b o r o u g h , ‘it s h o u l d be obvious that only a r e l a t i v e
few of that nu m b e r will be c a l l e d to give e v i d e n c e to the Inquiry.
 If you are ca l l e d it does not imply that you have a n y t h i n g to a n s w e r
for and, conver s e l y , if you are not called it does not m e a n that
y our e f f o r t s are u n r e c o g n i s e d .

S o l i c i t o r s for the Inquiry (who are sort of clerks to the court)
are r e s p o n s i b l e for s i f t i n g t h r o u g h all the e v i d e n c e and c h o o s i n g
those who m ight have             som e t h i n g to add to the facts a l r e a d y heard
by the Inquiry.            It is a n t i c i p a t e d that s o m e t h i n g in the o rder
of 50-75 p o l i c e o f f icers wil l be called so, clearly, not e v e r y o n e
will have the o p p o r t u n i t y to tell his or her s t o r y .
                                                                                                                               (3)




    At the c o n c l u s i o n of the Inquiry, however, C o u n s e l for the S o u t h
    Y o r k s h i r e P o l i c e can call a d d i t i o n a l w i t n e s s e s if we feel that
    the w h o l e s t o r y has not bee n p r e s e n t e d or that the Inquiry has
    b een m i s l e d in any way.

    A t t a c h e d to this re p o r t is a list of o f f i c e r s who, for one reason
    or a n o ther, ma y be p e o p l e that the Inquiry w o u l d w i s h to hea r from.
    That        is not to say that the y will be called, we s i m p l y do not
    know, but their p a r t i c u l a r e v i d e n c e was c o n s i d e r e d useful in p r e p a r i n g
    the r e p o r t for our C o u n s e l .

    Eac h of t hese o f f i c e r s is e n c o u r a g e d and welcome, to see the p r o ­
    gress of the i n t ernal e v i d e n c e g a t h e r i n g to dat e and to get a

    At 9.00 a m each m o r n i n g M o n d a y to Friday 22 - 26 M a y 1989, there
    w ill be a v i d e o s hown at the L e c t u r e Theatre, First Floor, F orce

    by the BBC, the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e P o l i c e and S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y
    Foot ball Club.               It lasts for a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 hours and is the
    'official' v i d e o of the Inquiry.                        (There are     many, m a n y hours of
    v i d e o f i l m a v a i l a b l e f r o m d i f f e r e n t sour c e s but this two hours
    is thou g h t to r e p r e s e n t the m ost r e levant).                 A m e m b e r of the inter n a l

    an o p p o r t u n i t y to visit the Town Hall to see the Inquiry in session.

    If any o f f i c e r s are s u b s e q u e n t l y ca l l e d who do not a p p e a r on the

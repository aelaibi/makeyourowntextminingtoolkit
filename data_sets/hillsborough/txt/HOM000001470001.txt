DATE OF BIRTH



1.    I am in my 15th year of ambulance service all with SYMAS and

      am presently a Leading Ambulance man stationed at Maltby.



2.    Before joining the service I had served in the forces in

      Northern Ireland.       I was a driver engaged in the movement of

      troops to and from trouble areas.



3.    On joining the ambulance service I was with Barnsley Borough

      Council Service the forerunner to SYMAS.            In the first year

      of   service   I attended the six week ambulance                  training

      course    at the ambulance       training      centre   in Mar k fi e l d ,

      Leicester.     With that qualification I was able to enter the

      emergency rota of the service.           I have also attended two

      week     refresher     courses   which    up    date    us   on   the   new

      facilities and equipment in the service.            These courses run

      approximately every three years.



 4.   I was stationed at Hoyland in Barnsley for approximately

      three years.         I then transferred to Longley a m b u l a n c e

      station in Sheffield in about 1975 and remained there for

      about    4 years.      I then gained promotion to the rank               of

       Leading Ambulance man at Batemoor ambulance station in the

       Sheffield     area.    I remained there for about four years.                I

       then transferred to my present station of Maltby.
Since becoming Leading Ambulance man I have attended courses

for that rank.    These are usually held at the training

centre at SYMAS H.Q.    These are to up date us in line with

the extended skills, equipment and procedures that are being

implemented within the service.



As regards major incidents there is a specific manual,   and

in addition SYMAS holds dry-runs.    Only senior staff are

aware of planned dry runs and the crews have to respond as

normal.   As far as I am aware the last dry-run was at an

airport hear Doncaster.



At Maltby   station,there are five Leading Ambulance men

working a twenty four hour emergency rota seven days a week.

In   addition to the    Leading Ambulance men there   are 44

ambulance personnel which includes one station officer and

eight part time staff who provide cover for the full time

 staff.



 My duties as Leading Ambulance man concern actual ambulance

 duties only on the emergency side, and not for outpatients.

 In addition to this I have to maintain the station including

 manning, supplies and statistics including hours worked and

 sickness monitoring.



 Essentially   I have to be aware of anything which could
affect the emergency side of operations including changes to

the roads,weather etc.         I also ensure that all ambulances

are operational and fully equipped,             and as a designated

supervisor I am able to delegate many of there tasks.



I cannot recall the exact rota for the week prior to the

Hillsborough incident.       However,     on Saturday the 15th and

Sunday the 16th I was on 1400 to 2200 emergency rota at the

Maltby station.



On Saturday the 15th there was to be a two man crew of

myself and                    •     I arrived at about 1350 at Maltby

Station      and   checked    the    station   logs   for   information

relevant to my shift.                                                 .



I saw                        and said words to the effect that he

should not be in.       He informed me that he was working his

day off to cover for                            who had taken a days

leave to which he was entitled.



Having logged in at about             1400 we proceeded to make the

usual checks to the equipment on the emergency vehicle which

was   allocated to us.         This was Vehicle 405.         For control

 purposes this has a call sign of Romeo 608.                We made our

 checks   on all the equipment required for the emergency

 vehicles.     This included checking that the gas was on in the

 vehicle, together with all medical equipment.              Tyre pressure
and fluid levels are also checked.



On completing our checks we returned to the mess room to

await calls from control.         I was in the office when the

telephone rang from Control.       I answered the phone and spoke

to Control Superintendent Ray Clarke.              He said "proceed to

Hillsborough,    Sheffield,    query major"    I replied "we are on

our way" and put the phone down.        I can not recall the exact

time,   but    would   estimate    we   left       at   about    1510.    We

proceeded     to Hillsborough     ground      at    speed       with   Chris

Beighton driving.



Whilst on route we continued to receive calls from Control

who requested ±hat. we attend the Leppings, Lane-^nd«.                    We

proceeded along Middlewood Road to the ground.                   On arrival

at Leppings Lane at 1535 (track 16 page 7) entrance we were

directed in front of a number of police officers,                        by a

senior police officer,        into the Leppings Lane end of the

ground.      There were three ambulances already in attendance.

 The vehicles infront were loading casualties                   in order of

 priority.



 There were in excess of 30 casualties lined up against the

 wall on the left of our vehicle as we faced into the ground.

 On the right side there appeared to be approximately 18

 bodies with a line of police officers in front of them.                       I

 did not pay much attention to them because they were clearly
dead and from their colour they had been syanosed for some

considerable time.      I was concerned for the living.                       I told

my colleague to stay in the vehicle in the driving seat with

the engine running      and not to open his door or get out at

all.      This is standard procedure so as to prevent the

vehicle being blocked,       prevents mechanical problems and

unauthorised persons gaining access to the vehicle.                           As we

approached behind approximately three ambulances which were

parked up,   I noticed to our left at least 30 casualties in

various     conditions,    i.e.     co n scious,         semi-conscious,

unconscious,      everything       appeared         to    be        g oing    well,

ambulances    were being     lo’aded w i t h    patie n ts .                 As    the

ambulances were loaded they were leaving the scene in the

same direction.                                 <             ; i



I had my portable resuscitating unit and hand radio.                              I was

about to get out of the vehicle when a police officer ran up

explaining that there was a lad nearby in a bad way through

Gate C immediately to the left.          I again told ______________

of the importance of staying with the vehicle and running

with the flow of traffic.         I accompanied the police officer

to the young man laid on the ground.            A police officer told

me     they had tried   to r e v i v e   him   but       to    no     avail.          I

administered resuscitation and he breathed irregularly.                               I

told the police officer to return to my vehicle and collect

                  together with a stretcher.                  He returned and

we loaded the young man on to the ambulance which by then
was alongside Gate C.



I recognised a colleague Mr                 from Barnsley ambulance

station who was a football supporter at the event, but off

duty.        He pointed out a second casualty who was next to

our vehicle.     He assisted              in getting him onto the

vehicle and we gave oxygen to both the patients.                     I told

        to leave the ground for the Northern General Hospital

and we    left   at    1546   (track   16 page   12).          Upon arrival

doctors and staff were awaiting casualties.               We off loaded

both casualties who by then were breathing for themselves

without oxygen."



I then drove, the .vehicle and told               ..and..--]        l- t o - gat..-

into the back and re-check all the equipment ready for the

next casualties.          I was given a police motorcycle escort

back to the ground.           During the return journey I contacted

Control at 1555 (track 16 page 16) stating we had brought

two casualties to Northern General and were returning to

Hillsborough Leppings Lane end unless directed otherwise.

 They replied, but instructed me on arrival to contact one of

 the Duty Officers at the ground and ask him to contact

 Control.        I also received a further instruction                   from

 Control during this call which stated "Romeo 608a further

 message .....        please establish yourself as my contact Duty

 Officer...."
On returning towards        the Leppings Lane entrance we were

coming down Leppings Lane and turning left when I noticed

there were hundreds of supporters walking around some of

them    shocked     and   some     of    them    holding   their       chests

indicating crush injuries.              We gradually proceeded through

the crowd into the ground.              I instructed                         and

Yoxall to remain in the vehicle as the two man crew.



I walked to another Leading Ambulance man whom I recognised

as                  from Parkway ambulance station by Gate C.                  I

asked him if there was an incident officer at Leppings lane

end.      He said he did not know.                As I had an off duty

ambulanceman to relieve me I decided in accordance with

Control's request to become the incident officer for that

area of the ground until relieved by a senior officer.                         I

returned to my vehicle and told                              and              to

continue as a crew without me.              I said I was going up ahead

to     sort   out   the   scene.        T here   were   in exc e s s    of    30

casualties      lined up,    but all were conscious.               They were

being loaded six or seven at a time into vehicles mainly as

 sitting cases.



 A Derbyshire ambulance vehicle was parked in front with the

 rear doors open and I noticed a young girl who appeared to

 be an official ambulance observer                 (medical student).           I

 asked her where the crew were and she said they had gone

 into the ground.         I noticed that the resucitating unit and
portable radio were still with the vehicle.                 I told the

observer to stay with the vehicle as I would be using it for

casualties who did not require immediate hospital treatment.




As vehicles were loaded up I directed them alternately to

Royal   Hallamshire     and    Northern    General     to    even    the

distribution of patients to each casualty unit.             I then went

back down the road towards         Leppings Lane to see if any

further    assistance    was    required    because    most     of the

casualties had, by then, been taken to hospital.



I met the Assistant Chief        David Jones.    He asked me if my

portable    radio, wa.s in     working    orxLisx as   his^ was <>ri>ot ~

functioning correctly.        I said yes and we exchanged radios.

I told him what I had been doing at that position and he

said to continue in charge of that area while he was going

to re-direct ambulances round to the gymnasium.



I went back down to the area of Gate C which by now was a

lot clearer.     There were only walking casualties that were

being comforted by Red Cross and St Johns personnel.             I went

back to the Derbyshire vehicle to supervise the care of

 casualties.    The attendant of the Derbyshire vehicle then

 returned explaining     to me     that he had    been       using   his

 extended skills training        (paramedic) on casualties within

 the ground.   I explained that I had used his vehicle for
walking casualties and pointed out the only casualty that he

should keep an eye on, namely a patient who was holding his

chest, and was being oxygenated.



I looked around and noticed my vehicle coming up behind

(circa 1625).    I went over to it and asked                  if he

would go into the Derbyshire vehicle as attendant and told

the Derbyshire crew member to drive the ambulance to the

Hallamshire.



I went back to my vehicle and took up the roll of ambulance

attendant.                       informed me that he had been

informed to go round to the gymnasium and to report to the

officer in c h a r g e . — We, drove on to Penistone Road   where we

were asked by Assistant Chief Jones to off load all blankets

and body bags.



Mr Jones then told us to report to the bus depot on Herries

Road and liaise with the incident officer present.              I've

 attended the bus depot and reported to the incident officer.

 Nottinghamshire,   Derbyshire and other vehicles were sent

 home leaving only Symas vehicles.      We waited in position for

 about an hour to relieve any further casualties in the

 Hillsborough area.     We were then requested to report to the

 gymnasium for briefing.



 At the gymnasium Mr Jones ascertained from each crew what
    shift they were on.     Having established that we were on

    emergency we were requested to return to duty and switch

    from channel one to normal emergency channel number two and

    report to   control.   We were told by control   to return to

    the Maltby area.

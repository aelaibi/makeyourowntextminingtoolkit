 You    will        require          little      reminder           of     the       increasingly           acrimonious               rounds
 of     accusation             and       counter       accusation           that        abounded          in     the      media        until
 you had the good sense to issue your instruction to the police and request
 a general cessation.
 Despite       acute           provocation          and    at        times       great       personal          anquish,           my       wife
 and     X    have       resisted          numerous        opportunities                to    fuel       that        deplorable              and
 unseemly          state        of       affairs,       preferring              to    assist       the        Taylor        Inquiry           in
 its difficult task                      - including being prepared                       to await            the outcome before
 making detailed comment to the media.


 I write           to    you       today    to     request          your    comment          and    intervention                 following
 the    statement,             widely       reported           in    the media,          by South Y o r k s h i r e ’s Deputy
 Chief       Constable             Peter     Hayes        to    the        effect       that       ”no     further          action           was
 required"              in     connection              with         the     actions          and         behaviour               of        Chief
 Superintendent David Duckenfield.
 I was       under        the      impression          that     Lord       Justice        Taylor         on      the one          hand and
 the    internal Police                  Investigation by the West Midlands force on the other,
 would       draw       conclusions             when    and     only       when       they     had       concluded          their work
 and    had        time       to     deliberate.          Despite           the      careful        wording,             the      issue       of
 this statement by the Deputy Chief Constable pre-empts these findings!


 Words fail me when I try to convey to you the hurt and totally unneccessary
 anguish       this          untimely       statement           has       given      my wife,           myself and             presumably
 the    other           families.          Apart    from        the       crass       nature       of    this      action,            I find
 the need to issue such a statement at this time beyond contempt.
FROM FIR-E SERVICES INSPECTORATE/FEU                                     06.12,1989 14:26            NO. 2        P. 4




One can only conclude that this is yet a further attempt by South Yorkshire
Police       to    divert       public       opinion        away    from     their     appalling         performance
both on the fatal day and subsequent to it.


Apart      from    obvious       offence       to    the     bereaved,       how      are   the    public     to view
this premature "absolution" by the Deputy Chief Constable!
That- a .senior, police., officer-- who ..by. M s                        own admission deliberately chose
to deceive his superiors (and others!) should not be disciplined is totally
incredible.
Even^ kf      one believes Chief Superintendant D u c k e n f i e l d 's reasons                             for lying
to the general public at the time,                         (and I am bound to say that I personally
do not!)      there could have been no credible reason to have misled the Deputy
Chief Constable.


Is    it     purely      coincidence          that        this     provided      an    excuse      for     the     Chief
Constables silence during the lead-in /initial week of the Taylor Inquiry,
when the fans were able to give their views?
I    trust    that       under    the      circumstances           you    will     understand      my     fears     of    a
"whitewash"         at    the    least and          at    the worst       a deliberate attempt               to   -’close
ranks" and distort the course of justice.


I regret that M r . H a y e s ’s insensitive and untimely public action has further
reduced my opinion of the South Yorkshire senior police.
It leaves me no alternative but to formally complain directly to yourself,
and    to ask      you as        the vanguard            of a Government claiming                 to be    "committed
to    law    and    order'*      to    make    an        unequivocal       statement        of   your    opinion         and
intended actions in the wake of this regrettable development.


I will       await your urgent response during the course of today or tomorrow,
but     would      advise       that       should    I    fail     to    recieve      an    appropriate       response
I    reserve       the    right       to    follow       Mr.Hayes        example    and     release       this    letter
to the media tomorrow evening.

           The Home Secretary has asked me to tl ank you for your letter
       of 8 June 1989 and to offer his personal kvmpathy for your
       terrible loss.

           The Government has instituted the inquiry ’b y^Lord Justice
       Taylor in order to discover what vent wrong at HiT3rsfe€>^oy?gtf'on
       that day.    Whilst the responsibility for deciding whether
       disciplinary action should be taken against a police officer or
       chief superintendent rank or below lies w i t h the Chief Constable,
       the Home Secretary considers that any final decisions on
       disciplinary matters are bound to await the outcome of Lord
       Justice T a y l o r ’s inquiry.

           I understand that the Deputy Chief Constable of South
       Yorkshire takes that view.



                                                                      r\ J

 Dear Home Secretary,
                                         re:- Hillsborough Disaster


    a # you for your courtesy in replying to my letter of the 7th so promptly
 ThartR
 and for your personal expression of sympathy to my wife and I.


 I    was      pleased      to     recieve           clarification                  of         your     position        regarding
 discipline,        however       your     letter          does        not    really            deal    with    the complaint
 I was      making.      Namely,        that       it   was       totally           improper           of   the Deputy Chief
 Constable,       whilst      the       Inquiry         is    still          hearing           evidence        and    the    police
 internal       investigation            is        still      taking          place,            to     state        publicly         his
 decision regarding further action against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,


His     very    well     publicised               action     in     stating           that           having    considered            the
matter       carefully,       subject         to     the     findings          of     the           Inquiry    "it    is my view
 that    no    further      action       is        required"           appears            to    be     at   great     divergance
.from the position you claim in the last paragraph of your reply to me.


In view of        the very poor           impression that                    the police evidence has created
in    the minds        of   the    public,           I cannot          help         but    feel        that    the D.C.C.            has
quite       deliberately,         and    most        improperly,-             * jumped          the     gun"    in an attempt
to counteract the poor showing of his senior officers at the Inquiry.


As the improper conduct of an officer of the rank of Deputy Chief Constable
is a matter for you,               I would welcome youz; comments and intentions on this
particular point and await your early reply.


                                                   Yours Faithfully,
                                                                                                                             S   y   ” }

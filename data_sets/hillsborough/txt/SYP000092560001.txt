                States;

                Further to the questionnaire                        I have completed in connection with my

                visit— £o Hillsborough F o o tb al 1 Ground on 15th April                                1989 (150489)      I

                can give s o m e a ^ t a i l       of the casualties                 I helped that day.

                                       the matsch had been stoooed ana                        I got onto the pitch to

                look for the oro m e r             of\|ie        lad                         who I was with.     I had

                contact with four casualties                        in all,      I was just helping other fans

                put casualties on to advertising boards and carrying them to the other

                end of the ground.

                On the floor           I can only remember two in any detail.                            One was a young

                boy he was picked up fr^om behind the^ goal                                  line just to the right of

                the goal, as you look at th&\pitch from the  terrace.

                 10/12 y r s old,       I c a n’t tell yotir^nythi ng more about him.

                 The other one I remember was picked iTjKf i'tom about the same place.                  He

                 was a man of 35/40 yrs short dark and wavy hair fat features.                     He had

          ^      a *~^verf'0 0 ^ s car ^ round his neck with a dark T shirt, and a jumper

              / which had just been tied round his waist.                He also had a wrist watch
                                      "                                                   -------------

                      I am sure this man was dead his face was blue.
                                --------------------
                 In fact I did not carry any of the casualties the full                  1 ength of the

                 pitch the farthest         I got was almost to the half way line.            Then I went

A 8 b < ^        back to the goal area to help others.

                 I was on the pitch between 3.10 pm <1510) and 3.30 pm <1530) a f ter

                 that I was just in a daze and was by the player tunnel.

                 If it would help I would be w i 11ing to view a video to identify myself

                 and the casualties         I carried.

 I have no doubt that the question of crowd safely will have exercised the minds ofi every
 senior club after the tragic events at Hillsborough. Following the publication of Lord
 Justice Taylor’s Interim Recommendations, attention has naturally been focused on matches
 in the Football League but you will be aware that any match involving a Football League
 club is designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. Some non-League grounds
 are also designated under the Act by virtue of their capacity and these clubs will,

 Whatever the casefshould your club progress to. the Competition Proper, it will'tor            ^ „
 ncceaarary for you *6 consult with your Local Authority and Police regarding the            .rv. ,
 arrangements for a tie or, indeed, a possible replay. This should also apply to ties             “ m* •
 not involving Football League opposition ^fniblie^interest-ia- my- matclr atrthisrstagrof
 the-Ghaitenge'Cuprirlilcely to'be'greater tSairiarperJtiapnctistoinat^l I am, therefore,
   iclosing a copy of a leaflet entitled "Crowd Safety Information" which may assist in
     itifying some of the Issues you will be required to address. This contains Lord
     ice Taylor's Interim Recommendations in full and supersedes The Football
     »datlon*s 1985 Memorandum on Crowd Control.
The draw for the First Round Proper will be issued on Monday next, the 30th October, at
 12.30 pm and^t is essential that discussions with your Local Authority and Police are
initiated immediately. This Office, in the shape of the Competitions Department pr
myself, must be appraised of any decisions prior to them being made public and tfe will
endeavour to provide whatever assistance is at our disposal^ Whilst we are hopeful that
as many ties or replays as possible are played as drawn and at the appointed time] we
are, of course, mindful of the wider issues of crowd safety and control and I am certain
you will share our concern.                             .

Mr R M Whalley
Secretary
Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
50 Queen Anneâ€™s Gate
London
SW1H 9AT




Dear Mr Whalley

I refer to a conversation with Mrs H um nhnes on Fridav last.

That day we held a meeting of our Advisers on Crowd Control who as you probably will know are
former Senior Police Officers who now work for us on a part time basis visiting Football
League and FA Cup matches and reporting on the many aspects of crowd management. One of them,
Mr Leslie Walker also acts as Security Officer to the England Team and as such has great
experience of measures taken by Foreign Associations in this area. Also attending the meeting
was Mr Jack Crawford, another retired Senior Police Officer, who is currently on the staff of
The Football League.

At the meeting it was felt that Lord Justice Taylor might wish to hear their views on crowd
management in the light of experiences this season to date. I realise that this is somewhat
late in the day but if the opportunity were to arise, I am sure Messrs Walker and Crawford
would be delighted to assist the Inquiry.

Yours sincerely




Ad
Crowd Management Co-ordinator

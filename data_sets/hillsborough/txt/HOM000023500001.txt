|0piank you for your note of 8 November to Miss Lenaghan asking for
  the up to date position on the evaluation of the electronic
  monitoring trials.


  All three trials are now under way and the collection of
  statistical and other evaluative material is progressing.   The
  full evaluation will not be completed until Spring 1990.    There
  will, however, be an interim evaluation which is to be submitted
  to Ministers in mid December.

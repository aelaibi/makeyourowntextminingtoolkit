Dear Member

HILLSBOROUGH

Accompanying this letter and the formal agenda you will find a hefty file of papers. The
majority of these papers have been put before the Authority on at least one previous
occasion, in particular at the May and November 1999 meetings. It is important however
in considering further applications for funding that you have available to you, at the time
you take a decision, all the relevant information.

The first two papers on the file are the most important items. Firstly there is a joint report
of the Chief Constable and myself outlining the procedure and summarising the estimated
costs and budgetary position. It also includes a statement by the Chief Constable. This
report is followed by the main paper, a detailed report prepared by Garretts. The key
sections of Garretts report are:

Section 1:... which outlines the decisions you are being asked to consider

Sections 4/5 ... which summarise the decisions previously taken by the Authority

Section 6:... which summarises the outcome of the December and January hearings on
the conduct of the trial. The latter part of this section also outlines the possible courses
which the proceedings might take at the end of the trial in June

Section 9:... which deals with the merits of the application and needs to be read in
conjunction with Garretts report of May 1999 (see Appendix 5 of the file)

Section 10: ... which runs through the options available to you in considering the
applications now before you
At the end of the Garretts report is a list of the supporting papers, many of which are
referred to in the report. For the most part, however, the key considerations are in either
the Garretts report or the covering joint report.

Please bear in mind at all times the confidentiality notice preceding the contents
page of the Garretts report.

I am conscious that there are a number of members who were not involved in the May
1999 meeting and may therefore not know the full background. If any members require
background briefing prior to Friday’s meeting please phone the Secretariat.

The meeting will be held at the Fire Brigade Training Centre in Sheffield. I enclose a map
showing the location. If any members are unsure of the location, or need transport to get
to the meeting, please phone the Secretariat.

Yours sincerely




Bill Wilkinson
Clerk and Treasurer

DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST

MR CHARLES PERRYMAN

I was an Assistant Chief Engineer in the Highways

and Traffic Directorate of Sheffield City Council. In

the days leading up to the Hillsborough Disaster I

supervised the installation of temporary direction

signs. Having previously discussed this matter with

the Authority’s legal advisers I do not consider that

I have a clear and substantial private or personal

interest and I propose to take part in the

discussions.

I was on duty at Hillsborough on 15 April, 1989 as

an Assistant Divisional Officer in the South

Yorkshire Ambulance Service and later co-ordinated

the evidence of South Yorkshire Ambulance Service

to the enquiry by Lord Justice Taylor. I have

previously discussed this matter with the Authority’s

legal advisers and I do not consider I have a clear

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

1     Purpose of the Report

To give consideration to applications for funding by two former police officers
in connection with private criminal prosecutions arising out of the
Hillsborough disaster.



      2      Recommendations

      Members are asked to consider the options and
      recommendations in Sections 2 and 10 of the attached report
      prepared by Garretts, the Authority’s legal advisers in this matter.


3     Background Information

3.1   The private prosecutions are brought by the Hillsborough Family
      Support Group (HFSG) for alleged offences arising out of the
      Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 1989.

3.2   In 1998 two former officers applied for and were granted financial
      assistance to pay their legal costs in defending themselves against the
      private prosecutions. Subsequently doubts were raised about whether
      it was lawful for the Authority to meet the officers’ costs. On 31 March
      1999 the Divisional Court ruled that Police Authorities do have the
      power to pay officers’ and former officers’ costs in legal proceedings.

3.3   On 21 May 1999 the Authority considered applications from the former
      officers for funding of the committal proceedings in July 1999. This
      was approved unanimously, subject to certain conditions which are set
      out in detail in Garretts report and its supporting appendices.

3.4   On 26 November 1999' the Authority considered applications for
      funding of proceedings in December 1999 and January 2000 in
      connection with the scope of the trial. These applications were
      approved by a majority vote, subject again to the conditions set out in
      Garretts report.




                                                                                1
3.5   The outcome of the December and January hearings is that the trial
      will proceed, and is scheduled to commence in Leeds on 6 June.
      Applications have been received from the former officers for financial
      support for their legal costs, and the principal purpose of this meeting
      is to consider those applications.

3.6   In addition, however, a number of other outstanding applications in
      connection with or arising out of the various proceedings over the last
      year were considered at the meeting on 4 February 2000 and
      decisions were deferred at that time. It is appropriate that the
      applications be reconsidered at this meeting so that the Authority is in
      a position to see the full potential financial implications.

4     The Process

4.1   Garretts were appointed to advise the Authority in January 1999 and
      have been retained to advise on the subsequent stages.
      Accompanying this report is a detailed paper which outlines the history
      of the Hillsborough proceedings and identifies the relevant
      considerations which the Authority must take into account in coming to
      a decision on the various applications.

4.2   Garretts report also refers to:

      (i)        The alternative methods by which funding of the defence costs
                 could be obtained.

      (ii)       The latest estimates of costs incurred or committed to date, and
                 the estimated cost of agreeing further support.

      (iii)      The possible scope of any further proceedings arising out of the
                 trial.

4.3   A substantial amount of background material is enclosed by way of
      appendices to the main Garretts report. This follows the practice
      adopted on previous occasions when the Authority has been asked to
      consider funding. It is essential that in coming to its decision, the
      Authority ensures that all relevant considerations are taken into
      account at the appropriate stage in the process.

      These include:

      •       do the powers exist? (This was confirmed by the Divisional
              Court);

      •       whether the Authority is satisfied that the former police officers
              acted in good faith in directing the police operations on the day
              of the disaster;



                                                                                 2
       •   whether the former police officers exercised their judgement
           reasonably, in the light o f the circumstances they faced, and if
           not, whether other relevant factors outweigh this consideration;

       •   whether it is appropriate to require the former police officers to
           look to alternative sources of finance to pay their legal costs,
           such as legal aid, the Police Superintendents' Association or
           their own resources, given the likely adverse financial effects
           for them of seeking legal aid;

       •   the seriousness of the charges and whether it is appropriate to
           agree to provide funding before a verdict is reached on them;

       •   the Authority's view on the merits of the charges;

       •   the impact on the Authority's resources of funding the former
           police officers' costs and the “knock on” effect on policing in
           South Yorkshire;

       •    the impact of a refusal to provide financial support on police
           morale and on the confidence of officers to exercise their
           judgement in difficult circumstances;

       •   (if support is agreed) on what terms should that support be
           offered?

5     Financial Implications

5.1   The Authority’s current financial commitment to the cost of the
      Hillsborough proceedings arises from the decisions taken in February
      1998, May 1999, and November 1999. Costs to date are not finalised
      because a substantial proportion of the claimed costs are still under
      review by the costs draftsman employed on the Authority’s behalf.
      Garretts report includes the latest estimates of possible commitments.
      The extent of the Authority’s VAT liability remains to be finally
      resolved; however Counsel’s view is that VAT on the previously
      agreed payments to the former officers is not recoverable, and there
      are fundamental concerns as to whether any future agreements could
      be structured so as to avoid VAT. Provision is therefore made in the
      estimates.

5.2   Garretts report includes provisional estimates of costs for the trial in
      June. The figures have been provided by the officers’ solicitors and
      would be incorporated in the letters of agreement issued by the
      Authority if it made support available.

      The report also includes updated estimates for the Authority’s own
      legal advice.



                                                                                 3

        It should be noted that the costs for the June, December and January
        proceedings* are still subject to completion of the Costs Draftsman’s
        review. The figures in the table are as claimed. Provisional results
        from the Costs Draftsman suggest that the Authority will seek to
        reduce the claims in the period to June 1999 alone by over £50,000.


                                                                                4
5.4    Budget provision

       Provision has been made for expenditure and commitments to date out
       of reserves and budget underspends in 1998/99 and 1999/2000.

       The Authority’s budget strategy for 2000/01 preserves a minimum level
       of general reserves amounting to 2% of the revenue budget. The
       estimated position after taking into account other adjustments referred
       to in the budget report to the Authority on 25 February is as follows:


       Estimated Police Authority reserves as at 31 March 2000

                                                       £000

       General reserves                                3929
       Less: 2% minimum                                3586

                                                        343

      Additional projected underspends in
      1999/2000 not reflected at budget stage           440

      Transfer of MMI reserve to general reserves      1000


      Additional general reserves over                 1783
      and above 2% target



5.5   If the Authority wishes to make further support available to the former
       officers in connection with the criminal proceedings, it is recommended
       that the cost be financed out of general reserves. This would avoid
        immediate impact on other elements of the policing budget and would
       not reduce the Authority’s working reserve level below its target level.

5.6   The overall budgetary position taking into account both the latest
       estimates of spending to date and the estimated future costs is set out
       on the table overleaf.




                                                                             5

BRiEFING PAPER FOR POLiCE AUTHORITY

Chief Constable’s Comments

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
Private Prosecution of David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray


Members of the South Yorkshire Police Authority have been asked to meet the legal costs of the
trial of two retired police officers; Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and Superintendent
Bernard Murray. As with previous discussions on this subject, I offer my professional assessment
of this application.

On 15 April 1989 (nearly 11 years ago) over a thousand police officers were on duty at the
football match played at the Hillsborough Stadium between Liverpool and Nottingham Forrest.
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was in charge of the policing operation and Superintendent
Murray was in charge of the control room arrangements. 96 people died in a crowd crush inside
the ground. Lord Justice Taylor’s enquiry analysed the cause of the disaster and apportioned
blame. After he had considered the investigation of the West Midlands Police, the Director of
Public Prosecutions ruled that nobody be prosecuted in connection with the disaster

The scrutiny of Lord Justice Stuart Smith (1997-98) found no fault in that decision.

The private prosecution of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray alleges that they caused the deaths of
people on the day of the disaster. The former officers deny these allegations.

In order to defend themselves against these charges they will need a lot of legal assistance
because of the complexities of trying to reconstruct what happened in such a complex
environment 11 years ago. To pay for that legal assistance they have two options;

a.    seek legal aid.
b.    ask the Police Authority for help.

Legal Aid Board rules require these two long retired officers to surrender almost all of their
savings and to make a substantial monthly contribution to the cost of their defence. The trauma
they have experienced since the day of the disaster has been compounded since April 1998 by
the commencement of the private prosecutions. If they have to seek Legal Aid that trauma will be
compounded by the financial penalties described above.

Subject to proper controls and limits the Police Authority may take the view that they owe a duty
of care to these two former officers.

I wish to express the same view as I have previously expressed. Where it is reasonable to
conclude that officers were acting in good faith in doing their difficult and dangerous tasks they
should be able to look to the Authority as their ‘employer’ for support. If the Authority do not
support the officers this will have an impact on how officers behave and this will make the daily
task of policing more difficult. Police officers need to know that they will have the support of the
Authority in defending themselves. For that reason I recommend that the Authority agrees these
requests subject to proper controls and limitations.

       The purpose of this report is to consider developments since and in the light cf She
       resolutions made by the Authority on 21 May and 26 November 1999 to provide
       financial assistance to the former officers, Mr David Duckenfield and Mr Bernard
       Murray, including:

       1.1    The decisions of 24 December 1999 and 16 February 2000 of Mr Justice

        3     THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - KEY EVENTS FROM 15
              APRIL 1S89

        3.1    15_April 1999: FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool Football Club and
               Nottingham Forest Football Club at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield
               Wednesday's ground. Only six minutes into the game, play was stopped
               when it was realised that spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal
               had been severely crushed. As a result, 96 people died and over 400 received
               hospital treatment.

        3 J      17 April 1989: Lord Justice Taylor was appointed

               'to carry out an inquiry into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football
               Ground of 15 April 1989 and to make recommendations about the needs of
               crowd control and safety at sports events".

        3-3    17 April 1989: Geoffrey Dear QPM, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police,
               appointed to carry out independent investigation of the disaster and gather
               evidence.

        3-4   19 April 1989: West Midlands Police assumed responsibility for the inquiry.

        3.5   HM Coroner opened and adjourned inquests on 95 deaths that had already
               occurred as a result of the disaster (the death of the last victim to die, Mr Tony
               Bland, occurring at a later date),

        3.6     4 August 1989: Having head the oral testimony of over 170 witnesses
                between 15 May and 19 June 1989, Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report was
                made public. He found that the immediate cause of the gross ovsr-crowding
                which had taken place, and thus of the disaster, had been the failure to cut off
                access to the central pans behind the goal (which were already over full)
                when gate C was opened. He found also a number of contributing factors
                including the Club's "confused and inadequate signs and ticketing", police
                planning, police operations on the day, "the presence of an unruly minority
                who had drunk too much" and interaction of parties responsible for safety
                issues. In respect of police operations on the day, Lord Justice Taylor in his
                Interim Report, said (at paragraph 278)


                "although there were other causes, the main reason for the disaster was the
                failure of police control'’.


                The then Chief Constable, Peter Wright, referred the questions of
                manslaughter, by criminal negligence, to the Director of Public Prosecutions
                for a decision es to criminal liability.

        3-7     15 August 1989: Director of Public Prosecutions recommended that the
                matter should be subject of a criminal investigation. Mr Dear, Chief Constable
                of West Midlands Police, was invited to undertake this investigation. He was
                also asked that if he discovered any matters against the Police (Discipline)
                Regulations, he should enquire into them on behalf of South Yorkshire Police.

        3.8     30 November 1989: Peter Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police,
                offered in conjunction with insurers to open negotiations with representatives
               of the bereaved to resolve all bona fide civil claims for compensation without
               having to await the outcome of legal hearings.

        3.9    15 December 19S9: Agreement reached with representatives of the bereaved
               for settlement of civil actions without a decision as to liability.

        3.10   December 1989: Full criminal and disciplinary investigation formally
               commenced.

        3.11   18 Tanuary 1990: Lord Justice Taylor!s Final Report was published.

        3.12   31 March 1990: Mr Dear's report was submitted to Director of Public

        3.16   30   August 1090: Director of Public Prosecutions Allan Green QC, concluded
               that there was insufficient evidence upon which a prosecution for
               manslaughter, or any other criminal offence, could be brought against any
               officer in the South Yorkshire Police, or any other person.

        3.17   19 November 1990 to 28 March 1991: HM Coroner resumed inquests on 95
               deaths in the Hillsborough Disaster. Jury returned a verdict of accidental

               Superintendent Duckenfield should face four disciplinary charges of Neglect
               of Duty and one of Discreditable Conduct In addition, Superintendent
               Murray should face one charge of Neglect of Duty.

        3.21   November 1991: Chief Superintendent Duckenfield retired on medical
               grounds, having been on sick leave for some time.

        3.22   13 Tanuary 1992: Police Complaints Authority gave leave not to proceed with
               the discipline charge against Superintendent Murray, as it would be
               inappropriate and unjust to pursue the charge against him alone, in the
               absence of his superior officer. Sometime thereafter, Superintendent Murray
               went on sick leave.

        3.23 26 August 1992: Superintendent Murray retired on medical grounds.

                  of the HFSG. That material related in particular to video evidence of the
                  disaster and medical evidence about the time of death of the victims.

           3.28    3 Mav 1997: DPP reviews the case in the light of the "Hillsborough" drama,
                   but decides not to prosecute as there was no reasonable prospect of

           3.29 30 If ne 1997; Hie Home Secretary made an oral statement to the House of
                  Commons during the course of which he stated:

                                       "Madam Speaker, my Department, the office of the Attorney
                                       General and the Crown Prosecution Service have considered
                                       very carefully all the evidence which has beer, put forward in
                                       recent months.

                                       The Director of Public Prosecutions has taken the view that thg
                                       material sc far presented to her would not justify fresh
                                       criminal investigations. The then Attorney General also took
                                       the view, again on the material presented to him, that any
                                       application to the High Court for a new inquest would not
                                       have any realistic prospect of succeeding.

                                       Nonetheless, I am acutely conscious that the families of those
                                       who died at Hillsborough and many others including Hon
                                       Members of this House are very concerned that unresolved
                                       issues remain. I am determined to go as far as I can to ensure
                                       that no matter of significance is overlooked and that we do not

                                  I can therefore tell the House today that the Attorney General,
                                  the Director of Public Prosecutions and I have agreed that it is
                                  in the public interest that ihere should be an independent
                                  scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any new
                                  evidence relating to the disaster which was not previously
                                  available. We are appointing Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a
                                  senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, for that purpose".

           3.30   18 February 199$: Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny Report was presented
                  to the House of Commons. He concluded:

           3.30.1 None of the evidence he was asked to consider added anything significant to
                  the evidence which was available to Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry or to the
                  inquests;

           3.30.2 There was no basis upon which there should be a further judicial inquiry or a
                  reopening of Lord Taylor's inquiry;

           3.30.3 There was no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court cr for the
                  Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988; and

           3.30.4 There was no material which should be put before the Director of Public
                  Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to
                  reconsider the decisions they had already taken.

           3.30.5 18 February 199S: The Home Secretary announced in the House that he, the
                  Attorney General and the DPP had very carefully considered Lord Justice
                  Stuart-Smith's report, and said "we have no reason to doubt his conclusions1'.
                  Following publications of the Scrutiny Report, Trevor Hicks, the Chairman of
                  the HFSG announced that he was disappointed with the Scrutiny's
                  conclusions and that the HFSG were considering private prosecutions.

           3.30-6 27 February 1998: The Authority resolved to authorise die Q erk and
                  Treasurer to consider applications for financial assistance from serving and
                  retired officers in respect of possible criminal proceedings arising from the
                  Hillsborough Stadium disaster.

              was not appropriate for payments to be made out of central funds to meet the
              costs ordered on 10 July 1998.

        4       THE RESOLUTIONS OF 21 MAY 1999

        4.1    On 21 May 1999, the Authority made resolutions on the
               applications for financial assistance received from the former officers. The
               resolutions were made following the Divisional Court's decision that


               "A Police Authority has the statutory power/ but subject to ordinary public law
               principles, to provide financial assistance to police officers and former police
               officers in respect of their costs and expenses incurred in relation to private
               prosecutions brought against them and judicial review proceedings in which
               they participate".

               In reaching its decision, the Authority received written and oral submissions
               from or on behalf of:

               4.1.1 HFSG

                4.1.2 Mr Duckenfield

                4.1.3 Mr Murray


                and received written and oral reports from its legal advisors, Garretts, and the
                Chief Constable.

        4.2     In summary, the resolutions were to the following effect:

                4.2.1 To pay the reasonable costs of the former officers in the Leeds criminal
                      proceedings up to the conclusion of the committal proceedings,
                      subject to certain conditions (see paragraphs 1,2,10 and 11 of the
                      resolution.)

                4.2.2 To pay the reasonable costs of the former officers in the judicial review
                     of the DPP's decision not to take over and discontinue the criminal
                     proceedings ("the DPP judicial review") (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of the
                     resolutions).

                           central funds (paragraphs 4 and 5 of the resolution).

                      (b) The former officers' costs of the judicial review of the Authority's
                          decision of 5 February 1999 given the award of costs against the
                          private prosecutor (see paragraphs 8 and 9 of the resolutions).

                       (c) The DPP's costs in the DPP judicial review that were ordered to be
                           met by the former officers until the amount of such costs are known.

                  4.2.4 To defer consideration of the applications to pay the former officers
                       costs in ths potential judicial review of the Chief Clerk of South Sefton
                       Magistrates Court until the Clerk's decision (i.e. whether central funds
                       would meet the former officers costs) is known.

                 South Sefton

           4.3   Following the decision of the Chief Clerk of the South Sefton Magistrates
                 Court to meet the former officers' costs out of central funds, the potential
                 judicial review referred to in paragraph 4.2.4 was averted. However, the
                 former officers contend that the amount of costs awarded by the Chief Clerk
                 are too lew and they seek further financial assistance to challenge the award
                 of costs by way of judicial review, or to meet the difference between the costs
                 claimed and the costs awarded. The solicitors for the former officers have
                 confirmed that the challenge may be made only by judicial review and that
                 the time limited for challenge is 3 months from the date of the relevant
                 decision. In the case of Mr Murray, this expires on 15 March 2000. In the case
                 of Mr Duckenfield, this expires on 13 April 2000.

           4.4   In the case of Mr Murray, costs of £4,792.50 (plus VAT) were sought. These
                 costs were allowed at £2,475. In the case of Mr Duckenfield, costs of £8,716.63
                 were sought, but only £2,320.67 were allowed. It is understood that the
                 primary reason for the deductions was that only those costs relating to the
                 challenge to the jurisdiction of South Sefton were allowed, whereas the costs
                 claimed included a wider range of work undertaken, including, for example,
                 preparatory work on die proposed application to request the DPP to take
                 over and discontinue the proceedings. We would not expect central funds to
                 meet such costs, even though they were reasonably incurred on behalf of the

        4.5    DP? costs in the DPP judicial review

               The DPP has now provided details of the costs it claimed from the former
               officers following their (largely) unsuccessful challenge to his decision not to
               take over an discontinue the prosecutions. Their costs totalled £8,631 plus
               VAT. One half of these costs are to be borne by Mr Murray pursuant to the
               order for costs mada against him on 31 March 1999. Mr Duckenfield is to
               bear two thirds of one half of these costs. This is to reflect the fact that his
               application was partially successful, in that the Divisional Court directed the
               DPP to reconsider its decision not to take over the charge of attempting to
               pervert the course of justice. Therefore, costs of £4,31530 are sought against
              Mr Murray and costs of £2,877 are sought against Mr Duckenfield. These
              totiu £7,192.50.

        4.6   It is considered that the amount of costs claimed by the DPP is reasonable.
              The decision for the Authority is whether it should indemnify the former
              officers against these costs. It will be remembered that the Authority has
              agreed to meet the costs incurred by ihe former officers with their own
              solicitors of and incidental to their challenge of the DPFs decision.

        4.7   Award of costs against Ms Adlinpton


              Mr Duckenfield's solicitors, Winckworth Sherwood, have applied tc assess
              the costs payable by Ms Adlington pursuant to the order for costs made
              against her of 31 March 1999.


              Vvinckworth Sherwood should like to seek Counsel's advice on some points
              arising in the assessment of costs. They have asked the Authority to meet the
              costs of obtaining Counsel's advice. However, it should be noted that, on 21
              May 1999, the Authority deferred a decision on applications by Mr
              Duckenfield (and Mr Murray) to meet the costs they incurred in the funding
              judicial review on the grounds that they had obtained orders for costs against
              Miss Adlington. The assistance sought is part of the process of recovering
              costs from the prosecutor, and will be recoverable from her if the court
              considers them to have been reasonably incurred.

            5.1    Or. 26 November 1999, the Authority resolved to meet the costs of and
                   incidental to;


                    (i)    The applications to exclude from the trial statements made by the
                           former officers and answers to the Taylor Inquiry; and


                    (ii)   The former officers further application to stay the prosecutions


                    subject to terms and conditions set out in draft letters detailing die number of
                    solicitors working, the hourly rates payable etc.


           6       THE PRESENT POSITION

           6.1     Tha committal proceedings against Hie former officerscommenced in the
                   Leeds Magistrates Court on 5 July 1999. As a preliminary matter, the
                    Stipendiary Magistrate was asked to rule on an application by the former
                    officers to strike out the prosecutions as an abuse of process. His written
                    judgment was delivered on 15 July 1999. He concluded that the proceedings
                    should not be struck out.

           6.2     On 20 July 1?97, the Stipendiary Magistrate held that there was sufficient
                   evidence to commit the Defendants for trial on all charges. This was not a
                   finding of guilt. It is simply that he was satisfied that there was sufficient
                    evidence or. which a reasonable jury could (not would) find the former
                   officers guilty. No written judgment was handed down by the Stipendiary
                   Magistrate. He simply said,, after listening to the evidence, that he had
                   decided that there was a case to go forward to the Crown Court.

                   Preliminary   hearing on admissibility of evidence


           6.3     Mr Justice Hooper ruled on this application on 24 December 1999. His
                   judgment if in the appendices. The judgment concentrates cn Mr
                   Duckenfield's position.

           6.4     It was submitted on behalf of Mr Duckenfield that:

           6-4.1   A statement made by him on or about 5 May 1989; and

          6.4.2   The answers he gave to the Taylor Inquiry

                  were inadmissible in the forthcoming manslaughter trial on two grounds,
                  namely public policy at common law and by virtue of section 78 of the Police
                  and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.


                  Public policy at common law

          6.5     It was argued that there was a principle, based on public policy at common
                  law, that all witness who give evidence at public inquiries should not have
                  the evidence given used against diem in subsequent proceedings. Mr Justice
                  Hooper observed that witnesses are sometimes given an undertaking at
                  public inquiries that their evidence will not be used to their prejudice in any
                  criminal proceedings. Mr Justice Hooper found that, because it was felt
                  necessary to sometimes give this undertaking, there was no room to argue
                  that public policy at common law provided a general immunity.


                  PACE 1984

          6.6     The second ground was based on the proposition that, under section 78 PACE
                  1984, the evidence against Mr Duckenfield should not be allowed as it would
                  have ''an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings". Under this
                  ground, the court dealt separately with the statement made on 5 May 1989
                  and the answers given to the Taylor Inquiry.

          6.7     The statement of 5 Mav 1989


                  Mr Justice Hooper felt that, taking into account Mr Duckenfield's experience
                  as a senior police officer and that he knew what use could have been made of
                  his statement, there was no justification for concluding that die admission of
                  this evidence would have an adverse effect on the fairness of die proceedings.

          6.8     Evidence and Tavlor


                  On the matters of the answers given to the Taylor Inquiry, it was contended
                  that these should be excluded on the grounds that Mr Duckenfield


                  (i) Was not represented before the Inquiry;


                  (ii) Was not made aware of allegations that were to be made against him and

                   the evidence in support of them; and


              (iii) He did not receive a caution before giving his evidence.

       6.9    Mr Justice Hooper rejected the submissions on the following grounds:

              (i) Mr Duckenfield was a very senior police officer;


              (ii) That the Inquiry and Counsel for the Inquiry would have raised the issue
                   of a caution had it felt that any witnesses were laying themselves open to
                   a criminal charge but did not feel, in the circumstances, that it was
                  necessary to caution Mr Duckenfield; and


              (iii) That Counsel for the 5outh Yorkshire Police Force (who it was accepted
                    was not acting for Mr Duckenfield or any particular officers) did suggest
                  to Mr Duckenfield that he ought to obtain legal advice but that despite
                  this advice, Mr Duckenfield chose to go into the witness box (although it
                  is not clear whether Mr Duckenfield sought independent advice himself).


              [Note: Mr Murray also appeared in the admissibility application but there is

              Applications to stay the prosecution

       6.10   Fresh applications to stay the prosecutions on various grounds were heard
              between 4 and 8 January 2000. Mr Justice Hooper reserved his decision,
              which was delivered on 16 February 2000.

       6.11   Mr Justice Hooper's judgment on the various grounds on which it was
              contended that the proceedings should be stayed were as follows:


              (i) The delay has been such that no fair trial is possible.


                  The prosecution case against the officers is that, instructions having been
                  given to open the perimeter gates, steps should have been taken to block
                  access to the pens, which were already overfull, at die Leppings Lane
                  end. The former officers contended that the passage of time presented
                  them with insuperable difficulties in examining whether it would have
                  been possible or practical fox them tc have arranged for the entrance to

                 the pens to have been closed off. Mr Justice Hooper did not accept the
                 argument, although he noted that if, during the course of the trial/ such
                 difficulties as were envisaged by the Defence did materialise/ he had the
                 power to stop the prosecution or make some other less draconian ruling.


           (ii) The publicity has been such that no fair trial is possible


                .Although Mr Justice Hooper acknowledged that there had been a massive
                 amount of adverse publicity/ he concluded that the former officers failed
                 to prove on the balance of probabilities that such adverse publicity will
                prevent or impede a fair trial. Indeed, he went further and stated himself
                 quite satisfied that the officers will have a fair trial. However, Mr Justice
                 Hooper recognised that it will be necessary to prepare a list of questions
                /or jurors in order to assess whether their minds could be "clogged with
                prejudice as a result of adverse publicity". Mr Justice Hooper also felt
                 that it might be appropriate to hold the trial outside West Yorkshire,
                 although he was dissuaded from this course of action following
                submissions that were made after judgment

           {iii) The prosecution is so oppressive, unfair and wrong that it should not be
                allowed to continue


                There were a number of submissions made under this ground including:

            •     The manner in which the prosecution had been conducted;

            •    . That the prosecution had been prompted by a distorted and
                 misrepresented view of the facts as a result of the Jimmy McGovern film
                 "Hillsborough";

            •    That in the light of earlier decisions not to prosecute and the fact that the
                 evidence had net changed since 1989 - 90, the prosecution should not
                 continue.

           Mr Justice Hooper rejected these arguments. However, he felt that the delay
           in this prosecution coming to trial had placed a strain upon the former
           officers beyond that which any Defendant to criminal proceedings is to be
           expected to endure. He concluded that the greatest worry for Defendants is
           the prospect of imprisonment, and that it was unfair for the former officers to
           have had to have lived with this prospect for so many years. However, Mr

         Justice Hooper did not feel that this warranted the stay of proceedings if there
         were other means to mitigate this oppression. Mr Justice Hooper felt that the
         oppression could be mitigated by his announcing that, in the event cf their
         conviction, the former officers would not face immediate prison sentences.


      (iv) A breach of the European convention on human rights


         Issues under this head were similar to those considered under the preceding
         head. Indeed, Mr Justice Hooper felt that there were European cases which
         justified his decision to mitigate oppression by announcing that the former
         officers would not be subject to immediate imprisonment in the event of
         conviction.

6.12     In die light of these decisions, the trial will take place in Leeds from 6 June
         2000. It is scheduled for 6 weeks, although the proseojfcion has indicated that
         it should last only 3 weeks. The former officers seek financial assistance to
         meet tfieir costs of and incidental to the trial.


         Appeals

6.13     Judgments on these points are considered to be part of the trial. Therefore, if
         the officers ere convicted, they will be entitled to appeal on the grounds that
         the decisions of 24 December 1999 and 16 February 2000 were wrong, in
         addition to any grounds of appeal that may occur during the course of a trial.
         In the event that the officers are acquitted, the prosecutor may appeal on a
         poin t of law, but once acquitted, the officers cannot be convicted, even
         following an appeal. Therefore, the former officers might choose not to take
         part in such an appeal.

6.14    The officers right of appeal is, in the first instance, to the Court of Appeal and,
         subject to obtaining leave, to the House of Lords. The officers may also seek
         to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights upon exhausting their
         domestic rights of appeal. If the matter were to go as far as the European
        Court of Human Rights, the appeal procedure could take as much as 5 years,
        possibly longer.

                 legal team during the trial. Therefore, it would appear that their estimate is
                 in the order of £310,000.

         7.3.3   In the light of the above estimates, the total costs are estimated to be in the

       8     TAXATION

       8.1   In section 7 of o u t report of 22 November 1999, we set out the position on the
             possible incidence of taxation on financial assistance provided to the former
             officers, We concluded that this could have increased by up to 87% the cost of
             providing financial assistance.

       8.2   As proposed in our report, the opinion of Mr William Massey QC was supplied
             to the Inland Revenue. On 18 February 2000, the Inland Revenue confirmed
             that

             "the payment made (or due to be made) to Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray in
             respect of legal action regarding the Hillsborough Stadium disaster are free of
             tax.


             I would point out that the Revenue does not accept that this sets a precedent
             The decision regarding these two former police officers is based upon the facts
             specific to their case."

       8.3   It wid also be remembered that Mr Massey also advised that VAT would be
             payable by the Authority on the financial assistance sought from the officers
             unless the Authority were, jointly with each of the officers to instruct each of
             the firms of solicitors for the further conduct of die proceedings.

       8.4   However, it was the view of Presily Baxendale QC and Mr Mark Shaw of
             Counsel that, while such joint instructions may be legitimate from a taxation
             perspective, a public authority might be criticised, or even be acting outside its
             powers, to enter into such an arrangement. Their reasons were:


             8.4.1     Th;' AutI iority needs to have a proper legal basis for instructing
                        solicitors. It appears here that the purpose of the instructions is to
                        save VAT, rather than to look after its own interests. The Authority
                        might contend that its legitimate interests required it to ensure that it
                        monitor how the Defence was being conducted with a view to its
                       own interests, but this might give rise to a conflict between the
                       position of the Authority and each of the officers. In any event, to

                          the extent that it was necessary to ensure that costs were kept to
                          reasonable limits, the Authority is able/ and indeed has, exercised
                          this function independent of being a joint client


               8.4.2     If the Authority to were become clients jointly with the officers, the
                          Authority would be seen to be aligning itself with the officers when
                          its proper position would be to remain objective.


               8.4.3     The Authority does ro t actually want any advice from the solicitors
                         for Messrs Murray and Duckenfield. The position would be different
                          if the Authority wers a co-defendant.

         8.5   The possibility of the Authority becoming a joint client with the former officers
               has been canvassed with each of their solicitors who have indicated that, in
               principle, they would not object to such course if the Authority were minded to
               seek to jointly instruct them.



         8.6   However, it is our view that m the light of Counsel's concerns, the Authority
               should not seek to become clients of the former officers in order to save VAT
               on any financial assistance that may be given to the former officers.

         9      THE MERITS OF THE APPLICATIONS FOR ASSISTANCE

         Sectron 8 of the Garretts report of 13 May 1999 detailed the factors to be considered
         by the Authority when deciding upon applications for assistance. Those
         considerations remain relevant and need to be considered afresh, albeit in the light of
         the fact that, having considered those matters the Authority decided on 21 May and
         26 November 1999 that it was appropriate to provide financial assistance to the
         former officers.

         The following further matters need to be considered by the Authority;

         Whether there have been any material developments in relation to those factors


         9.1,1 The judgments of Mr Justice Hooper on the applications to exclude evidence
               and to stay the prosecution are relevant. In particular, the decision of Mr
               Justice Hooper, who will be the trial judge, to announce that, in the event of
               their conviction, neither officer will be subjected to an immediate prison

               sentence. This does not detract from the very serious nature of the charges that
               they face.

          9.12 Although the charge against Mr Duckenfield of attempting to pervert the
                course of justice has been withdrawn, it has been replaced by a fresh
                indictment of misconduct arising from what he said about the circumstances
                in which the perimeter gate was opened.


                The elements of this indictment have not been considered by the Authority
                (the ehments of the charge of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a
                public duty were discussed in paragraphs 5.2 and following on pages 19 - 20
                of our report of 13 May 1999). It is an offence for a police officer (indeed, any
                public official) to neglect the duties required of him by law. The offence has
                been rileged for

                 •     Failing, on notice, to pursue a felon; and

                 •     Failing to intervene to stop a fatal attack committed 30 yards from the
                       officer.

                 The Eolicitors for Mr Duckenfield have been asked to provide to the
                 Authority particulars of this indictment for consideration as part of the
                 application for financial assistance.

 David Duckenfield and Superintendent Bernard Murray. As with previous
 discussions on the subject, I offer my professional assessment of this
 application.

 On 15 April 1989 (nearly 11 years ago) over a thousand police officers were on
 duty at the football match played at the Hillsborough Stadium between
 Liverpool and Nottingham Forrest. Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was in
 charge of the policing operation and Superintendent Murray was in charge of
 the control room arrangements. 96 peopled died in a crowd crush inside the
 ground. Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry analysed the cause of the disaster and
 apportioned blame. After he had considered the investigation of the West
Midland Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions ruled that nobody be
prosecuted in. connection with die disaster.


The scrutiny of Lord Justice Stuart Smith (1997 -98) found no fault in that
decision.


The private prosecution of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray alleges that they
caused the deaths of people o r the day of the disaster. The former officers
deny these allegations.


In order to defend themselves against these charges they will need a lot of
iegal assistance because of the complexities of trying to reconstruct what
happened in such a complex environment 11 years ago. To pay for that legal
assistance they have two options;

a. seek legal aid.
b. ask the Police Authority for help.


Legal Aid Board rules require these two long re tired officers to surrender
almost all of their savings and to make a substantial monthly contribution to
the costs of the defence. The trauma they have experienced since the day of
the disaster has been compounded since April 1998 by the commencement of
the private prosecutions. If they have to seek Legal Aid that trauma will be
compounded by the financial penalties described above.


Subject to proper controls and limits the Police Authority may take the view
that they owe a duty of care to these two former officers.

              I wish to express the same view as I have previously expressed. Where it is
              reasonable to conclude that officers were acting in good faith in doing their
             difficult and dangerous tasks they should be able to look to the Authority as
             their "employer" for support. If the Authority do not support the officers this
             will have an impact on how officers behave and this will make the daily tasks
              of policing more difficult, Police Officers need to know that they will have
              the support of the Authority in defending themselves. For that reason I
              recommend that the Authority agrees these requests subject to proper
              controls and limitations.

      10     THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE AUTHORITY


              On rhe applications for financial assistance for the trial commencing on 6 June
              2000, the Authority needs to make decisions separately for each of the former
             officers on each of the charges namely

      10.1    In the case of Mr Duckenfield that he

             •     Unlawfully killed John Alfred Anderson and James Gary Aspinal;

             •     Wilfully neglected to perform a public duty;

             •     Was guilty of misconduct arising from the admitted lie; and in the case
                   -of Mr Murrav; and

             in the? c.is*i of Mr Murray that he

             •     Unlawfully killed John Alfred Anderson and James Gary Aspinal; and

             •     Wilfully neglected to perform a public duty.

      10.2   On each of these matters, the Authority may

      10.2.1 Reject the applications,

      10.2.2 Defer the applications until after the conclusion of the criminal proceedings
             on the grounds that only then can the Authority know the circumstances of
             the prosecution cases against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray, and the likely

                cost of granting financial assistance. However, tile previous decisions to
                provide financial assistance would suggest that this is not a realistic option.

         10.2.3 Defer the applications pending further information or clarification.

         10.2.4 Approve the applications subject to terms and conditions set out in draft
                letters dealing with the number of solicitors working, the hourly rates
                payable etc. Meet a specific proportion only of the costs.

         10 2.5 To provide financial assistance in principle, subject to the outcome of the
                proceedings.

         10-2.6 To provide financial assistance by way of loan.

         10 3   The Authority also needs to reconsider the applications it first considered on
                4 February 2000 $s fallows:

         10.3.1 On the request by each of the former officers to meet the DPFs costs of the
                judicial review the Authority may in the case of each of Mr Duckenfield and

                costs of a challenge to the decision of the Chief Clerk of the South Sefton
                Magistrates Court on the amount of costs awarded out of central funds, the
                Authority may

                 •     Reject the applications to fund the judicial review proceedings;

                 •    Approve the application for judicial review proceedings;

                 •    Meet the difference between the amounts claimed and the amounts
                      awarded by die Chief Clerk; or

                 •    Meet the difference between the amounts allowed by the Chief Clerk
                       of th5 South Sefton Magistrates Court and die sums which were
                       reasonably incurred in the South Sefton proceedings in the context of a
                       prosecution as a whole i.e. those costs which were relevant to the
                       conduct of the Defence in the Leeds Magistrates Court and in
                      connection with die proposed requests of the DPP to take over and

                hearing before Mr Justice Hooper between 4 and 7 January 2000, the
                Authority might

                 •     Reject the application

                 •     Approve the application

                 •     Defer the application pending the outcome of trial and then consider
                       the matter afresh as part of an application for financial assistance for
                       an appeal.

         10.3 4 On Mr Duckenfield's application to meet costs to be incurred in the
                proceedings to assess the costs awarded against Ms Adlington in the powers

                 •    Defer the application on the grounds that it has not yet approved

                the dismissal of the charge against Mr Duckenfield that he attempted to
                pervert the course of justice, the Authority may

Police - Police authority - Powers o f police authority - Private prosecutions being
brought against retired police officers fo r actions in course o f duty - DPP refusing to
intervene in proceedings - Officers seeking judicial review o f DPP’s decision - Police
authority refusing to fu n d judicial review proceedings and officers’ defences to private
prosecutions - Whether police authority having power to fund legal representation o f
police officers - Local Government Act 1972, s 111(1)-Police Act 1996, s 6(1).

The applicants, two retired senior police officers in the South Yorkshire force, had
been on duty during the 1989 Hillsborough disaster in which many persons lost
their lives. In 1998 a representative of the victims’ families brought private
prosecutions against them for manslaughter and wilful neglect of duty, and the
South Yorkshire Police Authority (the SYPA) agreed to fund their defences. The
applicants subsequently asked the Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) to
exercise his statutory power to take over the conduct of the proceedings with a
view to discontinuing them. The DPP rejected that application, and the
applicants sought to challenge his decision through judicial review proceedings.
They asked the SYPA to fund those proceedings, just as it had already agreed to
fund their defences to the private prosecutions. However, after taking legal
advice, the SYPA concluded that it had no power to provide them with financial
assistance in respect o f either the judicial review proceedings or the private
prosecutions. The applicants together with the Chief Constable challenged that
decision in further judicial review proceedings, contending, inter alia, that police
authorities could fond officers’ legal representation by using the ancillary power
in s 11 l(l)a of the Local Government Act 1972 to support their general function
under s 6(l)b of the Police Act 1996. The SYPA contended that s 111(1) o f the
1972 Act could be used only to support the powers expressly conferred on police
authorities, and that s 6(1) o f the 1995 Act conferred no such powers.

Held - A police authority was empowered by s 111(1) of the 1972 Act to fond
officers in criminal and judicial review proceedings. Such a conclusion flowed
from a consideration of the interlocking roles of chief constable, Secretary of State
and police authority under the 1996 Act, which established that the ancillary power
provided by s 111(1) of the 1972 Act was not restricted to support only those
powers and duties expressly conferred on a police authority. Such powers and
duties, though important, were themselves ancillary to the chief constable’s
tactical role and the Secretary o f State’s strategic role, and s 111(1) allowed a police

31 March 1999. The following judgments were delivered.

 LAWS LJ. These are linked applications for judicial review which require the
 court to revisit the terrible disaster which took place at the Hillsborough football
ground at Sheffield on 15 April 1989. In what I will call the first case the applicants,
Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray, (to whom I will refer as D and M), who are retired
police officers, seek leave to move for judicial review o f the decision of the
Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) to refuse to take over and discontinue
private prosecutions which have been instituted against them by
Ann Adlington (AA) on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group (the
HFSG). The decision was communicated by letter of 18 December 1998. On
 15 March 1999 Latham J adjourned the leave application to 22 March 1999 and
directed that the parties should then be ready to proceed with the substantive
application if leave were granted. On 22 March this court granted leave and
proceeded at once to hear the inter partes application. In the second case the Chief
Constable of the South Yorkshire Police (the CCSY) seeks to challenge a decision
of the South Yorkshire Police Authority (the SYPA) made on 5 February 1999 to
the effect that it lacked the legal power to fund the defences of D and M to the
private prosecutions brought by AA, or to fund their prospective judicial review
applications against the DPP. On 12 February 1999 Latham J granted leave to the
CCSY, joined AA as second respondent, abridged time and ordered expedition.
On 24 March 1999 this court (having reserved judgment in the first case the
previous day) granted leave to D and M to challenge the same decision and, again,
proceeded at once to hear the inter partes application. We now deliver our
judgments in both cases.
   I will first set out the facts material to the first case, which also form the
necessary background to the second. I will later describe the further facts which
are specifically relevant to the second case.
   The football match at Hillsborough on Saturday 15 April 1989 was the FA Cup
semi-final between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC. In the events
which happened 96 people lost their lives. The divisional commander in charge
of police operations at the match was D, then holding the rank of chief
superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police Force. The second applicant, then
Supt Murray, held the position o f sub-divisional commander and was also on
duty at the match.
   On 17 April 1989 Taylor LJ, as he then was, was appointed by the government
to conduct a public inquiry into the disaster. He heard the oral testimony of
 174 witnesses between 15 May and 29 June 1989, and presented an interim report
on 4 August 1989 (The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster (Cm 765) (1989)). He found
that the immediate cause of the gross overcrowding which had taken place, and

 thus o f the disaster, had been the failure to cut off access to the central pens          to
behind the goal (which were already overfull) when gate C was opened. He                    de
found also a number o f contributing factors including the condition of the
                                                                                       Paragr
ground, police planning, police operations on the day, and the interaction of
parties responsible for safety issues. Lord Taylor’s final report (Cm 962 (1989))
was delivered on 18january 1990 and included a number of recommendations                    th
relating to crowd control and safety at sporting events.                                    in^
   Meanwhile, immediately after the disaster, die West Midlands police had been             be
 appointed to conduct a review of the policing operations o f the South Yorkshire           At
police. In March 1990 the West Midlands police reported to the DPP. After                    all
taking the opinion of two experienced leading counsel, the DPP announced on
30 August 1990 that in his view there was insufficient evidence to justify any         On the
prosecution for a criminal offence, relating to the disaster, against any member of    that h
the South Yorkshire police force. Then from November 1990 to March 1991                Stuart'
HM Coroner for South Yorkshire conducted an inquest into the deaths, in the                 -' e
course of which 230 witnesses gave evidence. On 28 March 1991 the coroner’s            attemi
jury returned verdicts of accidental death.                                            in the

   Disciplinary proceedings for neglect of duty were instituted against D and M by
the Police Complaints Authority (the PCA). But D retired from the force on              13jul)

   On 5 December 1996 a documentary programme called "Hillsborough’ was

disaster had come to light. The allegations made in the broadcast were                  powe
investigated by the Crown Prosecution Service (the CPS) between March and               condi
May 1997. At length, on 30 June 1997, the Home Secretary announced in                   proce

disaster which had not been available to Lord Taylor, or to the DPP or the
Attorney General for the purposes of their discharge of their statutory
responsibilities. Stuart-Smith LJ’s report (Scrutiny o f Evidence Relating to the             c
Hillsborough Football Stadium Disaster (Cm 3878) (1998)) was presented to                     c
the House of Commons on 18 February 1998. Chapter 1, paras 55-57 state:                       (
                                                                                              \
        ‘55. From my meetings with the bereaved families and their
      representatives, I am left in no doubt that there was widespread                          r
      disappointment at the DPP’s decision not to prosecute. They find it difficult             <
      to understand in the light of Lord Taylor’s trenchant criticisms of the South             <
      Yorkshire police and the fact that the force had been paying compensation.                I
      56. What the Director of Public Prosecutions had to bear in mind, however,
      is the significantly different and greater degree of culpability which is          Secti
      involved in manslaughter, or culpable misfeasance in public office, as against
      the degree of negligence which gives rise to liability, and compensation
      payments, under civil law. Any prosecution of an individual police officer
      would have to establish his individual responsibility. It would not be enough
      simply to prove the composite failure of the police operation. 57. The
      causes of the disaster were many and complex. So far as these two officers
      [D and M] were concerned, the prosecution would have to prove to the high
      standard required for a criminal conviction that the failure to give the order
QBDDC                 R v DPP, ex p Duckenfield (Laws LJ)                        877

    to close off the tunnel when Gate C was opened amounted to the serious
    degree of recklessness necessary to constitute manslaughter.’
Paragraph 5 of ch 7 (‘Summary’) stated:
      ‘. .. I have come to the clear conclusion that there is no basis upon which
    there should be a further judicial inquiry or a re-opening of Lord Taylor’s
    inquiry ... I do not consider that there is any material which should be placed
    before the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints
    Authority which might cause them to re-consider the decisions they have
    already taken.’
On the same day, 18 February 1998, the Home Secretary announced in the House
that he, the Attorney General and the DPP had very carefully considered
Stuart-Smith LJ’s report, and said: ‘We have no reason to doubt his conclusions.’
   The HFSG was clearly not satisfied with this result. There was first an abortive
attempt on 26 June 1998 by AA to institute criminal proceedings against D and M
in the South Sefton Petty Sessional Division. That was given its quietus on
technical or jurisdictional grounds into which it is unnecessary to go. Then on
13 July 1998 AA laid informations against them before the Leeds Petty Sessional
Division, and summonses were accordingly issued by the stipendiary magistrate.
The charges accuse D and M of the manslaughter of two o f those who died at
Hillsborough, John Anderson and James Aspinall. They also allege against both
an offence of ‘wilful neglect to perform a public duty'; and in the case of D, a
further offence o f attempting to pervert the course of justice, said to consist in his
having lied about the circumstances in which gate C at the football ground
became open.
   Both D and M made representations to the DPP that he should exercise his
power under s 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the
conduct of the proceedings initiated against them, and then discontinue the
proceedings under s 23(3) of the 1985 Act. In order to appreciate the contrary
positions being taken and the issues in the case, it is convenient to set out the
relevant statutory provisions at this stage.
   Section 3(2) of the 1985 Act provides, so far as relevant:
      ‘It shall be the duty of the Director ... (a) to take over the conduct of all
    criminal proceedings, other than specified proceedings, instituted on behalf
    of a police force (whether by a member of that force or by any other person);
    (b) to institute and have the conduct of criminal proceedings in any case
    where it appears to him that—(i) the importance or difficulty of the case
    makes it appropriate that proceedings should be instituted by him; or (ii) it is
    otherwise appropriate for proceedings to be instituted by him; (c) to take
    over the conduct of all binding over proceedings instituted on behalf of a
    police force ... (d) to take over the conduct of all proceedings begun by
    summons issued under s 3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 ...’
Section 6 provides:
      ‘(1) Subject to subsection (2) below, nothing in this Part shall preclude any
    person from instituting any criminal proceedings or conducting any criminal
    proceedings to which the Director’s duty to take over the conduct of
    proceedings does not apply.
      (2) W here criminal proceedings are instituted in circumstances in which
    the Director is not under a duty to take over their conduct, he may
    nevertheless do so at any stage.’
878                          All England Law Reports                  [1999] 2 All ER

Section 10(1) provides, so far as relevant:
        ‘The Director shall issue a Code for Crown Prosecutors giving guidance on
      general principles to be applied by them—(a) in determining, in any
      case—(i) whether proceedings for an offence should be instituted or, where
      proceedings have been instituted, whether they should be discontinued ...’
Section 23 provides, so far as relevant:
        ‘(1) Where the Director of Public Prosecutions has the conduct of
      proceedings for an offence, this section applies in relation to the preliminary
      stages of those proceedings.
        (2) In this section, ‘‘preliminary stage” in relation to proceedings for an
      offence does not include ... (b) in the case of an indictable offence, any stage
      of the proceedings after—(i) the accused has been committed for tria l...
        (3) Where, at any time during the preliminary stages of the proceedings,
      the Director gives notice under this section to the clerk of the court that he
      does not want the proceedings to continue, they shall be discontinued with
      effect from the giving of that notice
   Representations had first been made to the DPP on behalf of D and M in early
July 1998, after the commencement of the proceedings in the South Sefton Petty
Sessional Division which proved abortive. In the course of correspondence, the
HFSG again contended that it had discovered new evidence, which, it was said,
had not been before Lord Taylor, the DPP, the coroner, or Stuart-Smith LJ. At
length, after AA’s informations had been laid in the Leeds Petty Sessional
Division, the considered views of the DPP as to the approach to be taken to a
request to take over and discontinue a private prosecution were set out in a letter
to the HFSG on 27 July 1998. The letter did not contain a decision, but it
explained the DPP’s policy:
         ‘The policy where proceedings have been commenced by a private
       prosecutor builds on that contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The
       right to bring a private prosecution is preserved by s 6(1) ... subject to the
       power under s 6(2). The CPS will take over a private prosecution where
       there is a particular need for it do so on behalf of the public ... In the instant
       case where we have been asked by the defendants to take over the
       prosecution in order to discontinue it, we would do so if one (or more) of
       the following circumstances applies:
         • There is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution commenced in
       these circumstances would be unfounded, and would, therefore be an abuse
       of the right to bring a prosecution.
         • The public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those
      factors tending in favour.
         • The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests o f justice.
         The CPS would then regard itself as having to act in accordance with our
       policy. If none of the above apply there would be no need for the CPS to
       become involved and we would not interfere with the private prosecution.
       Clearly there is a distinction between the “realistic prospect o f conviction”
       test in the Code [the Code for Crown Prosecutors issued by the DPP under
       s 10 of the 1985 Act (CPS Annual Report 1993-4)] and the “clearly no case to
       answer” test mentioned above. Accordingly we recognise that there will be
       some cases which do not meet the CPS Code tests where nevertheless we
       will not intervene. It has been considered that to apply the Code tests to
QBD DC              R v DPP, ex p Duckenfield (Laws LJ)                          879

    private prosecutions would unfairly limit the right o f individuals to bring
    their own cases. Before this decision can properly be made the CPS must be
    assured that all relevant material has been considered ... Until there has been
    a detailed review of the many papers in the case the Crown’s position cannot
    be determ ined...’

   There followed very substantial representations from D and M and from the
HFSG. At length the DPP communicated his decision not to intervene, as I have
said, by letter of 18 December 1998. The letter merely stated:

      ‘We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties
    and all the relevant circumstances of the case. W e have concluded that we
    should not intervene to take over any of the charges.’

The respective solicitors for D and M asked for reasons to be given. There
followed a letter o f 1 February 1999 (the reasons letter) from the CPS’ casework
director to M’s solicitor from which it is necessary to cite at some length:

      ‘As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general
    principles applied by the Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to
    continue a prosecution it has taken over; or whether to institute proceedings,
    or whether to advise the police to do so. It is correct that the CPS decided
    in 1997 that the evidence available at that time was not sufficient, in its view,
    to provide a realistic prospect of the conviction of either your client or
    Mr Duckenfield for any offence. However, it does not follow that, when
    considering the evidence and the representations submitted by the private
    prosecutor, and by yourselves on behalf of your client, the CPS should seek
    merely to identify whether there is now any new evidence sufficient
    to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction. The decision whether to
    intervene in a private prosecution with a view to terminating it calls for
    different considerations to be applied. It is quite possible for a private
    prosecution to continue, notwithstanding that the CPS is not satisfied, on the
    basis of its own assessment of the strength of the evidence, that the evidence
    would pass the evidential sufficiency test in the Code (that there should be a
    “realistic prospect of a conviction”). In broad terms, the reason for this is that
    s 6(1) ... specifically preserved the right of private individuals and
    prosecuting authorities and bodies other than the CPS to bring criminal
    proceedings. This right is subject (among other limitations) to the limitation
    in s 6(2) that the CPS may nevertheless take over the proceedings with a
    view either to conducting or to terminating those proceedings. Private
    prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors when
    deciding whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the
    evidential sufficiency test in the Code when deciding whether there is a case
    to answer. The Service therefore recognises that it is not appropriate to
    intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That
    general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its
    Consultation Paper No 149 Criminal Law: Consents to Prosecution [1997]
    (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).’

The letter then proceeds to set out the DPP’s policy in the same terms as those in
which it had earlier been described by the three ‘bullet-points’ in the letter of
27 July 1998, save that it gives instances o f the 'public interest factors’ test as
follows:
880                         All England Law Reports                  [1999] 2 All ER

           . examples might be where the prosecution is malicious, or vexatious; or
      the offence is one for which the defendant should clearly have been
      cautioned; or where, although the offence may be serious, the defendant is
      terminally ill ... In this case, I took the decision not to intervene ...
      I concluded in respect of the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to
      perform a public duty (which, for the avoidance of doubt, were each
      considered against each individual separately) that I could not say that there
      is clearly no case to answer. It was not right, therefore, for the Service to take
      over the proceedings with a view to terminating them. I should add that,
      against that background and after specifically considering the appropriate
      course to take in these circumstances, I concluded further that it would not
      be right to intervene in respect of the one remaining charge against
      Mr Duckenfield, of attempting to pervert the course of justice, albeit I had
      formed the view that there was clearly no case to answer on that charge
      alone. The charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice is a serious
      one, particularly when levelled against someone who was, at the relevant
      time, a serving, senior police officer. Nevertheless, in the context of the case
      as a whole that charge is not the gravamen of the criminality alleged against
      Mr Duckenfield and I concluded that my approach to that charge should be
      led by my conclusions on the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to
      perform a public duty. I also considered whether, nevertheless, there were
      overriding public interest factors that should lead to the Service intervening
      with a view to discontinuance, but I came to the conclusion that any public
      interest factors tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in
      favour; nor did I consider that the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the
      interests of justice ...’
    The private prosecution of D and M presently stands adjourned in the
magistrates’ court. Committal proceedings were due to commence on
19 April 1999. But we understand that date has been vacated. There is a
directions hearing fixed for later in April. The matter was earlier before the
magistrates’ court on 21 December 1998, an occasion to which I should refer
because Mr Jones QC for AA contends that the applications in the first case have
not been made promptly, as RSC Ord 53 and the Supreme Court Act 1981 require
(Mr Havers QC for the DPP likewise so contends but only in relation to the
assault which is directed to the legality o f the DPP’s policy; he says, as is plainly
the fact, that D and M had notice of the policy by the letter of 27 July 1998). On
21 December it is said by AA that Mr Harrison QC for D and M indicated his
clients’ intention to seek leave to bring an application for judicial review against
the DPP’s decision, whatever the reasons for it (the reasons had not, of course, by
then been supplied). Mr Jones contends that the application for judicial review
could and should have been lodged then or very shortly thereafter. There is an
issue as to the context in which Mr Harrison said what he said to the magistrate.
It is clear from an affidavit sworn by M’s solicitor Mr Manning that Mr Harrison
took the view (as, if I may say so, one would expect) that he would have to
consider the DPP’s written reasons before finally advising as to a judicial review.
As at 21 December 1998 a reasons letter was expected before Christmas, and
Mr Harrison so informed the magistrate. In the event the reasons were not
delivered until 1 February 1999. These applications were lodged in the Crown
Office on 1 and 5 March 1999.
    In my judgment there is nothing in the delay point. It would have been
irresponsible to seek judicial review leave before the DPP’s reasons were
available. And the letter of 27 July 1998 could not have been a proper trigger to
     QBD DC             R v DPP, ex p Duckenfield (Laws LJj                          881

  seek leave; it contained no decision. It is true that a challenge only to the legality
a o f the policy need not strictly have awaited the DPP’s reasons for applying it as
  he decided to do; but since D and M, very obviously, were at least as interested
  in the application of the policy as in its legality, overall it was perfectly proper and
  reasonable to wait for the reasons letter before lodging any application for leave.

^    THE FIRST CASE: THE DECISION OF THE DPP
         I may now turn to the substantive arguments in the first case. The lead
     skeleton argument is that prepared on behalf of M, which is adopted by D who
     adds further submissions to challenge the distinct decision of the DPP not to take
     over and discontinue the charge against him of attempting to pervert the course
     o f justice. To that I will come in due course.
c
     Section 3(2)(b) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985
        The applicants’ first submission is that the DPP’s decision fails to pay any
     regard to his duty under s 3(2)(b), which I have set out. The submission is put
     thus:
gj
           T h e applicant’s point is that the policy and decision process in this case
         have not recognised that the s 3(2)(b) duty is relevant to the exercise of
         discretion whether to intervene under s 6(2) and apply s 23(3).’
  In the course of his oral submissions, Mr Harrison expanded this argument. He
e submitted that in deciding whether to take over and discontinue a private
  prosecution where the case is one o f ‘importance or difficulty’, the DPP should
  bear in mind that it is ordinarily his duty to institute and conduct such
  proceedings. Accordingly, as I understand it, the suggestion is that the DPP
  should in some way entertain a heightened concern where such a private
  prosecution is launched, and his policy in relation to the potential discontinuance
f o f such cases under s 23(3) of the 1985 Act should reflect this; presumably
  (for otherwise I cannot see how the argument can assist Mr Harrison) by leaning
  more favourably towards discontinuance than in other classes of case.
      In my judgment this is a bad argument. Section 3(2)(b) speaks only of the
  institution of proceedings by the DPP; contrast s 3(2)(a), (c), and (d), which
g require him to take over proceedings. Plainly the DPP would not institute
  proceedings with a view to discontinuance. Moreover, as Mr Havers submitted,
  had it been the legislature’s intention to require the DPP to treat ‘important or
  difficult’ cases in a different way from others for the purposes of ss 6(2) and 23(3),
  it could have readily so provided and it is to be supposed would have done so. In
, my judgm ent the right of private prosecution preserved by s 6(1) is in no way
  qualified by s 3(2)(b), which has nothing to do with the discretion to take over
  such a prosecution under s 6(2) with a view to discontinuance under s 23(3). I
  consider that this conclusion is lent support by the decision of the Divisional
  Court in R v Bow Street Stipendiary Magistrate, ex p South Coast Shipping Co Ltd
  [1993] 1 All ER 219 at 221-222, [1993] QB 645 at 650, in which Lloyd LJ said:
           ‘It will be noticed that s 3(2)(a) ... provide[s] for the Director to take over
         the conduct of certain kinds of proceedings. By contrast, s 3(2)(b) provides
         for the Director to institute certain other kinds of proceedings where it
         appears to him to be appropriate, having regard to the importance and the
         difficulty of the case. The difference in language is not, in my view,
         accidental. It becomes of crucial importance when one turns to s 6, which
         deals with private prosecutions ... The effect of s 6(1) is to preclude a person

template of a lawful policy to be adopted by the DPP for the execution of his duty
under ss 6(2) and 23(3) of the 1985 Act.

The Code for Crown Prosecutors
   The argument here, at least as originally put forward in M’s skeleton
argument, was that because o f his view (referred to in the reasons letter) that
private prosecutors are not bound to apply the code when deciding whether to
institute proceedings, the DPP has erroneously proceeded on the basis that the
principles in the code are irrelevant to his discretion under ss 6(2) and 23(3). But
the DPP has nowhere stated that he regards the code as systematically or
generally irrelevant to his power to discontinue. Indeed, as I shall show, there are
some aspects of the code which are reflected in his approach to the question, how
his policy should be applied in this case. In truth, however, it could not be right
for the DPP to apply across the board the same tests, in particular the ‘reasonable
prospect of conviction’ test referred to in the correspondence, in considering
whether to take over and discontinue a private prosecution as the code enjoins
crown prosecutors to follow in deciding whether to institute or proceed with a
prosecution themselves; the consequence would be that the DPP would stop a
private prosecution merely on the ground that the case is not one which he
would himself proceed with. But that, in my judgment, would amount to an
emasculation of s 6(1) and itself be an unlawful policy; and in fairness Mr Harrison
made it clear that he did not submit so much. The very premise of s 6(1) must be
that some cases will go to trial which the DPP himself chooses not to prosecute.
   As it seems to me the only points remaining in relation to the code concern the
application of the DPP’s policy to the facts of this case, and I will deal with that
shortly.

The ‘clearly no case to answer’ test
   The argument here is that such a test is impermissibly rigid. It is said that the
policy excludes ‘any assessment of evidential deficiencies’ and so amounts to an
unlawful fetter of the DPP’s discretion; and that it ‘also leads to a distorted
evaluation of the public interest factors’. In my judgm ent the test involves no
unlawful fetter of discretion. It is plain from the formulation ‘there is clearly no
case to answer’ (my emphasis) that the DPP only intends to stop private
prosecutions on this ground where no reasonable decision maker could conclude
that there was sufficient evidence for the case to go forward. Thar seems to me
to be a perfectly proper approach. Such a prosecution could offer no legitimate
benefit to anyone and would, potentially at least, be an abuse of the process of the
court. The test rightly identifies a class o f case which should always be stopped;
if the case is not within the class, then the decision whether to stop it will, of
course, depend on the other two tests which, in my judgment, amply
contemplate an exercise of discretion in which all material factors will be
considered and whose application accordingly negates any unlawful fetter of
discretion.
   As regards any ‘distorted evaluation’ of the public interest test, it is clear that
the three aspects of the policy are individually self-standing. Their respective
application in this case is another matter, to which as I have said I will come. But
the applicants have a separate argument about the public interest test.

The ‘public interest factors’ test
   Here it is submitted that the public interest necessarily involves consideration
of the likelihood of conviction, so that the evidential test should not be hived off
884                        All England Law Reports                  [1999] 2 All ER            QBD I


from that relating to the public interest. Mr Harrison also argues that the public             favour
 interest test as formulated: ‘the public interest factors tending against prosecution         nothin
 clearly outweigh those factors tending in favour’ gets it the wrong way round; the            forcefl
 test should be whether the public interest factors in favour of the private                   furthei
prosecution outweigh those against.                                                            I agree
    I see no reason why, quite aside from the evidential test of no case to answer,            existed
the DPP should not, widiin his policy as presently formulated, have in mind the                any pu
likelihood or otherwise of conviction when considering where the public interest               those i
lies. And I see no basis for the suggestion that the law should compel the DPP to              which
reverse the effect of the public interest factors so as to favour discontinuance               prosec
unless in his judgment they clearly point in the other direction. The test as                  Wedne
presently formulated seems to me designed to allow proper scope for the                        [1947]
operation of the right of private prosecution. The private prosecutor is very                  there 1
likely to take a different view as to where the public interest lies than does the             discon
DPP, and s 6(1), I think, implies that he is entitled to do so. The approach urged              dr "n.
by Mr Harrison would in effect require the private prosecutor to persuade the                  factors
DPP that his view of the public interest is plainly right. I consider it strongly              be clai
arguable that that would place an illegitimate constraint upon the right of private             the CF
prosecution; but it is enough to hold, as I would, that the present public interest             to 4 of
policy is perfectly consistent with the objects of the statute and thus well within
the proper discretion of the DPP.
    Mr Harrison directed similar criticisms to the third limb o f the policy, but in
                                                                                                    w
light of what I have said about the public interest test they possess no separate
force.                                                                                              p;

    For all these reasons, the DPP’s policy overall is in my judgment a lawful one.
                                                                                                    M

the application of the public interest test was crucial. In this context it is                      ti­
convenient to deal first with Mr Harrison’s submission that the reasons letter                      re
shows that the DPP has given improper and perhaps decisive weight to the                             d
‘no evidence’ test. He relies on the sentence which follows the conclusion that                     re

the proceedings with a view to terminating them’, and submits that it suggests                       ir
the author of the letter considered that that was the end of the matter. However                     (‘
after dealing with the particular issue concerning the charge against D of                           o

whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest factors that should                     tl

could have been better expressed, so as to make it clear that the public interest                    P

satisfied that there was no intention to downgrade or sideline the balance of                        o
public interest factors. It is not really credible to suppose that the author of the 1               Si

  Mr Harrison submitted that in light of everything that had gone before, and                        o
not least Stuart-Smith LJ’s Scrutiny (Scrutiny o f Evidence Relating to the Hilbborough              p
Football Stadium Disaster (Cm 3878) (1998)), there were no public interest factors
QBD DC              R v DPP, ex p Duckenfield (Laws LJ)                           885

favouring continuation of the prosecutions of D and M. He said that there is
nothing in the reasons letter to show that the DPP accepted the suggestion, urged
forcefully and at length by the HFSG in the course of their representations, that
farther evidence had come to light since the Scrutiny. W ith this latter proposition
I agree. But the reasons letter clearly implies an acceptance that some factors
existed which favoured the prosecutions. It stated: ‘I came to the conclusion that
any public interest factors tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh
those in favour’. W hat were those in favour? If in truth there were no factors
which a reasonable decision-maker could regard as going in favour of the
prosecutions, then the DPP’s decision would be vulnerable to a challenge on
Wednesbury grounds (see Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp
[1947] 2 All ER 680, [1948] 1 KB 223) (as indeed Mr Harrison claims it is) since
there would be nothing in public interest terms to weigh in the scales against
discontinuance. When the case was opened there was no affidavit from the DPP
dealing with the point, nor did Mr Havers’ skeleton argument articulate any such
factors. So it was that, effectively at the court’s invitation so that the matter could
be clarified, Mr Newell swore an affidavit for the DPP on 22 March 1999. He is
the CPS’ director of casework and the author of the reasons letter. Paragraphs 2
to 4 of Mr Newell’s affidavit are as follows:

      ‘2. As I now recall, the public interest factors tending against prosecution
    which I considered were as follows: (1) Previous reviews of the case, in
    particular those carried out by the DPP when considering the question
    whether criminal proceedings should be taken against Mr Duckenfield and
    Mr Murray and the more recent report of Lordjustice Stuart-Smith. (2) The
    fact that the Applicants had been told on previous occasions that the DPP did
    not intend to prosecute. (3) The delay which had occurred between the
    commission of the alleged offences and the commencement of this
    prosecution and its likely effect on the Applicants, although I took the view
    that delay may be offset by the seriousness of the alleged offences (as is
    reflected in paragraph 6.5(d) of the Code ...). (4) The effect of the delay on
    the evidence, for example in terms of the potential impairment of the
    recollections of witnesses. (5) The assertion made on behalf of Mr Murray
    of ill-health, although I noted that no medical evidence had been put forward
    in support of this assertion and that, as again reflected in the Code
    (at paragraph 6.5(e)), ill-health may be offset by the seriousness of the
    offence. 3. As against these factors tending against prosecution, there was
    in my view one extremely important factor in favour of prosecution, namely
    the very serious nature of the alleged offences, in particular, the alleged
    offences of manslaughter. In my opinion, the allegation that two senior
    police officers were responsible for the deaths of a number of people as a
    result of criminal negligence was a very grave allegation. 4. Paragraph 6.2
    of the Code reflects the considerable weight attached by the CPS to the
    seriousness of the alleged offence when seeking to strike the right balance as
    to the factors for and against prosecution. (I refer also to the opening words
    of paragraph 6.4.) Having carefully considered the factors tending against
    prosecution and this extremely important factor in favour of it, I came to the
    firm conclusion that the factors tending against prosecution did not clearly
    outweigh what I considered to be the very strong public interest in favour of
    prosecution.’
886                       All England Law Reports                 [1999] 2 All ER

   One of Mr Harrison’s complaints, advanced before this affidavit was sworn,
was that the policy should have taken account of para 10.1 of the code, which
includes this:

        ‘Normally, if the Crown Prosecution Service tells a suspect or defendant
      that there will not be a prosecution ... that is the end of the matter ... But
      occasionally there are special reasons why the Crown Prosecution Service ^
      will re-start the prosecution, particularly if the case is serious.’

This is one of the points relating to the code which, as it seems to me, bear on the
application of the policy rather than the policy itself; and para 2(2) of Mr Newell’s
affidavit shows that regard was had to assurances or statements made to D and M
that, for his part, the DPP would not prosecute. Clearly it was right to do so,         c
within the public interest balance. But I think there is a qualitative difference
between the situation where the DPP himself goes back upon a previous
assurance not to prosecute and one where the DPP does not change his mind but
a private prosecutor chooses to instigate proceedings.
    In reply, having by then seen Mr Newell’s affidavit, Mr Harrison made further       ^
submissions. While accepting that there could be a case in which a single factor
favouring prosecution might not be outweighed by a multiplicity of factors going
the other way, he submitted that if the raft of public interest considerations
favouring discontinuance in this case was held not to be enough to outweigh the
single factor of the allegations’ gravity, it was difficult or impossible to imagine
what set of considerations might do so; and the court should conclude that the          e
DPP had fettered his discretion by treating the seriousness of the allegations as
overriding everything else, so that he had not in truth carried out a proper
balancing exercise at all.
    I would reject this argument. There is no reason to suppose that the factors
against prosecution were not properly weighed and considered, and certainly no          f
basis for the supposition that, once faced with a private prosecution for
something as serious as manslaughter, the DPP would inevitably decide to allow
it to proceed.
    Mr Harrison submitted next that Mr Newell’s affidavit showed that the DPP
had transposed from the code the ‘seriousness of the charge’ factor as a
consideration favouring the prosecution without also taking account of his own          &
view that the code test o f ‘realistic prospect of conviction’ was not met. I agree
that the DPP’s view of the prospects of conviction is a proper matter for him to
consider, within the public interest test contained in the policy, when deciding
whether to discontinue; but, as it seems to me, para 2(1) of Mr Newell’s affidavit
shows that in this case he has done so.                                                 h
    Then Mr Harrison suggested that para 3 of the affidavit demonstrated that the
DPP’s view of the gravity of the allegation was informed simply by the fact that
there was a manslaughter charge. He had not properly considered the real degree
of culpability inherent in the facts alleged; and the gravity of the offence of
manslaughter can vary very widely. There is nothing in this. Mr Newell made it          j
perfectly clear that he had regard to the species of manslaughter in question
(‘criminal negligence’) and it cannot sensibly be doubted that he was well aware
and took account of the circumstances in which the alleged offences are said to
have been committed.
    Lastly on this part of the case, Mr Harrison submitted that the refusal to
discontinue was simply perverse, given the ‘enormous weight’ of the public
interest considerations going the other way.
QBD DC              R v DPP, ex p Duckenfield (Laws LJ)                           887

   The DPP might, in my judgment, lawfully have decided to discontinue. The
tragic events at Hillsborough have been the subject of repeated, detailed,
thorough inquiries. Nearly ten years have passed. But the judgment was for the
DPP to make. If we acceded to Mr Harrison’s submission, we would I think
usurp the role of the primary decision-maker.
   In my judgm ent the decision not to discontinue is no more unlawful than is the
policy which the DPP applied.

The first applicant: attempting to pervert the course o f justice
   Mr Harrison discretely submits that the decision to let the charge of attempting
to pervert the course of justice go ahead was unlawful, because it runs flat
counter to the ‘no case to answer’ test in his own policy. It will be recalled that
the reasons letter said:
      ‘I concluded further that it would not be right to intervene in respect of the
    one remaining charge against Mr Duckenfield, of attempting to pervert the
    course of justice, albeit I had formed the view that there was clearly no case
    to answer on that charge alone ... in the context of the case as a whole that
    charge is not the gravamen of the criminality alleged against Mr Duckenfield
    and I concluded that my approach to that charge should be led by my
    conclusions on the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a
    public duty.’
Paragraphs 5 and 6 of Mr Newell’s affidavit state:
      ‘5. I was fully aware of the seriousness of the additional charge. I also
    tentatively concluded that partial intervention ... was in law open to the CPS
    and I proceeded on that assumption. However, the existing policy did not
    cover the situation which arose in this case, namely where the conclusion
    was reached that there was clearly a case to answer in relation to some of the
    charges but not in relation to others. (I can say that with some confidence,
    since I had overall responsibility for formulating the policy.)... I concluded
    that it was in fact inappropriate to intervene only to take over (with a view
    to discontinuing) this additional charge. 6. First, partial intervention was
    not, in my view, either appropriate or desirable. It seemed to me that the
    DPP should either intervene so as to take over the proceedings in their
    entirety or not at all. To have intervened partially would still have left the
    criminal proceedings in place in relation to the other charges which included
    the even more serious charge of manslaughter. Secondly, I took into
    account the fact that Mr Duckenfield would not be left without any remedy
    in relation to this additional charge. On the contrary, he would be entitled
    to invite the Magistrates’ Court to dismiss it on the basis that there was no
    case to answer. Thirdly, the charge arose out of essentially the same events
    as the events which gave rise to the other charges and thus those events
    would be scrutinised in any event.’
   I of course accept that Mr Newell did not subjectively believe—or intend—that
the policy covered this situation. But the policy has to be read objectively; there
can be no doubt that it gave rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of D and
M that it would be applied according to its terms. The first question, then, is as
to the true meaning of the policy on a fair reading of the letter of 27 July 1998 and
the reasons letter. It is true that the letters use the singular: ‘the prosecution’ and
‘a private prosecution’. But it is elementary that in criminal cases each count
constitutes a separate indictment; it is as if there are separate trials relating to
888                       All England Law Reports                 [1999] 2 All ER

each. And this is no mere technicality; for it means, of course, that where there
is more than one charge any question whether there is ‘no case to answer’ is, as
regards each individual charge, wholly discrete. I do not consider that the policy
can fairly be read as indicating that the DPP would necessarily either take over or
discontinue a private prosecution in its entirety. In my view the articulation of
the ‘no case to answer’ test would be taken by any informed reader, facing a
multiple private prosecution, to imply that the DPP would consider whether in
his view there was clearly no case to answer on each charge.
   The DPP concluded that there was clearly no such case in relation to this
charge against D, and yet decided to allow it to proceed. It follows, in my
judgment, that there is a breach of D’s legitimate expectation that the policy
would be applied. The pragmatic factors spoken to by Mr Newell in para 6 can
make no difference. Nor, of course, can the vigorous assertion by the HFSG that
there is in fact a case to answer. W hat matters for present purposes is the DPP’s
conclusion on that issue.
   For these reasons I would quash the DPP’s decision only so far as it relates to
this charge against D. I make it clear that I say nothing as to what might follow
as regards any further decision concerning that charge to be made by the DPP.
   Otherwise, for the reasons I have given I would dismiss the application in the
first case.

THE SECOND CASE: THE DECISION OF THE SYPA
   First 1 should describe the further facts which are specifically relevant to the
second case. These must be read into the narrative of events which I have already
given in relation to the first case; it seems to me clearer and more convenient to
isolate here the particular facts which bear on the challenge to the decision of the
SYPA.
   The history shows that at earlier stages the SYPA had been prepared to provide
financial support for D and M (and other officers) to be legally represented in
matters arising from the Hillsborough disaster. On 7 December 1990 they
resolved to fund the representation of six police officers, including D and M, at
the inquest. They had earlier resolved not to do so; the decision of 7 December
was taken after considering ‘the most recent legal advice available’. Then on
1 August 1997 the SYPA resolved to set aside £500,000 for financial assistance for
police officers in connection with Stuart-Smith LJ’s Scrutiny (Scrutiny o f Evidence
Relating to the Hillsborough Football Stadium Disaster (Cm 3878) (1998)). In both
instances they had considered a report from the chief constable (or a joint report
of the chief constable and the clerk and treasurer). The latter decision was said to
be taken ‘in accordance with the principles set out in Home Office
circular 77/1987 (Financial Assistance to Police Officers in Legal Proceedings), to
which I will have to refer.
   On 27 February 1998, following publication of the Scrutiny, and considering
that ‘there were indications that private prosecutions could be brought against
three officers’, the SYPA resolved in principle to authorise consideration being
given to applications by officers for financial assistance. On 5 March 1998 D’s
application for such assistance was approved by the SYPA, and M’s was approved
on 29 June 1998. It will be recalled that three days earlier, on 26 June, AA had first
sought to institute criminal proceedings against D and M in the South Sefton
Petty Sessional Division. On 20 November 1998 M applied for further financial
assistance in relation to the judicial review which was then seen to be in prospect
should the DPP decide to allow the private prosecutions to continue; and the
HFSG had made it clear that were the DPP to take over the prosecutions and
QBD DC              R v DPP, ex p Duckenfield (Laws LJ)                           889

discontinue, they would seek a judicial review. On 21 December 1998 counsel
for D and M indicated to the stipendiary magistrate their intention to seek a
judicial review of the DPP’s decision; I have already referred to this in dealing
with Mr Jones’ misconceived argument that the first case should be dismissed on
grounds of delay. The following day, 22 December 1998, in a letter of over six
pages, AA made written representations on leading counsel’s advice to urge the
SYPA that the decision to fund the defences of D and M was ‘unlawful, irrational,
ultra vires and procedurally improper on various grounds’. On 23 December 1998
D applied for further financial assistance in relation to the prospective judicial
review proceedings. On 5 January 1999 AA wrote a further lengthy letter to the
SYPA repeating and expanding her assertions that the funding decisions were
unlawful.
    Then on 5 February 1999 the SYPA passed the resolutions under challenge,
‘that, on balance, the Authority has no legal power to provide financial assistance’
to D and M in respect either of the private prosecution or a judicial review of the
DPP’s decision. On 10 February 1999 the CCSY’s application for judicial review
in these proceedings was lodged, and on the same day solicitors for the SYPA
wrote to the Crown Office to consent to the grant of leave and seek expedition.
They stated: ‘SYPA passed these resolutions with great reluctance on the basis of
advice received from ourselves and C ounsel...’
   The legality or otherwise of the decisions under challenge ultimately turns on
the construction and application of s 6(1) of the Police Act 1996 and s 111(1) of the
Local Government Act 1972. I shall have to look at other statutory provisions,
but it is convenient to set these out at once. The sidenote to s 6 of the 1996 Act
reads: ‘General functions of police authorities’, and sub-s (1) provides: ‘Every
police authority established under section 3 shall secure the maintenance of an
efficient and effective police force for its area.’ Section 111(1) of the 1972 Act, in
its present form, provides:
      ‘Without prejudice to any powers exercisable apart from this section but
    subject to the following provisions of this Act, a local authority shall have
    power to do any thing (whether or not involving expenditure, borrowing or
    lending of money or the acquisition or disposal of any property or rights)
    which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge
    of their functions.’
   Section 111(1) applies to police authorities (but in light of my ccncl ii3ions it is
unnecessary to go into the legislative history relating to that). Now, it might be
thought—indeed this is the applicants’ case—that by s 6(1) of the 1996 Act,
securing ‘the maintenance of an efficient and effective police force’ is plainly
made the function of a police authority, and that accordingly it is no less plain that
s 111(1) of the 1972 Act empowers the police authority to do such things as fund
the legal representation of police officers in proceedings if the authority
reasonably concludes that to do so is conducive to that function’s discharge. That
has been the settled view of the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Police
Superintendents Association, and (until 1998) the Home Office. The decision to
provide such finance, in common with any decision taken under s 111(1), would
of course be subject to well-known public law constraints enshrined in the
Wednesbury and Padfield principles (see Padfield v M inister o f Agriculture Fisheries
and Food [1968] 1 All ER 694, [1968] AC 997). There is before the court an affidavit
of Mr Daines, assistant chief constable of South Yorkshire, in which he describes
what he regards as the ‘absolutely vital’ requirement ‘that officers should know
that if they act in good faith in performing their duties their Police Authority will
890                        All England Law Reports                  [1999] 2 All ER               QBD C

support them in the event that they face litigation’. If, as a matter of vires, s 111(1)         The
allows a police authority to incur expenditure in furtherance of the general                 a betwee
function seemingly conferred by s 6(1), then in my judgm ent the use of s 111(1)               authori
to finance police officers’ legal expenses in litigation, including private
prosecutions brought against them and the bringing of judicial review
proceedings, cannot in principle be ruled unlawful on Wednesbury or Padfield                          an
grounds. The circumstances in which such funding might be provided in any                                 (
particular case is another matter. The policy has, in the past, been to the effect                    thi
that the authority must be satisfied that the officer has acted in good faith in the                  sei
discharge of his duty; and I can see that, at least where a private prosecution is                (Sectio
involved, there may be issues for the authority to consider which would involve                   the pol

we are not concerned with any question whether, when, or to what extent, the
SYPA might provide financial assistance to D or M. We are only to decide
whether the power exists to do so at all.                                                               i
   In fact the argument of the CCSY was put two ways by Mr Baker QC. It was                            di
first said that s 6(1) of itself, without the aid of s 111(1), enabled the funding                Sectio:
decision. Alternatively, it was enabled by s 111(1) read with s 6(1).
   Upon this issue Miss Baxendale QC for the SYPA submits that the apparently
obvious relation between s 6(1) and s 111(1) is in fact no relation at all. The                        fii
essence of her argument may be expressed very shortly, as follows.                                     b;
   (a) Section 6(1) confers no powers of any kind. All the powers possessed by                     The i
police authorities are conferred elsewhere in the 1996 Act and by the local                        Sectio
government legislation. Section 6(1) does no more than to provide the purpose
for which the authority’s powers are to be exercised; it states the Act’s ‘policy and
objects’, in the language of Padfield’s case, as they apply to police authorities. If                  tl
this is right, it would contradict Mr Baker’s first argument, that s 6(1) alone is                     a
enough to empower the SYPA to fund D and M.                                                            e
   (b) Section 111(1) cannot be read as enabling the authority to do anything                      Sectic
which is not ancillary to a power which is elsewhere conferred upon it. If this is
right, then taken with (a) it contradicts Mr Baker’s second argument which relies
o n s 111(1).
   There is no doubt that express powers are conferred on police authorities by a
                                                                                                   As re
raft of statutory provisions. Miss Baxendale says that such provisions support
                                                                                         9    g    of th<
proposition (a) which I have set out, by application of the canon of statutory
construction expressed by the Latin maxim ‘expressio unius est exclusio alterius’.                 Sectii
Thus, she submits, where Parliament has seen fit to confer a range of specific
powers on police authorities, the intention must have been thereby to set the
limits on what such an authority may do and it cannot be supposed that s 6(1)
provides an undefined and open-ended power to do anything else which the                      h           <
authority may choose, merely on the ground that in some way it may be said to                       Secti
support the general aim of ‘the maintenance of an efficient and effective police
force’. The high-water mark of this submission is found in s 88(4) of the 1996 Act
which confers an express power to fund police officers’ costs in certain
circumstances which do not include the defence of private (or any) criminal j
                                                                                                  J The
prosecutions or participation in proceedings for judicial review.                                   folio
   I shall have to look in a little more detail at s 88(4). I have concluded, however,
that the correctness or otherwise of proposition (a) is not in the end at the centre of
the case. The reason is that, in the particular statutory context, proposition (b) is in
my judgment wrong; so that the SYPA is enabled by s 111(1) (subject to Wednesbury
and Padfield principles) to finance D and M in the criminal and judicial review
proceedings even if s 6(1) confers no powers as such.

    The scheme of the 1996 Act involves the distribution of responsibilities
a between three bodies: the chief constable, the Secretary of State, and the police
  authority. The chief constable’s role is principally given by s 10:
           ‘(1) A police force maintained under section 2 shall be under the direction
         and control of the chief constable appointed under section 11.
           (2)            In discharging his functions, every chief constable shall have regard to
b        the local policing plan issued by the police authority for his area under
         section 8.’
     (Section 11 provides for the appointment and removal of the chief constable, by
     the police authority with the approval of the Secretary of State.) I should notice
     also ss 22(1) and 44(4). Section 22(1) provides:
C
           ‘Every chief constable shall, as soon as possible after the end of each
         financial year, submit to the police authority a general report on the policing
         during that year of the area for which his force is maintained.’
     Section 44 (4) provides:
           ‘Every chief constable shall, as soon as possible after the end of each
         financial year, submit to the Secretary of State the like report as is required
         by section 22(1) to be submitted to the police authority.'
  The role of the Secretary of State is principally given by ss 36 and 37(1).
e Section 36(1) provides:
           ‘The Secretary of State shall exercise his powers under the provisions of
         this Act referred to in subsection (2) in such manner and to such extent as
         appears to him to be best calculated to promote the efficiency and
         effectiveness of the police.’
^ Section 37(1) provides:
         ‘The Secretary of State may by order determine objectives for thepolicing of the
         areas of all police authorities established under section 3.’
     As regards the Secretary of State’s position, I should notice also these provisions
g    of the 1996 Act.
     Section 38(1):
           ‘Where an objective has been determined under section 37, the Secretary
         of State may direct police authorities to establish levels of performance
fa       (“performance targets”) to be aimed at in seeking to achieve the objective.’
     Section 39(1):
           ‘The Secretary of State may issue codes of practice relating to the discharge
         by police authorities established under section 3 of any of their functions.’
J The role of the police authority is given first by the subsections of s 6 which
  follow sub-s (1):
           ‘(2) In discharging its functions, every police authority established under
         section 3 shall have regard to—(a) any objectives determined by the
         Secretary of State under section 37, (b) any objectives determined by
         the authority under section 7, (c) any performance targets established by the
         authority, whether in compliance with a direction under section 38 or
892                        All England Law Reports                 [1999] 2 All ER

      otherwise, and (d) any local policing plan issued by the authority under
      section 8.                                                                    a
        (3) In discharging any function to which a code of practice issued under
      section 39 relates, a police authority established under section 3 shall have
      regard to the code.
        (4) A police authority shall comply with any direction given to it by the
      Secretary of State under section 38 or 40.'                                   b

These provisions, of course, confer duties rather than powers. In relation to the
police authority I should next notice ss 7 to 9. Those sections provide:

         ‘7.—(1) Every police authority established under section 3 shall, before
      the beginning of each financial year, determine objectives for the policing of     c
      the authority’s area during that year.
         (2) Objectives determined under this section may relate to matters to
      which objectives determined under section 37 also relate, or to other
      matters, but in any event shall be so framed as to be consistent with the
      objectives determined under that section.
         (3) Before determining objectives under this section, a police authority
      shall—(a) consult the chief constable for the area, and (b) consider any views
      obtained by the authority in accordance with arrangements made under
      section 96.
         8.—(1) Every police authority established under section 3 shall, before the     e
      beginning of each financial year, issue a plan setting out the proposed
      arrangements for the policing of the authority’s area during the year (“the
      local policing plan").
         (2) The local policing plan shall include a statement of the authority’s
      priorities for the year, of the financial resources expected to be available and
      of the proposed allocation of those resources, and shall give particulars          f
      of—(a) any objectives determined by the Secretary of State under section 37,
      (b) any objectives determined by the authority under section 7, and (c) any
      performance targets established by the authority, whether in compliance
      with a direction under section 38 or otherwise.
         (3) A draft of the local policing plan shall be prepared by the chief           g
      constable for the area and submitted by him to the police authority for it to
      consider.
         (4) Before issuing a local policing plan which differs from the draft
      submitted by the chief constable under subsection (3), a police authority shall
      consult the chief constable.                                                       ft
         (5) A police authority shall arrange for every local policing plan issued by
      it under this section to be published in such manner as appears to it to be
      appropriate, and shall send a copy of the plan to the Secretary of State.
         9.—(1) As soon as possible after the end of each financial year every police
      authority established under section 3 shall issue a report relating to the         y
      policing of the authority’s area for the year.
         (2) A report issued by a police authority under this section for any year
      shall include an assessment of the extent to which the local policing plan for
      that year issued under section 8 has been carried out.
         (3) A police authority shall arrange for every report issued by it under this
      section to be published in such manner as appears to it to be appropriate, and
      shall send a copy of the report to the Secretary of State.’

Section 14 is important:
      ‘(1) Each police authority established under section 3 shall keep a fund to
    be known as the police fund.
      (2) Subject to any regulations under the Police Pensions Act 1976, all
    receipts of the police authority shall be paid into the police fund and all
    expenditure of the authority shall be paid out of that fund.
      (3) Accounts shall be kept by each police authority of payments made into
    or out of the police fund.'
Then s 43(1):
      ‘A police authority shall, whenever so required by the Secretary of State,
    submit to the Secretary of State a report on such matters connected with the
    discharge of the authority's functions, or otherwise with the policing of its
    area, as may be specified in the requirement.'
Section 92, so far as material, provides:
      ‘(1) The council of a county, district, county borough or London borough
    may make grants to any police authority established under section 3 whose
    police area falls wholly or partly within the county, district, county borough
    or borough ...
      (3) Grants under this section may be made unconditionally or, with the
    agreement of the chief officer of police for the police area concerned, subject
    to conditions.’
Section 96 provides:
      ‘(1) Arrangements shall be made for each police area for
    obtaining—(a) the views of people in that area about matters concerning the
    policing of the area, and (b) their co-operation with the police in preventing
    crime in that area.
      (2) Except as provided by subsections (3) to (6), arrangements for each
    police area shall be made by the police authority after consulting the chief
    constable as to the arrangements that would be appropriate.'
   Looking at the whole picture displayed by these provisions, it is clear that the
chief constable is in charge of day-to-day policing (s 10(1)); the police authority
has a role in relation to policy, or strategy (ss 7, 8 and other provisions): but this
is subject to the overall direction of the Secretary of State (ss 37, 38, 39 and other
provisions, taken with s 6(2) to (4)). The police authority holds the purse (s 14).
Those provisions, specifically concerned with the police authority’s role, confer
duties rather than powers, though in some cases there is clearly a discretion as to
how the duty is to be performed (as for example under s 37). Other powers
(including those contained in s 111(1)) are conferred on the police authority by
the local government legislation, to the extent that measures there contained
were applied to police authorities by s 146A(1) of the 1972 Act. The powers so
conferred are listed in a helpful note provided by Miss Baxendale. I do not
propose to set them out. They include (apart from s 111(1)) such matters as the
disposition and treatment of staff and the acquisition and disposal of land.
   The critical point which in my judgm ent emerges from a consideration of the
interlocking roles of chief constable, Secretary of State and police authority, is
that it cannot have been within the contemplation of Parliament in enacting the
scheme, and in embracing within it s 111(1), that the police authority should only
be empowered to incur expenditure in support of those duties, and ancillary
894                        All England Law Reports                 [1999] 2 All ER           QBD D(

         satisfied that the officer has acted in this way, the authority should provide
a        or fund legal advice and / or representation.’

       On 17 February 1998 Home Office circular 4/1998 was published. Unlike its
    predecessor, it sits on the fence as regards the power of a police authority to fund
    defences to private prosecutions. It has no persuasive effect one way or the other
^   upon the issues in these proceedings. The earlier circular, though obviously not
    a source of law, may possibly possess some force as regards the purposes to be
    fulfilled by s 6(l)’s predecessor, in s 4(1) of the 1964 Act: see Bristol DC v Clark
    [1975] 3 All ER976, [1975] 1 WLR 1443 perScarman LJ, referred to in E xp Wibon.
    But there are great dangers in treating government pronouncements, however
    helpful, as an aid to statutory construction. I would prefer to base my conclusion,
C   that s 111(1) in principle empowers the SYPA to support D and M’s defence (and
    their participation in the judicial review against the DPP), upon those
    considerations touching the correct construction of the material statutory
    provisions which I have already set out.
       If Cresswell and Latham JJ agree with this conclusion, it is enough to dispose
^   of the case in the applicants’ favour. However we heard much argument on the
    question whether s 6(1) conferred on the police authority any power, in any
    circumstances, to take action not otherwise expressly authorised. This engages
    Miss Baxendale's proposition (a) as I have described it, and her reliance on the
    ‘expressio unius est exclusio alterius’ doctrine. It only has relevance if I am wrong
    to hold, as I have done, that s 111(1) in principle enables the SYPA to fund D and
6   M even if s 6(1) does not itself empower the authority to do anything. In this
    context I will deal only (and that shortly) with s 88(4) of the 1996 Act, which as I
    have said is the high-water mark of this part of Miss Baxendale's argument.
       Section 88 contains a comprehensive scheme as to liability on the part of the
    police for torts. By sub-s (1) the chief officer of police for a police area is liable in
f   respect of torts committed by constables under his direction and control in the
    performance or purported performance of their functions. W ithout this
    provision there would be no such liability because police officers are not servants
    but office holders. Subsection (2) provides in part:

           'There shall be paid out of the police fund—(a) any damages or costs
g       awarded against the chief officer of police in any proceedings brought against
         him by virtue of this section and any costs incurred by him in any such
         proceedings so far as not recovered by him in the proceedings ...’

    Subsection (4) provides:
L

           ‘A police authority may, in such cases and to such extent as appear to it to
        be appropriate, pay out of the police fund—(a) any damages or costs
        awarded against a person to whom this subsection applies in proceedings for
        a tort committed by that person, (b) any costs incurred and not recovered by
        such a person in such proceedings, and (c) any sum required in connection
J       with the settlement of a claim that has or might have given rise to such
        proceedings.’

    In my judgm ent this provision offers no support for Miss Baxendale’s reliance on
    the ‘exclusio alterius' rule. Section 88 is self-standing. It has no implications for
    the general reach of the police authority’s functions. And once s 88(4) was to
    allow the police authority to cover damages awarded against an officer in a tort
    action, it is no surprise that it covers costs as well. If it did not, there might well
896                       All England Law Reports                [1999] 2 All ER               HL

be an argument—based on the ‘exclusio alterius’ rule—that costs were
deliberately excluded.                                                                    a
   In all these circumstances I do not think it necessary to go into the legislative
history of s 6(1) of the 1996 Act, or to canvass the arguments which were                       HOUSE
addressed to us as to the construction or effect of its predecessor, s 4(1) of the              LORD B
1964 Act. In the end there are two possibilities: s 6(1) empowers the police                    OF CRA
authority to do things, or it does not. I have so far proceeded on the assumption         b     26, 27 0   <

asserted by Miss Baxendale that it does not; but given that assumption,
nevertheless for reasons I have sought to explain, the SYPA possesses in principle
                                                                                                Boundc
the legal power to fund D and M.

   In fact I think the better view is that s 6(1) enables the police authority to do
                                                                                                bounda
things which reasonably support the function which s 6(1) confers. Such a power
is by no means open-ended. It would not allow the authority to invade the
provinces of the chief constable or the Secretary of State; and this is an important      °      In 197!

                   Adlington - v - David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray

    Ruling

    This case concerns the tragic events which took place on the 15 April 1989 during a

    F A. Cup Semi-Final Soccer Match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at

    Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

    Play was stopped after 6 mins when it was realised that Liverpool Spectators on the

    Standing Terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground had been seriously

    crushed. 95 people died, over 400 required hospital treatment. In 1993 a 96m victim
    died.



    There followed a series of investigations and other enquiries. L.J. Taylor conducted

    a public enquiry for which the West Midlands police collected a large amount of

    evidence.    The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) considered criminal charges

    against police officers and others.    The Police Complaints Authority considered

    complaints against senior police officers.   There was a coroner’s inqyest whose

    conduct was itself later considered by the Divisional Court. These enquiries and the

    inquest and the hearing in the Divisional Court covered the period from 1989 to

    1993.    L.J. Stuart-Smith carried out a scrutiny in 1997, the conclusions of which I

    shall return to later.



    Private prosecutions began in Leeds Magistrates’ Court in July of 1998 with the

    laying of informations against David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray.               Each

    defendant now faces two allegations of manslaughter and an              allegation of

    misfeasance of public office.   David Duckenfield also faced a further allegation of
    perverting the course of justice which in the meantime has been discharged.        The

    Defendant’s first appeared at Leeds Magistrates’ Court on the 20 August 1998 when

    it was made clear that a section 6(1) ’old style' committal would be necessary in this

    case.    It subsequently became apparent that the defendants would make an
    application to stay these proceedings on the grounds that in all the circumstances

    they are so unfair as to amount to an abuse of process. This application has now

    been made and has been taken as a preliminary and discrete point before the

    committal proceedings.     I have heard evidence and submissions taking five days
                                                                                  flu. / /JU




from Monday 5m to Friday 9!;i July. I have taken time to consider my ruling and give
it today Thursday 15lh July.



The Law



It was agreed by Counsel that the Magistrates' Court whether conducting a summary

trial or acting as examining magistrates has power to stay proceedings on the basis
of an abuse of process.        I have been referred to numerous authorities on this topic

and I am most grateful to all Counsel for their assistance.                The power of the

magistrates' court has been refined over the years.             In R - v - Derby Crown Court

ex-parte Brooks (1984) 80CR.APP.R.164, the Lord Chief Justice said at page 168



"The p o w e r to stop a prosecution arises only when it is an abuse o f the process o f

the court.     It m a y be an abuse o f process if either a) the prosecution have

m anipulated o r m isused the process o f the court so as to deprive the defendant o f a
protection p rovid e d by the law o r to take unfair advantage o f a technicality, o r b) on

the balance o f probability the defendant has been o r will be prejudiced in the

preparation o r conduct o f his defence by delay on the p a rt o f the prosecution which

is unjustifiable.     F o r example, not due to the complexity o f the enquiry and

preparation o f the prosecution case, o r to the action o f the defendant o r his co­

accused, o r the genuine difficulty in affecting service.         We doubt whether the other
epithets v/hich are sometimes used in relation to delay, such as "unconscionable”,

"inordinate” o r noppressive" do more than add an emotive tone to an already

sufficiently difficult problem ."



Further assistance was given in the case of R - v - Telford Justices ex-parte Badhan

(1991) 2Q.B.78 when Mann L.J. said at page 90



"W e emphasise that the p o w e r which the Justices have is one to prevent an abuse o f
process.     They have no p o w e r to refuse to em bark on an enquiry because they think

that a prosecution should not have been brought because it is fo r example, ”mean-
m in d e d ", "petty”, o r em anated by personal hostility.      It is for this reason that the
p o w e rs o f the ju stice s are said to be "very strictly confined"."




                                                                                               2

     and cn page 91



     "as in a case o f delay, we think the onus will normally be on the accused to show

     that on the balance o f probability a fair trial is now impossible. H ow the accused is to

     discharge the onus upon him m ust depend on all the circumstances o f the case.

     Thus,    he    m a y find his       task more   difficult in a case   wholly dependent on

     contem porary and available documents than he would in a case such as is the

     p rese n t which is dependent wholly upon a late complaint and oral testimony. ".



     In R - V - Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court ex parte Bennett (1994) 1A.C.42

     House of Lords, Lord Griffiths gave yet further guidance to the Magistrates' Court at

     page 62. He said



     "the p o w e r h a s recently and m ost comprehensively been considered and affirmed by
     the divisional court (in the Badhan case.) Provided it is appreciated b y magistrates

     that this is a power to be most sparingly exercised, o f which they have received more

     than sufficient ju d ic ia l v /a m in g    it appears to me to be a beneficial developm ent

     and I am unpersuaded that there are any sufficient reasons to overrule a long line o f

     authority developed b y successive Lord C hief Justices and Judges in the Divisional

     Court who are daily in much closer touch with the work in the m agistrates’ court than

     y o u r Lordships.       N o r do I see any force in an argum ent developed by the

     respondents which sought to equate abuse o f process with contem pt o f court.             I

     w ould accordingly affirm the p o w e r o f the magistrates whether sitting as committing

     ju s tic e s o r exercising their sum m ary jurisdiction, to exercise control over their

     proceedings through an abuse o f process jurisdiction.            However, in the case o f

     m agistrates this p o w e r should be strictly confined to matters directly affecting the
     fairness o f the trial o f the particular accused with whom they are dealing, such as

     delay o r unfair manipulation o f court procedures.       Although it m ay be convenient to

     label the w id e r supervisory jurisdiction with which we are concerned in this appeal

     u nder the h e a d o f abuse o f process, it is in fact a horse o f a very different colour

     from    the n a rro w e r issues that arise when considering domestic criminal trial

     procedures".




                                                                                               3

     The one fundamental principle which arises from these authorities and many others

      is one of fairness an imprecise concept and often as in the present case open to

      debate.



      In Tan - v - Cameron (1993) S6CR.APP.R 172 Lord Mustill at page 184 identified

      the question there as



      "w hether it was unfair any longer to hold the defendant to account".



      He stated it was a question to be considered in the round; "a single appreciation o f

      w hat is o r is not unfair".



      In the unreported case of R - v - Reade Morris and Woodwiss, Mr Justice Garland

      added the following propositions to the basic concept of fairness:



      1            the burden of establishing unfairness rests on the defendant alleging it.



      2            the standard of proof required is on the balance of probabilities, but



      3            the jurisdiction to grant a stay should be regarded as exceptionaland to be

                   used sparingly and only for compelling reasons.



      4            in assessing the relevant degree of unfairness or prejudice a court must bear
                   in mind



                   i)          the power of a judge to regulate the admissibility of evidence.



                   ii)         the trial process, which should ensure that the jury have any relevant

                               issues placed before them.



                   iii)        the power of the judge to give appropriate directions .at any stage of the

                               trial and, not least, in summing up.




                                                                                                        4

    See particularly Attorney General's reference No. 1 of 1990 (1992) 95CAR296. I

    therefore take all these matters into account.



    I particularly remind myself that when I consider the concept of “fairness" I should

    restrict it to matters directly affecting the fairness of the trial of these particular

    accused and put aside issues which would come under the label of the “wider

    supervisory jurisdiction" of the High Court.



    History


    It is necessary to set out the history of this case in some detail in order to understand

    the arguments that are put forward by both the defendant applicants and the
    prosecution.      The disaster occurred on the afternoon of the 15 April 1989.        It was

    captured live by BBC and other cameras and was broadcast immediately on

    television and radio.     Not surprisingly the media coverage was immense from the

    cutset. At 9.00 am on the 16 April 1989 a debriefing took place at which Mr Wright

    the Chief Constable was present. Also present were the two defendants and many

    other senior and junior police officers. There was a further debriefing the following

    day at which both defendants were present. The briefing notes will be referred to
    later in this ruling. Also on the 17 April 1989 L.J. Taylor was appointed to conduct a

    public enquiry. The terms of reference were as follows:



    "to inquire into the events a t Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on the 15 April

     1989 and to m ake recommendations about the needs o f crowd control an d safety at

    sports events".


    The hearing began on the 15 May.        It continued for 31 days, concluding on the 29

    June. In that period, 174 witnesses gave oral evidence, Counsels' submissions were

    delivered in writing on the 7 July and on the 14 July L.J. Taylor heard their brief oral

    submissions supplementing the written argument. Witnesses were not sworn, there

    was evidently no power to administer the oath.       L.J. Taylor also took into account

    many written statements in addition to oral testimony.         The interim report was

    published on the 4 August 1989. It was known that the statements provided to the

    enquiry by the West Midlands Police had been edited. The effect of the editing has


                                                                                               5

      been subject to much argument since then.             Statements had initially been obtained

      from police officers of the South Yorkshire Police who had been on duty on the 15

      April-1989 and they included their evidence of feelings and opinion. It was thought

      right to edit that evidence of feeling and opinion from the statements that were

      provided to the Taylor enquiry.           Unfortunately, the tenor of the editing which has

      been illustrated to me during this case shows that many adverse comments about

      the control by senior police officers were removed from the statements of junior

       police officers.         In the event that did not prevent Lord Taylor concluding that "the

      main reason fo r the disaster was the failure o f police control” (Interim report

       paragraph 278). I consider it is unnecessary to explain the reasons for the disaster

       in great detail in this ruling. In brief, David Duckenfield had been promoted to Chief

       Superintendent some 21 days before the match was due to take place.              He was in
       overall charge of the policing operation for that day. He had no recent experience of

       policing at any football match let alone a sell-out semi-final. Superintendent Murray

       had the relevant recent experience and basically was Mr Duckenfield's right-hand

       man. There was a dangerous build-up; of spectators outside the turnstiles at the

       Lepping’s Lane end of the ground between 2.30 and 2.45 pm for a 3.00 pm kick-off.

       As a result at 2.47 pm a request was made to the police control room for permission
       to open the exit gates to relieve the pressure of the build-up at the turnstiles. David

       Duckenfield gave permission for the gates to be opened at 2.52 pm when pens 3

       and 4 behind the Liverpool goal were already over full. Gate C was opened and a

       large num ber‘of spectators entered the ground fairly quickly and made their way
       through a tunnel to the rear of pens 3 and 4, immediately behind the goal. This led

       to the crushing of spectators in pens 3 and 4 and the stopping of the game at 6
       minutes past 3. At chapter 16 Lord Taylor gave a brief summary of the causes of the

       disaster.


       P a ra g ra p h 265. The immediate cause o f the gross overcrowding and hence the

       disaster was the failure, when Gate C was opened, to cut-off access to the central

       p e ns which were already o ve r full.



       P a ra g ra p h 266.      They were already overfull because no safe m aximum capacities

       h a d been laid down, no attem pt was made to control entry to individual pens

       num erically and there was no effective visual monitoring o f crowd density.


                                                                                                 6

    The findings in an earlier paragraph are also important.



    P a ra g ra p h 231.    It should have been clear in the control room where there was a

    view o f the pens and o f the crow d at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If

    orders had been given to that effect when Gate C was opened, the fans could have

    been directed to the empty areas o f the wings and the disaster could still have been

    averted. Failure to give that order was a blunder o f the first magnitude.



    As I have indicated the police in general have been criticised by Lord Taylor, but

    David Duckenfield in particular came in for heavy criticism. -


    P a ra g ra p h 281.    M r Duckenfield lent heavily on M r Murray’s experience, between

    them they m isjudged the build-up at the turnstiles and did little about it until they

    received M r Marshall's request to open the gate.         They did not, for example, check

    the turnstile figures available from club control o r check with Tango Units as to the

    num bers still to come. They did not alert M r Greenwood to the situation at the fringe

    o f his area command. They gave no instructions as to the m anagem ent o f the crowd
    at Leppings Lane, inflexibly they declined to postpone kick-off.


     P a ra g ra p h 282.   When M r Marshall's request came, M r Duckenfield's capacity to

     take decisions 'and give orders seem ed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at lastr the

     opening o f the gatest he failed to give necessary consequential orders to exert any

     control when the disaster occurred.


     P a ra g ra p h 283.   M ost surprisingly, he gave Mr Kelly and other's to think that there

     h a d been an in-rush due to Liverpool fans forcing open a gate.        This was not only

     untruthful it set o ff a widely reported allegation against the supporters which caused

     grave offence an d distress.



     Lord Taylor was then prepared to assume that Mr Duckenfield’s lack of candour on

     that occasion was out of character.



     In Paragraph 284. Lord Taylor described Mr Duckenfield as having "frozen".


                                                                                               t
Lord Taylor also criticised the police in the way in which they conducted their case at

the enquiry.



Paragraph 285. It is a m atter o f regret that at the hearing, and in their submissions,

the South Yorkshire Police were not prepared to concede that they were in any

respect at fault a t what occurred.         M r Duckenfield, under pressure o f cross

examination, apologised fo r blaming the Liverpool fans fo r causing the deaths but,

that apart, the police case was to blame the fans for being late a nd drunk, and to

blame the club fo r failing to m onitor the pens.


After the interim report a large number of witness statements were sent to the DPP
for his consideration.    It became apparent that it was the edited statements which

were sent to him and of the huge number of witness statements obtained by the

West Midlands Police both from police officers and spectators at the ground, the

DPP was sent approximately 11% of those witness statements. Although it must be

the case that there was a great deal of duplication in those witness statements it is
unknown precisely upon which information the DPP subsequently made the decision
not to bring any criminal prosecutions against any police officer in this case.     Two

Senior Queen’s Counsel advised the DPP in relation to this case, the advice has not

been made public.        On the 18 April 1990, Doctor Popper, the Coroner for South

Yorkshire began the first of 95 mini-inquests to decide the statutory questions as to

who each of the deceased was and when and where he or she died. He did not deal
at that stage with the remaining statutory question of how each victim died, since that
could not be answered pending the decision of the DPP as to whether or not any
prosecutions should be brought against any of those involved.



The decision by the DPP not to. prosecute was taken in August of 1990. On the 19

November 1990 the inquests were resumed at Sheffield. These proceedings have
been referred to as the ‘main inquest’ since they were concerned with the question
common to all the then 95 deceased of how they came to their deaths. Around 200

witnesses gave evidence at these resumed inquests including 56 who had done so

before Lord Taylor.




                                                                                       8

    On the 28 March 1991 the Jury returned verdicts of accidental death in all 95 cases,

    by majorities of 9 to 2. The families of the bereaved were unhappy with the way in

    which the inquests were conducted, in particular the decision of the Coroner to

    impose a 3.15 pm cut-off time in relation to evidence to be called before him.

    Evidence has subsequently come to light to suggest that some of the deceased were

    still alive at 3.15 pm and died later.



    On the     11     July   1991   the   Police Complaint's Authority directed    disciplinary

    proceedings against both Duckenfield and Murray for neglect of duty.          In November

    1991 Duckenfield retired from the Police on grounds of ill health.             Disciplinary

    proceedings against him were then withdrawn and shortly afterwards the disciplinary
    proceedings against Murray were also withdrawn.



    In April 1992 the bereaved families approached the Attorney-General inviting him to

    exercise his powers under the Coroner’s Act 1988 to apply for new inquests and that

    was on the basis of evidence that had come to light since the original inquests.         In
    August that year the Attorney-General announced that he had declined to do so.



    In April 1993, six families who had lost relations at Hillsborough were granted leave
    to move for judicial review to quash the verdict of the inquests and seek a fresh

    hearing.   On the 5 November 1993 the Divisional Court dismissed that application.

    Civil claims for compensation have been made throughout the period since the

    disaster. The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has not contested liability for these

    claims, thought he has sought contribution from other parties.


    On the 5 December 1996, Granada Television broadcast a programme entitled

    “’Hillsborough”. The programme presented an emotive and powerful picture of the

    plight of the bereaved immediately following and in the aftermath of the tragedy. It

    also suggested that there was fresh evidence, which had not previously been

    considered which called into question the verdict at the inquests and perhaps some

    other decisions.



    On the 30 June 1997, the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Right

    Honourable Jack Straw MP, appointed Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to conduct a


                                                                                             9

scrutiny into whether there was any fresh evidence which may have a bearing on the

various legal procedures and decisions that had been taken. His terms of reference

were as follows:



          to ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the

          Hillsborough stadium on the 15 April 1989 which was not available;



          a)        to the enquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


          b)        to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney-General for the
                    purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or



          c)        to the Chief Officer of South Yorkshire Police in relation to police

                    disciplinary matters;

                    and
                    in relation to a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available
                    is of such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of

                    State for the Home Department of a further public enquiry; and in

                    relation to b) and c) to draw to their attention to any evidence not

                    previously considered by them which may be              relevant to their

                    respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action

                    which should be taken in the public interest.



The nature of the scrutiny was that it was not a public hearing. Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith was provided with a number of witness statements and that included the

unedited and edited statements of police officers. He was also provided with a list of

submissions made on behalf of the bereaved families which was prepared by Mr A

Jones QC in advance of the hearing without him knowing exactly what Lord Justice

Stuart-Smith had been provided with or being able to see that evidence.                      The
submissions concerning new evidence centred around:



i)        video camera evidence
ii)       the 3.15 pm cut-off time in relation to the inquests




                                                                                              10
                                                                        NO. 7730   P. 13


iii)   interference with witnesses which specifically related to witnesses concerned

       with the aftermath of the disaster.



The bereaved families were also given the opportunity of putting forward not only

their own submissions but witnesses they considered important and that is how a Mr

Houldsworth was put forward. He was the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club video

technician. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith read those submissions, he read a number of

witness statements and himself interviewed a total of 14 witnesses.      The Scrutiny
was published on the 18 February 1998 and is a total of 222 pages in length. Lord

Justice Stuart-Smith considered what his terms of reference meant and in relation to

evidence which was not previously available, he concluded that that meant either it
had not been given in evidence to Lord Taylor or the Coroner or that evidence had

not been considered by the DPP so long as it was not in the public domain. For the

evidence to be significant he concluded it must first be credible but then must also

differ in some important way from evidence which has already been given.            In

relation to this prosecution the evidence which was of potential significance was the

video evidence.      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith read the statements of Mr Houldsworth

and also interviewed him during the Scrutiny.



C hapter 2 paragraph 96 of the Scrutiny sets out Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's

conclusions about the evidence of Mr Houldsworth and how it affected the video

evidence.   He* was unable to accept that Mr Houldsworth recollection of the events

was accurate.     To further summarise L.J. Stuart-Smith’s conclusions I quote from
chapter 7 paragraph 6.        “None o f the evidence I was asked to consider added
anything significant to the evidence which was available to Lord Taylor's enquiry or

to the inquests.'’



The evidence he was asked to consider included about 100 police witness
statements in their edited arid unedited form in order to assess the significance of

the deletions.   L.J. Stuart-Smith declined to describe the deletions as a cover up or
misleading but he did state that in a few cases it would have been preferable if the

deletions had not been made.

In April 1998 a decision was made by the Hillsborough Family Support Group

(hereinafter referred to as HFSG) to commence private prosecutions against

Duckenfield and Murray.          Initially proceedings began in South Sefton Magistrates'

Court but the           defence took a jurisdictional   point.     Without   conceding    that

jurisdictional point the prosecution withdrew those proceedings and began new

proceedings in the Leeds Magistrates' Court.             This had the effect of delaying

proceedings for a matter of a couple of weeks only.              Informations were laid and
summons signed on the 18 July 1998 requiring the defendants Duckenfield and
Murray to attend for the first hearing on the 20 August.            Almost immediately the

Defendants made submissions to the DPP to intervene in the proceedings and
discontinue them pursuant to the Prosecution of Offences Act                   1985.      The

Prosecution also prepared detailed submissions. The DPP announced the decision

not to intervene on the 18 December 1998.               He gave written reasons for that

decision in a letter dated 1 February 1999.        The defendants applied for a judicial
review of that decision.



The hearing was consolidated with another hearing concerning the legality and

correctness cf the defendants' funding by the South Yorkshire Police Authority. The

DPP's decision not to intervene was upheld by the Divisional Court on 31 March
1999.



The Issues          ‘

          »»
I have already indicated the charges each defendant faces.            The prosecution case

put simply is as follows:



The primary and immediate cause of the deaths was traumatic asphyxiation, caused

by the gross negligence of the two defendants in allowing severe overcrowding in
pens 3 and 4 of the west terraces to develop between 2.30 and 3.06 pm.                    The
defendants were on duty in the elevated control box at the south west corner of the

ground which had clear views across the pitch along the goal line of the west end of

the ground and of the west terraces.         In addition to being able to look out of the

window and use their own eyes they had a number of monitors in the control box

from which they could observe the condition of the terraces and the Leppings Lane


                                                                                           12
1i1J.;
                                                                                 NO. 7730   P. ib


         entrance to the ground.   They had a zoom facility allowing them to focus on any

         problem areas covered by the equipment, which included pens 3 and 4 of the

         Leppings Lane terraces and the areas around and outside the turnstiles.            The

         supporters of Liverpool club were allocated the north and west sides of the ground,

         and arrived from Leppings Lane.



         By 2.30 pm there was a very substantial crowd at the turnstiles where there was no

         queuing system, and an insufficient number of turnstiles and police officers to
         process the crowd. Between 2.30 and 2.45 pm the crowd grew in size more quickly

         than the turnstiles could admit spectators.   A press was caused by the increasing

         numbers funnelling into the turnstile area, anxious to get into the ground by kick-off

         time. The spectator witnesses and video tape show that the crowd was enthusiastic
         and cheerful, some supporters climbed over the wall to get into the ground,

         apparently to escape the crush.     Although there was some misbehaviour as the
         video tape and spectator evidence illustrates there was no general misbehaviour.



         At about 2.45 pm Superintendent Marshall asked for gate C to be opened to relieve

         the press. At 2.45 pm that gate was opened from the inside to eject a supporter, and

         a number of people came in. That gate was shut. Insistent further demands for the

         gate to be opened were made as it was considered by officers near the turnstiles

         that the press was a danger to life.    The risk to life at the turnstiles, which had
         steadily developed from 2.15 pm was a grave crisis and the prosecution contend
         required two things by 2.45 pm:



         i)    an announcement to supporters inside and outside the ground by the public
               address system at the start of the game would be delayed;



         ii)   that any further supporters entering the west end of the ground even if by
               turnstiles alone should be diverted from the tunnel which led to the central
                pens.



         At 2.52 pm Mr Duckenfield gave an order to open the gates, gate C was opened.

         Between that time and kick off at 3.00 pm many hundreds of supporters went in.

         Those in the control box could or should have seen both the condition of the central


                                                                                             13
         : V '/ H

pens and the conditions at the turnstiles. When gate C was opened the central pens

numbered 3 and 4 were already full and should have been apparent to the

defendants whose responsibilities for ensuring the safety included monitoring the

pens.   Access to the pens was through the tunnel under the west stand.                If the

defendants had ordered police officers to block or close off the tunnel to pens 3 and

4, the tragedy would have been avoided.         The defendants owed a duty of care to
those in the pens, adults and children alike, and those entering the ground, to

prevent them from being crushed.         Diversion from the tunnel was a simple and
obvious step that could have been taken and should have been taken at 2.45 pm

before the request came to open the gates. It obviously should have been taken in

any event between the time of the request to open the gates and the kick-off. It was

criminally negligent not to have taken this obvious precaution between at the latest
2.45 pm and the time when the game was stopped 3.C6 pm.



The prosecution therefore simply say that the defendants are guilty of manslaughter

because a) they owed the deceased a duty of care; b) that they were negligent; c)

that their negligent actions or omissions were a substantial cause of death and d)

that their negligence was of such a gravity as to amount to a crime within the

principle in R - v - Adomako (1995) 1A.C.181



“the essence o f the matter, which is supremely a ju ry question, is whether having

regard to the risk o f death involved the conduct o f the defendant was so bad in all

the circum stances as to amount in their jud g e m en t to a criminal act o r om ission” at
page 107.



The prosecution submit that the only apparent issue in this case can be whether the
negligence was of such a gravity as to amount to a crime.



I have set out these matters in my ruling because it is clear from the case of R - v -

Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate ex parte DPP (1992) 95CR.APP.R.9
that in order to consider prejudice particularly in relation to delay I need to consider

the issues in the case.      In their initial submissions neither Mr Clegg QC nor Mr

Harrison QC set out what the issues were and how either defendant was prejudiced

by the delay in this case.    An issue then arose during argument in this way.          The


                                                                                          14

     prosecution has stated that its case is based upon the findings of the Taylor enquiry.

    The Defence said well what about paragraph 78 which reads as follows:



     "in the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything amiss in pens 3

     and 4 until the first fans spilt out onto the perim eter track ju s t before kick-off.   Then

     the officers in com m and assumed that there was an attempted pitch invasion



     The prosecution apparently do not accept this particular finding and intend to put
     their case in the alternative, in this way; that the defendants did notice or, in the

     alternative, should have noticed the overcrowding in pens 3 and 4. In the light of that

     the defence now say that the issue of what the defendants in fact saw in the pens is
     a relevant issue in the case and therefore by inference what other witnesses,

     particularly police officers on duty on the touch line and in the west stand themselves

     saw is an important issue and that their memories on the point are bound to be

     affected by the passage of time. Mr Clegg QC also argued that the decision to open
    the gates was a difficult cne for Duckenfield and goes to the issue of foreseeability.

     He went on that in any consideration of foreseeability it was important for

     Duckenfield to rely upon ether people’s perception which would be difficult after 10 or
     11 years.    I shall now move on to deal with this and other arguments raised during
    submissions.



    C o u n sels’ Submissions



     Mr Harrison expressly adopted the submissions of Mr Clegg and then expanded
     upon them particularly on the topic relating to publicity. They both submitted that in
    the light of the history of the case the prosecution reflected a refusal on the part of

    those    responsible for bringing the case to accept the decisions of various

    investigations into the tragedy, including the Taylor enquiry where Duckenfield and

    Murray gave evidence over a lengthy period, the decision of the DPP not to
    prosecute either defendant in August 1990, the accidental death verdict of the

    Coroner's Jury and the findings of the Stuart-Smith Scrutiny. It was argued that the

    findings of the Scrutiny impliedly affirmed that the decision of the DPP not to

    prosecute was right and that there was no significant evidence to alter that decision.

    They argued that after 10 years of enquiry, investigation, inquest and scrutiny it is


                                                                                                15

oppressive then to bring a private prosecution.            1 take the use of the word

"oppressive” to mean unfair in the context of this application.



They further submitted that the essential criminality alleged by the prosecution is the

same as that which was investigated at the Taylor enquiry, that the evidence upon

which they rely is essentially the same as the evidence the DPP had in deciding not

to prosecute and that to commence private prosecutions based on the same
evidence so long after the event is unfair and would test the public confidence in and

the integrity of the system. They also submitted that the delay of 10 years is such

that a fair trial is impossible; that would be the case irrespective of any fault by the
prosecution but in any event the prosecution, they say, could and should have been

brought many years earlier than it has been.



They then submitted that in the context of delay the court should consider the

alleged breach of article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. They both

went on to make strong submissions about the media coverage in the case; that it

had been very extensive and intense; that much of it had been instigated by the

prosecution and by that they meant the HFSG; that it was overwhelmingly prejudicial

and that there could not be a fair trial at any time in the future.



They further submitted that the Prosecutor Ann Adlington had lost all sense of

objectivity, had unfairly selected evidence upon which the prosecution rely and had

failed to consider the effect of bringing a prosecution upon either defendant.



Mr Jones submitted that the prosecution did accept the findings of the Taylor enquiry

and that was the basis of the prosecution case. He did not accept the verdict of the

Coroner’s Jury and did not accept Lord Justice Stuart-Smiths Scrutiny save in so far
as it supported the Taylor findings. He said that neither the prosecution nor the court

were bound by these decisions because there is no doctrine of issue estoppel in
English criminal law. He also submitted that the South Yorkshire Police had carried

out a concerted cover up, had concealed evidence, edited statements and had

misled the DPP, the Coroner’s Court and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.           He further

submitted that the onus was on the applicants to show unfairness and or oppression

and that they had not called any evidence to support their submissions. He said of


                                                                                      16
delay that the defence had not at any stage identified the issues in the case so as to

enable the court assess any prejudice the defendants may have suffered or will

suffer. He argued that the essentia! issue was one of gross negligence and that the

vast majority of the evidence would not be in dispute, much of it was captured on

video, witness statements were taken at the time, and therefore the issues would net

be adversely affected by the delay in this case.   He argued that the delay was not

the fault of the prosecution in this case, that there were good reasons for the delay

which included; a lack of funding; the concealment of evidence; the difficulties over
disclosure and the drip feed effect of the evidence in this case.   He submitted that

the publicity was not such as to render a fair trial impossible. He argued that there

were two conflicting interests of the police and the Liverpool fans both of whom had

influenced the media and that they balanced each other out to some extent.



Of necessity these are only brief summaries of careful, detailed and extensive

submissions, but further arguments put forward by both parties will be referred to in

the remainder of my ruling.



Many of these submissions have been made both by the prosecution and the

defence at various stages of this case, particularly in relation to the recent

proceedings concerning the DPPs decision not to intervene in these private

prosecutions.



It follows from what I have just said that the applicants did not call any evidence to

support their submissions of oppression or how that and the delay and the alleged

adverse publicity has directly affected the defendants.      Neither has any written

evidence of the defendants' health, state of mind, personal circumstances or how

these proceedings have in any way affected them been put before me so I am,

therefore, only able to make proper inferences where I can.     The court clearly has

power to hear evidence during an abuse of process application and ought to if either
party wishes to call evidence.   See R - v - Clerkenwel! Stipendiary Magistrate ex

parte Bell (1991) 55.J.P.669.



On the other hand the prosecution has called the Prosecutor Ann Adlington to

explain various aspects of the background to this prosecution. She is a solicitor who


                                                                                   17

was working for Liverpool City Council in 1989 when the disaster took place. In 1992

she became the Solicitor for the Hillsborough Disaster Working Party and in that

capacity advised bereaved families generally in relation to all aspects of the disaster.

In August 1997 she was seconded to become the Solicitor for the HFSG.                  She

explained that she had been chosen as the prosecutor as a kind of figurehead and to

avoid any clash of personalities within the HFSG had a bereaved member of the

HFSG been chosen instead.



I deal new with the various submissions in turn.



1      Oppression

       I reject the defence submission that the prosecution or this court is in any way

       bound by earlier decisions or findings, accepting as I do that there is no
       doctrine of issue estoppel in English criminal law.      See Director of Public
       Prosecutions - v - Humphrys (1977) A.C.1 House of Lords.          Regarding the
       Taylor enquiry the prosecution does accept the findings of the Taylor enquiry

       and bases its case upon them. The defence pointed to an earlier submission

       made by Mr Jones when he stated that the Taylor enquiry "almost" amounts

       to a prima facie case, but I accept Mr Jones’ response during which he

       reminded me of the terms of reference which in no way permitted Lord Justice
       Taylor to give an opinion upon anyone's criminal responsibility let alone

       recommend criminal proceedings.       In that sense the findings of the Taylor
       enquiry do stop short of a prima facie case.



       Regarding the DPP's decision not to prosecute, I do not know the basis upon

       which a decision.was reached, I do not know what evidence the DPP was
       provided with and I have not seen the QCs advice which has not been made
       public.   I do not accept that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny implies that
       the DPP was right in its decision not to prosecute and that as a result of the

       Scrutiny no subsequent prosecution ought to be brought although I have

       borne in mind the Scrutiny as a whole.         It was further argued that it can

       amount to an abuse of process in circumstances where a prosecution is

       brought after a defendant has been informed that he will not be prosecuted.

       The defence referred to a number of authorities, including R - v - Croydon


                                                                                         18
    ■27                                                             NO. ??30    P.


J.J. ex parte Dean (1980) C.A.R.76 and R - v - Bloomfield (1997) 1.C.A.R.35.

I agree with Mr Clegg when he stated that it must be a question of fact and

degree whether a private prosecution amounts to an abuse of process after a

decision by the DPP not to prosecute has been made and communicated to a

suspect. Clearly if a decision to prosecute privately is made immediately after

the decision by the DPP it will be almost impossible to establish abuse

because the effect would be to fetter the right of a private individual to

prosecute when the state declines.       Mr Clegg argues that where, however,

nine years elapses between the two decisions then the existence of
unfairness can be presumed. If it were argued that this amounts to an unfair

manipulation of the court proceedings I would reject that argument because

whatever the delay the effect would be to fetter right of a private individual to
prosecute. This point, therefore, is better left to be considered with the other

points relating to the issue of delay.



There is little I need to say about the inquest. The purpose of an inquest is
specific and the verdict of accidental death in my view does not undermine

this prosecution or in itself make it unfair.    L.J. Stuart-Smith indicated in

chapter 1 paragraph 66 that the verdicts of accidental death did not, as had

been suggested, undermine or reverse the findings of L.J. Taylor.



Regarding the Scrutiny I have already made comments about the Scrutiny in
so far as it affects the issues in this application. The terms of reference were

very specific and related to the evidence of Mr Houldsworth, video evidence

and the editing of police statements to which I shall return later.        Neither
Duckenfield nor Murray were called before the Scrutiny, and I have no

evidence as to how the fact the Scrutiny took place affected them.             It is

difficult in those circumstances to infer oppression or unfairness in relation to

this matter. The defence have argued that the failure of the prosecution to

accept the various findings can be equated with the Maxwell No.2 case
(unreported) where Mr Justice Buckley said at page 24.



7 am suggesting that if all parties have played     their p a rt an d the essential
crim inality alleged has been placed before a Jury who have acquitted, it


                                                                                 19
15. JUL. 1 999 1 5:2?                                                               HO. ??30    P. 22


             should be unusual for a second trial to take place. The reason is that it would

             be very likely to appear to the public that the authorities were not prepared to

             accept the verdict o f a ju ry and were determined to pursue the defendant at

             w hatever cost to the public purse, court time o r disruption o f the defendant's

             personal life, business or professional career. That must n o t happen. ”



             That case is wholly distinguishable from the present case in that there had

             already been a jury trial and the issues in the second trial were very similar,
             although relating to a different transaction, essentially boiling down to a

             question of the defendant's honesty. A jury’s verdict after a very lengthy trial

             cannot in my view be equated to decisions that have taken place in these

             present proceedings.      The Maxwell No. 2 case is an illustration of a case

             where oral evidence was given (by Kevin Maxwell’s wife) of the terrible strain

             and stress suffered by the whole family. As a result Mr Justice Buckley said

             this at page 27.
             “Finally, an important, though not decisive consideration; fairness to the

             defendants. I have m entioned the time that these criminal proceedings v/ould

             h a ve been hanging o ve r their heads in the event o f a further tria l at least five

             years, that v/ould be so in M r Kevin Maxwell’s case, not withstanding that in

             going through the extremely lengthy trial process he gave evidence before a

             ju r y fo r twenty days and not withstanding the acquittals, the disruption to

             p e rso n a l a nd business life is inevitably considerable. The stress and pain that
             criminals inflict on their families is a sad but inevitable consequence o f their

             misdeeds.    Courts are m indful o f it b ut obviously cannot allow it to outweigh
             consideration for victims and the general public interest in punishing crime,

             but I rem ind m yself here that these defendants have been acquitted in the
             circum stances I have described."



             There is no similar situation in the present case, neither defendant has

             already faced a criminal trial, the cases are not sufficiently similar to place any

             great weight on the defendants’ submissions.         Finally the defence have also

             suggested that the prosecution must show that the earlier decisions were in

             some way flawed. 1 disagree for the reasons I have already given; although

             Mr Jones spent time trying to show that various people including the OPP, the


                                                                                                20

             Coroner and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith had been misled, in my view without

             much success.



             I should also mention that my attention has been drawn to the submissions

             made by the Defence to the DPP in their attempts to persuade the DPP to

             intervene   in   these   proceedings    and   discontinue.      The    defendant's
             submissions to the DPP are similar to those put forward before me and failed

             to persuade the DPP to discontinue, therefore the prosecution says how can I

             come to a different decision to his where it is said he has a wider discretion

             than I.



             I have already indicated that I am not bound by earlier decisions in these

             proceedings, and it is particularly so in this instance, where it is clear from the

             D P P ’s reasons that he is able to take into account the seriousness of the
             offences charged in weighing up the 'public interest'..      I cannot take such a

             matter into consideration although as Buckley J said in Maxwell No.2 there

             are matters of “public interest" which go to the issue of ’‘fairness" to both the

             prosecution and the defence and can properly be taken into account.



             I am not persuaded that these submissions give me grounds for staying these
             proceedings as an abuse of process.


    2        Delay



             In a case involving delay the court will consider the reasons for the delay and

             the responsibility, if any, of either the prosecution or the defence for the delay.
             The court will also consider the issues which are likely to arise at the hearing

             and the nature of the evidence which is likely to be relevant. (See Badhan). I

             have already set out the history of the case which goes some way to

             explaining the delay.     Further Ann Adlington refers to the history in her

             statement which she adopted as her evidence in chief and upon which she

             was cross-examined.       The reasons for the delay can be summarised as
             follows.




                                                                                              21
lijiJU lb:27                                                         NO. 7730   P. 2


    Although I would not go so far as to say that there has been a cover up, the

    South Yorkshire Police have made it difficult for anyone considering a private

    prosecution to obtain the evidence to bring one. I agree with L.J, Stuart-Smith

    (Chapter 4 paragraph 100) that "in the days following Hillsborough the South

    Yorkshire Police perceived themselves to be on the defensive.    This was also

    the perception o f their Legal Advisers.   There was an understandable desire
    n ot to give anything away."   Statements were edited for use at the Taylor
    enquiry and for consideration by the DPP.      South Yorkshire Police via the

    West Midlands Police were able to influence what evidence went before the

    Coroner.    The HFSG fairly and reasonably did nothing about a private
    prosecution between the DPP's decision not to prosecute in August 19S0 and

    the Jury verdict in March 1991. Again, fairly and reasonably they awaited the

    outcome of the disciplinary proceedings during which there was an embargo
    on further disclosure of evidence and then awaited the outcome of the judicial

    review of the Coroner’s inquest. After the outcome of the judicial review in

    1993, Ann Adlington states at paragraph 41 of her statement that the HFSG

    were demoralised and believed that they had come to the end of the legal

    road. No money was available nor was there any prospect of raising it. This

    was not challenged.     So even if private prosecutions were considered the

    HFSG had no funds.


    An approach was then made to Jimmy McGovern about making a drama

    believing this to be the best way to raise public awareness. The Drama was

    shown in December 1996, it did raise public awareness, there was great

    interest in the media and in Parliament and the Scrutiny then followed. About

    this time a memorial concert took place which raised substantial funds. The
    Scrutiny was published in February 1998.        The decision to bring private

    prosecutions followed in April 1998 soon after the Scrutiny was published and

    further evidence had been made public in the House of Commons Library.
    Once private prosecutions began the only delay has been the defendants

    decision to apply to the DPP to intervene, a course of action which they are

    entitled to take.   The prosecution encountered further problems concerning

    disclosure from the South Yorkshire Police which was only resolved by them




                                                                                 22
15. JUL. 1993 15:28                                                           NO. 7730    P. 25


           taking out a witness summons on A.C.C. Daines pursuant to S.97 of the

           Magistrates'Courts Act 1980.



           The defence argue that private prosecutions should have been brought earlier

           and ideally that is the case but I consider there are good reasons for that not

           being done.      The prosecution say that the defendants themselves have

           directly or indirectly contributed to the delay by participating in an alleged

           cover up or by the concealment of evidence or in the fack of disclosure.
           There is no evidence to support those submissions but I take the view that the
           South Yorkshire Police must take some responsibility for that, not these

           defendants.      I, therefore, conclude that neither -party is responsible for

           ‘'unjustifiable” delay in this case.



           I have already set out the issues under that heading, and in the absence of a

           great deal of help from the defence on this point they appear to me to be fairly

           narrow. I conclude that much of the relevant evidence relating to the issues is
           contained on video tape and in transcripts of evidence at the Taylor enquiry

           which took place very shortly after the disaster.   The only specific prejudice

           alleged by the defence concerns the possibility of calling police witnesses as

           to the state of pens 3 and 4 at the relevant time and those police officers who

           may have had a perception of the opening of the gates. I do not consider this

           to be a--strong argument because it is these defendants' perceptions and what
           they saw or ought to have seen which is important.       If other officers did not
           have a perception of the danger when the gates were opened, or the state of

           pens 3 and 4, it could be construed as a further example of the lack of care of

           the police, but it was these two defendants who had overall responsibility on

           that day.   In so far as the case will depend upon the memory of witnesses,

           these defendants and those witnesses will have had every reason to have the
           events very much in mind since the day of the disaster. I, therefore, consider
           that the prejudice caused by the delay is not so strong as to render a fair trial

           impossible.



           When Lord Justice McCowan said this at page 41 of the judgement in relation

           to the judicial review of the Coroner’s inquest "I have to consider the interests


                                                                                          23

 who may have to give evidence as to precisely where the deceased were in
 the pens, when and where they were taken, what attempts were made to
 revive them and matters of that sort,       He was therefore talking about a

 completely separate issue.



 European Law


  In support of their submissions on delay the defence-allege a breach of article

 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights which provides



  "in the determination o f his civil rights and obligations o r o f an y criminal

 charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a

 reasonable time b y an independent and impartial tribunal established b y la w ”.



 A number of authorities have been put before me.         The principal argument

 between the prosecution and defence concerns the period to be taken into
 account in determining the length of the proceedings.        According to those

 authorities the time runs from what has variously been described as when the

 person is “charged”. This may occur upon “arrest" or "official notification given

 to an individual b y the com petent authority o f an allegation that he has

 com m itted a crim inal offence” or the opening of “a prelim inary investigation",
 Thus the defence have argued that time runs from the time of the Taylor
 enquiry i.e. the opening of a preliminary investigation.    But the prosecution
 say that the use of the expression the ‘opening of a preliminary investigation'

 has been taken from the case of Ringeisen - v - Austria 1 EHRR.455 and

 ignores the basic fact that a preliminary investigation is a stage in criminal

 proceedings in Austria which follows the charge. The prosecution states that

 the time must run from the date of commencing these proceedings i.e. when

 the defendants were first charged in Sefton Magistrates in June of 1998.            I

 consider that I do not have to decide when the time begins for the following

 reasons.


                                                                                24

                   The authorities set out the principles which the European Court considers in
                   determining what is a reasonable time, ! refer to Soddaert - v - Belgium

                   (1992) EHRR 242.       In the judgement of the court at paragraph 36, I quote,

                   “the reasonableness o f the length o f proceedings is to be determ ined with

                   reference to the criteria laid down in the court's case law and in the light o f the

                   circum stances o f the case,        which in this instance call fo r an overall
                   assessm ent" and paragraph 39 “article 6 commands, that ju d icia l proceedings

                   be expeditious, but it also lays down the more general principle o f the proper

                   administration o f justice. In the circumstances o f the case the conduct o f the
                   authorities was consistent with a fa ir balance which .has to be struck between

                   the various aspects o f this fundam ental requirement." In Allenet De Ribemont

                   - v- France (1995) 20 .EHRR 557, l quote paragraph 86 of the Commission’s

                   opinion, “the commission reiterates that the reasonableness o f the length o f
                   proceedings m ust be assessed in the light o f the circumstances o f each case

                   a n d having regard to the follov/ing criteria; the complexity o f the case, the

                   a sse ssm e n t11. The Commission further recalls that in civil cases exercising

                   the right to a hearing within a reasonable time is subject to diligence being

                   shown by the party concerned. Nevertheless this principle does not absolve

                   the court from ensuring that trials are conducted within a reasonable time.

                   The principles laid down in these authorities therefore are no different, in my
                   view, to the principles I have to decide in the abuse of process application

                   according to UK Law. This appears to be confirmed by L.J. Buxton in R - v -

                   Stratford Justices ex parte Imbed, The Times, February 25 1999 when
                   considering another part of article 6 of the Convention, he said this, “the

                   principle o f looking a t the fairness in their entirety o f their particu la r criminal
                   proceedings that were under criticism perm eated the whole o f the Strasbourg

                   jurisprudence". Therefore if I were to accept the defence submission upon the

                   length of the proceedings (approximately 10 years) any consideration of a

                   breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights adds

                   nothing to the matters I already have under consideration in the                  abuse   of

                   process application.


                                                                                                             25
Publicity



I have been taken through an enormous volume of material which was mainly

made up of newspaper articles over the last 10 years. I have also seen video

tapes of various television programmes, including the McGovern drama

‘Hillsborough'. I have been shown samples of internet coverage, three books

on the subject and the words of a song by the Manic Street Preachers called
‘SYM M ’ which stands for South Yorkshire Mass Murderer. It is clear that the
media coverage has been widespread, extremely voluminous and unrelenting.



From the outset the media coverage was vast, which is not surprising as this

is the worst disaster in British sporting history and was therefore of the

greatest public interest and concern. In the early stages, the South Yorkshire

Police decided to deflect blame onto the drunken Liverpool supporters so that
on Wednesday 19 April, for example, we see on the front page of the Daily

Express "Police Accuse Drunken Fans", and on the same day on the front

page of the Sun "The Truth. Some fans picked pockets o f victims, some fans

urinated on the brave cops" These allegations were roundly rejected by Lord

Justice Taylor; but I accept Mr Jones’ point that in the early stages the media

coverage reached saturation point and it may be those early perceptions

which -'sink into the public consciousness.        However, both before and
particularly since the Taylor interim report, the blame for the disaster has been
laid on the police.   In the early stages it was Superintendent Marshall who
received a lot of attention because it was he who had "opened the gates".



During and after the Taylor enquiry Duckenfields name appears regularly in

newspaper articles, Murray's not so often. There has been substantial media

coverage of each step in the history of the case. For example, The Guardian,
31 August 1990 "Prosecutions ruled out in Hillsborough disaster.              The
decision by the Director o f Public Prosecutions was attacked by Liverpool

M Ps as a scandal and a w h ite w a sh ” Terry Fields, Labour MP for Broadgreen

said   ""my initial reaction is one o f shock and absolute         disgust,   this

announcem ent is an absolute scandal".      The Independent, 29 March 1991
      *\
     id                                                               NO. 7730    P. 29


"Hillsborough inquest ends with tears and scuffles.      The anger o f the relatives

o f those who died spilled over as the jury's verdict o f accidental death was

re a d out. People in court scream ed and began crying, one vsoman shouted “it

was no a c c i d e n t The Times, 30 October 1991, "Police C hief blam ed over

Hillsborough retires early”. The report stated that David Duckenfieid was to

retire from the South Yorkshire Police Force on health grounds and not face a
planned disciplinary tribunal.   Philip Hammond of the HFSG whose 14 year-

old son was among those who died said “we feel we have been cheated o f

ju s tic e ”. There appears to have been something of a lull after this until 1995

when there was substantial media coverage of the McGovern drama and the

alleged new evidence that had come to light A headline in the Daily Mirror for
Thursday, December 5 1996, provides an example "Why everyone in Britain
m u st watch, at last w e ’ve seen the terrible truth . . . now why do esn ’t someone

say so rry", and the Daily Mirror the following day contained headlines as

follows "It took us back into hell".   "Victims who still wait for justice " and “M y

rage o ve r the cover-up, the paramedic".



The prejudice the defence allege is that much of the media coverage has

been generated by the prosecution and by that they mean the HSFG and that

they have linked many of the legitimate grievances they have concerning the

tragedy (e.g. the inquest and the 3.15 pm cut-off time, the !ack of disclosure,

and poor treatment by the authorities) with their calls for justice. Further many

allegations of police cover up (lying about the video evidence, the editing of

statements) in the light of the Scrutiny are, the defence say, inaccurate, unfair
and prejudicial. There was, of course, much media coverage to mark the 10th
Anniversary of the disaster in April of this year, with renewed calls for justice.



I do accept that the media coverage in this case is bound to create some

prejudice against these two defendants, more so against Mr Duckenfield than

Mr Murray.    However, I also bear in mind Mr Jones’ argument that unusually

in this case there are two polarised views and each have used the media to
put forward their point of view, and that any potential jury will be from a cross

section of the community. I note that there is no evidence as to the effect of

the publicity on the public, there are no opinion polls concerning the publicity


                                                                                  27
i J.   J UL.   13 3 3   i ;
                                                                                         NO. 7731          30


                    as there were in the Maxwell case, although I accept that Mr Justice Phiilips

                    said that the opinion polls in the Maxwell case should not set a precedent or

                .   become the norm. Having accepted that there is some prejudice against the

                    defendants I have to weigh that up against the need to report matters of public

                    interest and concern and ask myself this question: Is the prejudice so great

                    as to make a fair trial impossible? Bearing in mind those matters to which I
                    have just referred and the powers of the Judge at trial to regulate the trial

                    process and give appropriate directions to the jury 1 answer the question in
                    the negative.



        5           O ther Matters



                    The defence have argued that the prosecutor lacks objectivity and the
                    selection of the evidence is unbalanced and unfair.         Ann Adlington gave
                    sworn evidence before me.       She clearly feels very strongly about the case

                    and has been involved in it, indirectly at first, and then directly for many years.

                    However, I found her evidence to be reliable and credible and she certainly

                    did not give me the impression that she had lost her sense of objectivity. She

                    came across as a responsible prosecutor mindful of her duties as such. An

                    example can be given when she was asked about the media coverage. She

                    considered the Manic Street Preachers ‘SYMM’ song to be in bad taste and

                    was prepared to support the defence application to the Attorney-General to

                    prevent its publication (N.B. the defence application to the Attorney-General to

                    have the song stopped failed). She further indicated that she had been very

                    careful to avoid adverse publicity, that she had given members of the HFSG a

                    severe telling off when they made various outbursts to the press and she said
                    that she didn't want anything to prejudice the prosecution case. The defence
                    have      criticised Ann Adlington for relying upon      Mr Houldsworth         as a
                    prosecution witness after he had been discredited by Lord Justice Stuart-

                    Smith. In my view he did not go quite that far. In chapter 2 at paragraph 99,

                    he said this 7   am unable to accept that his (M r Houldsworth) recollection o f
                    events n o w is accurate. Even if it was correct it would not have any effect on
                    the p revious proceedings.    It would simply have been the evidence o f one

                    m ore person who thought that the central pens were full at 2.52 pm ."           He


                                                                                                      28
      30                                                                          NO. 7730     F. 3!


therefore describes Mr Houldsworth evidence as inaccurate and even if

accurate      of marginal           relevance.     Ann    Adlingtcn     said   she     found    Mr

Houldsworth a truthful witness and I accept her evidence on that point,

whether the jury were to find Mr Houldsworth truthful is a matter for them.                       I

was referred to the case of R - v - Epping & Harlow Justices ex parte

Massaro (1972) 1.Q.B.433 in which the Lord Chief Justice Lord Widgery had

to decide the purpose of committal proceedings. At page 435 he said this “is

it as the prosecution m ight c o n te n d s im p ly a safeguard fo r the citizen to
ensure that he cannot be m ade to stand his trial without a prima facie case

being show n o r is it as M r Beckman would contend, a rehearsal proceeding

so that the defence m ay try out their cross examination on the prosecution

w itnesses with a view to using the results to advantage in the Crown Court at

a la te r sta g e ?          F o r m y p a rt I think it is d e a r that the function o f committal
p roceedings is to ensure that no-one shall stand his trial unless a prima facie
case has been made o u t. The way in which the prosecution have prepared

the committal bundle accords with the duties of the prosecution at committal

proceedings.


The defence have also criticised Ann Adlington for failing to have various

police witnesses            in the committal bundle, in particular Superintendent

Marshall who is involved in the opening of gate C or any of the three police

officers; apart from the defendants, who were in the control box. I accept the

reasons given by Ann Adlington for their absence in that bundle.                               Ann

Adlington was also criticised for failing to take into account the DPP’s decision
not to prosecute the defendants. She said that she had taken that matter into
account but was unaware of the reasons for the decision. I reject that

criticism. I therefore find that the defence have not made out a case of lack of

objectivity or bias on the part of the prosecutor.



Finally, during cross examination of Ann Adiington the defence suggested that

a   primary      purpose of bringing these proceedings was                      to enable the

prosecution           to   obtain    disclosure   of   further    evidence     after   committal

proceedings and that it was an unfair manipulation of the court process. Ann

Adlington denied that this was a primary purpose of the prosecution and I


                                                                                                29
i J. J UL.   13 3 3    13 • JU                                                           NO. 7730    P. 32


                  accept that. Although I find that the bringing of this prosecution may have that

                  consequence it is not an unfair manipulation of the court process.



                  It was alleged by the prosecution that new and important evidence had come

                  to     light   since   the   commencement    of   these    proceedings,   particularly

                  concerning the closing of the tunnel in 1988 at the corresponding match the

                  previous year. The prosecution referred to debriefing notes and also a ‘new'

                  statement from Inspector White which arrived from the South Yorkshire Police

                  archive during the submissions. On the face of this statement, it purported to

                  show that Superintendent Murray had been aware of the practice of closing
                  off the tunnel at the semi-final the previous year in -1988 and that he knew

                  before the 15 April 1989.          If that were right it v/ould be very important
                  evidence in this case.        Upon a close analysis of that evidence, however, Mr

                  Harrison was able to demonstrate that the submissions of the prosecution

                  were incorrect.        He showed that Inspector White was referring in this new

                  statement to the practice of filling up pens 3 and 4 first, then closing off the
                  tunnel before redirecting spectators to outside pens at league games only.
                  This practice was known at the Taylor enquiry and-paragraph 170 of the

                  interim report makes that clear.



                      Mr Harrison further demonstrated that Murray had referred to this practice of

                  filling up pens 3 and 4 first and then redirecting the fans to the wings at league

                      matches during the Taylor enquiry. Inspector White’s statement further shows
                  that he was not on duty in the Leppings Lane area of the ground at either the
                  semi-final in 1987 or the semi-final in 1988.             So when he refers in that

                      statement to speaking to Superintendent Murray about the way in which the

                      pens were to be filled it is clear he was referring to the difference between

                  filling up those pens at a league game and how they were to be filled on that

                      day the 15 April 1989. The fact that the tunnel had been closed off in 1988
                      was also known to the Taylor enquiry (see paragraph 230 of the interim
                      report) "since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 pm, the tunnel should have been

                      closed w he the r gate C was to be opened o r not.     The exercise was .a simple

                      one an d ha d been carried out in 1988. A ll that was necessary was fo r a few

                      officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans

           elsewhere.   Unfortunately, the 1988 closure seems to have been unknown to

           the Senior Officers on duty at the time.      It did not figure in the debriefing

           notes. It therefore ha d no influence on the planning for 1989". The statement

           of Inspector White therefore sheds no further light on Lord Justice Taylor's

           findings that I have just quoted.     The prosecution have referred me to the

           briefing notes of the 17 April 1989 at which these two defendants were

           present.   It is not known who made these notes.       From the top of page 3 I

           quote:



           CC - Go back to the control inside the tunnel. Whose responsibility is it there

           to divert people - anybody?


           D uckenfield - Inspector White with serials 14 and15. Specific instructions on

           the o rder at phase 2.



            CC - Inspector White experienced individual.



           M ole - M r C reaser was the Inspector who worked it before M r White.



           N esbitt - A t the crucial time Inspector White was returning having dealt with an

           arrest.



           Top o f the tunnel solid with horses - that procedure happened last year. "



           That is the only reference which may relate to the tunnel being blocked off the
           previous year. It is not known who said this and therefore does not assist me

           greatly.



           I have also had my attention drawn to the debriefing notes dated 19 April
           1989, this was with Supervisory Officers deployed at Leppings Lane on 15

           April 1989, neither of the defendants were present.      In relation to this point I

           quote from the first page “there is nothing in the operational orde r n o r at the

           briefings ab ou t contingency for police protection o f the tunnel to restrict o r

           preve n t spectator entry.    Officers remembered (particularly C h ie f Inspector


                                                                                            31

            Creaser) that in previous years the above had been done by the use o f horses

            and static police lines (referred to as Superintendent Freeman's policy).



            Neither of these passages support the prosecution's submission that either of

            these defendants knew about the policy to close off the tunnel at the match

            the previous year. At its highest the prosecution may be able to argue that

            this policy of closing off the tunnel was known to some officers of a senior

            rank and therefore was above junior level.       I want to make it quite clear

            therefore that 1 have not placed any weight on the prosecution's submissions

             of new evidence concerning what happened in 1988 in determining this

             application.


             In conclusion I have considered all the above matters, everything I have read

             in the case papers and all that Counsel has urged upon me.          Although I
             appear to have dealt with various aspects of the argument one by one, I have
             considered their cumulative effect and therefore have considered matters in

             the round. I have concluded that the defence have not persuaded me to the

             required standard of proof that a fair trial is not possible in this case.     I

             therefore dismiss this application.

A                                                            RULING


    MR JUSTICE HOOPER: I first of all give my reasons for the ruling I made on

    Monday.
B
           Mr Clegg QC, objects to the admissibility of answers given by the defendant,

    Mr Duckenfield, to the Taylor Inquiry and to the statement in writing made by him

    to the Inquiry. He submits that the evidence is inadmissible on the grounds of public

^ policy at common law. At the conclusion of the submission, I ruled against it. That

    submission was heard before a number of other submissions, also concerning the

    admissibility of this evidence. Had this first submission succeeded, then witnesses

D would not have needed to come to court. Mr Clegg's submissions are set out in

    paragraphs 2 .4 , 2 .5 , and the first sentence of 2 .6 , which I now cite.

               "2 .4 The Taylor Inquiry was established with the following terms of
               reference

F
                            'To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday
                            football ground on 15th April 1989 and to make
                            recommendations about the need of crowd control and
                            safety at sports events.

               2 .5 It is axiomatic that in the circumstances of the Hillsborough
F              Disaster it was in the wider public interest that all witnesses should
               be free to give their evidence with candour and that the overriding
               public interest in seeking to prevent a possible recurrence of the
               disaster far outweighed the interests of the prosecutor in this trial.

               2 .6 Were evidence given by witnesses to such an Inquiry to be
               admissible against them in criminal proceedings then one of the prime
               objectives of the inquiry might be eliminated."

    If there was such a public policy rule, then it would apply to any subsequent civil




H
D. L . S E L L E R S & C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




     and criminal proceedings. I asked Mr Clegg whether the rule of public policy would

     apply if a witness had been reminded of the privilege against self-incrimination and
A

     had continued to give evidence upon which the prosecution wished to rely at some

     subsequent trial. He seemed to accept the rule of public policy would not preclude

     the admission of that evidence. The only authority to which Mr Clegg could point
B
     was a passage in a decision of Mr Justice Turner in a case called Alcindor and

     Others, a decision he gave at the Old Bailey on 1 1th June of 1 9 90 . That case

     involved the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in Zeebrugge harbour on 6th

^ March of 1 9 8 7 and the manslaughter charges that arose out of it. Shortly after the

     sinking an Inquiry was opened under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act.

     That Inquiry concluded with the publication of the report.                     Police investigations

D subsequently started in December 1 9 8 7 .                      It was unsuccessfully submitted on the

     part of all of the defendants that the prosecution was an abuse of process. During

     his ruling, Mr Justice Turner said,

                "It should of course be stated that if a public inquiry is to fulfil the
                reasonable expectations of those who have caused it to be set up, and
                indeed the legitimate expectations of the wider public, that the
                candour in the witnesses who are called to give their evidence is to be
                encouraged. If witnesses, or potential witnesses are conscious that
                w h at they may say at an Inquiry may subsequently be used against
                them one of the prime objectives of the Inquiry might be eliminated,
F               either by the witnesses withholding that required candour or
                alternatively by not coming forward in the first instance."

     I was told that subsequently the prosecution decided not to rely upon the answers

     given by defendants to the Inquiry.

        Mr Jones QC, for the prosecution, who appeared in that case, told me that the

     case against the defendants come to an end part w ay through the prosecution case



                                                              2

D. L. S E L L E R S & C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




     and before the time at which any such answers would have been put into evidence.

     It seems clear that the passage is obiter and it must be doubtful whether or not the
A
     matter was fully argued. Indeed, on page 23 of the transcript of the decision, there

     is a reference to the fact that Mr. Carman QC might advance in the future an

     argument that the admissions made in the course of the formal investigation should
B
     be excluded under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1 9 8 4 .

         Mr Jones in his skeleton argument opposes the submission made by Mr Clegg.

     He draws my attention to the fact that both in the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, being

     conducted under the Chairmanship of Lord Saville of Moodigate and in the

     Lawrence Inquiry, under the Chairmanship of Sir William Macpherson of Clooney,

     the witnesses were given an undertaking that their evidence would not be used to

D their prejudice in any criminal proceedings, other than for perjury.             Mr Jones

     submits that no such undertaking would be necessary if Mr Clegg was right.

         I agree with that submission. Although Mr Clegg drew my attention to cases

     concerned with the privilege against self-incrimination, I do not see how they help
E
     in deciding the issue as to whether or not it would be against public policy to permit

     any answers given during an Inquiry to be used in subsequent civil or criminal

     proceedings. Reluctant as I am to depart from anything said by Mr Justice Turner,
F
     albeit obiter, I am firmly of the view there is no such rule of public policy as that for

     which M r Clegg argued.

          I now give my reasons for the ruling I announced late yesterday afternoon,

G
     namely that the statement made by

     M r Duckenfield for the purposes of the Inquiry and the answers to questions put to



                                                             3
(I
D .L. S E L L E R S & C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




    him during the Inquiry, are in principle admissible, subject to any further argument

    as to that part of the answers which underpins count 5 and relates to an alleged
A

    lie.     I shall deal with that matter, if it is necessary to do so when I consider the

    validity of count 5.                         That will only arise should the application to stay the

    proceedings on the ground of abuse, which I'm hearing starting on 4th January,
B
    should fail.

           Mr Clegg submits that a statement made by Mr Duckenfield on about 5th May

    of 1 9 8 9 and the answers he gave, starting on 24th May of 1 9 8 9 at the Inquiry into

    the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, are inadmissible by virtue of section 7 8 of the

    Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1 9 84 . Section 7 8 provides,

                "(1) In any proceedings the Court may refuse to allow evidence on
                which the prosecution proposes to rely to be given if it appears to the
D               Court that, having regard to all the circumstances in which the
                evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would have
                such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the
                Court ought not to admit it."



    The defence having put before me sufficient credible evidence to raise an argument
E
    that the admissibility of the evidence would be unfair, I approach the issue on the

    basis that the prosecution must satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that the

    admission of the evidence would not have such an adverse effect. I add that in any
F
    event I would have reached the same conclusion had the burden been the higher

    one of being sure.

        During the trial within a trial I heard oral evidence from three witnesses: David

G
    Brummel (whose witness statement will be found at tab 12, of the bundle entitled,

    'Defendant's skeleton submissions and witness statements re admissibility and



                                                                4

     related documents'); Sir Andrew Collins (who was leading counsel to the Inquiry

     and is now a High Court Judge, tab 9); and Mr William Charles Woodward QC (who
A

     was counsel to the South Yorkshire Police in the Inquiry, tab 10). Mr Duckenfield

     chose not to give evidence. Mr Duckenfield was a Chief Superintendent at the time

     and was in overall charge of the policing on the day. He had
B
     become a police officer in 1960.

        Mr Jones QC, for the prosecution, sought to put into evidence three documents.

     For reasons which I have separately given, I ruled that that evidence was

     inadmissible in the form in which he wished to put it before the Court.

         I start with the statement made on or about 5th May of 1 9 89 . Following the

     disaster on 1 5th April of 1 9 89 , Lord Justice Taylor was asked to preside over the

D Inquiry. He was assisted by the West Midlands Police. Understandably, everything

     was done extremely quickly at that stage. The Inquiry opened on 15th May, one

     month after the disaster. On the evidence which I have heard, it appears that Mr

„ Duckenfield handed the statement to the West Midlands Police. That police force
E

     then handed it to the Treasury Solicitor, who provided it to Mr Collins, as he then

     was, to help him in the preparation of his opening.                              Sir Andrew said that in his

     opinion, having regard to the contents of the statement and the circumstances at
F
     the time, Mr Duckenfield probably prepared the statement himself without legal

     advice.        I shall so assume.                       It is submitted by Mr Clegg that in the absence of a

     solicitor, in the presumed absence of any warning against self-incrimination and
Q
     bearing in mind the passage of

     Mr Justice Turner in the Herald of Free Enterprise case, to which I made reference



                                                                        5

     in my earlier ruling, the admission of this evidence would have such an adverse

     effect on the fairness of the proceedings that I ought not to admit it.
A

          Bearing in mind that Mr Duckenfield was a very experienced and senior police

     officer when he made this witness statement, and must have known w hat use

     could be made of it, I can see no justification at all for saying that its admission
B
     would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that I ought

     not to admit it.

        I turn to the answers which he gave before Lord Justice Taylor. Mr Clegg makes

^ a number of submissions, which are helpfully summarised in paragraph 3 .2 and

     following of his skeleton argument. He submits first that, amongst the following

     factors which he says are relevant is (1) the defendant was not represented at the

D Inquiry.             Mr Woodward QC represented the South Yorkshire police, not any

     individual officer: "My approach from the outset was that David Duckenfield and

     Bernard Murray were simply witnesses and not my clients." The passage, as cited

     by Mr Clegg, comes from the witness statement of Mr Woodward. It seems clear
E
     that both Mr Collins and Lord Justice Taylor thought that Mr Woodward was

     representing the police officers. The evidence for that can be found in the witness

     statement of Mr Justice Collins at tab 9 at page 3 8 9 . In paragraph 3 will be found
F
     these words, "throughout the course of the Inquiry there was no doubt in my mind,

     and I'm sure Lord Justice Taylor shared this view, that the police both as a Force

     and individual officers, were represented by Mr Woodward QC, instructed by

     Hammond Suddards." A reference can also be made to the transcript for the first

     day, namely, 1 5th May.                           On that first day submissions were being made by Mr



                                                                   6

     Brown QC regarding the possible representations of the Police Federation.                      Lord

     Justice Taylor, at page tab 9, page 3 9 8 , asked whether he thought there was going
A

     to be a conflict of interests between the Federation and the South Yorkshire Police,

     to which Mr. Brown said he simply did not know. Lord Justice Taylor w ent on to

     say, "My approach has been that when applications were made last month that I
B
     would always be open to further applications if the evidence went in a w ay which

     suggested somebody's interests ought to be represented and was not being up until

     then. I'm reluctant to allow representation, as it were, on the speculative chance

     that there might develop a conflict."                   In tab 9, page 4 0 2 , Lord Justice Taylor,

     according to the transcript, asked Mr Woodward whether he saw any conflict as

     at present, to which Mr Woodward replied, "I rose because of the wording in the

D letter suggesting that there might be. It seems to be not on the horizon at the

     moment." That reference to the letter there is, I assume, a reference to w hat has

     been called in this hearing 'the Salmon Letter' to which I shall return. I shall come

     back to this topic later. Mr Clegg submits that another relevant factor in support
E

     of his submission that the evidence ought to be excluded was, "He was not sent

     a Salmon letter and was not sent a copy of the one sent to the police."                        The

     Salmon principles are helpfully set out in the skeleton argument submitted by the
F
     prosecution. The relevant principles are 2 to 6 and read as follows:

                2. Before any person who is involved in an inquiry is called as a
                witness he should be informed of any allegations which are made
                against him and the substance of the evidence in support of them.
Q
                3. (a) He should be given an adequate opportunity of preparing his
                case and of being assisted by legal advisers.
                  (b) His legal expenses should normally be met out of public funds.



                                                             7
II
D . L . S E L L E R S & C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




                 4. He should have the opportunity of being examined by his own
                 solicitor or counsel and of stating his case in public at the inquiry.

A                5. Any material witnesses he wishes called at the inquiry should if            s.-
                 reasonably practicable, be heard.

                 6. He should have the opportunity of testing by cross-examination
                 conducted by his own solicitor or counsel any evidence which may
                 affect him.
B
     On 9th May of 1 9 8 9 a letter was sent by Mr Brummell, the Treasury Solicitor

     assigned to the Inquiry. That letter will be found set out in full in tab 9, pages 3 9 5

     to 3 9 6 . The letter was sent to Hammond Suddards and sets out what was then

     believed to be the main general criticisms which appeared so far from the evidence

     available to the Inquiry. From the evidence I have heard I draw the inference that

     Mr Duckenfield was shown it or made aware of its contents. As I understood what

D Mr Clegg was saying, he did not dispute that that was a proper inference that could

     be drawn. The prosecution case is that the defendant is guilty of manslaughter

     because, having correctly decided to order the opening of the gates, he failed

     thereafter to take the allegedly necessary and simple steps of closing off access to
E
     the already allegedly over full pens, 3 and 4.                It was in those tw o pens that the

     injuries were caused which led to the 9 6 deaths.                    There is evidence that Mr

     Duckenfield received further details relating to him personally. Even if he had not
F
     received any further details it seems clear to me, having regard to the contents of

     the Salmon letter, and in particular the contents of paragraphs 2 and 3 in so far as

     these charges are concerned, that Mr Duckenfield must have known w hat it was

     that was concerning the Inquiry, namely not preventing persons from entering the

     already overcrowded pens 3 and 4.



                                                               8

          The transcript for day six reveals that Mr Woodward was expressing a concern

     about the position of individual officers. This transcript will be found in three loose

     pages with which I was provided.                          He submitted to Lord Justice Taylor that it

     would be appropriate that officers should have notice of individual matters against

     them, thus giving them an opportunity to either put their minds at rest or have
B
     various matters considered. See G on the first page of that three page document.

     Lord Justice Taylor states, see the second page,

                "As far as specific points of criticism, if there are any, areconcerned,
                this is not a civil case in which every allegation has to be pleaded.
^               The general nature I think of the expected points of possible criticism
                has already been indicated in letters which have been written by
                Counsel for the Inquiry. Insofar as it is possible to be more specific
                at any stage no doubt that can be done between counsel and if in the
                last resort something crops up during the course of the evidence of a
                witness, or indeed after he has finished, which makes it desirable he
D              should be recalled to have an opportunity of dealing with it, that will
                be done. That is, I hope, the best way we can proceed."

     Finally, on the third page of that same short transcript,

     Mr Collins is recorded as saying this,
r
                 "I have already told my learned friend",

     that must be Mr Woodward,

                "I have done that exercise, and he will receive specific matters in
                relation to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. At the moment I have
F              not done it in respect of any other officer but since Mr Duckenfield is
                intended to be either next or next but one and will probably take a
                considerable time, he may have a slight breathing space."

     The transcript, to be found at tab 3, page 51, records

_ Mr Woodward as saying during the evidence of Mr Duckenfield,
G
                "We have been given indication of the allegations that are to be made
                against this particular officer and against the police in particular."



                                                                 9

     It appears, therefore, that Mr Duckenfield did have the more detailed allegations,

     albeit that he would have received them orally from Mr Woodward. I see no merit
A
     in this ground.

          I turn now to the grounds put forward by Mr Clegg and summarised in 3.2(iii)

     of his skeleton argument, namely, 'He was not cautioned when he gave evidence.'
B
     Mr Clegg said in argument that he had meant by that, of course, not warned or not

     told that he had a privilege against self-incrimination. I deal with this matter along

     with the other matters to be found set out in paragraphs 3 .3 , 3 .4 , 3 .5 , 3 .6 , 3 .7

C and 3 .8 of the skeleton argument, which read as follows:



                "3 .3 It was the view of Andrew Collins QC and Lord Justice Taylor
                that they,

D                 "did not believe that there was a realistic         p ro s p e c t of a
                manslaughter prosecution being         brought."

                As a consequence Duckenfield was not cautioned when he gave his
                evidence.

                3 .4 There was a failure to afford Duckenfield the protection of five
^              of the cardinal principles established by Lord Salmon. [Nos. 2-6]

                3 .5 It is submitted that the failure to caution the defendant or afford
                him the protection of the Salmon principles renders the admission into
                evidence of his answers unfair.

F              3 .6 Further it is submitted that in the circumstances of this case
                Duckenfield once giving evidence to the inquiry was in practice
                required to answer (he had not been told that he could not answer).
               Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees
               him a 'fair' trial. The effect of the Inquiry was to offend his right

G
                3 .7 It is the same principle that requires a judge in civil proceedings
                to warn a witness that he need not answer questions that may
                incriminate him and the same privilege that entitles a party to civil

                 3 .8 The defendant may elect to give evidence in support of this
                 submission but no witness statement will be served.

           I start then with the failure to advise Mr Duckenfield of the privilege against

g self-incrimination. It is clear under the law that there is no duty to advise a witness

     but it is custom and practice so to do. Although Mr Woodward was, I accept, not

     acting for Mr Duckenfield, Mr Woodward became concerned about his position. Mr

     Woodward explained that out of a sense of fairness. Although Mr Jones in
C
     cross-examining Mr Woodward was critical of Mr Woodward on this matter, it

     seems to me that Mr Woodward behaved in a way that one would have expected

     of leading counsel.                                By the opening of the Inquiry, a private summons had
D
     been taken out charging someone or somebody with manslaughter. I have no more

     details other than the recollection of Sir Andrew Collins.                          It is clear from the

     evidence there was much talk behind the scenes of manslaughter charges following

^ the Inquiry. Feelings were running very high at this time. It will be remembered that

     blame had been attached to the supporters by at least some newspapers. There

     probably also was a feeling of hostility towards the police for what may well have

F been seen as an attitude of denial of responsibility on their part.

         I turn to Mr Woodward's witness statement, tab 10. In paragraph 10 at page

     4 he mentioned that the "sights" of others might have been on individual officers.

     In paragraph 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 2 0 he sets out the background to an
G
     Inquiry that he was to make of Mr Collins. Those paragraphs read as follows:

                 13.        At some point between 15 May 1 9 8 9 , which was when the


                                                                    11

                evidence to the Inquiry first began, and 2 4 May 1 9 8 9 when David
                 Duckenfield started his own evidence to the Inquiry, I raised with
                Andrew Collins the question of whether David Duckenfield should be
A              cautioned with regard to the question of possible criminal prosecution.
                The question of cautioning was in my mind at that time. My concern
                was that David Duckenfield was not represented at the Inquiry, that
                there were murmurings amongst the Liverpool camp of a prosecution
                of him for manslaughter and that he ought to be advised of his
                entitlement when being invited to give evidence to the Inquiry. I
B              cannot say exactly when it was between 1 5 May 1 9 8 9 and 2 4 May
                 1 9 8 9 that I raised this with Andrew Collins. I cannot recall whether
                it was with specific reference to David Duckenfield or to police
                witnesses generally.
                My raising of the issue with Andrew Collins would have been
                purposeful and fairly formal as I did not know Collins at the Bar. The
                issue of cautioning witnesses was in the legal air at that time. This
C              was after the Herald of Free Enterprise case when talk of prosecutions
                was in the air. I made a point of raising this matter with Collins. I
                wanted to have Lord Justice Taylor's view. Collins was my route to
                Taylor unless I raised it publicly in the course of the Inquiry.

                14. I have a recollection of Lord Justice Taylor saying that he would
D              reconsider further individual representation if any individual requested
                it. No individual would need to seek representation unless a finger
                was pointed at him. No individual officer had been named in the
                "Salmon letter".

                15. I do not recall what I actually said to Collins when I first raised
                the matter with him or whether I broached the subject generally or
^              with regard to specific people. M y concern would have been for those
                who by that time appeared to be the principal actors. When I first
                raised the matter with Collins I had seen enough to cause me to be
                concerned, and that includes what I had made of the material which
                I had seen and the incandescence of the Liverpool camp. In raising
               the matter with Collins I had hoped to get feedback from Lord Justice
F              Taylor and his view. I may have been given Collins' view but I had
                had no proper answer as to Lord Justice Taylor's view.

                16. When I had raised with Collins my concerns about the possible
               need to caution Duckenfield in relation to his evidence before he
               commenced on it, on the basis of risk of potential prosecution for
                manslaughter, Collins had been quite dismissive of my concerns. I
^              have no doubt that I told him that I was not acting for David
                Duckenfield but that I felt that Duckenfield should get some legal
                advice. I felt that Duckenfield, being about to give evidence in the
                witness box without representation or advice, was like a lamb going


                                                               12
I!
S E L L E R S 6c C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




           to slaughter and that he needed to be advised about getting legal
           advice.

            17. I therefore felt a need to write a note to Andrew Collins asking
           him whether he had managed to speak to Lord Justice Taylor on the
           question of prosecutions as I wanted Lord Justice Taylor's views
           given a prospect of manslaughter charges arising.         I have no
           recollection now of how much time had passed between my initial
           raising of this matter with Andrew Collins and my writing the note to
           him. I would have written the note to him before 2 4 May 1989 which
           is the date when David Duckenfield started his evidence to the
           Inquiry.

           18. I have retained the original note.       My handwriting on the note
           reads as follows:-

                       "Andrew - did you manage to speak to PT on the
                       question of prosecutions."

          Although I did not refer specifically in the note to manslaughter it
          would have been obvious to both of us that this is what I was
          inquiring about.  We had mentioned manslaughter in our earlier
          discussion.

           19. I had passed the note across to Andrew Collins in the Town Hall
          in the currency of the sitting. I needed an answer and I thus far had
          not received one. I gave the note to him myself. We were only sitting
          a matter of feet away from each other. I was not interested in
          hearing again what Collins thought. I cannot recall a verbal exchange
          between us at the time that I passed the note to him but there must
          have been one. Collins' view was that I was worrying over nothing.
          The effect of what Collins was telling me was that I had nothing to
          worry over as the law was not like that. This was what Collins had
          told me when we had discussed the matter earlier. I wanted to know
          the view of Lord Justice Taylor. I did not ask Collins for his own view
          although this is what I had received previously.

          2 0. I eventually received written reply from Andrew Collins on the
          same piece of paper on which I had sent him my note. His reply
          reads, "Yes - he said that (since because in part of his view of the
          unreality of suggesting manslaughter) he would leave it to you to raise
          the issue if you thought it necessary". I did not get this answer
          straight away. I do no recall exactly when I received the answer. I
          might have got it back on the same day that I had written my note.
          I might have got it back after the interval or the break for lunch on the
          same day. My impression was that Collins did go away and talk to
D . L . S E L L E R S 6c C o . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




                 Lord Justice Taylor before giving me his reply. My impression of the
                 reply from Collins was that it was quite plain w hat the Inquiry was not
                 going to do. I took Collins' reference to "the issue" to be whether
A                w hat the witnesses would say might incriminate them. I trusted what
                 the Inquiry would not do. Lord Justice Taylor had a job to do but he
                 knew that I was enquiring not about what he would do but about a
                 wider scope of the consequences of a witness incriminating himself.

    In paragraph 21 he said that he knew that there would be further proceedings and
B
    claims for damages. He did not know at that time that David Duckenfield would

    eventually be prosecuted for manslaughter, "But I felt that this would not be an end

    of the matter." In paragraphs 24, 2 5, 26, 2 7 , 29 and 3 0, Mr Woodward wrote as
f
    follows:

               24. I remember David Duckenfield. He seemed to be ill. He was
               pale. I did not know him from before although I would have met him
               before at Snig Hill. He struck me as very odd, as behaving oddly.
               There was something about him. He seemed "shot to pieces". I have
D             an image of a man who was not with it. I got this impression from a
               combination of his appearance, his demeanour and his responses. I
               have no clue as to w hat time of day this meeting took place although
               something tells me that it was round about midday.

               25. I was seeing David Duckenfield because I was concerned for him
               in that he was not legally represented and he was clearly a target for
^             criticism in that he was being substantially blamed by the media and
               the Liverpool group for all that had happened and he had clearly
               played an important part in what had happened.

               2 6. As he was not represented I had a concern for his position, given
               the atmosphere on the part of the Liverpool people, and I thought that
F             someone should talk to him if Lord Justice Taylor was not going to
               give him a warning, as he was not. It seemed to me that this matter
               would not end with the Inquiry.

                27. I told David Duckenfield and those present of my concerns and
                the query that I had raised with Lord Justice Taylor. I told him that
                I did not represent him and that I could not advise him of his own
                personal position, and that my concerns for him were such that I
                thought that he should get legal advice. I may have asked him how he
                was, whether or not he had had legal advice and whether or not he
                was having any medical treatment. I may have told him that he did


                                                                14
D . L. S E L L E R S & C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




                 not have to give evidence and that if he was going to get legal advice
                 it should be before he started giving evidence. He seemed to want to
                 get on with it. I cannot recall what else was said. My purpose was
A               to see him and to tell him to get legal advice.

                 29. I have no precise recollection of how long the discussion was.
                 It was a short discussion, between 10 and 15 minutes perhaps. My
                 approach to him was motivated by personal fairness. I was not
                 professionally required to speak to him. I am not sure how he actually
B               received my advice. He gave me the impression that he just wanted
                to get in the witness box and get it over with and I do not know
                 whether he actually understood the implication of what was
                concerning me. That is why I emphasised that he should seek some
                 independent legal advice.     My impression was that he had not
                 previously had any independent legal advice. It was unclear to me
                what advice he might already have had or from whom he might have
C               had it.

                30. I am fairly sure that at the time of my conversation with David
                Duckenfield I had the card with me, on which I had written my note
                to Collins and on which he had written his reply. I think I might have
                shown it to Duckenfield. I would certainly have told Duckenfield
D               about w hat I had raised with Lord Justice Taylor and I would have
                told him that the gist of Lord Justice Taylor's response was that a
                prosecution for manslaughter was unlikely.




     In evidence, Mr Woodward said that in giving advice to
E
     Mr Duckenfield he told him that there was a whisper of manslaughter charges in the

     air.    He said to him that he thought that in the circumstances, he, Duckenfield,

     ought to have his own legal advice about it. The drift of what he was saying was,
F
     'I don't think it will end here so that he should have his own independent advice

     about his position.' The effect of what he was saying to Mr Duckenfield was, 'This

     is not a guarantee', by that meaning the contents of the note which Mr Collins had

     sent him. Mr Woodward w ent on to say that he was saying to Mr Duckenfield that

     he should get advice.                          He went on to say that he did not know whether Mr



                                                                15
II
O . L . S E L L E R S & C o . / W. L L O V D W O O D L A N D




    Duckenfield did, in fact, get any advice.                              Mr Woodward said that he got the

    impression that he wanted to get on and have it done with, accepting that it was
A
    a surprise.             He said that he thought that whilst Mr Duckenfield was hearing w h at

    I was saying he seemed to want to get on with it and to, "Not mess about with

    law yers.” Although there is reference to the condition in which Mr Duckenfield
B
    found himself, there is nothing to suggest that he did not understand the advice

    that he was being given by Mr Woodward.                                   So although it is true to say Mr

    Woodward was not representing Mr Duckenfield, notwithstanding what Lord

    Justice Taylor and Mr Collins may have thought, it is clear to me that at this vital

    point Mr Woodward was giving him the sort of advice that a lawyer would give,

    who could not himself give the advice, but that it was right that someone else,

D another lawyer, should do so. It seems clear to me that

    Mr Woodward was, in the best traditions of the legal profession, giving M r

    Duckenfield disinterested advice and I reject entirely the criticisms made of Mr

    Woodward by Mr Jones in his cross-examination. Indeed, I could not understand
E
    them.

         There is no evidence from Mr Duckenfield whether he did or did not seek any

    further advice as to why he decided to give evidence following his conversations,
F
    as recorded by Mr Woodward.                                Sir Andrew Collins describes the events which led

    up to the note to which I have referred in paragraphs in his witness statement.                            I

    turn first of all to paragraph 4, which will be found at tab 9 at page 3 9 0 .                         That

^ reads:

                "In terms of the protection of potential witnesses, I did not have any
                power to give any undertaking to any party seeking protection from
O L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. L L O V D W O O D L A N D




                prosecution. Had any party suggested such an undertaking I would
                have consulted Lord Justice Taylor and contacted the Attorney
                General. I consider that had any undertaking been given it would have
A               been in very limited terms. At the time these preliminary matters were    v-
                being considered I did not consider that there could be charges of
                manslaughter brought against any individual from the South Yorkshire
                Police Force. I did not consider that there was sufficient evidence for
                the bringing of any such charges"

B
    In evidence he said that his view, that there was not sufficient evidence for the

    bringing of any charges, was a view that did not and had not changed. In evidence

    he said also that if there had been a reasonable fear that manslaughter charges

^ might have arisen, then they would have gone to the Attorney General for the kind

    of undertaking to which I referred in the ruling I gave earlier. Sir Andrew Collins

    said he thought that it was usual practice to take that course because it was

D important to have all the evidence necessary to conduct the Inquiry properly rather

    than have persons claiming the privilege against self-incrimination and thus possibly

    denying the Tribunal important and relevant evidence.

        In paragraphs 13, 14 and 15 he sets out the background to the note. Paragraph
E
    14 merely sets out the contents of the note to which I have already made

    reference. In paragraphs 13 and 1 5 he states:



F              "13 . At some stage prior to Mr Duckenfield giving evidence to the
               Inquiry, which I now understand to be 2 4 May 1 9 89 , I believe that I
               was approached by Sir William Woodward QC, leading counsel on
               behalf of South Yorkshire Police. Although I do not recall the meeting,
               I have now been shown a note detailing an exchange between Mr
               Woodward and myself. I confirm that it is my handwriting on the
               note and it is apparent from that note that Mr Woodward wanted me
               to speak with Lord Justice Taylor on the question of criminal
               prosecutions of individuals. I do not recall when the note was made
               but it seems likely that it was made prior to Mr Duckenfield giving
               evidence to the Inquiry.


                                                            17
H
O.L. S E L L E R S a C O . / w. l l o v o w o o d l a n d




                 1 5. Although I do not recall speaking to Lord Justice Taylor it is
                apparent from the writing on the note that I must have done. I believe
A              that neither Lord Justice Taylor nor myself thought that any criminal *•
                charges were going to arise out of the Hillsborough disaster. The note
                records that I have indicated to
                Mr Woodward that Lord Justice Taylor had considered that the
                prospect of manslaughter charges was "an unreality". I meant to
                indicate to Mr Woodward that if he was concerned about the
B              possibility of manslaughter charges he should raise with Lord Justice
                Taylor that possibility and what should be done about it. The aspect
                of cautioning a witness prior to giving evidence was never raised by
                Mr Woodward during the Inquiry. I am sure, however, that if in the
                course of giving evidence, a witness was incriminating himself or
                herself in terms of criminal charges Lord Justice Taylor would have
                raised the issue of cautions with the representatives of the particular
^              witness concerned out of his sense of fairness.”

    In paragraph 16 he said,

                "If I had felt that any witnesses were laying themselves open to a
                criminal charge, I would have raised the issue of cautioning. I did not
D              so with David Duckenfield or any other officers because I did not
                believe that there was a realistic prospect of a manslaughter
                prosecution being brought against them, a view which I knew was
                shared by Lord Justice Taylor."



    In paragraph 19 he said,
L
                "During the course of the Inquiry, there was never at any time any
                suggestion that there was inadequate protection for witnesses. I had
                no reason to believe that the legal representatives of each witness
                were not a proper protection for those witnesses. At no time did I
                consider that there was a need to caution any witness in relation to
F              their evidence, on the basis of risk of any potential criminal
                prosecution."



    Mr Clegg submits that, putting the note aside, then this evidence, the evidence of

~ the answers to the Inquiry, must be inadmissible under section 78 because if either

    Lord Justice Taylor or Mr Collins had perceived the risk of prosecution then they

    would have gone to the Attorney General and, as a consequence, the answers


                                                            18

     w hich Mr Duckenfield gave would not have been admissible in any subsequent trial.

     He submits that that is sufficient in itself to make these answers inadmissible under
A

     section 7 8. However, one has to bear in mind that Mr Duckenfield was, as I say,

     a very senior police officer who had been in the Force since 1 9 60 . Secondly, the

     note makes it clear that it was left to Mr Woodward to raise the issue if he thought
B
     it was necessary. As w e have seen in the witness statement of

     Mr Woodward, the contents of the note were drawn to the attention of Mr

     Duckenfield. Thirdly, I have already set out the advice which Mr Woodward gave,
r'
     making it clear that it was a matter for Mr Duckenfield himself.              We have heard

     nothing from

     Mr Duckenfield, as I have said before, given the very sensible advice which he was

D receiving. I do not know how he reacted to that or, indeed, do not know w hat he

     did. In one sense,

     Mr Duckenfield was perhaps in the greater possession of the facts than the Inquiry

„ may have been. He knew that, assuming the prosecution to be right, he had lied
E

     about how the gates had been opened. He was later to accept that he had wrongly

     blamed the supporters for the deaths (see transcript 26th May, page 31 set out at

     tab 3, 2 2 4 ).           Having regard to the matters which I have just outlined, I take the
F
     view that it could not be stated that this evidence is inadmissible under section 78.

          I finally and briefly turn to numbers 2 to 6 of the Salmon principles. I take the

     view that in so far as number 2 is concerned, Mr Duckenfield was informed of the
Q
     allegations which were being made against him and, albeit that he may not have

     known the substance of the evidence in support, he was the officer in charge on



                                                               19

     that day. He had made the decision that the gate should be opened and he would

     know from the letter that he received, if not from any further communication, the
A
     thrust of the criticisms against him. It is right to say that he did not have his own

     lawyer but that has to be seen in the context of the view taken by Lord Justice

     Taylor and Mr Collins that there would not be any manslaughter prosecution and
B
     the advice given to                      Mr Duckenfield by Mr Woodward.          The other three matters

     seemed to be not to be relevant. The issues which I have to decide today, namely

     the admissibility of the answers that he gave to questions posed, even if there was

^ some breach of the Salmon principles it would not be sufficient, in my judgment,

     to make this evidence inadmissible under section 78.

         In conclusion, ( am quite satisfied that this evidence is admissible for the reasons

D I have given.                                                ____________________

Mr Justice Hooper:

The two defendants are charged with manslaughter (Counts 1 and 2) and misconduct in
public office (Count 3) arising out of the events at Hillsborough Stadium on the 15th April
1989. The prosecution is what is commonly known as a private prosecution. The decision to
bring .the proceedings in 1998 was made by the Hillsborough Family Support Group
(“HFS.G”) as a whole (8/30). That group is unincorporated and consists of some 86 of the
bereaved families. Ann Adlington has been seconded by Liverpool City Council to act as the
solicitor for the Group and she laid the informations.
David :Duckenfield (“Duckenfield”) was a chief superintendent in charge of the policing on
that day.       Bernard Murray (“Murray”), a superintendent, was the officer with specific
responsibility for the control room. Following a decision by Duckenfield to order the opening
of the gates, a decision not criticised by the prosecution, 96 people who were watching the
game in pens 3 and 4 of the West Terraces died from traumatic asphyxiation. Duckenfield
also faces a charge of misconduct arising from an admitted lie told by him at the time to the
effect that the gates had been forced open by the Liverpool fans. (Count 5) Count 4 charged
him with perverting the course of justice, a charge which he no longer faces following
intervention by the Attorney-General who entered a “nolle prosequi”.
In this ruling I shall concentrate on Counts 1,2 and 3.
It is the prosecution’s case that the two defendants are guilty of manslaughter because they
failed to prevent a crush in pens 3 and 4 of the West Terraces “by failing between 2.40 and
3.06 pJm. to procure the diversion of spectators entering the ground from the entrance to the
pen.” In argument Mr Jones QC for the prosecution said that his case was that police officers
should have been stationed in front of the tunnel leading to the pen to prevent access. It
appears, at this stage, to be the defence case that neither of the officers, in the situation in
which 'they found themselves, thought about closing off the tunnel or foresaw the risk of
serious injury in the pen if they did not do so. The prosecution submit that they ought to have
done. This is likely to be the most important issue in the case. There may well be a further
issue: if the risk had been foreseen, would it have been possible or practicable to have closed
the tunnel.
It was the worst stadium disaster in British football history and has left the parents and loved
ones of those who died not only with an enduring grief but also with a deep seated and
obviously genuine grievance that those thought responsible have not been prosecuted nor

     indeed even disciplined. They have campaigned long and hard for what they see as justice
     and have attracted wide-spread support.                   Amongst other things of which they have
     complained are the lack o f any apology, the conduct of the inquest, the disparity between the
     damages awarded to the families and to the police officers and a cover-up amounting to a
     conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, particularly on the part of the South Yorkshire
     Police and their then legal advisers.
     It is submitted that the proceedings should now be stayed on the following grounds:
         1. The prosecution is a breach of the defendants’ rights to a fair trial under Article 6(1)}
              of the European Convention on Human Rights.
         2. The prosecution is so oppressive to these defendants, so unfair and so wrong that it
              :should not be allowed to continue.
         3. The pre-trial publicity has been such that no fair trial is possible.
         4. The delay has been such that no fair trial is possible.

     I have necessarily had to be selective. I have chosen those events which are or may be
     relevant to the decisions which I have to make. In particular the media coverage referred to in

          the view that manslaughter charges were not a realistic possibility (see my earlier ruling on

                   control room for information. Mr Duckenfield told them he thought there were
                   fatalities and the game was likely to be abandoned. He also said a gate had been
                   forced apd there had been an inrush of Liverpool supporters. He pointed to one of the
                   television screens focused on gate C by the Leppings Lane turnstiles and said “That’s
                   the gate that’s been forced: there’s been an inrush”. Inevitably Mr Kelly was
                   interviewed a little later live on television. He spoke of the two stories concerning the
                   gate - the fans’ account that the police had opened it; the police assertion that the fans
                   had forced their way in.


                   The Dead and the Injured
                  ' 108. Of the 95 who died the evidence suggests that at least 16 and probably 21 came
                    through gate C after it opened at 2.52 p.m. That is established by the statements of
                    relatives and friends who came through with them but survived.


                   ,111. Although the great majority o f those who died were in pen 3 at least five were in
                    pen 4. Most deaths occurred at the front of the pens but there were a few fatalities
                    further back.


                   Tart 11
                   iWhy did it happen?
                    The Archbishop of York, Dr John Habgood, preaching at the Hillsborough Memorial
                   JService on 23 April 1989 said:
                              “Events o f the magnitude of Hillsborough don’t usually happen just for one
                              single reason, nor is it usually possible to pin the blame on one single
                              scapegoat ...    Disasters happen because a whole series of mistakes,
                              misjudgments and mischances happen to come together in a deadly
                              combination.’’
                    115. This disaster was the worst in the history of British football. It happened
                   •because pens 3 and 4 became grossly overcrowded. They were uncomfortably
                   'overcrowded by 2.50 p.m. at least to a degree which required that they should be
                   .closed to further arrivals. Even the numbers coming through the turnstiles in the last
                    10 minutes would have increased the pressure beyond danger point and there would
                    have been injuries if not fatalities. As it was the influx through gate C after 2.52 p.m.
                    so increased the pressure in the two pens as to cause fatal crushing.

                     Summary
                    ■ 183. Although the police had accepted de facto responsibility for monitoring the pens
                     their policy on the day was to leave fans to “find their own level” and to concentrate
                     their own attention on possible disorder. Whilst in theory the police would intervene
                     if a pen became “full” in practice they permitted the test of fullness to be what the fans
                     would tolerate.

                    • 184. By 2.52 p.m. when gate C was opened pens 3 and 4 were over-full even by this
                     test. Many were uncomfortable. To allow any more into those pens was likely to

               Summary
              • 228. The layout of the turnstiles and the number they were required to serve left no
              ; margin of safety against an uneven flow of fans. Because police strategy in advance
              • and on the day did not cater for it the arrival of a large number of supporters between
              . 2.30 p.m. and 2.40 p.m. created an unmanageable crush. The presence of a substantial
              ; minority of fans who had drunk too much aggravated that problem. Having lost
              ' control and rejected the option of postponing kick-off the police were faced with a
              • serious danger o f deaths or injuries. They were left therefore with no alternative but
              ■ to open the gates. Superintendent Marshall was right at that stage to ask for it andM r
              ‘ Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects of so dramatic a step required
                other action.

               The Blunder on opening the gates
              ' 229. The decision to order the opening of the gates was not accompanied or followed
              . by any other order to deal with the consequences. When gate C was opened a steady
                stream of about 2,000 fans poured through it over some five minutes. Clearly they
                were going to go into the ground somewhere and unless they were diverted their
                 likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. No warning was
              •issued from the control room that the gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse
                were not alerted. Neither the Club control room nor the Chief Steward at the
              : Leppings Lane end was warned. Not even Mr Greenwood, the Ground Commander,
                was informed. From 2.47 p.m. when Mr Marshall made his first request until 2.52
               :p.m. when Mr Duckenfield acceded to it there were five minutes in which orders
                 could have been given as to how the influx was to be absorbed. It was not done. In
                 evidence Mr Duckenfield began by saying that no officer made any wrong decision
               'but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. He said he did not consider where
                 the people would go when the gate opened. Even after it opened, when he could see
                 the influx on the television screen, no order was given to steer the'fans to the wing
               Ipens. Mr Duckenfield said it did not cross his mind to detail officers on the concourse
               :to shut off the tunnel. Those officers could not have known from their position how
               •full pens 3 and 4 were. That was a matter for the control room to monitor from its
                ■own observations and using intelligence from around the ground.

               ;230. Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 p.m. the tunnel should have been closed off
               ;whether gate C was to be opened or not. The exercise was a simple one and had been
               ;carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was for a few officers to act as a cordon at
               ;the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately the 1988 closure
               ■seems to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time. It did not
               •figure in the debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 1989.


                ;231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where
                !there was a view of the pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be
                 closed. If orders had been given to that effect when gate C was opened the fans could

                been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the fust magnitude.


              ' 232. Significantly, when permission was given to open gate A, Mr Duckenfield did
                 order serials to go to that part of the concourse to monitor the influx towards the north
                 stand. He did this because he feared that if fans went to the north stand without
                 tickets, they would not get seats and there being no perimeter fences at the north side, .
              . they might invade the pitch. This illustrates again the preoccupation with avoiding
                 pitch invasion as against safety and the risks of overcrowding. Because those entering
               ; through gate C could not get onto the pitch it was not thought necessary to alert
               ' officers to monitor them. The possibility of overcrowding simply was not considered.

               : B rief summary of causes
                 265. The immediate cause o f the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the
                 failure when gate C was opened to cut off access to the central pens which were
                 already overfull.

                 266. They were already overfull because no safe maximum capacities had been laid
                 down, no attempt was made to control entry to individual pens numerically and there
                 was no effective visual monitoring of crowd density.

                 280. By contrast, with some notable exceptions, the senior officers in command were
                , defensive and evasive witnesses. Their feelings of grief and sorrow were obvious and
                  genuine. No doubt those feelings were intensified by the knowledge that such a
                  disaster had occurred under their management. But, neither their handling of
                : problems on the day nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities of
                !leadership to be expected of their rank.


                 281. Mr Duckenfield leant heavily on Mr Murray’s experience. Between them they
                •misjudged the build-up at the turnstiles and did little about it until they received Mr
                 Marshall’s request to open the gate. They did not, for example, check the turnstile
                 figures available from Club control or check with Tango units as to the numbers still
                •to come. They did not alert Mr Greenwood to the situation at the fringe of his area of
                 command. They gave no instructions as to the management of the crowd at Leppings
                 Lane. Inflexibly they declined to postpone kick-off.


                  282. When Mr Marshall’s request came Mr Duckenfield’s capacity to take decisions
                  and give 6rders seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the opening of the
                  gates, he failed to give necessary consequential orders or to exert any control when the
                  disaster occurred. He misinterpreted the emergence of fans from pens 3 and 4. When
                  he was unsure of the problem he sent others down to “assess the situation” rather than
                 ‘ descend to see for himself. He gave no information to the crowd.

                  '283. Most surprisingly he gave Mr Kelly and others to think that there had been an
                   inrush due to Liverpool fans forcing open a gate. This was not only untruthful, it set
                   off a widely reported allegation against the supporters which caused grave offence and
                   distress. It revived against football fans, and especially those from Liverpool,
                   accusations of hooliganism which caused reaction not only nationwide but from
                  :Europe too. I can only assume that Mr Duckenfield’s lack of candour on this occasion
                  ■ was out of character. He said his reason for not telling the truth was that if the crowd
                  ibecame aware of it there might be a very hostile reaction and this might impede rescue
                   work. He did not wish to divulge what had happened until he had spoken to a senior
                   officer. However, reluctance to tell Mr Kelly the truth did not require that he be told a
                   falsehood. Moreover, although Assistant Chief Constable Jackson was at hand, Mr
                   Duckenfield did not disclose the truth to him until much later.


                  ' 284. The likeliest explanation of Mr Duckenfield’s conduct is that he simply could
                    not face the enormity of the decision to open the gates and all that flowed therefrom.
                    That would explain what he said to Mr Kelly, what he did not say to Mr Jackson, his
                    aversion to addressing the crowd and his failure to take effective control o f the
                    disaster situation. He froze.
                   The Police Case at the Inquiry
                   285. It is a matter of regret that at the hearing and in their submissions the South
                  =Yorkshire Police were not prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in
                  • what occurred. Mr Duckenfield, under pressure of cross-examination, apologised for
                  Iblaming the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But, that apart, the police case was
                   to blame the fans for being late and drunk and to blame the Club for failing to monitor
                   the pens. It was argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate
                   C but was due to barrier 124a being defective. Such an unrealistic approach gives
                   cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been leamt. It would have been far more
                   seemly and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.

           Murray interviewed under caution in the presence of his solicitor by a Detective Chief
           Superintendent. Some 200 pages o f interview. (File 6) He was told at the outset that:
                      “Following a public enquiry and report the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police
                      consulted with the Director of Public Prosecutions and as a result West Midland
                      police were requested to do a criminal investigation. This investigation came at the
                    ! same time as certain members of the public decided to make specific allegations
                    ; against named police officers. You are one of those officers and you have already
                      been served with Regulation 7 [disciplinary] Notice dealing with specific complaints.
                      The nature of those complaints and the particular duty you were performing at
                      Hillsborough on the 15lh April 1989 suggests that you may have contributed to the
                      deaths of some of those that died. Also that you may have failed to perform your
                    . lawful duty as a Police Officer ...”

           Murray was then cautioned that he did not have to say anything unless he wished to do so
           “but what you say may be given in evidence”. Having answered many questions Murray was
           told (483):
                     ■ “The final thing that I need to say to you is that the facts will be reported to the
                      Director of Public Prosecutions and it will be a matter for him to decide whether any
                     . criminal offences have been committed.”

            The appropriate Code of Practice required the caution to be given if there were grounds to
            suspect a person of an offence.

      DPP receives a joint opinion from Gareth Williams QC (as he then was) and Peter Birts QC
      as to whether there should be prosecutions. At the conclusion of the hearing I asked the DPP
       to provide me with a copy, which was then made available (subject to some irrelevant editing)
       to the prosecution and the defendants. I received further oral submissions dated 13,14 and 18
      January. Insofar as the law is concerned the authors of the opinion wrote;
                 “(2) Definition of manslaughter
               . 57. Involuntary manslaughter is committed when a person causes the death of another
                 either (1) intending to do an act which, whether he knows it or not, is unlawful and
                 dangerous in that it is likely to cause direct personal injury (“an unlawful and
                 dangerous act”), or (2) intending to do an act which creates an obvious and serious
                 risk o f causing personal injury (a) not giving thought to the possibility of such risk, .or
                 (b) having recognised that there was some risk involved, nonetheless going on to take
                 it (“recklessness” as defined by Lord Diplock in R v Lawrence \ 19821 AC 510).

                 58. To amount to manslaughter a person’s conduct need not be the only cause of the
                 death, but it must be a substantial cause in that it contributed significantly to the
                 result. Whether it did so contribute is generally a question o f fact for the jury: Pagett
                 (1983) 76 Cr. App Rep 279,287-91.

                  59. It may also be that manslaughter is committed if the person causing the death
                ■ intends to do an act, or omits to do an act where there is a duty to do so, being grossly
                ■ negligent whether death or serious personal injury results (“gross negligence"): see
                  e.g. Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, 6th ed. (1988) at p 345. The law is at present
                  uncertain whether gross negligence still exists as a separate head of liability, two
                  recent authorities having held that the earlier cases where manslaughter is defined in
                : terms of negligence should not be followed and that Lord Diplock’s test should be
                ' applied universally.

                  60. In Seymour (1983) 76 Cr. App Rep 211, Watkins LJ, giving the judgment of the
                  Court o f Appeal in a reckless driving case, said:
                         “... we are of the view that it is no longer necessary or helpful to make
                       ' reference to compensation and negligence. The Lawrence direction on
                          recklessness is comprehensive and of general application to all offences,
                          including manslaughter involving the driving of motor vehicles recklessly and
                          should be given to juries without in any way being diluted. Whether a driver
                          at the material time was conscious of the risk he was running or gave no
                          thought to its existence, is a matter which affects punishment for which
                          purposes the judge will have to decide, if he can, giving the benefit of doubt to

                   ' 61. In Kong Cheuk Kwan v R (1985) 82 Cr. App Rep 18 Lord Roskill, giving the
                     opinion of the Privy Council, said at p 25:
                            “Their Lordships are of the view that the present state of the relevant law in
                            England and Wales ... is clear. The model direction suggested in Lawrence
                            and held in Seymour equally applicable to cases of motor manslaughter
                            requires, first, that the vehicle was in fact being driven in such a manner as to
                            create an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to another and
                            secondly that the defendant so drove either without having given any thought
                            to the possibility of there being such a risk or having recognised that there was
                            such a risk nevertheless took it.
                            In principle their Lordships see no reason why a comparable direction should
                            not have been given in the present case as regards that part of the case which
                            concerned the alleged navigation of the Fiving Goldfinch by Kong and indeed
                            as regards the alleged navigation of the Fiving Flamingo by the other two
                            defendants. Did their respective acts of navigation create an obvious and
                            serious risk of causing physical damage to some other ship and thus to other
                            persons who might have been travelling in the area of the collision at the
                             material time? If so did any of the defendants ... so navigate either without
                            having given any thought to the possibility o f that risk or, while recognising
                            that the risk existed, take that risk?”
                     At p 26, Lord Roskill said:
                             “Their Lordships ... respectively agree with the comment made by Watkins LJ
                             ... in Seymour.”

                     62. However, as pointed out by Smith and Hogan (6th ed. (1988) at p 353), whilst the
                     clear implication from Kong Cheuk Kwan is that there is no longer any separate test
                     of gross negligence in manslaughter, it may be that the courts would not be prepared
                     to exclude it altogether in an appropriate case. Some support for this view is found in
                     GoodfeHow (1986) 83 Cr. App Rep 23, where Lord Lane LCJ said that the question m
                     Kong Cheuk Kwan was whether the defendant was “guilty of recklessness (or gross
                    .negligence)”.

                      63. We consider it right in the circumstances o f Hillsborough to approach the
                      evidence on the basis that the gross negligence test is sufficient to establish the
                    . offence of manslaughter and we propose to advise accordingly.

                     (3) Neglect by police
                    , 64. When gross negligence or manslaughter by neglect is alleged against the police,
                      however, authority indicates a more detailed test of liability. In R v W est London
                      C oroner’s Court, tx p Gray [1988] QB 467, allegations were made against police
                      following the death of a man while in police custody concerning the use of force
                      against him and failure to summon an ambulance promptly when he became
                      unconscious. The coroner’s directions to the jury as to unlawful killing were quashed
                      by the Divisional Court, which held that a coroner directing a jury on manslaughter
                      comprising unlawful killing alleged to have occurred because of neglect by police was
                      required to direct them as follows:

                              (1) that they had to be satisfied of four ingredients, namely (a) that the police
                              were under a duty to have regard to the health and welfare of the deceased, (b)
                              that in the circumstances there was a failure to do what should have been done
                              for the health and welfare o f the deceased, (c) that the failure amounted to a
                              substantial cause of death, and (d) that the failure amounted to recklessness;
                              (2) that the test of “recklessness” was whether a police officer, having regard
                              to his duty, was indifferent to an obvious and serious risk to the health and
                              welfare o f the deceased or, recognising that risk to be present, deliberately
                              chose to run it by doing nothing about it;
                              (3) that a failure to appreciate that there was such a risk was not by itself
                              sufficient to amount to recklessness; and
                              (4) that the jury could only return a verdict of unlawful killing if they could
                              attribute the unlawful conduct to a single police officer.

                     65. Plainly those directions are those to be given in any criminal prosecution of a
                   . police officer where omission to act is alleged to have caused death. In our view they
                   ' have a direct bearing on our consideration of the evidence in this case.”

          In relation to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield the authors wrote:
                    “87. Clearly there was no unlawful and dangerous act on his part or intended by him
                   .which would found the first head of liability in involuntary manslaughter. But in
                    failing to postpone the kick-off, or to order the closure of the tunnel after the opening
                    of gate C, or both, did he intend an act which created an obvious and serious risk o f
                   •causing personal injury, either not giving thought to the possibility of such risk, or
                    having recognised that there was some risk involved nonetheless go on to take it?

                    88. We consider that there are difficulties in proving that he intended to do an act
                    which created an obvious and serious risk of causing personal injury. In the first place
                   •there was no “ act” as such, but an omission or omissions to act which contributed to a
                   •rapidly developing state of affairs ending in serious risk of injury. But was it an
                   •obvious risk at the time? We think not. The complexity of the disaster as now known
                   •to those who have analysed it in hindsight demonstrates that there must be grave
                    doubt as to whether the omissions created a risk which was obvious to anyone at the
                    time. The considerations here are, of course, wholly different from the driving cases
                    or the collision at sea in the Kong Cheuk Kwan case.

                   •89. We conclude, therefore, that there is insufficient evidence on which to found a
                   'charge of recklessness against Mr Duckenfield. Nor is there evidence that he was
                     grossly negligent in failing to act as mentioned above. We bear in mind particularly
                     the judgment o f the Divisional Court in the West London Coroner’s Court case, the
                   : requirements o f which are not in our view satisfied.

                   •90. It follows, and we have come to the clear conclusion, that there is no evidence
                   ; that Mr Duckenfield was wilfully neglectful of his duty or was culpable so as to have
                   !committed the offence of culpable misfeasance.

                    .91. We conclude that there is no sufficient evidence of any criminal offence having
                    • been committed by Mr Duckenfield.”

       DPP announces that there will be no prosecutions. In a letter to HFSG dated 27 July 1998,
       the CPS explained in outline the 1990 decision. The letter explained that the CPS code
             I
       requires a Crown prosecutor to be satisfied that there is enough evidence to provide a realistic
       prospect of conviction, that is, a conviction is more likely than not. The letter went on to
       state that the reason for not prosecuting was the insufficiency of evidence to justify criminal
       proceedings.

       ‘The Steering Group of Solicitors’ who formed the ‘Hillsborough Steering Committee’”.

       part ini the inquest, Mr Douglas Fraser and Miss Elizabeth Steel, as she then was, the former
       playing the far greater role. A barrister, Mr King, was instructed by the Committee. “The
              I
       Steering Committee was instructed by a group of forty-three families who each eventually
       contributed £3.500 ...” “an enormous burden” to many of them. (AA, 8/33)

       of 9-2.j
                     “The verdicts of accidental death in 1991 were demoralising for the families .... The

          the elements of the offence of manslaughter. McCowan LJ. giving his judgment, with which
          Turner, J. agreed, said: (pages 8-9 of the transcript)
                    •“Assuming, without deciding, that there was a mis-direction, no blame can be attached
                      to the Coroner since he summed up as he was told to do by the Divisional Court and
                    : with the approval of counsel for the relatives. That Mr Jones accepts. What exactly is
                    ; it that Mr Jones would have the Coroner say? He gave us a long passage ending with
                    ; these words:
                    ;          ‘... that the attempted avoidance of the perceived risk, namely by opening the
                               gates, was attended by such a high degree of negligence that it justifies a
                               conviction for unlawful killing”.
                    ; So directed, he submits, the jury could have found unlawful killing. But there is
                    •nothing to say they would have done. The verdict they in fact brought in was a
                       perfectly rational one.
                     ' What then, we ask, would be the point of sending the matter back for another inquest?
                     : Mr Jones’s answer was that, whatever the verdict might prove to be, the function of
                       the jury would have been fulfilled. He agreed that no prosecution of any police officer
                       would result because the decision was taken as long ago as September 1990 (before
                     1the main inquest) that no one should be prosecuted. It is, he said, a point of legal
                     .purity.’’

           In rejecting the application to add this ground the Court took the view that it had been made
           far too; late and, if successful, would have achieved nothing of value.

           Granada television broadcast Jimmy McGovern’s dramatised reconstruction “Hillsborough”.
           Watchbd by some 7 million people. Included in the film were very moving accounts of the
           plight bf the bereaved families on the day and thereafter. The film portrays Duckenfield in a
           very unsympathetic manner. The film also included allegations that video tapes had been
            stolen by South Yorkshire Police as part of a cover-up, allegations that police had deliberately
            and falsely blamed failure to see overcrowding in pens 3 and 4 on the fact that camera 5 was
            defective, that evidence from video tapes of what was filmed by camera 5 deliberately
            suppressed and concealed, that the evidence of Mr Houldsworth, a video technician at
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, was deliberately withheld from the Inquest jury and that

      Lord justice Stuart-Smith’s report presented to Parliament. Having considered and rejected
      the allegations contained in the Hillsborough film, he concluded that there was no basis for
      any further public enquiry and no basis for a renewed application to quash the verdict of the
      inquest, that there was no material that should be put before the DPP or the police disciplinary
      authorities. He further concluded that none of the evidence which he had been asked to
               i

      consider added anything significant to the evidence that was available to Lord Taylor’s

      have been preferable if alterations to a few of the statements had not been made. He wrote in
      paragraph 57:
                     “The causes of the disaster were many and complex. So far as the [defendants] were
                   . concerned, the prosecution would have to prove to the high standard required for a
                   ■ criminal conviction that the failure to give the order to close off the tunnel when Gate
                     C was opened amounted to a serious degree of recklessness necessary to constitute
                   . manslaughter”

       The Home Secretary announced in Parliament that he, the Attorney General and the DPP had
       each considered the report very carefully and had no reason to doubt the conclusions. The
       Minister said that the system had failed the families and cited a passage from Chapter 7 of his
       report,; in which -Stuait-Smith LJ wrote that he understood the dismay felt by the families that
       no individual has been personally held to account in a criminal court, in disciplinary
       proceedings or even to the extent of losing his job.

      Under}the headline “Revealed- Hillsborough Police altered statements” the Sunday Telegraph
      reported: (Tab 3/76 of Media File):
                 “Dozens of statements made by police officers on duty at the Hillsborough soccer
               , ground at the time of the disaster were altered to remove their initial criticisms of the
                 South Yorkshire force, an investigation by The Sunday Telegraph has found.
                 Hundreds of sentences which criticised crowd control at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final
                 at the Sheffield ground were deleted or amended.
                 The original written recollections were changed within a month on the advice of
                 solicitors acting for South Yorkshire police or the force itself. It was the amended
                 statements which were presented to future inquiries into the disaster. Today’s
               : disclosures put renewed pressure on Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, to order a new
                 public inquiry just weeks before the 10th anniversary o f the tragedy,, in which
               ■ overcrowding and late arrivals led to 96 people being crushed to death and another
                 400 injured.
                (Trevor Hicks, chairman o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG), said
                • yesterday the new study revealed a scale of statement altering which had been greatly
                 underestimated by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's “scrutiny of evidence" last year.
                 “The sheer scale o f the altering of the statements is an absolute disgrace," said Mr
                .Hicks, who lost his only two children, Sarah 19, and Victoria, 15, at the match. •
                 The disclosures come as Mr Straw faced growing criticism yesterday of the bungled
                handling of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry report.
                 Yesterday South Yorkshire police denied that there was a need for a public inquiry
                 and said the alterations had been examined by Lord Stuart-Smith who decided they
                 did not affect the inquiries’ outcomes or the 1991 inquest where the jury returned
                 verdicts of accidental death."

       The statements referred to are, it appears, the statements which had been considered by
       Stuart-Smith LJ and deposited in the House of Commons library by the Home Secretary
       following his announcement. That theme was developed in the Independent (3/77) and
       Yorkshire Post (3/78) on 1.03-99. The Yorkshire Post cited Mr Hicks as saying that all that
       Stuart-Smith had done was to “scrimp" across the surface.

          Ann Adlington writes to Professor Scraton, thought to have been behind the story in the
          Sunday Telegraph, asking whether, in his new book “Hillsborough-the Truth”, he had
          included anything about the guilt of either defendant to which he replied that he had not:
          “References to either former officer are restricted solely to that which is already in the public
          domain."


          21.03.99
          The Sunday Mirror writes about a "disturbing new book” by Professor Scraton who says that
          around1a hundred first-hand recollections of Hillsborough were altered in a damage limitation
          exercise by the South Yorkshire Police and the “censored” statements were submitted as
          evidence to the Taylor inquiry. (Tab 3/79 of Media file) The newspaper reported that “The
          statement changes became apparent when Lord Justice Stuart-Smith carried out” his enquiry.

          The Independent publishes a review of Professor Scraton’s new book:
                     “I read this book in a fog of anger. At the disaster itself, naturally, but also at the way
                     the establishment ganged together to make sure that the truth - a scarcely believable
                     story of incompetence and mendacity - was never officially told.
                     Let’s establish a couple of facts: Hillsborough was not caused by alcohol and
                     violence; Liverpool people had not, in Brian Clough’s words, “killed their own”. A
                     combination of police incompetence and structural defects at the ground caused the
                     disaster. How the world reacted to it was conditioned by the first action of the man in
                    '.charge, Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield (who had no experience of such
                    :events): he informed Graham Kelly that Gate C had been forced by drunken fans.
                      In fact it was opened by the police. Kelly innocently passed this on in a TV interview.
                      One is left hoping that Mr Duckenfield, who retired through “ill health” to pre-empt
                      disciplinary proceedings, wakes up every morning full of remorse.
                     •Afterwards the police questioned survivors and bereaved with appalling insensitivity,
                      trying desperately to establish that Leppings Lane that Saturday afternoon had been
                      populated by insensate, aggressive drunkards intent on self-destruction.

                    when told by the mother of victim Andrew Sefton that he neither smoked nor drank,
                    turned to his colleague and said: “She’ll be telling us next he’s a bloody virgin!’’; the
                    remark to a family member by Mr Justice Stuart-Smith on the steps of the Liverpool
                  ' Maritime Museum before the so-called independent scrutiny: “Have you got a few of
                    your people or are they like the Liverpool fans, turning up at the last minute?”
                  ' The story of the Hillsborough disaster is, in the end, grimly familiar: the little people,
                    the ordinary people, the you and the me, we don’t count. Not really. Alive or dead.”


          16.04.99
         The day after the events of 10 years before had been marked in Liverpool by a minute of
         silence and in Anfield Stadium by speeches and music, the Independent reported that the
          families and the entire city of Liverpool “want to see police officers in the dock, charged
         with neglect and incompetence”. “Yesterday was all about remembrance. It did credit to a
          city and its people in its simplicity and reverence. But under the surface the rage and cries for
          revenge and punishment are still strong. It may be that someday those now broken and
          despised men, like Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and several of his named
          colleagues, may have to answer for their disastrous decisions on that day. Others may have to
          explain the lies and deceit that was rife among South Yorkshire police in the following years.
          But they did not.set out to kill anyone on that spring afternoon. It was the Glory game itself.”
          (Tab 3/91-92 of Media File) The Mirror reported on the same day the words of Mr Hicks at
          the Stadium referring to the astonishing verdict of the coroner’s jury and to the alteration of
          150 statements, many significantly, “If that isn’t wrong I don’t know what is.” The full text
          of Mr Hicks’ statement can be found in Tab 6/6 of the Media File, itself taken from the HFSG
          website.       In another article reference was made to the length of time taken to bring the
          Lockerbie suspects and a Nazi war criminal to trial: “... the families of the 96 deserve justice.

       Duckenfield and Murray, unreported 31/01/1999 (bundle 12 divider PQ).                    Giving the
       judgment of the Divisional Court, Laws LJ said:
             ' “Representations had first been made to the DPP on behalf of D (Duckenfield] and M
                [Murray] in early July 1998, after the commencement of the proceedings in the South
             : Sefton Petty Sessional Division which proved abortive.               In the course of
                correspondence the HFSG again contended that it had discovered new evidence,
                which, it was said, had not been before Lord Taylor, the DPP, the Coroner, or Stuart-
                Smith LJ. At length, after AA’s [Ann Adlington] informations had been laid in the
                Leeds Petty Sessional Division, the considered views of the DPP as to the approach to
              = be taken to a request to take over and discontinue a private prosecution were set out in
              • a letter to the HFSG on 27 July 1998. The letter did not contain a decision, but it
              : explained the DPP’s policy:
                          ‘The policy where proceedings have been commenced by a private prosecutor
                          builds on that contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The right to bring
                          a private prosecution is preserved by s.6(l)... subject to the power under s.6(2).
                          The CPS will take over a private prosecution where there is a particular need
                          for it to do so on behalf of the public...
                          In the instant case where we have been asked by the defendants to take over
                          the prosecution in order to discontinue it, we would do so if one (or more) of
                          the following circumstances applies:
                                    • There is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution
                                         commenced in these circumstances would be unfounded, and
                                         would, therefore be an abuse of the right to bring a prosecution.
                                    • The public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly
                                         outweigh those factors tending in favour.
                                    • The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.
                          The CPS would then regard itself as having to act in accordance with our
                           policy.
                           If none of the above apply there would be no need for the CPS to become
                :          involved and we would not interfere with the private prosecution.
                           Clearly there is a distinction between the ‘realistic prospect of conviction’ test
                           in the Code [the Code for Crown Prosecutors issued by the DPP under s. 10 of
                           the 1985 Act] and the ‘clearly no case to answer’ test mentioned above.
                           Accordingly we recognise that there will be some cases which do not meet the
                           CPS Code tests where nevertheless we will not intervene. It has been
                           considered that to apply the Code tests to private prosecutions would unfairly
                            limit the right of individuals to bring their own cases.
                           Before this decision can properly be made the CPS must be assured that all
                            relevant material has been considered...
                            Until there has been a detailed review of the many papers in the case the
                            Crown’s position cannot be determined...’
                    There followed very substantial representations from D and M and from the HFSG. ...
                  • the DPP communicated his decision not to intervene, as I have said by letter of 18
                  ' December 1998. The letter merely stated:
                             ‘We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties and
                             all the relevant circumstances of the case. We have concluded that we should
                             not intervene to take over any of the charges.’

                                                                  •21 •

                  . letter o f 1 February 1999 (the ‘reasons letter’) from the CPS’ Casework Director to
                  , M’s solicitor form which it is necessary to cite at some length:
                             ‘As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general principles
                             applied by the Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to continue a
                             prosecution it has taken over; or whether to institute proceedings, or whether
                             to advise the police to do so. It is correct that the CPS decided in 1997 that the
                             evidence available at that time was not sufficient, in its view, to provide a
                             realistic prospect of the conviction of either your client or Mr Duckenfield for
                             any offence. However, it does not follow that, when considering the evidence
                             and the representations submitted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves
                             on behalf of your client, the CPS should seek merely to identify whether there
                             is now any new evidence sufficient to provide a realistic prospect o f a
                             conviction. The decision whether to intervene in a private prosecution with a
                             view to terminating it calls for different considerations to be applied. It is
                             quite possible for a private prosecution to continue, notwithstanding that the
                             CPS is not satisfied, on the basis of its own assessment of the strength of the
                              evidence, that the evidence would pass the evidential sufficiency test in the
                              Code (that there should be a ‘realistic prospect of a conviction1).
                             In broad terms, the reason for this is that s.6(l)... specifically preserved the
                              right of private individuals and prosecuting authorities and bodies other than
                              the CPS to bring criminal proceedings. This right is subject (among other
                              limitations) to the limitation in s.6(2) that the CPS may nevertheless take over
                              the proceedings with a view either to conducting or to terminating those
                              proceedings.
                              Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors
                              when deciding whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the
                              evidential sufficiency test in the Code when deciding whether there is a case to
                              answer. The Service therefore recognises that it is not appropriate to intervene
                              to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That general principle
                              has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its Consultation Paper
                              No. 149 ‘Consents to Prosecution’ (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).
                               (The letter then proceeds to set out the DPP’s policy in the same terms as those
                               in which it had earlier been described by the three “bullet-points" in the letter
                               of 27 July 1998, save that it gives instances of the “public interest factors" test
                               as follows:
                                        ‘examples might be where the prosecution is malicious, or vexatious;
                                       or the offence is one for which the defendant should clearly have been
                                       cautioned; or where, although the offence may be serious, the
                                        defendant is terminally ill.’
                               Then the letter continues as follows]
                               In this case, 1 took the decision not to intervene... I concluded in respect o f the
                               charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty (which,
                    ;           for the avoidance of doubt, were each considered against each individual
                                separately) that I could not say that there is clearly no case to answer. It was
                                not right, therefore, for the Service to take over the proceedings with a view to
                                terminating them.

                                1 also considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest
                                factors that should lead to the Service intervening with a view to
                                                                     •   22   •

                           discontinuance, but I came to the conclusion that any public interest factors
                           tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour; nor did I
                           consider that the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of
                           justice...

       The Divisional court concluded that the DPP’s policy was a lawful one (page 22). The Court
       went :on to consider what it described as the real question: had the policy been lawfully
       applied? Dealing with the DPP's judgment on the issue of public interest, the Court said:
                 “Mr Harrison submitted that in the light of evetything that had gone before, and not
                  least Stuart-Smith LJ’s Scrutiny, there were no public interest factors favouring
                  continuation of the prosecutions of D and M. He said that there is nothing in the
                  reasons letter to show that the DPP accepted the suggestion, urged forcefully and at
                  length by the HFSG in the course of their representations, that further evidence had
               : come to light since the Scrutiny. With this latter proposition I agree. But the reasons
                  letter clearly implies an acceptance that some factors existed which favoured the
                  prosecutions. It stated: “I came to the conclusion that any public interest factors
               ; tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour”, What were
                  those in favour? If in truth there were no factors which a reasonable decision-maker
                  could regard as going in favour of the prosecutions, then the DPP’s decision would be
                  vulnerable to a challenge on'Wednesbury grounds (as indeed Mr Harrison claims it is)
                  since there would be nothing in public interest terms to weight in the scales against
                  discontinuance. When the case was opened there was no affidavit from the DPP
                  dealing with the point, nor did Mr Havers’ skeleton argument articulate any such
                  factors, Mr Newell swore an affidavit for the DPP on 22 March 1999. He is the CPS’
                ; Director of Casework and the author of the reasons letter. Paras 2 - 4 are as follows:
                           ‘2. As I now recall, the public interest factors tending against ptosecution
                           which I considered were as follows:
                                   (1) Previous reviews of the case, in particular those carried out by the
                                   DPP when considering the question whether criminal proceedings
                                   should be taken against Mx Duckenfield and Mr Murray and the more
                                   recent report of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.
                                   (2) The fact that the Applicants had been told on previous occasions
                                   that the DPP did not intend to prosecute.
                 1                 (3) The delay which had occurred between the commission of the
                                    alleged offences and the commencement of the prosecution and its
                                    likely effect on the Applicants, although I took the view that delay may
                                    be offset by the seriousness of the alleged offences (as is reflected in
                                    paragraph 6.5(d) of the Code...).
                                    (4) The effect of the delay on the evidence, for example in terms of the
                 1                 potential impairment of the recollections of witnesses.
                                    (5) The assertion made on behalf of Mr Murray o f ill-health, although
                                    1 noted that no medical evidence had been put forward in support of
                                    this assertion and that, as again reflected in the Code (at paragraph
                                     6.5(e)), ill-health may be offset by the seriousness of the offence.
                            3. As against these factors tending against prosecution, there was in my view
                            one extremely important factor in favour of prosecution, namely the very
                            serious nature of the alleged offences, in particular, the alleged offences of
                            manslaughter. In my opinion, the allegation that two senior police officers
                                                                   •   2>   •

                                  were responsible for the deaths of a number of people as a result of criminal
                                   negligence was a very grave allegation.
                                   4. Paragraph 6.2 of the Code reflects the considerable weight attached by the
                                   CPS to the seriousness o f the alleged offence when seeking to strike the right
                                   balance as to the factors for and against prosecution. (I refer also to the
                                   opening words of paragraph 6.4) Having carefully considered the factors
                                   tending against prosecution and this extremely important factor in favour of it,
                                   I came to the firm conclusion that the factors tending against prosecution did
                                   not clearly outweigh what I considered to be the very strong public interest in
                                   favour of prosecution.’
                     : One of Mr Harrison’s complaints, advanced before this affidavit was sworn, was that
                         the policy should have taken account of para 10.1 of the Code which includes this:
                                    ‘Normally, if the Crown Prosecution Service tells a suspect or defendant that
                                   there will not be a prosecution... that is the end of the matter... But
                                   occasionally there are special reasons why the Crown Prosecution Service will
                                    re-start the prosecution, particularly if the case is serious.’
                          This is one of the points relating to the Code which, as it seems to me, bear on the
                          application of the policy rather than the policy itself; and para 2(2) of Mr Newell’s
                      ‘ affidavit shows that regard was had to assurances or statements made to D and M that
                      ' for his part the DPP would not prosecute. Clearly it was right to do so, within the
                          public interest balance. But I think there is a qualitative difference between the
                          situation where the DPP himself goes back upon a previous assurance not to prosecute
                          and one where the DPP does not change his mind but a private prosecutor chooses to
                       ■ instigate proceedings.
                          In reply, having by then seen Mr Newell’s affidavit, Mr Harrison made further
                       ' submissions. While accepting that there could be a case in which a single factor
                           favouring prosecution might not be outweighed by a multiplicity of factors going the
                           other way, he submitted that if the raft of public interest considerations favouring
                       i discontinuance in this case was held not to be enough to outweigh the single factor of
                        ' the allegations’ gravity, it was difficult or impossible to imagine what set of
                        ' considerations might do so; and the court should conclude that DPP had fettered his
                           discretion by treating the seriousness o f the allegations as overriding everything else,
                           so that he had not in truth carried out a proper balancing exercise at all.
                           I would reject this argument. There is no reason to suppose that the factors against
                           prosecution were not properly weighed and considered, and certainly no basis for the
                           supposition that once faced with a private prosecution for something as serious as
                         ' manslaughter the DPP would inevitably decide to allow it to proceed.
                         5Mr Harrison submitted next that Mr Newell's affidavit showed that the DPP had
                         • transposed from the Code the ‘seriousness of the charge’ factor as a consideration
:                        ■ favouring the prosecution without also taking account of his own view that the Code
                            test of “realistic prospect of conviction” was not met. I agree that the DPP’s view of
                          5the prospects of conviction is a proper matter for him to consider, within the public
                          • interest test contained in the policy, when deciding whether to discontinue; but, as it
                            seems to me, para 2(1) of Mr Newell's affidavit shows that in this case he has done
                          ’ so.
                          ‘ Then Mr Harrison suggested that para 3 of the affidavit demonstrated that the DPP’s
                          ’ view of the gravity of the allegation was informed simply by the fact that there was a
                          ! manslaughter charge. He had not properly considered the real degree of culpability
                             inherent in the facts alleged; and the giavity of the offence of manslaughter can vary
                           • very widely. There is nothing in this. Mr Newell made it perfectly clear that he had
                                                                      . 2*.

                        regard to the species of manslaughter in question (“criminal negligence”) and it cannot
                        sensibly be doubted that he was well aware and took account of the circumstances in
                        which the alleged offences are said to have been committed.
                    .   Lastly on this part of the case Mr Harrison submitted that the refusal to discontinue
                    •   was simply perverse, given the ‘enormous weight’ of the public interest considerations
                        going the other way.
                        The DPP might, in my judgment, lawfully have decided to discontinue. The tragic
                    •   events at Hillsborough have been the subject of repeated, detailed, thorough enquiries.
                    :   Nearly ten years have passed. But the judgment was for the DPP to make. If we
                        acceded to Mr Harrison’s submission, we would I think usurp the role of the primary
                        decision-maker.
                        In my judgment the decision not to discontinue is no more unlawful than is the policy
                        which the DPP applied.”

            An application brought by the prosecution seeking to prevent the funding of the two
            defendants by the South Yorkshire Police was also dismissed. If that second application had
            been successful then the defendants would have had to pay for their own representation or,
            subject to a means enquiry, seek legal aid.


            07.99:
            Following a five day hearing during which it was submitted on behalf of the defendants that
            the proceedings should be stayed, Mr Nigel Cadbury, Stipendiary Magistrate,- dismissed the
            application and, in doing so, concluded: “The defence have not persuaded me to the required
            standard of proof that a fair trial is not possible". (Vol. 8 tab 7) The prosecution prepared for
            the committal proceedings an opening note. (Vol. 8 tab 1 pages 1-13) For the purposes of the
            hearirig the prosecution prepared a “Revised Skeleton Argument of the Prosecution on Abuse
            of Process”. Paragraph 73 reads in part: “Present leading counsel was involved in the judicial
            review from September 1993 to November 1993 and from December 1996.                               He was not
            asked to advise on criminal law until 1998.” During argument, Mr Jones made a correction to
            that.

             Following a finding that there was a case to answer, the defendants were committed for trial

       Publicity following the hearing
       Following the hearing I was asked my tentative views about the showing of a repeat of 3
        episodes of Cracker, a fictional series starring Robbie Coltrane as a forensic psychologist.
       The episodes concerned a young man who was at Hillsborough and resolves to kill 96 people,
        principally police officers. I reached the tentative conclusion that I would not be prepared to
        grant an injunction. Understandably, no injunction was thereafter sought. I have also been
        sent material in the public domain reporting and commenting upon an award of damages for a
        nurse who suffered PTSD as a result o f help which she gave at Hillsborough.


        Preliminary observations
        Mr Jones submits that the test for manslaughter is that which, he argues, was laid down by the
        House;of Lords in Adomako [1995] 1 AC 181. Manslaughter will be proved if it is shown
        that:
              a) ' That the defendant owed the deceased a duty of care;
              b) '•That he was negligent;
              c) 1That his negligent actions or omissions were a substantial cause of death;
              d) That, having regard to the risk of death involved, the conduct of the defendant was so
                   '■ bad in all the circumstances to amount, in the judgment of the jury, to a criminal act or
                     omission.
        If this is the conect test, then, it seems to me, that it was not the test applied by the authors of
        the 1990 opinion, which includes a subjective element.
        Mr Harrison in his written submission prepared after receipt of counsel’s 1990 opinion, now
        argues that Mr Jones’ suggested test , although applicable to medical negligence, is not the
         test for cases of the present kind. Relying particularly on a passage in Lord Mackay’s speech

            in Adbmako and his apparent approval of Stone and Dobinson [1977] QB and Ex parte
            Gray '(referred to in that opinion), Mr Harrison submits that the prosecution must additionally
            prove (that the defendant was at least indifferent to the risk of serious injury (para. 7 of note
     • dated ;13/01/2000). If this is right, then manslaughter in this kind of case requires a subjective
            element. He further submits that, therefore, the test applied by the authors of the opinion
            remains the correct one.
                  ii
            This is not the time for me to reach any final conclusion on the matter. Nor is it necessary for
            me to ideal with a further matter relating to breach of duty raised by Mr Clegg in his written
            submission dated 18 January 2000.
            I note !that Mr Harrison’s submissions do not seem to receive the support o f Professor Smith,
            Criminal Law, Smith and Hogan, 9th edition, page 376-377, where it is argued that there is
            now ohly one “single, simple test of gross negligence”, an objective one. 1 take the view that
            it is, at least, arguable (with the great benefit of hindsight) that the authors of the opinion did
            not apply the correct test. There is nothing to suggest that this               erTor,   if error it be, was
            recognised when the matter was reconsidered in 1997. I should add that an examination of
            the judgment in the Divisional Court in March 1999 does not suggest that it was being argued
            by Mr Harrison that Mr Newell had erred in reaching the conclusion that the “no evidence
            test” y/as not met. If the proper test for manslaughter involves a subjective element of the
       • kind for which he now contends, one might have expected Mr Harrison to have argued that
            the “no evidence test” was met.
            The stipendiary magistrate has found that both defendants have a case to answer. It was not
            and cobid not, as a matter o f procedure, be suggested before me that this decision was wrong.
            He gave no reasons and I am therefore unsure which test he applied. I suspect that it was the
       : test propounded by Mr Jones.
            The Director of Public Prosecutions in the person of Mr Christopher Newell has reached the
             conclu'sion that the DPP should not intervene and take over the prosecution to bring it to an
             end. As I have already mentioned, the policy and the decision were analysed in detail by the
             Divisional Court in March last year and the policy was found to be lawful and the decision
             not one that should be quashed.


             The delay has been such that no fair trial is possible

             I propose to deal with this submission first. During the course o f the hearing I made it clear
             that I did not accept it. As the prosecution’s case now stands, all or almost all of the evidence

        : upon which the prosecution rely is the evidence upon which Lord Justice Taylor relied to
           reach ihis conclusions- Significant parts of the evidence are recorded on video tapes which
           have laeen edited into a compilation tape. I have seen that tape and, in my view formed at this
            early stage of the proceedings, it will provide an invaluable and objective account of what
         : happened that afternoon in so far as relevant to these proceedings. This is not a case where
         i anyonje involved that day, witness or defendant, is going to forget what happened.
            Mr Hirrison submitted that the defendants could be faced with insuperable difficulties when
         ' examining whether, if thought had been given to closing off the tunnel, it would have been
            possible or practicable so to do. It is now too late, he submits, to know, for example, which
         . police: officers could have been used to close it off. Experience shows that judges must be
         ! cautious when arguments of this kind are submitted. In my own experience, having rejected
         : similar submissions, I have found that, at the trial, the difficulties proved non-existent. At the
            present time and having regard, for example, to the video tape, I cannot see how such a
            difficulty may arise. The tape shows a number of officers inside the gates. As a result of the
            openirtg of the gates, some of those officers, such as those who had been searching, could no
            longer! perform that task. If I am wrong and the difficulties outlined by Mr Harrison prove to
            be rea} difficulties then I have the power at any stage to either stop the case or make some less
            draconian ruling. Likewise Mr Harrison expresses concern should the prosecution seek to
            rely on experience gained at earlier matches. Should the prosecution seek to do this I will, if
            asked,; consider whether it would be fair to do so having regard to the delay.


          ' The publicity has been such that no fair trial is possible.
          ' There lis no doubt that there has been a massive amount of adverse publicity about the role of
             the police and of senior police officers on and after the day of the disaster at Hillsborough. It
           • was submitted on behalf of the defendants that the publicity has been more adverse than in
           ; any other case. Mr Jones submitted that the publicity in the Maxwell case, particularly as far
             as Robert Maxwell was concerned, was as adverse, if not more adverse.
             I turn to the appropriate legal principles. In Maxwell and others, unxepoited, March 5 1995,
             Phillips J, as he then was, referred to the “unrelenting adverse media publicity" about Mr
             Robert Maxwell, whose “name has become a synonym for fraud” (page 53). Phillips J said
              that there had “been significant adverse publicity to Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell.” In
              ruling against an application to quash the proceedings on this ground,   Phillips J said:


                                                                         - Z8 •

                     “I am satisfied, nonetheless, that the effect of pre-trial publicity alone can constitute a
                     valid ground for ordering a stay of proceedings. The principles that govern the
                     exercise o f such jurisdiction merit careful consideration.

                     No stay should be imposed unless the Defendant shows on the balance of probabilities
                     that owing to the extent and the nature of the pre-trial publicity he will suffer serious
                     prejudice to the extent that no fair trial can be held.
                     I would accept this test, so far as it goes, but it remains necessary to identify the
                     essential aspects of a fair trial for the purpose of the test.
                   : If it were enough to render a trial unfair that publicity has created the risk of prejudice
                   • against the Defendant our system of criminal justice would be seriously flawed. There
                     will inevitably be cases where the facts are so dramatic that almost everyone in the
                      lands will know of them. There will be circumstances when arrests are made or
                   . Defendants whose guilt will, or may, appear likely. Intense media coverage may well
                     take place before a suspect is identified or apprehended. If in the most notorious cases
                     Defendants were to claim immunity from trial because of the risk of prejudice public
                      confidence in the criminal justice system would be destroyed.” (Pages 60-62)

        Having              given             two    examples          Alcindor    (The   herald   of   Free    Enterprise)        and
        Savuridranavagan, he went on to say.
                     ’ “Our system of criminal justice is founded on the belief that the jury trial provides the
                       fairest and most reliable method of determining whether guilt is established. This
                     ' belief is based on the premise that that the jury will do their best to be true to their
                       oath and to try the case according to the evidence. The ability of the jury to disregard
                       extrinsic material has been repeatedly emphasised by judges of great experience.”


      • Phillipls J then cited passages from judgments given by Lawton J in Kray, and as Lawton LJ
      . in Coughlan. by Lord Denning and Sir John Donaldson in AG v. News G roup Newspapers
         Ltd [1987] QB 1. In K ray. Lawton J said;
                        “It is ... a matter of human experience, and certainly a matter of the experience of
                        those who practise in the criminal courts, first that the public’s recollection is short
                        and, secondly, that the drama, if I may use that term, of a trial almost always has the
                       ■ effect o f excluding from recollection that which went before.”

          As to recollections being short, my own experience may be of interest. When I first came to
          this case last year I thought that the criticism of the senior police officer on the day (whose
       ‘ name I; did not recollect) was that he had ordered the opening of the gates when he ought not
          to have done. I now know that it is accepted that the order to open the gates was the proper
          course to take.
        • Lawton J went on to say that a juror would not disqualify himself merely by reading
        ' newspapers containing discreditable allegations unless his mind had become so “clogged with
           prejudice that he was unable to try the case impartially”.

        Agaiti my own experience may be of interest. In a trial last year of a doctor charged with the
        murder of an elderly and very sick patient in great pain, two potential jurors, without being
        asked1,both indicated that they were unable to act as jurors because of their views on the topic
        of euthanasia, one being apparently in favour and one against.
        In AG v. News G roup Newspapers Ltd Sir John Donaldson said (page 16):
                    a trial by its very nature, seems to cause all concerned to become progressively
               • more inward looking, studying the evidence given and submissions made to the
                 exclusion o f other sources of enlightenment. This is a well-known phenomenon.”

        Phillips J went on to say:
                  “How then, in the case such as this, should the Court approach the question of
                  whether pre-trial publicity has made a fair trial impossible? I am inclined to think Mr
                  Lawson provided the answer when he advanced by way of submission the following
                  test:
                          “If prejudicial publicity would, in hindsight result in a conviction being unsafe
                          and unsatisfactory, it cannot a fortiori, be fair to embark on a trial which may
                          so result.”
                  It seems to me that the Court will only be justified in staying a trial on the ground of
                  adverse pre-trial publicity, if satisfied on balance of probabilities that if the jury return
                • a verdict o f guilty, the effect of the pre-trial publicity will be such as to render that
                  verdict unsafe and unsatisfactory.
                   In considering this question the Court has to consider the likely length of time the jury
                   will be subject to the trial process, the issues that are likely to arise and the evidence
                 • that is likely to be called in order to form a view as to whether it is probable that - try
                 ; as they may to disregard the pre-trial publicity - the jury’s verdict will be rendered
                   unsafe on account of it.

                 i I now turn to consider whether the Defendants have satisfied me that because of the
                 • pre-trial publicity, a fair trial cannot take place.

                 ■ The second point to consider is the possibility of potential jurors whose minds - to use
                   the words of Lawton J - have become clogged with prejudice as a result of adverse
                 : publicity. That such there may be is indicated by some of the answers to the opinion
                 ‘ polls and by compelling oral evidence given by Mr Kevin Maxwell on this
                    application. They also must be identified by an appropriate process of jury
                    questioning.
                    The question then remains of whether jurors who set out to perform their duties in
                    accordance with their oaths will, by the end of the trial, be at risk of acting under the
                    influence of publicity rather than reaching their verdicts on the basis of the evidence
                  . that they have heard in Court.
                  . Let me deal first with prejudice that may have been engendered by publicity adverse
                    to particular Defendants. So far as Mr Trachtenberg and Mr Bunn are concerned, their
                    Counsel did not suggest that such publicity as there has been about them would
                     prevent their having a fair trial. I think it unlikely that any juror would even
                  ; remember their names.

                                                                 .   jo -

                  The adverse publicity that there has been directed against Mr Kevin and Mr Ian
                  Maxwell is far more significant. Nonetheless I do not consider it that it is such as to
                  pose a threat to the fairness of the trial. It is too early yet to form a precise estimate of
                : the duration of this trial. I have no doubt, however, it will run for a period of months.
                • The phenomenon spoken to by Sir John Donaldson of becoming more inward looking
                . and studying the evidence and submissions to the exclusion o f other forms of
                  enlightenment is one of which I have had personal experience in the context of a long
                ! fraud trial. It is something that it is impossible to exaggerate. As the weeks go by the
                : trial becomes not merely part of life, but the dominant feature o f it so that the stage is
                  reached when one can hardly see behind it or beyond it, and I am quite sure that this is
                  truly true o f all involved in the trial.
                : The responsibility of reaching verdicts is a heavy one is any case, but in a case such as
                  this it is one of which the jury will be particularly aware. I do not believe that their
                  verdicts will be influenced by anything that they may have read about individual
                  Defendants before the trial begins. Nor can I accept the suggestion made by Mr Jones
                  that they will permit their verdicts to be influenced by views expressed by friends or
                  relatives outside court.” (Pages 72-76)

        Phillips J went on to consider the publicity surrounding the late Mr Robert Maxwell and said:
        “on reflection, I am not persuaded that, if he were to stand trial, a ju iy would not try him
        fairly ind reach verdicts on the evidence" (page 77).
        It willbe remembered that the defendants in the Maxwell case were acquitted by the jury.
        I turn to this case applying the principles enunciated by Phillips J. It is anticipated that the
        trial will take about 6 weeks, although it may well be shorter. Certainly it will last long
        enough for the phenomenon of which Sir John Donaldson and Phillips J spoke, to take effect.
        It can be assumed that every potential juror will know about Hillsborough and be appalled by
        the death o f 96 people, many of whom were so young, and feel the greatest sympathy for the
        relatives of those who lost their lives, particularly the parents of the young. That assumption
        can beimade in many high profile trials. In addition to those mentioned by Phillips J we have
        the more recent examples of Rosemary West and Dr Shipman. It can also be assumed that
        every potential juror may well feel that someone must be at fault for the tragedy, whether the
        police,: the fans or the Club. In this case it is noteworthy that at the Inquest the jury brought in
        verdicts o f accidental death, knowing, as they must have done, that the families of the
         deceased, many o f whom were present at the hearings, would be deeply disappointed if not
         devastated by the verdict. I see no reason why a jury cannot be chosen all members of which
         will try the case on the evidence before them.

       . It can also be assumed that every potential juror may well have read or heard about an alleged
         police-cover-up after the disaster. Any concern about that may be met by making it clear to
         the juiy, if need be, that the alleged cover-up has nothing to do with these defendants and that,

         in any event, many of the allegations made against the police inspired by Jimmy McGovern’s
         film have no foundation. Furthermore questions could be so framed to exclude anyone who
         has read, for example, Professor Scraton’s book.
       ' Are there any special features in this case which might have the effect that a juror’s mind
       . could be “clogged with prejudice as a result of adverse publicity”. Counsel point particularly
         to the song contained in the Manic Street Preachers album to which I have made reference.
         Although many copies have been sold, it would be easy to select jurors who have not heard
         the song. In any event, with all respect to the persons responsible for it and to those who have
       • welcomed it, the suggestion o f mass-murder is so outrageous and so far from the truth that no
       • sensible juror could ever be influenced by it.
         It will: be necessary, if this trial continues, to prepare a list of questions for the jury, the
         precise contents of which will be the subject matter of discussion.                  As I indicated in
       • argument, I have reached the tentative view that it will be easier to select a jury if the trial
         were to be conducted outside West Yorkshire. Given the proximity to Sheffield and the
         extensive coverage of the matters in the Yorkshire newspapers, there is likely to be more
       • potential jurors in West Yorkshire who will answer the questions in such a way that they
       . should not be empanelled.                   In any event, as Presiding Judge, I am well aware of the
         difficulties faced by the West Yorkshire courts (Leeds and Bradford) in coping with the
         volume of criminal cases.                  Cases, particularly long ones, are often moved out o f West
         Yorkshire when it is practicable so to do in order to relieve the strain on the system. I am also
         aware that none of the courtrooms in Leeds is ideal for a trial of this kind. I have also reached
         the tentative view that, for these reasons, a trial, if there is to be one, should be conducted in
        ' the Moot Hall at Newcastle. However, counsel indicated that they wished to address me
         about that, should I decide not to quash the proceedings.
:.       Ever mindful of the obligation to ensure a fair trial, I have reached the conclusion that the
         defendants have failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the adverse publicity will
         prevent or impede a fair trial. I go further. I am quite satisfied that they will have a fair trial.
          If there is to be trial, I shall reconsider the issue if it is necessary to do.

     • Jones’ argument at the PDH to the effect that admissions made by the defendants only for the
         purposes of the committal proceedings were binding at trial and his argument that I should
         admit! into evidence an attendance note of a solicitor who was not to be called because the
         prosecution did not believe a word he said.                   A similar argument was raised about Miss
         Adlington before Mr Cadbury and was rejected by him. (volume 8, tab 7 pages 100-101) I
         see nd reason to depart from his finding nor to stop the proceedings for this reason. I make it
         clear, however, that I expect the prosecution to act properly and fairly. I am sure it will. If it
         does Hot I shall not hesitate to act,
         It is Submitted that the proceedings should be stayed because the prosecution was only
         launched after the McGovern film which was a distortion of the truth. The prosecution has
         been "prompted by a distorted and misrepresented view of the true facts”. I understood the
         description “misrepresented” to refer to matters unconnected with the evidence upon which
         the prosecution rely in this case. It is submitted that this prosecution has “become a private
          persecution brought against the background of an unprecedented level o f media vilification of
         the defendants and a stirring up of emotional passions.” I see no merit in these arguments
         provided the defendants can have a fair trial, as I have found they can and provided that the
          prosecution is not so oppressive that it ought not be allowed to continue, a matter to which I
          return’.shortly.
          It Is submitted that, given that the evidence has not changed since 1989-90, the prosecution
          should be stayed having regard to the earlier decisions not to prosecute, the verdict of the
          Coroner’s jury, the results of the review conducted by Stuart-Smith LJ and the endorsement
          of the 'conclusions therein by the Home Secretary and the DPP. It is submitted that there is
          here “a refusal to accept earlier decisions”. Similar arguments were put to the DPP and, it
          appears, to the Divisional Court in March of last year. Mr Newell outlined this argument in
          paragraph 2(1) of his affidavit where he dealt with factors tending against prosecution. The
          position has further changed in favour of the prosecution in that there is now a case to answer.
           Against this background, I see no justification in quashing the proceedings for this reason,
           assuming, without deciding, that this could be a free-standing ground to quash.
           It is submitted that a court has a duty to be extra vigilant when a private prosecution is
           brought because private prosecutors are nor subject to the same code                as public prosecuting
           authorities: “the duty of the court to protect defendants from oppression and abuse against a

           private prosecutor calls for a different            approach" than that followed where public prosecuting
         : authorities are concerned. Private prosecution “must not be allowed to become an unfettered

                                                                     • 3J •

               indulgence”. It is submitted that this prosecution is so unfair, unreasonable and wrong that it
        ■ should not be allowed to proceed. These are similar arguments to those developed in the
               Divisional Court, since when, as I have said, there has been found a case, to answer. In my
               view it would not be right for me to apply the CPS evidentiary test and decide whether there
               is a iiealistic prospect o f a conviction.               Indeed I was not asked to carry out a detailed
               examination o f the evidence. Insofar as public interest is concerned, assuming that a private
               prosecutor should take that into account, the Divisional Court has already held that the
         • decision not to intervene is not Wednesbury unreasonable. Subject to the issue of oppression,
               I see no reason why I should interfere with the decision to prosecute which, it seems to me, is
               also one that a reasonable prosecutor could reach.
               It is submitted on the analogy of cases like R. v. Croydon Justices, ex parte Dean (1994) 98
               Cr.Apip.R. 76 that there had been, in effect, an undertaking to the defendants that they would
               not be prosecuted. Reliance is placed on what Mr Jones said during the Divisional Court
               hearirig in 1993 against the background of the CPS decisions not to prosecute. Nothing that
               Mr Jones said on behalf o f the six families who took those proceedings can be regarded as an
               undertaking of the kind referred to in Croydon Justices. This is not a case, on the evidence
               before me, where a person has relied upon a promise or undertaking (see Attorney-General
               of T rfaidad and Tobago (1995] 1AC 396 at 417).
               I turn to the question which h as given me the most concern: “Is this prosecution so
         • oppressive to these defendants that it ought to be stayed?” There was no dispute that an
               prosecution could be so oppressive that it should be stayed. In L atif [1996] 2 Cr. App. R. 92,
          ' at 101’(H.L.) Lord Steyn said the law is settled:
                       ! “Weighing countervailing considerations of policy and justice, it is for the judge in
                         the exercise of his discretion to decide whether there has been an abuse of process,
                         which amounts to an affront to the public conscience and requires the criminal
                       i proceedings to be stayed ... or where it would be contrary to the public interest in
                         the integrity of the criminal justice system that a trial should take place. ... (T]he
                         judge must weigh in the balance the public interest in ensuring that those that are
                       • charged with grave crimes should be tried and the competing public interest in not
                          conveying the impression that the court will adopt the approach that the end
                         justifies any means."

                In Attbrnev-G eneral's Reference (No. 1 of 19901 (1992) 95 Cr.App.R. 296, at 302-303 Lord

         That case and the earlier case o f Heston-Francois (1984) 78 Cr.App.R. 209 refer to the
         alternatives open to a trial judge other than stopping a trial.
         In Dept, of T ransport v. Chris Sm aller Ltd 1989 AC 1197, at 1210 (a civil case) Lord
          Griffiths said:

                    “I would, however, express a note of caution against allowing the mere fact of the
                    anxiety that accompanies any litigation being regarded as of itself a sufficient.
                  . prejudice to justify striking out an action.... There are, however, passages in some
                    of the judgments that suggest that the mere sword of Damocles, hanging for an
                    unnecessary period, might be a sufficient reason of itself to strike out. On this
                  ' aspect I repeat the note o f caution I expressed in the Court of Appeal in Eagil Trust
                  ■ Co. Ltd v. Pigott-Brown [1985] 3 All ER 119,124, where I said:
                            "Any action is bound to cause anxiety, but it would as a general rule be an
                            exceptional case where that sort of anxiety alone would found a sufficient
                            ground for striking out in the absence of evidence of any particular
                            prejudice. Biss's case is an example of such an exceptional case, the action
                            hanging over for 11 years, with professional reputations at stake."

          In the ruling of Buckley J. (unreported, 09/96, C.C.C.) following the acquittal of Kevin
          Maxwell and others at the first trial can be found the following passage (at page 233-234):
                     “Finally, an important, though not decisive consideration; fairness to the Defendants.
                     I have mentioned the time that these criminal proceedings would have been hanging
                      over their heads in the event of a further trial, at least five years. That would be so, in
                      Mr. Kevin Maxwell’s case, notwithstanding that in going through the extremely
                      lengthy trial process he gave evidence before the jury for twenty days and
                   ■ notwithstanding the acquittals. The disruption to personal and business life is
                      inevitably considerable. The stress and pain that criminals inflict on their families is a
                      sad but inevitable consequence of their misdeeds. Courts are mindful of it but
                   : obviously cannot allow it to outweigh consideration for victims and the general public
                      interest in punishing crime. But I remind myself here that these Defendants have been
                      acquitted and in the circumstances I have described. As I mentioned earlier Mrs.
                    . Kevin Maxwell gave evidence before me. Her obvious distress was, I am convinced,
                       entirely genuine. She described the agony of trial and the days waiting for the verdict
                       with the prospect of a significant prison sentence in the balance. She told me of
                       problems with her children. In particular, their son who had been told by schoolmates
                    : that his father was going to prison for a long time. When ever her husband goes out
                    ' she is now repeatedly asked “Will daddy be coming home again?”.
                       I can understand the expectation that built up in the family’s mind that an acquittal
                     • would be the end of the matter. Mrs. Maxwell’s bewilderment and anger at the
                     • decision to proceed to another trial were not feigned. I cannot be over influenced by
                       such matters but no one could have been unmoved by her evidence.”




                                                                   -35-

Some help can be obtained from the ECHR. The requirement in Article 6 of a hearing within '
a reasonable time is designed to prevent a person charged from remaining "too long in a state
of uncertainty about his fate" (StSgmiiller v. Austria 1 E.H.R.R. 155, at para. 5 at 191).
This is not a case where new evidence has been found many years later (for example DNA
evidence) or where the defendants have misled the prosecuting authorities in some way.
 Clearly different principles apply in those kinds of cases. As I have said before, the evidence
 against these defendants is the same evidence as it was in 1989. Even if the test applied in
 1990 was not the Adomako test (which I shall assume to be the correct test), that is not in the
 same category as the finding of new evidence. Nor is this a case where the authorities have
 acted improperly- the decisions not to prosecute weie made in good faith and it has not been
 suggested otherwise. Nor is this a case where there has been undue delay caused by the
 prosecution following the institution of these proceedings against the defendants.
 In this case neither the defendants or members of their family have given evidence, but I have
 no difficulty in inferring that they must be suffering a considerable amount of strain. They
 are likely to have thought following the verdict of the jury in the Coroner’s enquiry in 1991, if
 not earlier, that a prosecution was, at the least, very unlikely, except perhaps during the
 continuance of the 1993 Divisional Court proceedings and in the period leading up to and
 including the enquiry conducted by. Stuart-Smith LJ. In 1998 the defendants, I infer, must
 have started suffering the stress which they had suffered during the period 1989-1991. They
: have, o f course, both resigned from the police force and there is no evidence before me that a
. conviction would have any particular financial consequence. I add that, on the evidence
 before me, they are receiving the best possible legal representation thanks to the South
 Yorkshire police.
 The thought of being convicted for a serious offence of manslaughter must be a strain on
 anybody. However, and I can say this from my own experience defending in criminal cases
: over many years, it is the thought of prison which, for most defendants, is the greatest worry.
  In the words of Buckley I , Mrs Pandora Maxwell “described the agony of trial and the days
  waiting for .the verdict with the prospect of a significant prison sentence in the balance.” That
  is familiar to anyone who has defended in serious criminal cases. For police officers or ex-
  police officers, the threat o f prison has even more significance than for others. These two
  defendants, if sentenced to prison for the manslaughter of, in effect, 96 people, would
  necessarily be at considerable risk of serious injury if not of death at the hands of those who
  feel very strongly about Hillsborough.

On the other side o f the balance is the public interest put succinctly by M r Newell in the 1999
Divisional Court proceedings;
        '      there was in my view one extremely important factor in favour of prosecution,
          namely the very serious nature of the alleged offences, in particular, the alleged
           offences o f manslaughter. In my opinion, the allegation that two senior police officers
           were responsible for the deaths of a number of people as a result of criminal
         : negligence was a very grave allegation”.

Doing my best to resolve the competing interests of the defendants arid the public, I have
decided that there is an alternative to a stay. I conclude that the oppression is not such as to
prevent the trial from taking place but that I should now reduce to a significant extent the
anguish being suffered by these defendants.                  I do that by making it clear that the two
defendants will not immediately lose their liberty should they be convicted. This is, I accept,
a highly unusual course, but this is a highly unusual case. When I canvassed this possibility
with Mr Jones, he fairly and helpfully drew my attention to evidence that the families were
 not, apparently, seeking punishment o f this kind (page 6 of transcript o f evidence of Miss
 Adlington before the Stipendiary Magistrate).

            t
: The prosecution is a breach of the defendants* rights to a fair trial under Article 60)1 of the
  European Convention on Human Rights.
• Mr Clegg submits that even if, applying the English law of abuse of process, there should be
: no stay; I should nonetheless stay the proceedings. To order the trial to continue would be, he
• submits, a breach o f Article 6(1) of the ECHR. He relies on the words in that Article: “In the
' determination o f ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public
 ! hearing within a reasonable time”. Contrary to the submissions of Mr Jones, he submits that
 •time started to nin when the defendants were interviewed under caution in 1990, that it did
   not thereafter cease to run and that a determination of the charges at the earliest in June would
   not be within a reasonable time. He further submits that I should anticipate the coming into
   force of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act which provides that: “It is unlawful for a
   public Authority [which includes a court] to act in a way which is incompatible with a
    C o n v e n tio n right”. Alternatively, I should adjourn the trial until October when it is
   anticipated that the Act will come into force.
  :He accepts, on the authority of R. v D.P.P. ex parte Kebilene [1990] 3 W.L.R. 972 (H.L.)
    that it would be contrary to the legislative intention to treat section 6(1) as though it was now
    in force. He points to passages in the speeches in that case (984H-985A, 996F-H). Relying
    upon them, he submits that, if there is a clear breach of section 6(1), a decision should be
    taken at this stage rather than on appeal following a conviction. I shall assume the
   .correctness o f this submission.
     In my judgment the position is far from clear. I was referred to a large number of authorities
     which deal with when time starts to run. They, in very large measure, concern the very
     different system of criminal investigation followed on the continent. It is far from clear
     whether time would start to run at the moment of arrest or charge in this country or from the
     m o m en t of an interview under caution. In this case there is the added difficulty that this is a
     private prosecution, a type of prosecution unknown, I believe, on the continent. Although I

  am intlined to think that time would not cease to run, that is certainly not clear. Mr Jones
  strenuously argued that, even if time had started to runin 1990 and continued to run, the
  determination.would still be within a reasonable time.          My inclination would be that the
  determination would not be within a reasonable time but is not clear how that should be
  determined in a case of this kind.
  Amongst the many cases to which I was referred is EckJe v. Federal Republic of Germany
  (1982) 5 E.H.R.R. 1. In that case the Court said (at page 25) that a German court had
  available a means of affording reparation for a breach of the reasonable time requirement in
  Article 6(1): “according to well-established case law in the Federal Court of Justice, when
  deternjining sentence the judge must take proper account of any over-stepping of the
  ‘reasonable time’ within the meaning of Article 6(1)”. Mr Jones r.elied on this case .and on
  section 8 of the Act which provides that, in relation to any act which the court finds is
  unlawful, “it may grant such relief ... as it considers just and appropriate.” Mr Clegg
: submitted that section 6(1) o f the Act prevented the approach in Eckle- if the reasonable time
. had expired there was only one remedy available, namely stay the proceedings. He submitted
• that the court had no discretion in the matter. The balancing approach developed in the
• English courts could not be adopted. If all else were clear, this certainly is not. This alone
   prevents this case &om falling into the category of clear cases referred to in Kebilene.
   Should I then grant an adjournment until October, when it is anticipated that the Act will
   come into force? The trial date was set in September of last year, with the consent of all
 • concerned. It would not be right now .to adjourn it. Should either of the defendants be
   convicted, the arguments raised by Mr Clegg can be raised again in the Court of Appeal and
   the chronology which I have set out coupled with the written evidence of Miss Adlington and
   her oral evidence before the Stipendiary Magistrate, should enable the appellate court to
   resolve any issues of fact and, in particular, whether the determination will have been within a
 ■ reasonable time.
          i
 : Conclusion

   I decliiie to stay the proceedings and the trial will start in June. I shall now hear submissions
 ' as to whether
          I       it will be in Leeds or Newcastle.

1      PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT

The purpose of this report is to consider:

1.1   the judgment of the High Court on 31 March 1999, in response to the Chief
       Constable's application for judicial review of the Authority's decisions taken
       on 5 February 1999 ("The Powers Judicial Review"), that the Authority does
       have legal power to provide financial assistance to current and former police
       officers, so long as that power is exercised on normal public law principles;

1.2   the legal effect of decisions taken by the Authority in 1998 to provide financial
       assistance to Mr David Duckenfield (who was the Divisional Commander,
       then holding the rank of Chief Superintendent in charge of the police
       operations on the day of the Hillsborough Stadium disaster) and Mr Bernard
       Murray (who was the Sub-Divisional Commander, then holding the rank of
       Superintendent, who was also on duty at the match) in relation to private
       prosecutions alleging manslaughter, wilful neglect of a public duty and
       (against Mr Duckenfield) intentionally perverting the course of justice (the
       "Leeds Criminal Proceedings" and the "South Sefton Criminal Proceedings")
       brought by Ms Ann Adlington, Solicitor, on behalf of the Hillsborough
       Family Support Group ("HFSG'');

1.3   the legal effect of the decisions taken by the Authority on 5 February 1999 to
       reverse the earlier decisions to award funding for the criminal proceedings to
       Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray;

1.4    new applications for financial assistance from Mr Duckenfield and Mr
       Murray to meet their respective legal costs and disbursements in the
       following proceedings:

       1.4.1     the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings, which were discontinued on
                jurisdictional grounds;

       1.4.2    the Leeds Criminal Proceedings which are continuing;

       1.4.3    the judicial   review (the "DPP Judicial Review"), judgment in respect
                 of which was given on 31 March 1999, of the decision of the Director
                 of Public Prosecutions not to intervene to take over the conduct of
                 the private prosecutions referred to in paragraph 1.2 above which
                resulted in the charge of wilfully perverting the course of justice




                                             1
                 against Mr Duckenfield being withdrawn but no intervention in the
                 other criminal proceedings against the former officers;

       1.4.4     the Powers Judicial Review, in which an award of the former officers'
                 legal costs was made against Ms Adlington (so that only the balance
                 of their legal costs, after Ms Adlington's contribution, would be
                 payable by the Authority if it grants the former officers' application);
                 and

       1.4.5     a potential judicial review ("the South Sefton Judicial Review") of an
                 adverse ruling by the Clerk to the South Sefton Justices (should one
                be made) in respect of claims made for the payment of Mr
                Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's costs from central funds (which to
                 the extent that the Authority is legally bound to provide assistance in
                relation to the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings would effectively
                be for the benefit of the Authority).


2     RECOMMENDATIONS

The Authority is recommended to consider this report, the appendices to it and all
other relevant material put to it and:

2.1    subject to being satisfied on the issues referred to in paragraph 7:6.7 below, to
       resolve to pay Mr Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's reasonable and proper
       legal expenses incurred up to 5 February 1999 in relation to the Leeds
       Criminal Proceedings and to request a legal costs draftsman to review the
       expenses claimed an d /o r apply to the court for an assessment of the costs
       under section 71 Solicitors Act 1974 so as to have those reasonable and proper
       costs determined;

2.2   defer a decision in relation to the costs         of theSouth Sefton     Criminal
       Proceedings and the South Sefton Judicial Review until the Court Clerk's
       decision in relation to the payment of MrDuckenfield's and Mr Murray's
       costs from central furids is known;

2.3    defer’ a decision on the application for financial assistance in respect of the
       Powers Judicial Review, pending assessment and payment of Ms Adlington's
       contribution to those costs; and
2.4   consider the options set out in paragraph 9 of this report in relation to the
      applications for financial assistance for costs incurred in the DPP Judicial
      Review and, since 5 February 1999, in the Leeds Criminal Proceedings and if
      the Authority decides to approve financial assistance for those costs to do so
      on terms which limit the Authority's financial exposure.


3     THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - KEY EVENTS FROM 15
      APRIL 1989

3.1   15 April 1999:    FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool Football Club and
      Nottingham Forest Football Club at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield
      Wednesday's ground. Only six minutes into the game, play was stopped
      when it was realised that spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal
      had been severely crushed. As a result, 96 people died and over 400 received
      hospital treatment.

3.2   17 April 1989: Lord Justice Taylor was appointed

      ''to carry out an inquiry into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football
      Ground of 15 April 1989 and to make recommendations about the needs of
      crowd control and safety at sports events".

3.3   17 April 1989: Geoffrey Dear QPM, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police,
      appointed to carry out independent investigation of the disaster and gather
      evidence.

3.4   19 April 1989: West Midlands Police assumed, responsibility for the inquiry.

3.5   HM Coroner opened and adjourned inquests on 95 deaths that had already
      occurred as a result of the disaster (the death of the last victim to die, Mr Tony
      Bland, occurring at a later date).

3.6   4 August 1989:        Having head the oral testimony of over 170 witnesses
      between 15 May and 19 June 1989, Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report w a s.
      made public. He found that the immediate cause of the gross over-crowding
      which had taken place, and thus of the disaster, had been the failure to cut off
      access to the central pens behind the goal (which were already over full)
      when gate C was opened. He found also a number of contributing factors
      including the Club's "confused and inadequate signs and ticketing", police
      planning, police operations on the day, "the presence of an unruly minority




                                           3
         who had drunk too much" and interaction of parties responsible for safety
         issues. In respect of police operations on the day, Lord Justice Taylor in his
         Interim Report, said (at paragraph 278)

         "although there were other causes, the main reason for the disaster was the
         failure of police control".

         The then Chief Constable, Peter Wright, referred the questions of
         manslaughter, by criminal negligence, to the Director of Public Prosecutions
         for a decision as to criminal liability.

3.7      15 August 1989:      Director of Public Prosecutions recommended that the
         matter should be subject of a criminal investigation. Mr Dear, Chief Constable
         of West Midlands Police, was invited to undertake this investigation. He was
         also asked that if he discovered any matters against the Police (Discipline)
         Regulations, he should enquire into them on behalf of South Yorkshire Police.

3.8     30 November 1989: Peter Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police,
        offered in conjunction with insurers to open negotiations with representatives
        of the bereaved to resolve all bona fide civil claims for compensation without
        having to await the outcome of legal hearings.

3.9     15 December 1989: Agreement reached with representatives of the bereaved
        for settlement of civil actions without a decision as to liability.

3.10    December 1989: Full criminal and disciplinary investigation formally
        commenced.

3.11    18 Tanuarv 1990: Lord Justice Taylor’s Final Report was published.

3.12    31 March 1990:       Mr Dear's report was submitted to Director of Public
        Prosecutions.

3.13    6 August 1990: Two leading Counsel provide a joint opinion to the DPP
        advising that there was insufficient evidence to warrant prosecutions.

3.14'   30 August 1990: Director of Public Prosecutions Allan Green QC, concluded
        that there was insufficient evidence upon which a prosecution for
        manslaughter, or any other criminal offence, could be brought against any
        officer in the South Yorkshire Police, or any other person.




                                              4
3.15   19 November 1990 to 28 March 1991: HM Coroner resumed inquests on 95
        deaths in the Hillsborough Disaster. Jury returned a verdict of accidental
       death.

3.16   7 December 1990:       South Yorkshire Police Authority approved financial
       assistance for 6 officers including Mr David Duckenfield and Mr Bernard
       Murray in connection with legal proceedings relating to the inquest.

3.17   7 Mav 1991:     The Police Complaints Authority recommended discipline
       charges to be brought against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
       Superintendent Murray.

3.18   11 Tulv 1991:     The Police Complaints Authority -directed that Chief
       Superintendent Duckenfield should face fo.ur disciplinary charges of Neglect
       of Duty and one of Discreditable Conduct.        In addition, Superintendent
       Murray should face one charge of Neglect of Duty.

3.19   November 1991:        Chief Superintendent Duckenfield retired on medical
       grounds, having been on sick leave for some time.

3.20   13 Tanuarv 1992: Police Complaints Authority gave leave not to proceed with
       the discipline charge against Superintendent Murray, as it would be
       inappropriate and unjust to pursue the charge against him alone, in the
       absence of his superior officer. Sometime thereafter, Superintendent Murray
       went on sick leave.

3.21   26 August 1992: Superintendent Murray retired on medical grounds.

3.22   6 April 1993: The relatives of six deceased were granted leave for judicial
       review into the inquest verdicts. They sought certiorari to quash the jury's
       verdict.

3.23   5 November 1993: The judicial review concluded that the inquest verdicts
       should not be overturned.

3.24   December 1993: Inquest held by HM Coroner for West Yorkshire into the
       death of Tony Bland (the 96th victim of Hillsborough). A verdict of accidental
       death was returned.

3.25   5 December 1996: The drama "Hillsborough" written by Jimmy McGovern on
       behalf of Granada Television was broadcast to the ITV Network. Following
       this programme further material was submitted to the Home Office on behalf



                                         5
of the HFSG. That material related in particular to video evidence of the
disaster and medical evidence about the time of death of the victims.

30 Tune 1997: The Home Secretary made an oral statement to the House of
Commons during the course of which he stated:

                "Madam Speaker, my Department, the office of the Attorney
                General and the Crown Prosecution Service have considered
                very carefully all the evidence which has been put forward in
                recent months.

                The Director of Public Prosecutions has taken the view that the
                material so far presented to her would not justify fresh
                criminal investigations. The then Attorney General also took
                the view, again on the material presented to him, that any
                application to the High Court for a new inquest would not
               have any realistic prospect of succeeding.

               Nonetheless, I am acutely conscious that the families of those
               who died at Hillsborough and many others including Hon
               Members of this House are very concerned that unresolved
               issues remain. I am determined to go as far as I can to ensure
               that no matter of significance is overlooked and that we do not
               reach a final conclusion without a full and independent
               examination of the evidence.

               I can therefore tell the House today that the Attorney General,
               the Director of Public Prosecutions and I have agreed that it is
               in the public interest that there should be an independent
               scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any new
               evidence relating to the disaster which was not previously
               available. We are appointing Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a
               senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, for that purpose".

18 February 1998: Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny Report was presented
to the House of Commons. He concluded:

3.27.1   None of the evidence he was asked to consider added anything
         significant to the evidence which was available to Lord Justice
         Taylor's inquiry or to the inquests;
       3.2/.2   There was no basis upon which there should be a further judicial
                inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's inquiry;

       3.27.3   There was no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court
                or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the
                Coroners Act 1988; and

       3.27.4   There was no material which should be put before the Director of
                Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might
                cause them to reconsider the decisions they had already taken.

3.28   18 February 1998: The Home Secretary announced in the House that he, the
       Attorney General and the DPP had very carefully considered Lord Justice
       Stuart-Smith's report, and said "we have no reason to doubt his conclusions".
       Following publications of the Scrutiny Report, Trevor Hicks, the Chairman of
       the HFSG announced that he was disappointed with the Scrutiny's
       conclusions and that the HFSG were considering private prosecutions.

3.29   27 February 1998:     The Authority resolved to authorise the Clerk and
       Treasurer to consider applications for financial assistance from serving and
       retired officers in respect of possible criminal proceedings arising from the
       Hillsborough Stadium disaster.

4      THE POWERS JUDICIAL REVIEW .

4.1    The circumstances resulting in the Chief Constable's application to the court
       to challenge a decision of the Authority to withdraw the funding for the
       Criminal Proceedings, which it had previously agreed to make available to
       Messrs Duckenfield and Murray, and the decisions of the Court were as
       follows:-




                                              9
2     Meeting of the Police Authority on 1st August 1997

      At this meeting, the Clerk and Treasurer and the Chief Constable submitted a
      joint report informing members of the appointment of Lord Justice Stuart-
      Smith to conduct a scrutiny into aspects of the Hillsborough disaster. The
      Authority made the following resolutions:

       "1 - That approval be given to the provision o f up to £500,000from resents for
      expenditure likely to be incurred in respect o f the scrutiny.


      2 - That approval be given to a commitment to provide financial assistance for legal
      representation for officers (serving and retired) in connection xvith Lord Justice
      Stuart-Smith's scrutiny in accordance with the principles set out in the Home Office
      Circular 77/87 Financial Assistance to Police Officers in Legal Proceedings.

      3 - That the Clerk and Treasurer be authorised to determine individual applications
      for financial assistance in consultation with the Chief Constable".

3     Meeting of the Police Authority on 27 February 1998

      Shortly after the presentation of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny report to
      the House of Commons, the members of the Authority agreed to consider an
      item relating to Hillsborough. Assistant Chief Constable Daines gave an oral
      report to the Authority on the findings of the scrutiny and advised members
      that private prosecutions had been threatened against three of those who
      were officers on duty at the time of the disaster. The general issue of the
      provision of financial assistance to those concerned was addressed. It was
      recognised that actual decisions about financial support could be made only
      on individual application. Members were accordingly invited to delegate the
      determination of individual applications to the Clerk and Treasurer.
      Members resolved as follows:

      ”1 - That in the light o f the findings o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's inquiry and his
    ' comments on tire outcome, members do not believe there is any new evidence to cause
      them to reconsider the Authority's previous view, and remain of the opinion that the
      officers acted in good faith.




                                             10
       2 - That the Authority agrees to authorise the Clerk and Treasurer to consider
      applications for financial assistance from officers (sewing and retired) in accordance
      ivith the provisions o f Home Office Circular 77/87, Financial Assistance to Police
       Officers in Legal Proceedings".

4.4   Application of 28 February 1998 from Mr David Duckenfield

      On 28 February 1998, Mr Duckenfield applied to Assistant Chief Constable
      Dames for financial assistance from the Authority for legal representation.
      On 2 March 1998, Assistant Chief Constable Daines wrote to the Clerk and
      Treasurer asking him to approve Mr Duckenfield's request. At the request of
      the Authority's solicitor, Ms Maureen Oades, Assistant Chief Constable
      Daines provided supporting information on 5 March 1998 to the Clerk and
      Treasurer. These letters are attached at appendix 1. Following receipt of this
      letter, the Clerk and Treasurer approved Mr Duckenfield's application for
      financial assistance towards the costs of legal representation in the event of a
      private prosecution being brought against him in connection with the
      Hillsborough disaster.


4.5   M eeting of the Police Authority on 24 April 1998

      On 24 April, the Chief Constable and Clerk and Treasurer submitted a joint
      report to members requesting that members note the expenditure of £11,900
      on the Chief Constable's costs in connection with the Scrutiny from the
      earmarked reserve and requesting members to agree that the earmarked
      reserve continue to be held for purposes related to the Hillsborough disaster.
      The Authority resolved as follows:


      " I - That the use o f the funds to date be noted.

      2 - That the Authority agree, for the time being, to maintain the earmarked reserve
      for future costs associated ivith the Hillsborough Stadium disaster, subject to periodic
      reports on expenditure from the reserve".
                                                                               A
4.6   Application of 28 June 1998 from Mr Murray                               -

      By letter dated 28 June 1998, Mr Murray informed the Chief Constable that
      his wife had accepted a summons on his behalf arising from the events of the
      Hillsborough disaster and requested that the Police Authority reimburse any



                                              11
legal expenses that he may incur in defending himself. The next day,
Assistant Chief Constable Daines wrote to the Clerk and Treasurer setting out
the reasons for his support of Mr Murray's application and the application
was approved by the Clerk and Treasurer that day. (Copies of these letters
are attached at appendix 2 to this report.)


The Clerk and Treasurer's decisions

In approving both of these applications, the Clerk and Treasurer consulted
the Authority's legal advisor and took into account a number of
considerations which were detailed in the Garretts' report which the
Authority considered at its meeting on 5 February 1999. (Appendix 3).

Challenge by Ms Adlington

On 22 December 1998, following a report by the BBC that the Authority had
agreed to pay the legal costs of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray, Ms
Adlington wrote, on behalf of the HFSG, to the Clerk and Treasurer to the
Authority (appendix 4) challenging the Authority's power to provide such
assistance on a number of grounds, including the following:


•       that there was no legal power under statute for the Authority to pay
        the legal costs of a police officer (serving or former) in relation to
        criminal proceedings against him /her (a view dismissed by the Court
        in the subsequent Powers Judicial Review); and

•       that even if such power existed, it had been exercised improperly in
        this case as the Authority had taken into account a number of
        irrelevant considerations, ignored a number of relevant considerations
        and delegated powers, which it should itself have exercised, to the
        Clerk and Treasurer.

Legal advice received by the Authority

4.9.1    On 5 January 1999, the solicitor to the Authority sought preliminary
         advice from barrister, Mr Bernard Phillips. He confirmed that the
         general principle of whether to afford assistance at all was a matter
         for the discretion of the Authority. In the light of the representations
         received from Ms Adlington, however, he believed that the decision
         should be reconsidered by the Authority.
4.9.2   On 5 January 1999 Ms Adlington wrote a further letter to all the
        members of the Authority (in appendix 5) making additional points
        about the propriety of the decision to make financial assistance
        available to the officers. She subsequently supplemented that letter
        with a fax to Garretts, the solicitors instructed by the Authority,
        dated 29 January 1999 (appendix 6).

4.9.3   On 12 January 1999 the solicitor to the Authority.took legal advice on
        the two letters received from Ms Adlington from Leading Counsel,
        Richard Mawrey QC.

4.9.4   His advice was that there was a power to provide financial assistance
        to police officers in legal proceedings. However, this could only be
        exercised in appropriate circumstances and only to cover "out of
        pocket" expenses (but not expenditure which would otherwise be
        paid from central funds or by the Legal Aid Board). He added that
        the HFSG might seek to challenge the procedure by which such
        powers had been exercised because it covered more than "out of
        pocket" expenditure, with some prospect of success and that
        accordingly
                O y
                    the Authoritv' should be asked to reconsider itsO original
                                   s


        decision in order to ensure it took take account of all relevant
        considerations, including those Ms Adlington alleges might have
        been overlooked earlier.

4.9.5   On 15 January 1999, the Authority instructed Garretts, solicitors, to
        advise the Authority in reconsidering its decision to make financial
        assistance available to the officers for the criminal proceedings and
        considering the new' applications for financial support for judicial
        review' proceedings. Garretts, whose advice is also referred to below’
        in more detail, expressed its own concern about the statutory power
        to give financial support to officers in these circumstances and
        recommended that a second opinion be sought from Miss Presiley
        Baxendale QC and Mr Mark Shaw.

4.9.6   Counsel advised that whilst they had initially been attracted by the
        argument that the Authority had power to pay "out of pocket" legal
        costs and expenses of officers in all types of proceedings, where they
        had acted in good faith and it was otherwise appropriate, there were
        powerful arguments against this interpretation, particularly in the
        light of the relevant case law in respect of public authorities'



                                   13
                ancillary powers to incur expenditure to facilitate the discharge of
                their principal functions.

      4.9.7     Counsel stressed that they had both found this issue difficult and
                that there was no guarantee which wav a Court would decide.
                                        O                        /


                There were certainly strong policy reasons why the Authority should
                have power to support its officers (current and former) in this way.

      4.9.8     Accordingly, their recommendation was that the Authority should
                resolve that it has no power to provide the financial assistance which
                had been sought. It should then co-operate with the Chief Constable
                in bringing the matter before a court for an early decision on whether
                that view of their legal powers was correct.

.10   Decision of the Police Authority on 5 February 1999

      4.10.1    On 5 February, in addition to the legal advice received, the Authority
                considered a report from the Chief Constable and submissions and
                presentations from:

      •        Mr T Hicks and Ms A Adlington on behalf of the Hillsborough Family
               Support Group;


      •        Mr S Eastwood of Winckworth Sherwood, Solicitors on behalf of Mr
               Duckenfield; and


      •        Mr R Manning of Walker Morris, Solicitors on behalf of Mr Murray.


      4.10.2    Following consideration of the reports and representations made to
                it, the Authority resolved as follows:

                "2 - In the light o f legal advice, including advice from leading Counsel, that
                on balance, the Authority has no legal -power to provide financial assistance
                to M r D Duckenfield or M r B Murray of South Yorkshire Police in relatioji
                to their costs and expenses of defending the private prosecutions brought
                against them by the Hillsborough Family Support Group, by Information
                dated 10 Jidy 1998 and accordingly to determine that any previous decision
                of the Authority or any officer acting under its Authority, to make such
                assistance available is null and void.
                2 - In the light of legal advice, including advice from leading Counsel, tint,
                on balance, the Authority has no legal power to provide financial assistance
                to M r D Duckenfield or M r B Murray in relation to the costs of any judicial
                review proceedings brought by either of them whether relating to the
                decision of the Crown Prosecutions Service, not to take over the conduct of
                the private prosecutions and discontinue such prosecutions, of to any
                decision of the Clerk to the Sefton Magistrates' Court to challenge the
                payment o f the officers' costs of proceedings before that court from central
                funds, or to any other decision of any court, authority or body arising from
                such prosecutions; and, accordingly, that the applications o f M r
                Duckenfield and M r Murray for financial assistance in relation to such
                proceedings be rejected.

                3 - In recognition of the fact that legal advice provided to the Authority is
                that it remains arguable that power exists to provide the assistance referred
                to in 1 and 2 above, to take such action as the Clerk and Treasurer, in
                consultation with the Chief Constable, the Authority's legal advisors and
                the Chairman of the Authority may decide as appropriate to have the
                decisions referred to in 1 and 2 reviewed by the High Court and to expedite
                such a review with a view to clarifying the Authority's powers in this
                regard.

                4 - To defer consideration of the procedural issues raised by M s Adlington,
                in her letters of 22 December 1998 to the Clerk and Treasurer and 5 January
                1999 to the members of the Authority, until the legal power o f the Authority
                to provide financial assistance referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 has been
                resolved to the satisfaction o f the Authority ".

       4.10.3   The solicitors for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray were informed of
                the decision following the meeting on 5 February 1999.                  On 10
                February 1999, Garretts, the solicitors instructed by the Authority,
                wrote to the solicitors for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray setting out
                the Authority's reasons for its decision. Copies of these letters are in
                appendix 7. Similar letters were written to Ms Adlington and the
                solicitors for the Chief Constable.

4.11   The Chief Constable's Application

       The Chief Constable applied on 10 February 1999 to the High Court for a
       judicial review of resolutions 1 and 2 above. However, Ms Adlington was




                                              15
given leave to be joined as a party to the proceedings and challenged the legal
standing of the Chief Constable to make such an application. As a result, Mr
Duckenfield and Mr Murray also applied to be joined as parties to the
litigation as there was no doubt that they had legal standing to challenge the
Authority's decision. On 31 March 1999, the Court gave its judgment at the
same time as it gave judgment in respect of the DPP judicial review.

The Divisional Court's decision

4.12.1   The Court declared as follows:

         "A police authority has the statutory power, but subject to ordinary public
         law principles, to provide financial assistance to police officers and former
         police officers in respect o f their costs and expenses incurred in relation to
         private prosecutions brought against them and judicial review proceedings
         in which they participate''.

4.12.2   It is significant that the Court did not quash the resolutions of 5
         February 1999, although the Court did observe, in the proceedings
         following deliver}' of the judgment, that the Authority is to revisit
         the decision. Therefore, the resolutions of 5 February 1999 which
         declare the previous decisions to provide financial assistance null
         and void remain in force.

4.12.3   The Chief Constable's application to the Court also sought guidance
         on how the Authority should exercise its power to grant financial
         assistance if the Court held that such power existed, and in particular
         whether the availability of legal aid was relevant to the decision on
         funding to be taken by the Authority. The Court declined to give
         any guidance on how the Authority should exercise its power to
         provide financial assistance to current or former officers in legal
         proceedings arising from the conduct of their duties, other than by
         confirming that general public law principles applied. During the
         proceedings immediately following judgment, however, Lord Justice
         Laws observed that:-

         "... I think it is very important, in truth in the interests o f everyone
         concerned in this matter, that the Court should not attempt to steer public
         authorities such as [the AuthorityJ into any particular course of action on
         the merits".
               and:

                  " the parties know from the judgment tluit has been delivered that the vires
               [power] exists in principle and it will then be for the [Authority] to decide,
               subject to ordinary public law ndes ... xvhen and hoxo they may use that
              power".


      This makes it clear that although the Authority does have the basic power to
      support officers and former officers costs in legal proceedings arising from
      the performance of their duties, how this power is to be exercised is a matter
      for them.



5     THE LITIGATION FOR WHICH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS SOUGHT

5.1   The South Sefton Criminal Proceedings and the proposed South Sefton
      Judicial Review

      5.1.1   On 24 June 1998, informations were laid before the South Sefton
              Magistrates Court by Ms Adlington, the Solicitor representing the
              HFSG, alleging:

              (a)       against both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray offences of
                         manslaughter of two of those who died as a result of the
                         Hillsborough disaster, John Anderson and James Aspinall
                         and an offence of wilful neglect to perform a public duty; and

              (b)       against Mr Duckenfield alone, a further offence of perverting
                         the course of justice, said to consist in his having lied about
                         the circumstances in which gate C of the football ground
                         became open.

      5.1.2   Following representations from the parties, the Clerk to the Justices
              took the view that the South Sefton court had jurisdiction to deal
              with the offences, but that there was an argument that the
              summonses were ineffective unless the defendants submitted to the
              jurisdiction of the court. It was agreed that the proceedings would
              be brought forward to 10 July 1998 and that Ms Adlington would
              apply for them to be withdrawn.




                                             17
       5.1.3   On 10 July 1998, in the absence of all parties, the South Sefton
               Criminal Proceedings were withdrawn and the court made an order
               for Mr Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's costs to be assessed and paid
               from central funds in accordance with Section 16 of the Prosecution
               of Offences Act 1985.

       5.1.4   In September 1998, the solicitors for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray
               (being Winckworth Sherwood and Walker Morris respectively) each
               submitted their claims for costs.

       5.1.5   On 11 February 1999, the Clerk wrote to the solicitors for Messrs
               Duckenfield and Murray.           He stated that, as the Authority had
               agreed to pay Messrs Duckenfield and Murray's costs in relation to
               the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings, they had not themselves
               incurred any costs and were not entitled to be reimbursed from
               central funds. He based this view on the decision in R -v- Miller
               (Raymond) and Another (1993) 3 All ER 186 ("Miller").

      5.1.6    He drew attention to the fact that he was aware of the pending
               judicial review- in relation to the Police Authority's decision of 5
               February and advised that he would await the outcome of that
               hearing before he made a final decision. A final decision is expected
               from the Clerk shortly.

      5.1.7    Both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have stated their intention to
               seek a judicial review' of the Clerk's decision should it be
               unfavourable to them and have sought financial assistance from the
               Authority so to do - see further paragraph 6.2.1 below To the extent
               that the Authority is legally bound to provide assistance in relation
               to the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings (an issue on which Garretts
               advise in paragraph 7.6 below), the South Sefton Judicial Review
               would effectively be for the benefit of the Authority in reducing the
               costs it is liable to pay.

5.2 ' The .Leeds Criminal Proceedings

      5.2.1    On 13 July 1998 and 10 July 1998, fresh informations, alleging the
               same offences as the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings were laid by
               Ms Adlington before the Leeds Petty Sessional Division and
               summonses in respect of these offences were issued by the




                                            18
stipendiary magistrate against Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray.
Copies of the summonses are in appendix 8.

Following the discontinuance on 12 April 1999 of the charge of
perverting the course of justice against Mr Duckenfield, the
remaining charges against both officers are of manslaughter and
wilful neglect to perform a public duty.

The legal elements of these alleged offences are basically as follows:-

(a)    Manslaughter

       Manslaughter may be classified as voluntary or involuntary.
       Involuntary manslaughter may be committed as follows:-


       (i)    A person upon whom the law imposes a duty or who
               has taken upon himself any duty, tending to the
               preservation of life, and who, regardless of the life,
               safety, welfare and health of others, neglects to
               perform that duty or performs it negligently and
               thereby causes the death of another person may be
               guilty of manslaughter.

       (ii)   Similarly, a person who acts recklessly in such a
               manner as to create an obvious and serious risk of
               causing physical injury to some other person and who
               thereby causes the death of any person may also be
               guilty of manslaughter.

      It is important to note that a higher degree of negligence is
      necessary to render a person guilty of manslaughter than to
      establish civil liability against him and mere carelessness is not
      enough. The number of persons affected by a single act of
      negligence does not affect the degree of negligence. This
      offence is punishable by imprisonment for life or any shorter
      term at the discretion of the court.
 (b)      Wilful neglect to perform a public duty

          A public officer who wilfully and without reasonable excuse
          or justification neglects to perform a duty imposed on him
          either by common law or by statute may be guilty of this
          offence. The penalty for the offence is a fine and
        imprisonment at the discretion of the court and loss of office.

Leading Counsel for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray have provided
to the Authority a joint opinion on the merits of the prosecution
dated 26 April 1999. In a letter dated 30 April 1999 from Walker
Morris to Garretts a copy of Mr Murray's representations to the DPP
was enclosed (appendix 9).

Committal proceedings are due to commence on 5 July 1999. It is
understood that they have been given an estimate of 3 weeks. A
number of hearings on ancillary matters, such as a witness summons
requiring the Chief Constable to produce various statements and
documents, were heard on 10 May.

At the committal hearing, Counsel for Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray will argue:

(a)    There is no prima facie case of manslaughter or wilful neglect
       to perform a public duty; and

(b)    That the prosecutions are oppressive and an abuse of the
       right of private prosecutions.

If either submission succeeds, the Leeds Criminal Proceedings will
come to an end and an order for payment of the officer's costs out of
central funds is likely to be made.

If both submissions fail, the Leeds Criminal Proceedings will
continue to a CrowTi Court trial. There is currently no estimate of the
length of the trial. If Messrs Duckenfield and Murray are acquitted,
an order for payment out of central funds is likely to be made unless
the presiding judge were to decide that Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray:
        (a)    brought the prosecutions upon themselves for example by
               suspicious behaviour; or

        (b)    were acquitted on a technicality; or

        (c)    had not incurred any costs (for example because the
               Authority paid their costs - see further paragraph 5.2.8
               below).

5.2.8   Messrs Duckenfield and Murray have requested financial assistance
        for the Leeds Criminal Proceedings.       If the Authority provides
        financial assistance, there is a risk that the Chief Clerk of the Leeds
        Crown Court might conclude that, on the basis of Miller, they had
        not incurred costs and are not entitled to be re-imbursed out of
        central funds, although so long as the arrangements between the
        former officers, their lawyers and the Authority are properly
        structured, this risk can be reduced if not entirely eliminated. (See
        further paragraph 8.11.3 below’).

The DPP Judicial Review

5.3.1   In July 1998, Both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray made
        representations to the Director of Public Prosecutions that he should
        exercise his power under Section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences
        Act 1985 to take over the conduct of the Leeds Criminal Proceedings
        and then discontinue all charges under Section 23(3).

5.3.2   Following representations from Mr Duckenfield, Mr Murray and the
        HFSG, the DPP communicated his decision not to intervene by letter
        of 18 December 1998. It stated;

        "We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the
        parties and all the relevant circumstances of the case. We have
        concluded that we should not intervene to take over any of the
        charges".

5.3.3   The respective solicitors of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray asked for
        reasons to be given. There followed a letter of 1 February 1999 from
        the CPS Case Work Director, Mr Newell, to Mr Murray's solicitor (a
        copy of which is included at appendix 10).
Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray applied in March 1999 for a judicial
review of the DPP's decision. The DPP opposed the application. Ms
Adlington was given leave to intervene to support the DPP's
decision. Mr Newell made an affidavit expanding on the reasons
given in his letter of 1 February 1999. A copy of the affidavit is in
appendix 11.

On 31 March 1999 the Divisional Court delivered its decision on this
application. A copy of the judgment is in appendix 12.

The Divisional Court dealt with the application in two stages:

(a)   The charges against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray of
       manslaughter and wilful neglect; and

(b)   The charge against Mr Duckenfield of perverting the course
       of justice.

Manslaughter and wilful neglect

(a)   The DPP concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of
       conviction on these charges.      This is consistent with his
       previous conclusions and the outcome of the scrutiny.

(b)   However, the DPP stated that he

      "could not say there was clearly no case to answer. It was not
      right therefore, for [him] to take over the proceedings with a
      view to terminating them"

(c)   The Divisional Court decided there was no reason for it to
       interfere with the DPP's decision. Lord Justice Laws (with
       whom the other judges agreed) concluded

       "the DPP might, in my judgment, lawfully have decided to
       discontinue. The tragic events of Hillsborough have been the
      subject of repeated, detailed and thorough enquiries. Nearly
       10 years have passed. But, the judgment was for the DPP to
      make. If we acceded to [Counsel for Messrs Duckenfield and
      Murray's] submissions, we would I think usurp'the role of
       the primary decision maker".
                 (See the judgment in appendix 12 at page 16)

5.3.8    Perverting the course of justice

         On this charge, the DPP concluded

         "that there was clearlv no case to answer..."

         But he decided not to intervene for 3 reasons:

         (a)     He did not think partial intervention was appropriate or
                 desirable;

         (b)     Mr Duckenfield could invite the magistrate to dismiss the
                 charge (at committal) on the grounds that there was no case
                 to answer; and

         (c)     The charge arose out of the same events which gave rise to
                 the other charges which would be scrutinised in any event.

         The Divisional Court rejected this approach. It held that Mr
         Duckenfield was entitled to expect that the DPP would consider
         whether intervention was appropriate on each charge individually.
         Therefore, the DPFs decision on this charge alone was quashed and
         the DPP invited to reconsider it.

         On 12 April 1999, the DPP decided to take over and discontinue this
         charge (See the letter from Mr Newell to Winckworth Sherwood
         Solicitors in appendix 13).

5.3.9    Costs

        Mr Murray was ordered to pay the DPFs costs. Mr Duckenfield was
        ordered to pay 80% of the DPFs costs of the DPP Judicial Review.
        This reflects the fact that he enjoyed partial success in his application
        in having the charge of perverting the course of justice'referred back
        to the DPP (who subsequently intervened to quash the charge). As it
        is not usually appropriate to award costs in favour of a party which
        has intervened to support the decision under review, Ms Adlington
        did not seek costs against Messrs Duckenfield and Murr.ay. She did
        peek costs from central funds but these were refused.




                                    23
      5.3.10     Messrs Duckenfield and Murray have applied for financial assistance
                 from the Authoritv to meet both their own legal costs of their
                                      •»                         O


                 application to challenge the D PP's decision of 18 December 1998 and
                 the costs of the DPP's legal advice which were awarded against them
                 (see paragraph 6.2.3 below).

5.4   The Powers Judicial Review

      5.4.1     The events leading up to the Powers Judicial Review and the
                 judgment of the Court in relation to that review are summarised in
                 paragraph 4 above.

      5.4.2      Despite succeeding with their legal arguments in the Powers Judicial
                 Review, neither the Chief Constable nor Messrs Duckenfield and
               • Murray sought an order for costs against the Authority. Messrs
                 Duckenfield and Murray did, however,         seek an order for costs
                 against Ms Adlington, which she opposed.       The basis of the costs
                 application against Ms Adlington was that Messrs Duckenfield and
                 Murray would not have commenced their own application for
                 judicial review against the Authority's decision if Ms Adlington had
                 not contended in her affidavit and skeleton argument that the Chief
                 Constable did not have legal standing to challenge the Authority's
                 decision.   In the light of this submission, the court ordered Ms
                 Adlington to pay Messrs Duckenfield and Murray's costs.

      5.4.3     Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have applied to the Authority for
                 financial assistance in respect of their costs in these proceedings to
                 the extent not met by the costs awarded against Ms Adlington.

      5.4.4     It should also be noted that Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray were
                 offered support in relation to the Powers Judicial Review from the
                 Police Superintendents Association. The terms of that support are
                 summarised in a letter from the Police Superintendent's Association
                 of England and Wales to Winckworth Sherwood Solicitors dated 5
                 March 1999 (appendix 14).


6     PRESENT APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

6.1   Following the judgment in the Powers Judicial Review, the Authority's
      solicitors, Garretts, sought clarification from Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray




                                           24
                  of their application for financial assistance by letters dated 7 April 1999 and 30
                  April 1999. Copies of the responses from Mr Duckenfield dated 16 April 1999
                  and Mr Murray dated 22 April 1999 to the Authority, together with responses
                  from Walker Morris (solicitors to Mr Murray) to Garretts dated 7 May 1999
                  and Winckworth Sherwood (solicitors to Mr Duckenfield) dated 13 May 1999
                  are at Appendix 15.

            6.2   Their applications are for financial assistance to meet their legal costs and
                  disbursements in the following proceedings:

                  6.2.1   The South Sefton Judicial Review

                          (a)     As noted above in paragraph 5.1.7 both Mr Duckenfield and
                                  Mr Murray have stated their intention to seek a judicial
                                  review of the decision of the Clerk to the South Sefton Justices
                                  should he refuse to allow their costs to be paid from central
                                  funds.   The solicitors representing Mr Duckenfield have
                                  provided a cost estimate of £5,000 to £7,000 (excluding VAT
                                  and disbursements) for such judicial review. The risk of the
                                  Respondent's costs being awarded against Mr Duckenfield
                                  and Mr Murray if the Clerk's view on costs is vindicated
                                  should, however, be borne in mind.

                          (b)     To the extent that the Authority is legally bound to provide
                                  assistance   in relation   to    the South               Sefton   Criminal
                                 Proceedings, (as to which see paragraph 7.6 below) the South
                                 Sefton Judicial Review would effectively be for the benefit of
                                 the Authority. However, the Authority is recommended to
                                 defer its decision in respect of this part of the applications
                                 until the decision of the Clerk to the Justices and reasons for
                                 that decision are known. Any decision of the Authority to
                                 grant financial assistance before then could be open to
                                 potential challenge on the ground of irrationality, as it is not
                                 possible to properly consider the merits of the case until the
                                 Clerk's decision and reasons are known.

6.2.2   The South Sefton Criminal Proceedings and the Leeds Criminal
        Proceedings

        Both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have applied for financial
        assistance in respect of costs and disbursements incurred in the
        conduct of their respective defences in the criminal proceedings
        referred to in paragraphs 5.1 and 5.2 above. As noted at paragraphs
        4.4   and   4.6 above, Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray were each
        informed in writing in 1998 that their reasonable expenses in respect
        of the criminal proceedings (that is, both the South Sefton Criminal
        Proceedings and the Leeds Criminal Proceedings) would be met by
        the Authority.

        The legal costs and disbursements incurred by Mr Duckenfield in
        respect of the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings amount to
        £8,716.63 (including VAT). Legal costs and disbursements incurred
        by Mr Murray in respect of the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings
        amount to £5,874.40 (including VAT). It is not yet known how much
        (if any) of these costs and disbursements the Clerk to the South
        Sefton justices will allow to be paid from central funds and it is
        recommended that the Authority defer any decision in relation to the
        funding of the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings until this is
        known.

        The Authority has not paid any sums pursuant to the 1998 decisions
        to provide financial assistance to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray.
        An invoice for £34,492.16 (including VAT) for work up to 18
        September 1998 has been submitted by Mr Duckenfield's solicitors.
        A costs breakdown of the fees and expenses which their client has
        incurred or is expected to incur in the criminal proceedings, DPP
        Judicial Review (excluding costs of the DPP awarded against Mr
        Duckenfield) and Powers Judicial Review has, however, been

      6.2.3    The DPP Judicial Review

               Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have both applied for financial
               assistance in respect of their legal expenses incurred and those costs
               awarded against them in the judicial review (referred to at paragraph
               5.3 above) of the DPP's decision not to take over and discontinue the
               prosecutions.

               Mr Murray was ordered to pay the DPFs costs. As Mr Duckenfield's
               application to the court was partially successful, in that the decision
               not to take over and discontinue the charge of perverting the cause of
               justice was quashed, he has been ordered to pay 80% of the DPFs
               costs. The DPP has not yet provided an account of his costs.

      6.2.4    The Powers Judicial Review

               Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have also both applied for financial
               assistance in respect of any legal expenses incurred in the judicial
               review of the Authority's decisions that it had no power to provide
               the financial assistance sought by the former officers, but only to the
               extent not reimbursed under the costs award made against Ms
               Adlington.

               Both officers applied to be joined as parties to these proceedings after
               Ms Adlington disputed the Chief Constable's legal standing to bring
               the application. Ms Adlington has been ordered to pay their costs of
              . the application.

               It is recommended that the Authority defer its decision on this part
               of the applications pending assessment and payment of Ms
               Adlington's costs liability to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray.


7     LEGAL FEES INCURRED IN THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS UP TO 5
      FEBRUARY 1999         .

7.1   As noted above at paragraphs 4.4 and 4.6 the Authority originally agreed in
      1998 to meet the reasonable expenses of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray in
      the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings and Leeds Criminal Proceedings. (See
      the letters in appendices 1 and 2)




                                           28
On 13 January 1999 the Clerk and Treasurer wrote to Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray's solicitors stating that the Authority would be reviewing the issue of
financial assistance and that the Clerk and Treasurer was not in a position to
authorise payments in respect of the private prosecutions. In response to a
query from Mr Murray's solicitors, Walker Morris, the Clerk and Treasurer
wrote to Walker Morris on 14 January 1999 stating

"you should not incur further costs pending the meeting of the Authority and
that, if you do so, it will be at your own risk".

Copies of the Clerk and Treasurer's letters are attached at appendix 16. On 5
February 1999, the Authority resolved that it had no legal power to provide
funding and, accordingly, that its previous decisions to provide funding were
null and void.     Whilst the High Court held on 31 March 1999 that the
Authority did in fact have a statutory power to provide funding, the decisions
of the Authority on 5 February 1999 were not quashed by the High Court.
Therefore, the resolutions remain in force in effect although the court expects
the Authority to revisit the resolutions. It is the opinion of Garretts that Mr
Duckenfield and Mr Murray both have a strong case that they have a legally
enforceable right
              O
                  to recover from the Authoritv✓ their costs in the Leeds
Criminal Proceedings and the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings incurred up
to 5 February 1999 (to the extent that those costs are reasonable).

In relation to the costs incurred bv Messrs Duckenfield and Murrav in the
Leeds Criminal Proceedings since 5 February 1999 and in the DPP Judicial
Review, Garretts' opinion is that the Authority may decide to offer assistance
to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray on the same or different terms as
previously given, or it may decide not to provide assistance. This report deals
further with these questions in paragraphs 8 and 9 below.

The remainder of this paragraph 7 explains why Mr Duckenfield and Mr
Murray may have a strong claim for the costs of the criminal proceedings up
to 5 February 1999, but not after, and the principles on which the strength of
that claim should be judged.

Legitimate expectation

7.6.1    Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray may allege that they have a
         "legitimate expectation" in respect of the costs they have incurred in
         the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings and the Leeds Criminal




                                    29
        Proceedings up to 5 February 1999.            The concept of "legitimate
        expectation" has developed through a number of cases and has
        emerged as an enforceable right which may arise when a public
        authority seeks to withdraw from an assurance previously given bv
        it concerning the way in which it will exercise its powers.

7.6.2   YVhile "legitimate expectation" is now capable of giving rise to
        substantive rights, the concept of a legitimate expectation was
        initially formulated to ensure that a person would not have a right or
        interest which had been granted by a public body withdrawn or
        varied without an opportunity to make representations. Therefore, it
        was appropriate that the Authority heard from Messrs Duckenfield
        and Murrav
                 * when it met on 5 February
                                           * 1999 and did not withdraw
        funding of the criminal proceedings from them until that date.

7.6.3   While the boundaries of legitimate expectation are still developing,
        the elements needed to be established in this case are:

        (a)    a clear and unambiguous representation to Messrs
               Due
               Duckenfield and Murrav that thev would receive funding;
                                          ✓       ✓                       O '


               and

        (b)    that they acted in reliance on the representation to their
               detriment (there is some question as to whether reliance to
               detriment is a necessary ingredient. However, recent cases
               indicate that it is necessary).

7.6.4   The concept is always subject to the right of public bodies to
        withdraw from a position in appropriate circumstances.          This is
        consistent with a principle that there cannot be a fettering of a public
        authority's discretion by a fixed polity. But if a public body wishes to
        withdraw from a position it has taken, it may be required to honour
        undertakings or assurances it has given on which someone has relied
        up to that date, unless there is an overriding public interest
        consideration against so doing.

7.6.5   The concept is also subject to a public body acting within its power.
        A public authority cannot be required, nor is it entitled, to do
        something outside its basic statu tor}' powers, even if if has given an
        assurance so to do. If the public body has the basic statutory power,




                                  30
      however, but exercised it irregularly in giving the relevant assurance,
      then it mav still be bound bv that assurance. The decision of the
      Divisional Court on the Powers Judicial Review has confirmed that
      the Authority has the basic statutory power to meet current and
      former police officer's legal expenses in appropriate circumstances.
      Therefore, an enforceable legitimate expectation may well have
      arisen in favour of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray that their legal
      expenses of the criminal proceedings up to 5 February 1999 (when
      the original decision to meet those expenses was reversed) would be
      met by the Authority, even if there were procedural irregularities in
      the original decision.

6.6   It is important to note that Messrs Duckenfield and Murray's
      application should be considered separately and in particular
      whether they relied on the assurances given to their detriment. It is
      conceivable that one might establish an enforceable legitimate
      expectation whereas the other might not.

6.7   What the Authoritv needs to decide, therefore, is whether the officers

                                                                                  -9
      conditions:-

      (a)    Clear and unambiguous representation

              There seems little room to doubt that the letters of 5 March
              and 29 June to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray constitute a
              clear and unambiguous representation that their legal costs of
              the criminal proceedings would be met.

      (b)    Reliance to detriment

            It will be for each of the former officers to establish whether
            they have acted in reliance to their detriment on the letters
            from the Authority. It is likely that they did so, however, by
            instructing solicitors to represent them, without applying for
            legal aid. While it is not too late to seek legal aid, it will not be
            granted retrospectively (i.e. will not cover costs they have
            already incurred with their solicitors) but, if granted, will only
            meet future costs and then subject to the former officers
            making substantial contributions from their own resources.




                                  31
(c)     Are there any public interest factors which should override
        a decision to meet such expenses?

       The Authority should consider whether anv circumstances
                     v                            ■»


       such as public policy or other overriding factors in the public
        interest exist which would mitigate against meeting the
       former officer's costs up to 5 February 1999. Garretts have
       not, however, identified any such circumstances.

If Messrs Duckenfield and Murray establish the three elements for
legitimate expectation, which it appears likely that they will, it is
difficult to see that the Authority has any real alternative but to meet
their reasonable expenses of the Leeds Criminal Proceedings up to
the time the Authority effectively reversed its previous decisions on
financial assistance for the Leeds Criminal Proceedings.        Having
regard to the requirements of reasonable notice and their right to be
heard, it is submitted that the date the Authority effectively reversed
its decision and to which therefore reasonable expenses of the
criminal proceedings should be met, is 5 February 1999. This was the
first opportunity that representatives of Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray had to be heard on the issue of whether funding was to be
withdrawn and an unambiguous decision was taken by the
Authority to withdraw funding for the Leeds Criminal Proceedings.

It is submitted that the Authority was entitled, as from 5 February
1999 to withdraw the assurances given to the former officers about
funding their legal costs of the Criminal Proceedings, on the basis of
the legal principle that in areas of ongoing public expenditure, a
public body must not fetter its discretion. Therefore, it is entitled to
revoke, vary or suspend an expenditure commitment after proper
notice and an opportunity to challenge that decision has been given
to those affected by the change of policy. The Clerk and Treasurer's
letters of 13 and 14 January 1999 (referred to in paragraph 7.2 above).
and the opportunity afforded to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray to
be heard on 5 February 1999 would appear to meet the requirements
of notice and opportunity to be heard.
Recommendations w ith regard to costs of the Criminal Proceedings up to 5
February 1999

       A.       If the Authority are satisfied following presentations made by
                or on behalf of Mr Duckenfield, Mr Murray and Ms
                Adlington at their meeting that:-

                (i)      a clear and unambiguous assurance of funding for the
                         Criminal Proceedings was given by or on behalf of the
                         Authority;

                (id)     the former officers relied on that assurance to their
                         detriment (for example by not seeking funding from
                         other sources such as legal aid); and

                (iii)    that no overriding public interest factors exist which
                         means it would be inappropriate to confirm such
                         funding

                Garretts' recommend that the Authority should meet Mr
                Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's reasonable legal expenses for
                the Leeds Criminal Proceedings up to 5 February 1999. A
                decision on the South Sefton expenses should be deferred
                pending the decision of the Clerk to the Justices of the South
                Sefton Magistrates Court as to whether Messrs Duckenfield
                and Murray are entitled to be reimbursed out of central
                funds.

      B.        In order to assess the reasonableness of the legal expenses
                claimed, the costs incurred should be reviewed by a legal
                costs draftsman specialising in criminal costs. If his or her
                advice be that the costs claimed are not reasonable, the
                Authority should apply to the Court to have the costs
                assessed under Section 71 Solicitors Act 1974 (assessment of
                costs on application of third parties liable to pay costs) unless
                the costs to be paid can be agreed. However, it should be
                noted that the Court is not bound to grant an application by
                the Authority for such assessment.
8     THE MERITS OF THE APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

8.1   It will be recalled that:

      8.1.1      On 22 December 1998 and 5 January 1999, Ms Adlington wrote
                 letters challenging the Authority’s decisions on 2 grounds namely:

                 (a)     There was no power for the Authority to pay the legal costs in
                         relation to criminal proceedings against officers; and

                 (b)     Even if such power existed, it had been exercised improperly
                         in this case. (See paragraph 4.8 and 4.9.2).

      8.1.2      On 5 February 1999 the Authority resolved, amongst other things

                 "4 - To defer consideration of the procedural issues raised by Ms Adlington,
                 in her letters of 22 December 199S to the Clerk and Treasurer and 5 January
                 1999 to the members of the Authority, until the legal power of the Authority
                 to provide financial assistance referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 has been
                 resolved to the satisfaction of the Authority".

      8.1.3      The Divisional Court has recognised that the Authority has
                 committed itself to revisiting its decision to grant (and revoke)
                 financial assistance in the light of the finding of power.               The
                 application for financial        assistance       for the   Leeds   Criminal
                 Proceedings (after 5 February 1999 only) and the DPP Judicial
                 Review should now be considered afresh by the Authority.

8.2   In making the decision whether to exercise its discretion to grant such
      financial assistance to Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray, the Authority must
      bear in mind that, whilst the court has confirmed that it has the power to
      grant such financial assistance, it by no means follows that the Authority
      should grant such financial assistance.

8.3   In deciding whether to meet the legal costs of Mr Duckenfield and Mr
      Murray, (whether in relation to the criminal proceedings or any of the other
      proceedings referred to above) the Authority is subject to the public law
      principles of decision making. Briefly, these are that it must (amongst other
      things):
                                                      s'
      •       act within whatever statutory powers conferred upon it by Act of
              Parliament;



                                             34
 •        act with procedural fairness (including by giving a hearing to directly
          interested parties);

 •       take all relevant considerations into account;

 •       ignore all irrelevant considerations;

 •       not act irrationally;

 •       not fetter its discretion; and

 •       not unlawfully delegate the decision making function.

Failure to comply with any of these principles will expose the decision to
challenge by judicial review. The Authority must individually consider each
of Mr Duckenfield's and Mr Murray’s applications in respect of each separate
set of proceedings (and, in the case of the criminal proceedings, each charge)
separately.     All relevant considerations should be taken into account and
weighed against each other. Garretts consider that the major considerations
include:-

8.4.1     whether the Authority is satisfied that the former officers acted in
            good faith in directing the police operations on the day of the
            disaster;

8.4.2     whether the former officers exercised their judgment reasonably, in
            the light of the circumstances they faced, and if not, whether other
           relevant factors outweigh this consideration;
                                                                            *
8.4.3     whether it is appropriate to require Mr Duckenfield or Kir Murray to
          look to alternative sources of finance to pay their legal costs, such as
          legal aid, the Police Superintendent's Association or their own
          resources, given the likely adverse financial effects for them of
        - seeking legal aid;

8.4.4     the seriousness of the charges and whether it is appropriate to agree
          to provide funding, before a verdict is reached on them;

8.4.5     the Authority's view on the merits of the charges;

8.4.6     The impact on the Authority's resources of funding the former
          officer's costs and the "knock on" effect on policing in South
          Yorkshire (the Chief Constable will be present to advise on this at the
          meeting); and

8.4.7      the impact of a refusal to provide financial support on police morale
          and on the confidence of officers to exercise their judgment in
          difficult circumstances.

Factors which may assist in reaching a decision include:-

•       Guidance in Home Office Circulars;


•       The circumstances of the Hillsborough Stadium tragedy as recorded,
         inter alia, in:

         (a)       The interim report of Lord Justice Taylor into the
                   Hillsborough Stadium disaster; and

         (b)       The Scrutiny of Lord Justice Stuart Smith into the
                   Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


•       The decision of the DPP in 1990 that there was insufficient evidence
        upon which prosecution for manslaughter or any other criminal
        offence could be brought against anv officer in the South Yorkshire
        Police or any other person.


•       The decision of the Director of the Public Prosecutions in 1997 that the
        material so far presented would not justify fresh investigations.


•       The decision of the Director of Public Prosecution in 1999 that in
        respect of the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a
        public duty, the Director of Public Prosecutions was not satisfied that
        there was clearly no case to answer and decided not to take over and
        discontinue the prosecutions.


•       The fact that the D PPs decision in 1999 not to take over and
        discontinue the prosecution of Mr Duckenfield for perverting the
        course of justice was quashed by the High Court on judicial review
              and remitted to the DPP for reconsideration, and that the DPP has
              now taken over and discontinued this charge.


      •       The inquest findings of accidental death.


      •       The fact that disciplinary charges of neglect of duty were directed by
              the Police Complaints Authority against Mr Duckenfield and Mr
              Murray but were never determined due to the retirement of Mr
              Duckenfield.


      •       The fact that after several years of service to the police force, each of
              Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray retired with clean disciplinary
              records.


      •       The likely costs of the financial assistance.


      •       The financial resources of Messrs Duckenfield and Murrav.


      •       Relevant representations put to the Authority by the Chief Constable,
              Mr Duckenfield, Mr Murray and the HFSG.


5.6   Guidance on a number of these matters was given in the Divisional Court
      decision of R - v - Derbyshire Police Authority ex parte Wilson & Dalton (1989).

8.7   Home Office Circulars

      In I Vilson and Dalton, the court considered the relevance of the Home Office
      circular then in effect in relation to the funding of police officers' costs, HOC
      77/87. A copy of HOC 77/87 and the replacement circular, HOC 4/1998 are
      in appendix 17. The following principles emerged on the relevance of Home
      Office guidance:

      8.7.1    Circulars do not have statutory force but are a good indication of the
               matters to be taken into account.




                                          37
      8.7.2    Lord Justice Gibson further commented

               ”that is not to say that in considering an application for reimbursement of
               costs by an officer, a Police Authority is necessarily limited to factors in the
               circular."

      8.7.3   The central principle in HOC 4/1998 is

              "it is important that police officers should be able to carry out their duties in
               the confidence that their Police Authority xvill support them, if they act in
               good faith and exercise their judgment reasonably".


8.8   Good Faith and Reasonableness of Conduct

      8.8.1   In drawing any conclusions as to good faith and reasonable exercise
               of judgment, the Authority m ust consider all relevant evidence
               including the findings of the various investigations and reports. It is
               also important that the Authority does not limit itself to
               consideration of good faith but also considers whether Mr
               Duckenfield or Mr Murray exercised their duties reasonably. If the
               Authority decides either or both of them acted unreasonably,
               however, it may still decide that other factors pointing to supporting
               the relevant former officers outweigh this consideration (whilst it is
               difficult to envisage circumstances justifying supporting an officer
               who the Authority considers acted in bad faith).

      8.8.2   On the relevance of the conduct of the officers in Wilson and Dalton
              ■and more specifically on "good'faith" and "reasonable exercise of
              judgment", Lord Justice Ralph Gibson commented



               "if therefore, there was, on the part of the officer, negligence, i.e. failure to
              exercise such care as was reasonably to be required in the circumstances of
              an officer of his rank and experience', doing Tiisjob in the force, then in my
               view, the Police Authority is entitled to have regard to it if such negligence
               was connected to the subject matter of the legal proceedings, or to the
               causing of the legal proceedings to be taken, tluit it can fairly be regarded as
              a substantial cause of the incurring of the costs. I have no doubt that a
               Police Authority, if satisfied of good faith on the part of the officer, would




                                             38
         normally act, and be pleased to act, on the central principle stated in the
         circular [i.e good faith]; but the discretion is given to the Authority and it is
         impossible, in my view, to hold that, once goodfaith is established, a Police
         Authority must disregard clear evidence of negligence or a failure to
         "exercise judgment reasonably". So to hold would mean that a Police
         Authority would be required to disregard acts of substantial negligence,
         such that it could fairly be said that, although acquitted on bad faith, the
         officer had "brought the proceedings upon himself'.



8.8.3    The decision whether the evidence of such negligence in a particular
         case justifies withholding reimbursement, wholly or in part, is,
         therefore, entrusted to the Police Authority.

8.5.4    While the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police has admitted
         negligence in certain civil actions which have been brought, it must
         also be remembered that:

         (a)    the admissions were in respect of civil, not criminal liability;

         (b)    the other parties who were held responsible contributed to
                 the damages paid to the victims; and

         (c)    there was no finding that Messrs Duckenfield and Murray
                 were themselves individually negligent and responsible for
                 the disaster.

8.8.5    Whilst all the relevant factors must be considered as a whole, it is
        worth drawing attention to the following from Lord Justice Taylor's
        interim report and Lord Justice Stuart Smith's Scrutiny as relevant to
        an assessment of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray's behaviour:

(i)     From Lord Justice Taylor’s Interim Report (appendix 18) -
         "Postponement of kick off"

"226 - At various stages in his evidence, Mr Duckenfield gave three accounts
of why he thought it was too late to postpone kick off. Once it was that one of
the teams had already come onto the pitch. Then it was that a group of
photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the teams
were coming out. Finally, he did not know why he thought the teams were




                                      39
       coming out. They did not in fact come on to the pitch until 2.54pm, two
       minutes after gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton had asked for a
       postponement of kick off before gate C was opened. It should not, however,
       have needed a police constable in the thick of the crowd (and there were
       others of like mind) to think of postponing the kick off. The need should have
       been clear in the control room.

       227 - The truth was that Kir Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had
       discussed with Mr Murray. Kick off would not be postponed unless there
       was some major cause for delayed arrivals e.g. a jam on the motorway or fog.
       I accept that the thinking behind this policy was not callous or punitive. If
       kick-off is postponed whenever a proportion of fans choose to leave the
       public houses late, the practice may grow and kick off times would become
       meaningless. But, a commander must deal with the problem of the day.
       Faced with a situation which was becoming dangerous, crowd safety should
       have been his paramount consideration. Kick off should have been delayed.

Summary

       22S - The layout of the turnstiles and the number they were required to serve
       left no margin of safety against an uneven flow of fans. Because police
       strategy in advance and on the day did not cater for it, the arrival of a large
      number of supporters between 2.30pm and 2.40pm created an unmanageable
      crush. The presence of a substantial minority of fans who had drunk too
       much aggravated that problem. Having lost control and rejected the option
      of postponing kick off, the police were faced with the serious danger of
       deaths or injuries. They were left therefore with no alternative but to open
       the gates. Superintendent Marshall was right at that stage to ask for it and Mr
      Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects of so dramatic a step
      •required other action.

The blunder on opening the gates

      229 - The decision to order the opening of the gates was not accompanied or
      followed by any other order to deal with the consequences. When gate C
      was opened, a steady stream of about 2000 fans poured through it over some




                                           40
      five minutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground somewhere and
      unless they were diverted their likeliest route was through the tunnel for
      reasons already given. No warning was issued from the control room that the
      gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not alerted. Neither the
      Club control room, nor the Chief Steward at the Leppings Lane end was
      warned. Not even Mr Greenwood, the Ground Commander, was informed.
      From 2.47pm when Mr Marshall made his first request until 2.52pm when Mr
      Duckenfield acceded to it, there were five minutes in which orders could have
      been given as to how the influx was to be absorbed. It was not done. In
      evidence, Mr Duckenfield began by saying that no officer made any wrong
      decision but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. He said he did not
      consider where the people would go when the gate opened. Even after it
      opened, when he could see the influx on the television screen, no order was
      given to steer the fans to the wing pens. Mr Duckenfield said it did not cross
      his mind to detail officers on the concourse to shut off the tunnel. Those
      officers could not have known from their position how full pens 3 and 4 were.
      That was a matter for the control room to monitor from its own observations
      and using intelligence from around the ground."

      "231...it should have been clear in the control room where there was a view of
      the pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If
      orders had been given to that effect when gate C was opened, the fans could
      have been directed to the empty areas of the wings and this disaster could
      still have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the first
      magnitude".

"The Officers in Command

      250 - Even when realisation of the problem came to officers on the track, it
      was some minutes before it reached the control room. When spectators first
      appeared on the track, the immediate assumption in the control room was
      that a pitch invasion was threatened. This was unlikely at the beginning of a
      match. It became still less likely when those on the track made no move
      towards the pitch. Mr Motson, the BBC commentator, recognise'd and said
      well before the match was stopped, that the trouble seemed to be




                                         41
      overcrowding and not misbehaviour. Still, the assumption to the contrary
      persisted in the control room. Until Mr Murray radioed for a fleet of
      ambulances, about 3.06pm, Mr Duckenfield continued to treat the incident as
      a threat to the pitch and to public order."

      "281 - Mr Duckenfield leant heavily on Mr Murray's experience. Between
      them they misjudged the build up at the turnstiles and did little about it until
      the received Mr Marshall's request to open the gate.            They did not, for
      example, check the turnstile figures available from Club control or check with
      Tango units as to the numbers still to come.             They did not alert Mr
      Greenwood to the situation at the fringe of his area of command. They gave
      no instructions as to the management of the crowd at Leppings Lane.
      Inflexibly, they declined to postpone kick off.

      282 - When Mr Marshall's request came, Mr Duckenfield's capacity to take
      decisions and give orders seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the
      opening of the gates, he failed to give necessary consequential orders or to
      exert any control when the disaster occurred. He misinterpreted the
      emergence of fans from pens 3 and 4. When he was unsure of the problem, he
      sent down others to "assess the situation" rather than descend to see for
      himself. He gave no information to the crowd."


      (ii)             From Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny Report (appendix 19)

Chapter 1

      "25. The Director of Public Prosecutions had the responsibility of deciding
      whether criminal proceedings, in practice charges of manslaughter, should be
      brought against any corporate body or individual. In their submissions to me
      Counsel for the Family Support Group have only invited me to make a
      recommendation to the DPP in the case of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray...

      26. the DPP, accepting the advice of two very experienced Queen's Counsel,
      concluded in 1990 that there was not sufficient evidence to justify such
      charges against either of these officers. The fresh evidence, therefore, would
      have to be of sufficient significance that there is, in my view, a real possibility
      that in considering it the DPP might change her mind and institute



                                          42
proceedings for manslaughter, or any other offence, against one or both of
these officers".

"52. I have read the joint opinion of Counsel dated 6 August 1990 which gave
advice to the Director of Public Prosecutions on the possible criminal
proceedings against Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield, amongst others.
Although the material available to Counsel was more extensive than that
which was placed before Lord Taylor, because by that time the criminal
investigation carried out by the West Midlands Police had been completed,
Counsel stated that
" the criminal investigation, far all his thoroughness, has not significantly added to or
contradicted Lord Justice Taylor's findings. In our judgment, therefore, the Taylor
analysis of the facts is as firm a base as any from which to approach the question of
Criminal Liability''

53. Counsel then set out a full, detailed and careful resume of the facts based
on the evidence then available. I have not found any error or omission in this
resume, nor in my view is any particular aspect understated or exaggerated. I
have also considered the statement of the law set out in the opinion. Counsel
considered both the offences of manslaughter and culpable misfeasance in
public office. They were plainly correct to consider that the latter offence
would be no easier to establish than manslaughter in the circumstances of the
case.

54. In order to recommend that the DPP reconsider the decision not to
prosecute, therefore, I must be satisfied that any fresh evidence establishes, or
may establish, facts not previously considered by Counsel or the significance
of which was not appreciated, which makes it more likely that charges of
manslaughter could be established. Essentially this relates to Mr
Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's knowledge and appreciation o f the risk of
injury in doing what they did or omitted to do....

55. From my meetings with the bereaved families and their representatives, I
am left in no doubt that there was widespread disappointment at the DPP's
decision not to prosecute. They find it difficult to understand in the light of




                                      43
Lord Taylor's trenchant criticisms of the South Yorkshire Police and the fact
that the force have been paying compensation.

56. What the Director of Public Prosecutions had to bear in mind, however, is
the significantly different and greater degree of culpability which is involved
in manslaughter, or culpable misfeasance in public office, as against the
degree of negligence which gives rise to liability7, and compensation
payments, under civil law. Any prosecution of an individual police officer
would have to establish his individual responsibility. It would not be enough
simply to prove the composite failure of the police operation.

57. The causes of the disaster were many and complex. So far as these two
officers were concerned, the prosecution would have to prove to the high
standard required for a criminal conviction [i.e. beyond reasonable doubt]
that the failure to give the order to close off the tunnel when gate C was
opened amounted to the serious degree of recklessness necessary to constitute
manslaughter".

Chapter 7

"5....I have come to the clear conclusion that there is no basis upon which
there should be a further Judicial Injury or a reopening of Lord Taylor's
Inquiry. There is no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court
or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act
1988. 13o not consider that there is any material which should be put before
the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which
might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken..."

"6 ... None of the evidence I was asked to consider added anything significant
to the evidence which was available to Lord Taylor's Inquiry or to the
Inquests".


The nature of the charges against the former officers and the merits of the
charges

8.9.1     Each of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray face two charges of
          manslaughter and one charge of wilful neglect to perform a public
                 duty. Paragraphs 5.2.3 (a) and (b) above set out the elements of these
                 offences.

       8.9.2     The Authority has requested Leading Counsel for each of the former
                 officers, namely William Clegg QC for Mr Duckenfield and Michael
                 Harrison QC for Mr Murray, to provide an opinion on these matters.

       8.9.3     In appendix 9 is a copy of their joint opinion and a copy of Mr
                 Murray's representations to the DPP.

8.10   The likely costs to the Authority of providing financial assistance sought
       for the Leeds Criminal Proceedings

       These are referred to in paragraph 6.

8.11   Availability of alternative sources of funding

       S .ll.l   In Wilson and Dalton, the court considered whether the fact that Mr
                 Wilson and Mr Dalton's costs had been met by the Police Federation
                 was a relevant consideration which could be properly taken into
                 account in considering whether to reimburse those costs to Mr
                 Wilson and Mr Dalton. The report of the Police Authority's decision
                 in that case stated "any reimbursement of costs would in effect be a
                 reimbursement to the Police Federation of its costs". The court held
                 that the fact that an officer has been provided with legal
                 representation by the Federation was an irrelevant consideration.
                 Lord Justice Ralph Gibson said
                 "Mr Underhill [Counsel for Mr Wilson and Mr Dalton] submitted
                 that this was wholly irrelevant; the fact that these two officers had
                 been supported by thu Federation did not affect in any relevant way
                 the merits of their applications, and, if their applications were good,
                 so that they were entitled to reimbursement in whole or in part, they
                 should be allowed. It is, of course, a commonplace of the exercise of
                 discretion as to costs in our courts that in general, no attention is paid
                 to the fact that a plaintiff or defendant is entitled, in right of his
                 membership of a trade union, to legal representation. His right to an
                 order for costs depends in the ordinary case, upon the merits of his
                 claim thereto. The fact that his union supports him is as irrelevant as
                 the fact, if it should be the case, that he borrowed the money for his



                                             45
         costs from his parents on terms that he would not be expected to
         repay it.... for my part I have no doubt that Mr Underhill's primary
         submission is correct and that, having regard to the terms of the
         circular, the mere fact that an officer has been provided with legal
         representation by the Federation is irrelevant to the question whether
         an application for reimbursement should be granted....that
         conclusion does not mean that a Police Authority could in no case
         whatever have regard as to whether the Federation had provided the
         legal representation or whether it had been paid for by the officer
         personally. An application might be very finely balanced, having
         regard to the various factors to be weighed. If, in a particular case, a
         Police Authority was minded to take into account, in support of a
         plea based on severe financial hardship, that an officer was
         personally liable for the costs, I consider the Authority would be
         entitled to have such regard to it as it would think proper in the
         circumstances".

S.11.2   In Garretts' opinion, the availability or otherwise of Legal Aid should
         be considered in light of the following:

         (a)   The fact that Legal Aid is not available to Mr Duckenfield and
                Mr Murray in the judicial review proceedings and that a
                significant personal contribution may be required in respect
                of the Leeds Criminal Proceedings and the South Sefton
                Criminal Proceedings may add weight to any plea from the
                former officers of severe financial hardship in support of their
                applications;

         (b)   It is arguable that both R v Gloucestershire County Council and
                another, ex parte Barry [1997] 2 ALL E.R. 1 and R z> Chief
                Constable of Sussex, ex parte International Trader's Ferry Ltd
                [1997] 2 ALL E.R. 65 indicate that the availability of funding
                sources other than the Authority's own resources would be
                relevant. Both cases emphasise the fact that the legal duties
                of an authority are qualified by the resources available to that
                authority. It is acknowledged that where an authority has a
                limited budget to satisfy various demands which it has a duty




                                   46
                  to fulfil, it is entitled to decide how’’ to best allocate that
                 budget to the maximum advantage of the maximum number
                 of persons who are entitled to its services, and must weigh up
                 the needs of one such person against another;

         (c)     Given the acknowledgement in these cases of the need for
                 police or other relevant authorities to spread limited
                 resources between a number of different obligations, and to
                 weigh up the needs of one potential beneficiary against
                 another, it would seem inappropriate to exclude from
                 consideration the fact that the officers, in this case, might
                 receive financial support from the legal aid fund to mitigate
                 their costs, whilst paying the costs might deprive the force of
                 the funds required for other police purposes;

         (d)     Any assistance provided by the Authority in respect of future
                 legal costs will be added to Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray's
                 capital resources in assessing their eligibility for legal aid. In
                 effect this means that any funding by the Authority will
                 correspondingly reduce an)' contribution which the Legal Aid
                 Fund would otherwise make to their costs; and

         (e)     It is unlikely that Legal Aid will be awarded retrospectively
                 and accordingly the former officers- costs after 5 February
                 1999 may be recoverable from no-one, if the Authority are
                 unwilling to meet these costs.

         We have asked the Solicitors for Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray to
         provide details of their clients eligibility' for legal aid, but this is still
         awaited.

8.11.3   Criminal Costs - Central Funds

         If Messrs Duckenfield and Murray ^vere tried but acquitted, or the
         charges against them were dismissed at committal, or otherwise did
         not proceed to trial in the Crown Court, an order for costs in their
         favour to be paid out of central funds will be made unless there are
         positive reasons for not doing so. Examples of such reasons include:




                                      47
•       circumstances where their conduct has brought suspicion on
        themselves and has mislead the prosecution into thinking that
        the case against them is stronger than it is; and

•       circumstances where there is ample evidence to support a
        conviction but they are acquitted on a technicality which has
        no merit.                                 *”

It will be recalled that such an order for costs was made in the South
Sefton Criminal Proceedings but that the Q erk to the Justices of the
South Sefton Magistrates' Court is considering whether Messrs
Duckenfield and Murray should have their costs reimbursed. The
Clerk to the Justices has based his reasoning on the decision in Miller.

In Miller, the Defendant was acquitted of causing an affray
whereupon an order was made in his favour for payment of his costs
out of central funds. When the costs were submitted for assessment
by the court, the court declined to assess the cq|ts on the grounds that
the Defendant had not "incurred" costs as the^ehad been met by his
employer.

On appeal to the High Court, it was held that a Defendant has
incurred costs if he is responsible for their payment, even though his
employers would have met the costs. In order to show that costs were
not incurred by the Defendant, it was necessary to establish that there
was an agreement binding on the solicitors that they would in no
circumstances seek to recover costs from the Defendant.
                                             iferjr-
The Clerk to the Justices contends that, in the light of Miller, the
assistance evidenced by the Authorities letters of 5 March 1998 to Mr
Duckenfield and 29 June 1998 to Mr Murray establishes that they have
not incurred legal costs. The solicitors for Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray have challenged this view, and Garretts opinion is firmly that
their challenge is correct (unless of course they have entered into
agreements with their respective clients to the effect that they will not
seek to recover costs from them).

Therefore, if the Authority were to re-instate the financial assistance
granted in 1998 in respect of both past andf future ’costs, Messrs
Duckenfield and Murray should not be denied paym ent of their costs




                           48
        out of central funds on the principle enunciated in Miller. However,
        as the South Sefton Case shows, it is not uncommon for a court to
        deny a successful party its costs if another party is meeting these costs.
        There is therefore a risk that, even if Messrs Duckenfield and Murray
        are acquitted, the Authority will not be reimbursed the costs it has
        funded, even though Miller indicates this is wrong.

        Whilst the former officers could challenge such a refusal, there is also
        a danger that, were a further challenge to the High Court to be. made,
        it might be held that Miller was wrongly decided and that Messrs
        Duckenfield and Murray should not have their costs paid out of
        central funds. Further, even if such a challenge were made and failed,
        this will entail further applications to the court which the Authority
        would need to support as the Authority' would be directly affected by
        the outcome.

        It should also be observed that were Messrs Duckenfield and Murray
        to be convicted, orders for the prosecution costs may be made against
        them where a court is satisfied that the convicted person has the
        means and ability to meet the costs. A court mav be more inclined to
        find that Messrs Duckenfield and Murray had the means to meet the
        prosecution costs if it were aware that the costs of their Defence were
        being met by the Authority.

        In the light of these matters, we recommend that, if the Authority
        wishes to grant financial assistance in respect of the Leeds (and South
       'Sefton) proceedings, Garretts be instructed to draw up an agreement
       with each of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray. This agreement should
        try to minimise the likelihood of the court declining reimbursement
       on grounds that Messrs Duckenfield and Murray had not incurred
       costs.


OPTIONS OPEN TO THE AUTHORITY

South Sefton Criminal Proceedings

As noted above, it is likely that Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have a strong
case that the Authority is legally bound to pay their reasonable costs incurred
in the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings. However, in view of the fact that
the Clerk to the South Sefton Justices has yet to make a decision as to
      payment of the costs from central funds, the Authority is recommended to
      defer its decision on the costs of these proceedings until the Clerk's decision is
      known.

9.2   South Sefton Tudicial Review

      The Authority' is recommended to defer consideration of whether to provide
      assistance in the proposed judicial review of the decision of the Clerk to the
      South Sefton Justices whether to pay the former officers' costs from central
      funds until it is known what his decision is.

9.3   The Leeds Criminal Proceedings

      9.3.1    As noted above, Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have a strong case
               that the Authority is legally bound to pa)' their reasonable costs
               incurred in the Leeds Criminal Proceedings up until 5 February 1999.
               The Authority is therefore recommended to pay these costs and to
               ask a legal costs draftsman to review the expenses claimed and/or
               apply to the Court for an assessment of the costs under Section 71
               Solicitors Act 1974.

      9.3.2    In relation to costs incurred since 5 February 1999, the options open
               to the Authority
                              «/
                                 include:-

               A.        Rejection

               B.        Deferring consideration of the costs of the charge against
                         Mr Duckenfield of tending to pervert the course of
                         justice to await the outcome of his application to central
                         funds for costs

               C.        Deferring consideration on the other charges until after
                         the conclusion of the proceedings or the conclusion of
                         the committal proceedings on the grounds that only then
                         can the Authority know the circumstances of the
                         prosecution cases against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray,
                         and the likely cost of granting financial assistance.

               D.        Approving     the      application   subject   to   terms   and
                         conditions, e.g>




                                           50
        that an agreed overall budget for the defendant's maximum
        costs should be fixed and other conditions for meeting the
        legal costs imposed including:-

               (i) that the number of solicitors working on the case
                   should not exceed a specified number, nor should
                   there be more than a specified number of partners;

               (ii) the hourly rates payable for each level of fee earner is
                   fixed;

               (iii) rules on attendance of solicitors at hearings, meetings
                   and interviews are set;

               (iv) the circumstances in which Counsel and Leading
                   Counsel may be used, and the hourly or daily rates
                   payable for Counsel is agreed;

         (v)       that the costs of any other part}7 which are awarded
                                                                 not~&evmet
                   bv the Authority;

         (vi)     that the costs be5 monitoredyon a regular basis;

         (vii)    that the Authority's contribution to Mr Duck^nfield or
                   Mr Murray's legal costs may be withdrawn an
                   clawed back if they have misled the Authority about
                   their case, failed to provide adequate evidence of the
                   costs they have incurred or otherwise conducted their
                   case unreasonably;

        (viii)     that the Authority reserve the right to have the former
                  officer's costs up to Committal reviewed by a legal
                  costs draughtsman appointed by the Authority and to
                  pay such costs only to the extent that the Authority
s                ^aim sg jhase have been reasonably and properly

    ^ Tlie Authority approves funding, at this stage, only up to the               .   ~l
         conclusion of the committal hearing, when the prosecutions                V
         may in any case come to an end, further relevant




                             51
                 circumstances come to light and the costs of funding to a full
                 trial become easier to predict by the Authority.

        E.      That the Authority will meet a specific proportion of the
                costs only.




        F.      That financial assistance is approved in principle, subject to
                the outcome of the proceedings. For example, it might be
                provided that costs be met upon acquittal of the officers and
                equally, costs could be conditional on conviction because,
                arguably, Messrs Duckenfield and Murray would not require
                financial assistance if they were acquitted because their costs
                will be met out of central funds. However, it would appear
                unreasonable or irrational to provide assistance conditional
                on conviction, and would increase the likelihood of a costs
                order being made against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray if
                it were known that their costs on conviction were being met
                bv✓ the Authority.
                                ✓


        G.      to provide financial assistance by way of loan on the basis
                that if Messrs Duckenfield and Murray are acquitted, they
                should have the funding to repay the authority from the costs
                award made from central funds.

9.3.3   Taking no decision, pending any decision by the Legal Aid
        Authorities as to whether, and if so on what terms, to make legal aid
        available to’Messrs Duckenfield and Murray would appear not to be
        an option, as we are told by their solicitors that the legal aid
        authorities are not willing to decide on any application from them
        for funding, unless and until the Authority itself rejects funding
        them.

9.3.4   It is recommended that, if financial assistance is to be provided, it
        should be provided:-

        (a)     until the end of committal only at which time any further
                applications should be considered afresh;




                                     52
            (b)   under an agreement with Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray
                   which makes the Authority's obligation to reimburse their
                   costs subject to specific limits and conditions such as these set
                   out at paragraph 9.3.2 D above; and

            (c)   within a structure designed to fall within Miller so that, as far
                   as' possible, an order for costs from central funds is not
                   precluded in the event of an acquittal.

The DPP Judicial Review

9.4.1       The options for the Authority are to

            (a)   reject the applications; or

            (b)   grant the applications subject to assessment of the costs by a
                   legal costs draftsm an; or

            (c)   award a proportion of the costs, for example by refusing to
                   pay the costs awarded against Messrs Duckenfield and
                   Murray in favour of the DPP.

9.4.2       The application should, however, be deferred pending details of the
            costs claimed bv✓ the DPP against
                                       O      Messrs Duckenfield and Murrav.

The Powers Tudicial Review

It is recommended that the application for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray's
        t
costs for these proceedings be deferred to await assessment and payment of
the costs order obtained against Ms Adlington.

Dear Sirs

R -v - South Yorkshire Police Authority ex parte Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
Police

Further to our letter of 13 May we write in response to your letter of 12 May raising certain
queries, and confirming the meeting is to now take place at 4 pm on 21 May. Adopting the
headings in that letter we comment as follows:

Meeting of the Authority

The details are noted.

The role of the HFSG

We note the intended course. You will appreciate from our previous correspondence and
discussions that it has been our view at all times that the role o f HFSG in this matter has
been entirely questionable and we would not agree that it would be appropriate for them to
attend the meeting.

South Sefton

We have provided previous details with our earlier correspondence.

We enclose herewith a copy of the letter of 11 February, and a copy of our terms of
engagement. The latter correspondence is provided strictly on a confidential basis. We do
not believe any other parties, save your client, are entitled to this document, and would be
grateful if the document could be treated on that basis. If it is intended that this document
should come into the public domain we would be grateful if you could advise us by return.

Costs

We have dealt with this matter as far as we can. You will appreciate that in due course
detailed bills of costs will be drawn, but this will involve a great deal of time and costs from

the costs draughtsman point of view and it will be some time before the documents can be
produced. We have provided the estimate of future costs to the conclusion of a two week
committal.

Funding for the Police Superintendents Association

We have dealt with this in our previous correspondence. If there are any queries please do
let us know, and in addition we would be grateful for your advice about whether the
attendance of Mr Williams at the meeting would be of assistance to your client.

Legitimate expectation

W'e are surprised that this issue has now been raised, for we fail to see how there can be
doubt that our client has had a legitimate expectation to have his fees paid on the basis of
the letter o f 5 March 1998 from the Clerk and the Treasurer. The letter expresses the
position clearly. Mr Duckenfield engaged us on a private basis, and from that time until the
correspondence from the Police Authority early in January, it was understood that, subject
to proper reporting and approval, we would take all necessary steps to provide proper legal
assistance to him as necessary relating to and arising out of the criminal prosecution.

This is the first express suggestion that we have had that the Authority may not wish to
honour the commitment made in the previous correspondence, notwithstanding that the
legal power issue has been resolved in favour of making the payment. We request your
specific advice by return as to the reason for this change and how it is that you say the
Authority is not committed to making the payment, if that is the present position.

Legal aid

Walker Morris have been in contact with the Clerk to the Magistrates Court and we
understand they are confirming details. We can confirm that on the basis of the
understanding that the question of funding has to be finally resolved with the Authority. Mr
Duckenfield has not at this time made a legal aid application. It is, o f course, not open to
him to make an application for retrospective assistance.

Our client's financial resources

We are providing the following information subject to your absolute assurance that this
information will be treated with the utmost confidence, and not be brought into the public
domain nor conveyed to HFSG. We would expect that the detail is not referred to in any
public forum.
We have set out the position previously in regard to the potential legal aid implications. In
the event that South Yorkshire Police Authority does not resolve to provide financial
assistance for Mr Duckenfield’s legal costs, the clear implication is that Mr Duckenfield
will suffer considerable financial hardship, and that his economic resources will be greatly
depleted without any real prospect of rebuilding them.

Opinion of Counsel

In our previous letter we asked for clarification as to what matters required attention from
Counsel, given that both ourselves and Walker Morris have provided copies of the detailed
submissions to the DPP which dealt largely with evidentiary matters. In view of your
comment that you “remain of the view that the material does not meet our requirements”,
we have referred to Counsel as a matter of urgency, to see if it is possible to provide further
submissions by the Tuesday deadline.

In regard to fees, we are bound to raise the question as to the costs involved generally in
regard to these submissions and the attendance at the Authority’s meeting. The solicitors
for both defendants are being put to a great deal of trouble in satisfying new requirements
that have been raised by the Police Authority since January 1999 in regard to funding
matters. In our view it is entirely proper therefore that in the event that the Authority
resumes financial assistance to Mr Duckenfield, it also agrees to pay the reasonable costs
associated with dealing with the Authority’s queries and requests since January 1999 on
funding issues generally up to and including representations made in respect of and
attendance at the forthcoming meeting.

You will appreciate from this and previous correspondence that we are doing all that we can
to satisfy your requests for information. If there are any other potential concerns that you
have in regard to the funding issues, we naturally request the opportunity to address those in
good time for the meeting to ensure that the Authority arrives at a fully informed decision,
whilst maintaining the opportunity for the Defendants to make proper submissions on all
relevant matters.

We await your further advice accordingly.

Yours faithfully

Dear Sirs

R -V- SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY

We acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th May.

1.      Meeting o f Authority. We note the date and time and await details of the
        venue. It would be intended that our Mr. Richard Manning will attend to
        make the oral submission and we note the request for a written submission.

2.      Role o f H.F.S.G. Having regard to the comments made in the Divisional
        Court to Mr. Alan Jones, Q.C. namely “what are you doing here” we are
        surprised that you are even asking H.F.S.G; whether in the circumstances
        they believe it appropriate to question the use of Public Funds for the funding
        of our Client. We reserve our position as to what action we will take if
        H.F.S.G. indicate a wish to attend and to make representations,"and you
        allow them to do so.

3.     South Sefton. Attached is a copy of the letter of the 11th February 1999.
       The Magistrates' Clerk at South Sefton has not made a final decision because
       it will depend upon your decision. If, as we expect, the Police Authority
       confirms the continuation of funding to our Client from the 12th January, and
     • ongoing, then we think it very likely that the Clerk at South Sefton will
       confirm the decision he has provisionally reached, and in which event both
       ourselves and Winckworth Sherwood (who are in an identical position) would
       want to jointly mount an application for Judicial Review of that decision.

4.       Costs.

        4.1           The Schedule that we have provided to you post the 12th January is
                      for the most part work on the w o Judicial Review Applications.
                      You know the date that we made an application in relation to the
                      funding, which was precipitated by the challenge from H.F.S.G. to
                      the locus of the Chief Constable.




       / lb:     f4ft*rn      K cptn u        at                      by 75/ L»v Aemij   the m Juct ofint+imw kuu*tu.
                                                               Messrs.Garretts
                                                                14 May 1999
                                                                       Page 2




4.2     That necessitated the Application and we had to do a bundle of
         documents because of it. Up to that time the majority of the work
         had been in relation to the Application for Judicial Review of the
         D.P.P.'s decision. It is going to be impossible within the timeframe
         to extract detail of what work was done in relation to each of those
         two Applications. The best guesstimate is that taking things as .a
         round, possibly slightly more was done in relation to the
         D.P.P.Application because we had the conduct of it as the Applicant,
         and because it was over a longer period of time.

4.3     Notwithstanding the fact of the communication of the 12th January,
        there has obviously been work done in relation to the Magistrates
        Court proceedings and the prosecution, our best estimate is that
        probably about 15% of the costs would fall into that category. You
        are aware that there have been Magistates Court hearings on the 1st
        March, 2nd March, 26th April and of course last Monday the 10th
        May and we are back on the 24th May, but neither of those are in
        the schedule.

4.4     If there had not been the intervention by H.F.S.G.so that funding
         had continued uninterrupted then insofar as the Order for costs
         obtained against Ann Adlington is concerned, we would have
         proceeded to tax the bill and reimburse the Authority for that
         portion of the costs that were recoverable against her as against the
         charging rate agreed with the Authority, and that in our view is the
         sensible way to deal with the matter in any event.

4.5     We have heard nothing from the D.P.P. and therefore do not
        propose to make an approach to ask them about the level of their
        costs just in case they forget about them.

4.6     We will have a look at the disbursements between the bill to the
        Clerk to the Justices at South Sefton aod the amounts in the
        enclosures to our letter of the 29th April and try to resolve this, but
        that is not an insurmountable problem between us.

Funding from Police Superintendents’ Association. We do challenge the
relevance of this infonnation. However again we would not want your
Members to feel that this is in any way controversial as between the
Authority and ourselves. Thus although we reserve our position as to whether
there is entitlement, the money from the Superintendents’ Association would
only be provided up to a maximum of £20,000 if the Police Authority
refused to provide the funding requested, and further insofar as it may be
necessary to meet any shortfall that may arise either in whole or in part in
                                                               Messrs. Garretts
                                                                14 May 1999
                                                                        Page 3


 relation to the Order for costs against Adlington. In short therefore it is an
 amount that only would become available by way of indemnity if all else
 fails.

 Legitimate Expectation. We have to fundamentally disagree with you on the
 way in which you put this matter. In our view there is a contractual position
 between the Authority, our Client and ourselves in relation to costs. Having
• regard to that authority given and only stopped on the basis that you were not
 certain that your Clients had power to grant that authority, and having now
 been told that they did indeed have power, it would be in our view
 Wednesbury unreasonable and Padfield perverse for the funding decision not
 to be confirmed from the 12th January and not to be met to the 12th January.

Legal Aid. The Clerk to the Justices will not determine a Legal Aid
Application unless the Policy Authority refuse to grant funding. There is no
fresh Application, the original Application is held in abeyance on this basis.




Our Client’s Financial Resources. We reserve the position as to whether it
is appropriate for the Authority to take into consideration our Client’s
financial resources. We are instructed however that on the confidential basis
of this letter we can disclose our Client’s position.         _
                                                                      Messrs.Garretts
                                                                       14 May 1999
                                                                              Page 4




9.       Opinion o f Counsel. We appreciate that the written Opinion was not long, but
          it very powerfully repeated the view of two eminent Q.C.’s that there is not ■ ■ ■"
        ( any reasonable prospect of a conviction* We will deal with Counsels’fee ■;
          notes separately with you.

10.      General. It would seem to us that there is no way in which the Authority can
         refuse to meet costs for the period for which they have committed
         themselves, and indeed that goes to the date of the meeting where they
         actually made the decision Having now been told that they were empowered ■
         to grant funding, they should continue that funding on the same basis as
         previously agreed. We would view it as entirely responsible that the
         Authority should want to know of any material change in the view of
         Solicitors and the two Q.C’s. A prudent coursc would be therefore to grant
         funding up to the date of the conclusion of the committal proceedings. If of
         course the case is not committed to the Crown Court, then no further decision
         is likely to have to be made by the Authority. If on the other hand the case
         is committed, then the Authority would be justified in asking for further
         advices from Leading Counsel, with an estimate of the costs that were likely
         to be incurred. For our own part we would have no objection to a quarterly
         review so long as absolute confidentiality could be guaranteed.

         4       THE RESOLUTIONS OF 21 MAY 1999

         4.1    On 21 May 1999, the A uthority m ade the resolutions in enclosure 6 on the
                applications for financial assistance received from the form er officers. In
                reaching its decision, -the A uthority received w ritten and oral submissions
                from or on behalf of:

                4.1.1 HFSG

                4.1.2 Mr Duckenfield

                 4.1.3 Mr M urray

                 and received w ritten and oral reports from its legal advisors, G arretts, and the
                 Chief Constable. siXhe w ritten reports from Garretts are in enclosures 4 and 5,

         4.2    In summary, the resolutions were to the following effect;

                 4.2.1 To pay the reasonable costs of the form er officers in the Leeds crim inal
                       proceedings up to the conclusion of the committal proceedings,
                         subject to certain conditions (see paragraphs 1,2,10 and 11 of the
                         resolution.)

                 4.2.2 To pay the reasonable costs of the form er officers in the ju d id al review
                        of the DPP's decision not to take over and discontinue the crim inal
                       proceedings ("the DPP judicial review") (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of the
                       resolutions).

                 4.2.3 To make no decision on the applications to pay

                        proceedings in the light of the possible aw ard of costs from
                        central funds (paragraphs 4 and 5 of the resolution).

                    (b) The former officers' costs of the judicial review of the A uthority's
                        decision of 5 February 1999 given the aw ard of costs against the
                        private prosecutor (see paragraphs 8 and 9 of the resolutions}.

                     (c) The D PFs costs in the DPP judicial review that were ordered to be
                        m et by the former officers until the am ount of such costs are known.

               4.2.4 To defer consideration of the applications to pay the former officers ‘
                     costs in the potential judicial review of the Chief Clerk of South Sefton
                     Magistrates Court until the Clerk's decision (Le. whether central funds
                     would m eet the former officers costs) is known.

         4.3   Following the decision of the Chief Clerk of the South Sefton Magistrates
               Court to meet the form er officers costs out of central funds, the potential
               judicial review referred to in paragraph 4.2.4 above has been averted.

         4.4   The former officers solicitors are negotiating the am ount of costs to be
               paid out of central funds, but have indicated that they may ask the
               Authority to meet the difference between the costs claimed and the
               amount paid. No information has been received from the former
               officers on the outcome of their negotiations w ith the Chief Clerk of the South
               Sefton Magistrates Court, nor the current position on the DPP's costs nor the
               claim for costs against the private prosecutor.

         4.5   The conditions referred to in paragraph 4.2.1 have been agreed in principle
               and are contained in the draft letters in enclosure 7. Finalisation of the
               conditions has been deferred as a result of the tax issue which was m entioned
               to the members at the meeting of 10 September 1999 (see the report of the
               Clerk and Treasurer and the Chief Constable in enclosure 9.

         4.6   Further information on the level of costs claimed by the form er officers
               pursuant to the resolutions referred to in paragraphs 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 above are
               detailed in section 6 below.

            5.1    The committal proceedings against the former officers commenced in the
                   Leeds Magistrates Court on 5 July 1999. As a prelim inary m atter, the
                   Stipendiary M agistrate was asked to rule on an application by the former
                   officers to strike out the prosecutions as an abuse of process. H is judgm ent
                   was delivered on 15 July 1999 (a copy is in enclosure 8). He concluded that
                   the proceedings should not be struck out because:

                   5.1.1   It was not oppressive to prosecute the former officers, despite the
                           D PFs decision not to do so.

                   5.1.2   Although there w as delay in bringing the prosecution, the prejudice
                           caused by the delay was not so strong as to render a fair trial
                           impossible.

                   5.1.3   There was no breach of the European Convention on H um an Rights
                           w hich entitle a Defendant to a fair and public hearing w ithin a
                           reasonable tim e.

                   5.1.4   The publicity surrounding the trial w as n o t so great as to render a fair
                           trial impossible.

                   5.1.5   There was no basis to criticise the prosecutor, Ann Adlington, for lack
                           of objectivity or bias.

                   5.1.6   The cumulative effects of these m atters w as also insufficient to render
                           a fair trial impossible.

            5.2   On 20 July 1997, the Stipendiary M agistrate held th at there was sufficient
                   evidence to commit the Defendants for trial on all charges. This w as n o t a
                  finding of guilt. It is sim ply that he was satisfied that there was sufficient
                   evidence on w hich a reasonable jury could (not would) find the form er
                  officers guilty. No w ritten judgm ent was handed dow n by the Stipendiary
                  Magistrate. He sim ply said, after listening to the evidence, that he had
                  decided that there w as a case to go forw ard to the Crown C ou rt

            5.3   On 3 September 1999, Hooper J, 1he trial judge, m ade certain directions for the
                  further conduct of the criminal proceedings. We understand th at he has
                  ordered am ong other things:

                 -5-3.1 That there be a prelim inary hearing, listed for 20 December for 2 or 3
                        days, to consider the admissibility of the evidence given by the former
                        officers to the Taylor Inquiry;

                  5.3.2 There be a hearing on 4 January 2000, estim ated to last 5 days, of a
                        further application by the former officers to stay the proceedings on the
                        grounds that they are an abuse of process; and

                  53.3 That the trial of the action be listed for 6 June 2000, w ith a time estimate
                       of 6 - 7 weeks.

                Preliminary hearing on admissibility of evidence

          5.4   Both the former officers gave evidence to the Taylor Inquiry. It is to be
                contended that this evidence should not be admissible at the criminal trial.
                The ground is that neither of the former officers was given the statutory
                w arning of their right to silence prior to giving evidence at the Taylor Inquiry.
                It is understood that Counsel at the Taylor Inquiry, M r Collins QC (now
                Collins J) and Mr Bill W oodward QC have both been interviewed and confirm
                that the statutory warnings were not given. We further understand that the
                lawyers for the former officers consider this matter of crucial im portance and
                that this will be the first occasion on w hich the point has been argued.

                If the application is successful, it is said that it may shorten the trial and, more
                im portantly, th at it may improve the merits of the Defence.

          5.5   The trial is likely to be shortened because:

                5.5.1' The evidence of the form er officers to the Taylor Inquiry w ill not be read
                      out to the jury; and

                5.5.2 The prosecution w ill not be able to cross-examine the form er officers on
                      their evidence to the Taylor Inquiry in order to highlight any differences
                     between the testimony they give at trial, the inquests and the inquiry.

          5.6    We understand that the trial may be shortened by 2 days, so the saving in
                 tim e is not significant and the solicitors for the officers have indicated that
                 they would not w ish the Authority to focus on this point.

          5.7    It is considered by their advisers th at the merits of the former officers'
                 Defence will be im proved because there is less m aterial on w hich they may be

                cross-examined and because the evidence of the form er officers to the Taylor
                Inquiry, which w as not helpful, will not be available to the jury.

               The further application to stay the proceedings on the grounds of abuse of
                process

        5.8   The former officers will make a fresh application to stay proceedings. H ie
              lawyers for the former officers believe th at it w ould have been a brave step for
              a Stipendiary magistrate to have stayed such a high profile case. They fee1 that
              a High Court Judge w ill be willing to take a more robust view - see Walker
              M orris's letter of 12 November 1999, a copy of which is enclosure 13.

        5.9   The Authority has been provided w ith the advice of M r William Clegg QC,
j             Leading Counsel for M r Duckenfield, on the m erits of a fresh application to
              stay the proceedings, and on the m erits generally (in enclosure 11). This advice
              appears to have been provided following our suggestion th at the members of
              the A uthority w ould w ant to see clear reasons why it should m eet the costs of a
              fresh application.

        5.10 Mr Clegg'5 view is that fee merits of -the application are "evenly balanced".

        5.11 It is natural that the former officers and their lawyers w ould w ant to take every
              opportunity available to stop the prosecution. If the application succeeds, it
              w ill obviate the need for further funding but this benefit should be considered
              in the light of the possibility of an appeal by the prosecution, which could lead
              to the trial being re-instated.

■j      5.12 Further inform ation on the costs of and incidental to these applications is dealt
             w ith in section 6. It should be noted that the inform ation on costs do not dptail
             the likely costs in the event of an appeaL


        6     COSTS

        6.1    On 10 September 1999, the Clerk and Treasurer and Chief Constable reported
               to the A uthority on, among other things, the costs of the form er officers
               solicitors. A copy of that report is in enclosure 9.       '

        6.2   Following th at meeting, Garretts w rote to the solicitors for each of the former
              officers in terms of the copy letters of 17 September 1999 in enclosure 10.
              These letters m ade offers to the solicitors in respect of the costs they had
              incurred as follows:

           62.1    W inckworth Sherwood - for M r D uckenfield
                   VVinckworth Sherwood sought a total of £89,833.33 plus £15,7959 VAT for the
                   proceedings to 5 February 1999. The Authority offered to pay £84,633.33 plus
                   VAT. The proposed deductions reflected a reduction of 10% of "the Counsel's
                   fees claimed. A response from Winckworth Sherwood is awaited.

           6.2.2   W alker M orris - for M r M urray
                   Walker Morris sought a total of £146,905.50 plus £25,77422 VAT- The
                   Authority offered to pay £120,975 and VAT thereon. The deduction of
                   £25,930.50 reflected a reduction £22,13250 from Walker M orris's fees and a
                   10% reduction in Counsel's fees. Walker M orris's counter proposal is th at the
                   Authority pay £130,000, being Walker M orris's fees of £90,000, Mir M yserson's
                   fees of £10,000 (the A uthority had offered £9,500), and Mr H arrison Q C s fees
                   of £30,000. W ith regard to Walker M orris's fees, the view of the costs
                   draftsman was that the range of costs to be offered to Walker Morris should
                   be between £81,475 and £88,134.38 plus VAT. The initial proposal to Walker
                   Morris was at the bottom of the range proposed by the costs draftsman.
                   Walker M orris's counter proposal is only £1,863.72 above the range suggested
                   by the costs draftsman. We have m et with Walker Morris to discuss their bill
                   and, in the light of their comments, would recommend acceptance of the
                   proposal, which represents a total deduction of £16,905.50 (exclusive of VAT)
                   on their original claim.

           6.2.3   Garretts are awaiting a detailed breakdown from Winckworth Sherwood of
                   their further costs to be m et by the Authority pursuant to the resolution of 21
                   May 1999, namely, the criminal proceedings from 6 February 1999 to the end
                   of the committal proceedings on 20 July 1999 (for which they claim
                   £162,454-29 and £28,429.19 VAT, being a total of £190,883.79) and the costs of
                   the DPP judicial review (for which they daim £16,050 plus £2808.75 VAT,
                   being a total of £18,858.75). W inckworth Sherwood's daim for the criminal
                   proceedings to 20 July 1999 exceeds the maximum of £176,250 inclusive of
                   VAT prescribed in the draft letter in enclosure 7.

           6.2.4   Walker Morris have subm itted detailed bills for the balance of the criminal
                   proceedings which seek a total of £114,983.45 and £20,051.05 VAT, and for the
                   DPP judicial review, seeking £38,291.55 and VAT of £6,579.93 for the DPP
                   judicial review. Garretts is awaiting the report of the costs draftsman on
                   these amounts.

                                         committal up to b u t excluding the hearing on 20 December
                                           1999 w ill be £27500. Of this am ount, £20,000 is estim ated to
J                                          relate to the hearing and £7500 is for general w ork in
                                           connection w ith the trial due to commence in June 2000.
                                           Walker M orris have not broken down their estim ate of
                                           £20,000 betw een the hearings set for 20 December 1999 and 4
                                           January 2000, b u t they have said that the bulk of the w ork is
                                           connection w ith the 20 December hearing. We w ould suggest
                                           a fair breakdown is £16,000 for 20 December and £4,000 for 4
                                           January 1999.


                                 63.2.2 W alker M orris's costs on the hearings themselves are
                                          estim ated at £2,000 per day. This appears to be based on
                                          £125 per hour for 2 fee earners for 8 hours each day (to
                                          in du d e preparation, time in court and time following court).
                                          On this basis, the in court time for W alker M orris w ould be
                                          £6,000 for the 20 December hearing and £10,000 for the 4
                                          January hearing.


                                 632.3 Therefore, it seems that Walker M orris's fees for the 20
                                          December hearing are estimated to be in the order of £22,000.
                                          Their fees for the 4 January hearing are estim ated to be
                                          £14,000.

                                 63.2.4 Counsel's fees for the hearings are som ewhat unclear. We
                                          understand that Mr Harrison QC will be available to appear
                                          in both cases, and has suggested a brief fee of £15,000.
                                          However, w e do not know how this figure will be split

                                 b etw een the tw o hearings. We guesstimate £10,000 for the
                                 hearing commencing 20 December and £5,000 for the hearing
                                 commencing 4 January. Daily refreshers of £1,500 are
                                 estimated. Incidentally, M r H arrison's fees for the committal
                                 hearing were a brief of £12,500 plus refreshers of £1,250.

                          6.3.4.5 The position of Junior Counsel, Mr Myerson, is not clear. We
                                 understand that he will not be available for the hearing
                                 commencing on 20 December 1999 b u t will be available on 4
                                 January 2000. It is suggested that Junior Counsel's fee should
                                 be half of those for Leading Counsel.

                         6.3.4.6 Therefore, a fair estimate for Counsel's fees for the hearings
                                 would appear to be as follows:

          6.4   Estimates to trial


                Winckworth Sherwood have estimated costs of £500,000 plus VAT u p to and
                including the trial of this action. This estimate appears to include the costs
                of and incidental to the hearings on 20 December and 4 January. In our
                view, this estim ate is low foi a 6 or 7 week hearing and all the preparation
                that will be necessary. We think a m ore realistic figure is in the order of £1
                million.


                We have not received an estimate for Walker Morris but w ould think that
                their figures would be similar.

          7           TAXATION

          7.1         On 27 September 1999, Garretts w rote to Inland Revenue to seek clarification
                      of the taxation status of any financial assistance given to the form er officers
                      (see enclosure 14). The Inland Revenue's response of 19 October 1999
                      states their view that the financial assistance:

                      7.1.1      Is taxable as an emolument. This means that the financial assistance
                                 will attract income tax a t 40%, of which 23% should be deducted at
                                 source by the Authority under PAYE. This leaves the former officers
                                 to m eet the balance of 17%, and to pay to their solicitors the 23%
                                deducted by the Authority. The Authority will also need to m eet
                                national insurance contributions. Or,

                      7.1.2     Is taxable as a benefit paid under an unapproved retirem ent benefit
                                scheme (which will attract tax at 40%, bu t arguably not national
                                insurance contributions).

          7.2     If Inland Revenue is correct, it means th a t in order for the officers to receive
                  sums net of tax which w ill be sufficient to m eet their legal costs, the Authority
                  would need to pay or provide an additional 87% over and above the costs
                  claimed.

          7.3     On 18 November 1999, William Massey QC advised the Authority in
                  consultation on the tax position. Counsel confirmed Garretts view that the
                 financial assistance was not taxable either as an emolument nor as a retirem ent
                 benefit. Counsel's w ritten advice on these matters is awaited.

          7.4     In the light of Counsel's advice, it is proposed th at Garretts should w rite to
                  Inland Revenue enclosing a copy of Counsel's opinion and asking Inland
                  Revenue to reconsider their position in the light of Counsel's        and firm
                 view. Inland Revenue will also be informed that payments have been m ade to
                 the officers on account of costs incurred to date but that, in the light of
                 Counsel's view, it is not proposed to deduct tax from the paym ents, nor meet
                 National Insurance contributions. It is understood that the A uthority -will also
                 pursue its Home Office contacts to urge Inland Revenue to reconsider the
                 matter urgently in the light of Counsel's advice.

     7.5   If Inland Revenue agree the position, the issue w ill be resolved to the
           satisfaction of the Authority, and the form er officers.

     7.6   If Inland Revenue disagree, the onus will be on Inland Revenue to challenge
           the position before the Tax Commissioner. An early hearing could be obtained,
           as Inland R ev e n u e recognise that the issue is of "major public im portance".
           However/ even if the Commissioners were to decide the case in early
           2000, it rem ains possible that an appeal will be brought. It is unlikely th a t the
           appeal w ill be resolved until after the trial of the form er officers.

     7.7   Counsel also confirmed that, were the form er officers till in office, or had left
           office w ithin 6 years of the paym ent of costs on their behalf by the Authority,
           the costs borne by the officers w ould be deductible Le. the n e t effect being that
 )         the assistance is no t taxable. This is the consequence of sections 201AA Income
           and Corporation Taxes Act 1998 and section 92 Rnance Act 1995.


     7.8   Arising out of this issue is the question of w hether ihe A uthority has pow er to
           pay or provide for tax and National Insurance contributions to enable the
           officers to receive sufficient funds net of tax to m eet their legal costs. A w ritten
           opinion has been obtained from Mr M ark Shaw (in enclosure 15), w ho was
           Junior Counsel for the Authority in the recent judicial review hearings. He has
           advised that the A uthority does have pow er to m eet the incidence of taxation.
           He has further advised that the Authority needs to consider the possible effect
           of income tax and national insurance contributions on any resolutions it has
           m ade or m ay make to provide financial assistance and to pass resolutions
           accordingly.
 t               :
     8     VAT

     8.1   Mr Massey QC w as also asked to advise on the m atter of VAT.

     8.2    Counsel advised th at the Authority w ill not be able to recover the VAT on the
            costs already incurred by the officers because the legal service has n o t been
            provided to the Authority, b u t to the officers. However, Counsel advised that
            if the Authority w ere jointly to instruct each of the firms of solicitors for the
            further conduct of the proceedings, the Authority could recover VAT
            provided the purpose of the Authority jointly instructing the solicitors was
            not simply to avoid VAT b u t so that it could have a real input into the
•o

                 conduct of the Defences and so that it could ensure that the former officers
                 got the best possible Defence that w as available to them.

          8.3    Counsel also advised that the reason it is necessary for the officers and the
                 Authority to be jointly the clients of each firm of solicitors is to minimise the
                 possibility that, if die Defence is successful, the officers costs will not be m et
                 by central office. It will be recalled th at the case of re Miller [1983] All E R 186
                 decided that where five arrangements between a Defendant and his solicitors
                 is such that the Defendant will in no circumstances be liable to m eet the costs
                 of defending the criminal proceedings, the Defendant has not incurred costs
                 and is not entided to have the costs m et by central funds. A joint retainer has
                 the effect of preserving the former officers' liability to meet costs.

          8.4    The Authority will be entided to recover the VAT on the whole of the am ount
                 of costs paid by it, not simply a p ro ra ta share of the costs.

          8.5    The arrangements between the Authority, each of the former officers and
                 their respective solicitors needs to be carefully documented. This is to lim it
                 the A uthority's costs to those which are incurred w ith its authority and
                 w ithin any constraints it sets. This should enable the officers to be solely
                 responsible to the solicitors for any costs which the Authority is not willing to
                 meet e.g. if the Authority were to decline to provide financial assistance for
                 either or both of the hearings on 20 December and 4 January.


         9      T H E M E R IT S O F T H E A P P L IC A T IO N S F O R A S S IS T A N C E

         Section 8 of the Garretts report of 13 May 1999 detailed the factors to be considered
         by the Authority when deciding upon applications for assistance. Those
         considerations remain relevant and need to be considered afresh, albeit in die light of
         the fact that, having considered those matters the Authority decided on 21 May that
         it was appropriate to provide financial assistance to the former officers.

         The following further matters need to be considered by the Authority:

         9.1    Whether there have been any m aterial developments in rplatirvn to those
                factors
                We are not aware of any such developments, save for the taxation issue.

         9.2    The possible incidence of taxation
                The Authority has received firm advice that the paym ent to the officers will




ten ‘d                                                              3ilVnf)S A1I0 I         IS :91   I.VON) 6 6
      not be subject to taxation. However, the m atter rem ains to be determ ined. If
      the outcome is that any financial assistance will be taxable, the consequences
      will be either:

       9.2.1            The officers w ill have to m eet tax a t    >f the am ount of the
                        costs which were authorised by the Authority of 21 May 1998
                        and any further costs that the A uthority agrees to m eet and
                        the A uthority will have to m eet national insurance -
                        contributions on the costs; or

       9.2.2            The A uthority w ould need to resolve that any financial
                        assistance it provides or has provided shall be n et of taxation.
                        This will result in the Authority having to provide further
                        financial assistance equal to 87% of the former officers'
                        cost in order to pay or provide for the incidence of
                        taxation.

9.3   The purpose and m erits of the application on 20 December 1999

      This application to exclude the evidence given by the form er officers to the
      Taylor Inquiry is being m ade on the advice of Leading Counsel for each of the
      former officers. Its prim ary purpose will be to im prove the m erits of the
      former officers' Defence should the m atter proceed to tria l An ancillary
      benefit is that the length of the trial may be shortened, But this benefit is
      m itigated by the fact that any reduction is unlikely to be m aterially different
      from the length of the application. The views of Leading Counsel for the
      former officers is a very pow erful factor weighing in favour of assistance.
      However, Defendants to proceedings m ust always w eigh in the balance the
      costs of interim applications, the m erits of the application and the benefit that
      w ill follow. It should be recognised that a Defendant w ith lim ited resources -
      may have to decide to forego an application which a Defendant w ith
      unlim ited resources m ay seek to pursue.

9.4   The purpose and merits of the application on 4 Tanuarv 2000


      Once again, Leading Counsel for each of the former officers has advised that
      this application be made. It w ill be the second time th at a court considers the
      question of abuse of process. It is said on behalf of the former officers that the
      prospects of this application succeeding are better than before the Stipendiary




                                                     3W/1DS Alio I             rc : 9I   Im i   66 . 'V
              Magistrate because the Stipendiary Magistrate erred in law (see the w ritten
               advice of Mr Clegg QC in enclosure 11) and because a trial judge is likely to
              take a more robust view. After assessing these factors, Mr Clegg QC
              considers the merits to be evenly balanced. We understand that one fresh
              factor which is being considered by the solicitors for the form er officers is that
              the delay in the prosecution has prejudiced the former officers' prospects of
              obtaining funding from the Authority. This is on the grounds that, had die
              prosecutions been brought w ithin tim e to enable the defence costs to be m et
              within 6 years of the end of the tax year in which the fonner officers retired,
              any financial assistance w ould not be liable to taxation in the light of the
              provision of sections 201AA Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and
              Section 92 Finance Act 1995. The fact that the statutory provisions do not
              apply to the form er officers by reason of the delay means that the effect of the
              possible increase in the costs of providing financial assistance is a factor
              which m ust be weighed in the balance.

        9.5   Costs of the applications

              These have been dealt w ith in section 7 above. Additionally, the Secretary
              and Treasurer to the Authority has the following observations:


              "Financial Implications


              The defence costs have so far been m et out of reserves, along w ith legal costs
              of the Police Authority and die Chief Constable. Estimated costs to the end of
              the-committal hearings in July were £0.95m, as reported to the Authority in
              September. This figure will be reduced when the final results of the costs
              draftsm an's w ork are available; it is also subject to resolution of the VAT
              position.


              The costs of supporting the defence up to and including the trial itself were
              always going to be on a more substantial scale. In considering further
              funding, therefore, the Authority needs to consider afresh the potential
              im pact on the Authority's available finances, options for m eeting the cost, and
              implications for the rest of the policing budget


              The further issue of whether the paym ents are taxable adds additional
              complications. If the Revenue's initial ruling is not reversed, it potentially
              adds around 87% to the past payments. A 'worsts scenario w ould have the




9rn'd
           same im pact on future costs, although Counsel's advice received in the last
           week suggests that it should be possible to structure any future support in
           such a way as to avoid tax, while at the same tim e leaving the A uthority in
           the position of being able to recover costs from central funds in th e event of
           acquittal. However, the Inland Revenue having taken a firm position on the
           m atter so far, we cannot rule out the possibility of challenge to a future
           arrangement, and the potential im pact of th at m ust be taken into account in
           taking the decision to support

           Given the strength of Counsel's advice on the tax m atter, the Authority hopes
           to use all available channels to seek confirm ation that there are no tax
           implications, so that w hen the Authority considers funding for the m ain trial,
           it can do so in full knowledge of the financial implications. However, the two
           former officers face hearings in December and January for which they have
           requested funding, and if the Authority were to decide not to make support
           available, it would be necessary for the officers to seek Legal Aid. The
           original intention was to consider these tw o hearings along w ith funding of
           the m ain trial, and consideration has been postponed as long as possible in
           the hope that the tax issue would disappear.


           Therefore, the Authority is n o w asked to consider funding for the December
           1999 and January 2000 hearings alone. To recap, die reasons for
           recommending this approach are:


           (i)     the potential uncertainties due to the tax issue are limited.


           (ii)    it enables the officers to know w here they stand in the short term .


           (iii)   it provides time to resolve the tax issue permanently.

           Section 6 of the report summarises the costs.


           It is considered that this can be accommodated w ithin the existing budget,
           either from savings arising from the costs draftsm an's work, or from
           efficiency savings already identified in the vehicles budget"

           9.7   The views of the Chief Constable

                 We have been provided w ith a draft of the Chief Constable s comments,
                 which are set out below. The Chief Constable will be present at the meeting
                 to amplify these comments.

                 "I do not propose to re-state all of the points that I have m ade in connection
                 w ith previous applications for funding by Mr Duckenfield and M r Murray.
                 They are well documented in papers appended to this rep o rt However, I
                 will summarise the key elements:

                 1.      The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster occurred on 15 April 1989, over
                          10 years ago. Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield was in
                         charge of the policing operation. He was assisted by Superintendent
                          Bernard Murray.

                 2.      A crush in the crowd led to the deaths of 96 people and injury to
                         many others.

                 3.      Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry analysed the causes of the disaster and
                         apportioned blame.

                 4.     In 1990 the Director of Public Prosecutions determ ined not to
                         prosecute any person for any alleged offence connected w ith the
                         disaster.


                 5.     The jury at the Coroners' Inquest returned verdicts of accidental
                         death. •

                 6.     In February 1998, Lord Justice Stewart Smith, an appeal court judge,
                         published the results of his scrutiny into claims th at fresh and
                         relevant evidence had been uncovered. He found there was no
                         relevant new evidence and found no fault in the decision by the
                         Director of Public Prosecutions in 1990 that there should be no
                         prosecution.


                 7.     In m id 1998 the solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group,
                         Ms Anne Adlington, began a private prosecution against Mr




8in   'i                                                       3HV71&S A ll3 I           £S; 91 (XOK)66
                 Duckenfield and M r MurTay for alleged offences of m anslaughter
                 and other m atters.

        8.       The South Yorkshire Police Authority resolved to meet the costs of
                 legal advice to die two form er officers up to and including the
                 committal hearing. My advice to the authority w as that Mr
                 Duckenfield and Mr M urray acted in good faith on the day of the
                 disaster. They were perform ing their du ty as best they could.
                 Officers should feel confident that they w ill receive the backing of
                 their police authority if they face such a challenge in the courts. This
                 particular case is all the more acute because so m uch tim e has passed
                 and because this is a private prosecution.

        9.       The Authority have already determined to exercise their discretion in
                 support of the officers founded on the above facts. There have been
                 no changes to this position since the last exercise of this discretion.

       The prosecution could be brought to a dose if the Crow n C ourt Judge accepts
       the defence's argum ents in relation to the inadm issibility of evidence and the
       abuse of the process of the c o u rt If that is the case then a lengthy and
       expensive Crown Court trial w ill not occur.


       It is m y professional opinion that a refusal to grant this request w ould
       weaken the confidence of officers in perform ing their daily difficult and
       dangerous tasks on behalf of the public of South Yorkshire.

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS


1    Purpose of the Report

     The purpose of this report is to consider developments relating to the
     decisions taken by the Authority on the 21 May 1999 and on the 26
     November 1999 to provide financial assistance to Mr Bernard Murray
     and Mr David Duckenfield, including:

     1.1    To consider the applications heard before the trial judge, Mr
            Justice Hooper:

            a.    On the 20 December 1999, seeking to exclude from the
                  trial evidence given by the former officers to the Taylor
                  Inquiry; and

            b.    On the 4 January 2000, seeking to strike out the
                  prosecutions on the grounds that they are an abuse of
                  process.

     1.2    To consider an application received from Mr Murray’s solicitors

3     December 1999 and January 2000 Court Applications

3.1   December 1999 Application

       This application, the purpose of which was to exclude evidence given
       by the former officers to the Taylor Inquiry, was unsuccessful. Garrets
       have provided a brief summary of the main points of the judgment
       delivered on the 22 December 1999 and this is attached at Appendix 1.
       Any member requiring to read the full judgment can obtain a copy from
       the Clerk and Treasurer

32    January 2000 Application

       These proceedings which involved an application to stay the criminal
       proceedings instituted against the former officers on grounds that they
       are an abuse of process have been adjourned until 16 February 2000
       to give the Judge more time to consider his decision. In connection
       with these proceedings an application has been received from Walker
       Morris for authorisation to incur the cost of obtaining the transcript of
       the proceedings (details attached at Appendix 2).

4     Funding Letters

4.1    Financial Support from the 6 February 1999 to the end of the
       Committal Proceedings

4.1.1 As reported on the 10 September 1999, letters of agreement, setting
      out the conditions attaching to the Authority’s offer of financial support,



                                                                         3
        have been agreed with the solicitors acting for the two former officers.
        In view of the need to obtain clarification of the taxation status of the
        financial support, the Authority deferred making a decision to approve
        the letters on the 10 September 1999.

4.1 2   Since that date the Authority has obtained the advice of Mr William
        Massey QC on the taxation status of the payments. As members are
        aware, Counsel has advised that the financial support offered to the
        two former officers is not taxable either as an emolument nor as a
        retirement benefit.

4.1.3 In view of the tax advice received the Authority is recommended to
      approve the funding letters agreed, and to authorise the Clerk and
      Treasurer to issue these to the two former officers for signature.
      Copies of the agreed letters are attached at Appendix 3.

4.2     December and January Applications

4.2.1 The terms of the financial support approved by the Authority on the 26
       November 1999, for the legal costs and disbursements incurred by the
       two former officers in these proceedings, have been notified to their
       solicitors by Garretts. Copies of the formal funding letters drawn up by
       Garretts setting out these terms are attached at Appendix 4. Walker
       Morris have approved the letter drawn up in favour of Mr Murray.
      Confirmation is awaited from Winkworth Sherwood that the letter
      drawn up in favour of Mr Duckenfield is also agreed.

5       South Sefton Criminal Proceedings

5.1     The prosecutions brought against the two former officers were
         commenced in the South Sefton Magistrates Court but discontinued on
         a jurisdictional point. An order was made that the costs of the former
        officers be met from central funds. The Chief Clerk to the South
         Seftbn Magistrates questioned whether the former officers costs
         should be met from central funds in the light of the financial support
         offered by the Authority. Eventually, as reported on the 26 November
         last, he accepted that their costs could be met from central funds.

5.2.1 Walker Morris on behalf of Mr Murray submitted a claim for £4, 999.50,
      together with VAT. The Chief Clerk , on the 15 December 1999
      notified Walker Morris that he will pay costs of £2475 from central
      funds. In the light of the shortfall Walker Morris on behalf of their client
      have submitted an application dated the 12 January 2000 to Garretts,
      for a decision from the Authority on whether it will meet the short fall, or
      authorise Walker Morris to challenge the decision by way of Judicial
      Review. Copies of the bill submitted to Chief Clerk, the letter from the
      Chief Clerk to Walker Morris, and Walker Morris’s letter to Garretts are
      attached at Appendix 5.1.




                                                                                    4
fj.2.2 Winkworth Sherwood on behalf of Mr Duckenfield submitted a claim for
       costs in the sum of £8,716.63. This was made up of £6,111.58
        professional fees, disbursements of £1,348 (which included £1,000 for
        Counsel fees) together with VAT of £1,252,05. The court has allowed
       costs at £2,320.67. In the light of the shortfall Winkworth Sherwood
        have submitted an application dated the 25th January 2000 to Garretts
       for a decision from the Authority on whether it will meet the shortfall, or
       authorise Winkworth Sherwood to challenge the decision by way of
       judicial review. Copies of this letter and the letter from the South
       Sefton Magistrates’ Court to Winkworth Sherwood are attached at
       Appendix 5.2.

5.3.1 Garretts have advised that the costs of judicial review are wholly
      inappropriate having regard to the amounts in issue. In all the
      circumstances they believe it would not be unreasonable for the
      Authority to decline:

      i)      To meet the costs of the applications to support judicial review
              proceedings; or

      ii)    To meet the difference between the costs allowed by the South
             Sefton Magistrates Court and the amount claimed by each
             officer.

5.3.2 Garretts have suggested another option. This is that the Authority
      could decide to meet the difference between the amounts allowed by
      the South Sefton Magistrates Court and the sums which were
      reasonably incurred in the South Sefton proceedings in the context of
      the prosecution as a whole.

5.4   Garretts have provided the Hillsborough Family Support Group with an
      opportunity to comment on the applications. Any representations
      received will be reported to the Authority.

6     Judicial Review Proceeding - Director of Public Prosecutions’
      Costs

      Members will recall that on the 21 May 1999 the Authority resolved to
      make no decision on applications submitted by the former officers for
      payment of the costs of the Director of Public Prosecutions which were
      awarded against them, until the amount of those costs was known.
      The DPP has now submitted a bill of costs to Winkworth Sherwood.
      The total amount claimed in that bill is £3,250.96 costs and
      disbursements of £5,380.04, making a total of £8,630. Additionally, a
      small sum of £110.33 interest is sought. It appears that this bill should
      be apportioned between Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray. Pending
      clarification of the apportionment of the bill, the Authority is
      recommended to simply note the position.




                                                                                 5
7     Taxation Update

7.1   In accordance with the advice reported to the Authority on the 26
       November 1999;

      i.    The Clerk and Treasurer has arranged payment of the legal
      costs and disbursements incurred by Mr Murray in the Leeds criminal
      proceedings up to 5 February 1999, in the sum of £130,000 plus VAT.
      This payment has been discharged without any deduction of tax or Nl.
      Payment will be made to Mr Duckenfield’s solicitor when details are
      formalised.

      ii.  Garretts have informed the Inland Revenue of the payment and
      have provided a copy of the tax advice obtained by the Authority to the
      Inspector dealing with the matter. A copy of Garretts letter to the
      Inspector is attached at Appendix 6.

7.2   Following the meeting on 2 November between the Minister, Charles
       Clarke, the Chairman, the Chief Constable and the Clerk and
       Treasurer, formal representations to the Minister have been made on
       the Authority’s behalf by the Superintendents Association, the Police
       Federation, and ACPO. The APA has also been briefed. All of the
       organisations have stressed the potential wider implications of the
       case.

7.3   No formal response has been received from either the Home Office or
      the Inland Revenue, but we have been informed by the
      Superintendents Association that the Inland Revenue Inspector has
      indicated that he wishes to resolve the matter and is keen to meet with
      Garretts.

8     Home Office - Application for Financial Support

8.1   The Authority has sought assistance from the Home Office on two
      grounds:

      i)     Towards the cost of defending the officers, on the grounds that
             there are implications for the whole police service.

      ii)    Towards the cost of outstanding personal injury insurance
              claims, on the grounds that the Authority had taken out
              reasonable cover and could not have foreseen the extent to
             which claims would eventually exceed the insured limit.

8.2   The Minister offered no assurances on either issue, but did state that,
      of the two, he would be prepared to consider if the Home Office could
      provide assistance towards insurance costs. Informal contact with
       Home Office finance staff recently indicates that this is still being given
      serious consideration. The Authority requested grant and/or borrowing
      approvals to enable the costs to be spread.


                                                                                 6
9      Further Funding - Timetable

9.1    The 2000/2001 budget timetable and resolution of the various matters
       relating to Hillsborough are inextricably linked. The key issues are:

       i)     Whether payments to the officers are subject to tax. This will
              affect any future costs but also payments already made;

       ii)    Whether Home Office will provide any financial assistance to the
              Authority for either the defence or the insurance costs;

       iii)   The outcome of the January 2000 hearing, and whether this
              affects the future course of the case; arising directly from this,
              the receipt and consideration by the Authority of further
              applications from the officers for support towards the trial.

9.2    The Authority must set its budget by 28 February. Ideally it needs to
       know the outcome of all three Hillsborough related issues referred to in
       paragraph 9.1 before taking its budget decision. It is still not certain
       that this will be the case. However, the judge will deliver his decision
       on 16 February and if the outcome of this is that the officers still wish to
       make applications to the Authority for further support, it would be
       possible to consider these at a special meeting in late February. That
       meeting would require extensive preparation and background briefing,
       as in order to avoid challenge the Authority would need to revisit all of
       the issues, including financial implications and the potential impact of
       tax. If the tax issue were not to be resolved before the meeting it
       would complicate the decision by introducing a major element of
       uncertainty on total costs.

       As soon as the judge’s decision is known, and any ruling is received
       from Inland Revenue, it will be necessary to ask the Chairman to
       consider the arrangements for taking Hillsborough forward. This may
       require a special meeting or combining Hillsborough and budget issues
       in a single meeting at the end of February.

                ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE HEARING
          20 DECEMBER 1999 LEEDS CROWN COURT BEFORE
               THE HONOURABLE MR JUSTICE HOOPER

                                 SUMMARY


It was submitted on behalf of Mr Duckenfield that:

1     A statement made by Mr Duckenfield on or about 5 May 1989; and

2     The answers he gave to the Taylor Inquiry

were inadmissible in the forthcoming manslaughter trial on two grounds,
namely, public policy at common law, and by virtue of Section 78 of the Police
and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.

Public policy at common law

The argument on public policy at common law was rejected. Witnesses are
sometimes given an undertaking that their evidence to an Inquiry will not be
used to their prejudice in any criminal proceedings. There would be no need
for such an undertaking if it were the law that all witnesses who gave
evidence at public inquiries should not have the evidence given used against
them in subsequent proceedings.

PACEJ984

The second ground is based on the proposition that, under s78 PACE 1984,
I he evidence should not be allowed as it would have “an adverse effect on the
fairness of the proceedings". Under this ground, the court dealt separately
with the statement made on 5 May 1999 and the answers given before the
Taylor Inquiry.

The statement of 5 May 1989

The court felt that, taking into account Mr Duckenfield’s experience as a
senior police officer and that he knew what use could have been made of his
statement, there was no justification for concluding that its admission would
have an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings.

Evidence and Taylor

On the matter of the answers given to the Taylor Inquiry, it was contended
that this should be excluded on the grounds that Mr Duckenfield

      was not represented before the Inquiry,


                                                                                8
      was not made aware of allegations that were to be made against him
      and the evidence in support of them; and

      he did not receive a caution before giving his evidence.

In rejecting this submission, the court recognised

      once again that Mr Duckenfield was a very senior police officer

      that the Inquiry and Counsel for the Inquiry would have raised the issue
      of cautioning had it felt that any witnesses were laying themselves
      open to a criminal charge but did not feel it necessary to caution
      Mr Duckenfield; and

      that Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police Force (who it was
      accepted was not acting for Mr Duckenfield or any particular officers)
      did suggest to Mr Duckenfield that he ought to obtain legal advice but
      that despite this advice, Mr Duckenfield chose to go into the witness
      box (although it is not clear whether Mr Duckenfield sought
      independent advice himself).

 Mr D Duckenfield




 Dear Mr Duckenfield

Committal Proceedings, Leeds Magistrates Court ("Leeds Proceedings") - Provision of
funding of your legal costs by South Yorkshire Police Authority ("The Authority")

 I write further to the Authority's meeting on Friday 21 May 1999.

As you are aware, the Authority decided to make a contribution to certain legal costs incurred
by you as a consequence of the Leeds Proceedings brought by Ms Adlington on behalf of the
Hillsborough Family Support Group. I attach a copy of the letter sent by our solicitors to
yours on 28 May 1999 detailing the Authority's decisions.

This letter sets out the terms on a formal basis upon which the Authority will make their
contribution to your legal costs incurred in relation to the Leeds' Proceedings from and
including 6 February 1999 until and including the last day of the committal hearing.

Accordingly, the Authority agrees to reimburse your legal costs and disbursements up to a
fixed amount of £176,250 (inclusive of all disbursements and VAT) provided th a t:

1. no more than two fee-earners (and only if reasonable and proper for more than one to do
   so) may attend meetings (save for internal review and briefing meetings ), consultations
   and conferences with counsel or court hearings ("fee-eamer " to include trainees);
2. fee-earners will be charged out at a blended rate of £125.00 plus VAT per hour;

         BERNARD DEAN MURRAY
                    an d
           DAVID DUCKENFIELD


Costs of the Defendant Bernard M urray to be
taxed and paid out of Central Funds pursuant to
Defendant’s Costs Order dated 10 July 1998 -
Defendant not legally aided.


Defendant’s Solicitors:

R E F: RBM /M T

Tel: 0113 283 2500

VAT Reg. No. 481 8022 50



The Defendant was a Senior Police Officer
involved with operational command of the
Hillsborough Football Ground (along with his co­
accused David Duckenfield) on the day of what
has become known as the Hillsborough Disaster
on the 15 April 1959. The events o f that day and
subsequent Public Enquiry received widespread
news coverage. This and later TV documentaries
and dramatisations were critical o f the Police
handling o f the ground control at the football
stadium on that day and o f the actions of the two
Defendants in particular.




                     ( 1)
The Defendant faced three charges brought by
A n n Adlington on behalf of the Hillsborough
Family Suppprt Group and alleging two of
unlawful killing and one of wilful neglect to
perform a public duty.     This was a private
prosecution brought as a result of the DPP
deciding there was no evidence to prosecute the
Defendants coming out of the Inquests and public
enquiry.

The charges were strenuously denied and
representations were made to the Director of
Public Prosecutions to take over conduct of the
proceedings pursuant to Section 6(2) of the
Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and then to
discontinue the proceedings pursuant to Section
23(3) on the grounds of their being insufficient
evidence against the Defendant and / or that the
proceedings would be contrary to the public
interest. In addition, representations were made
to the Court to effect that the summonses had been
invalidly issued and should be quashed as the
alleged offences took place out of the jurisdiction
of this Court. There was a degree of cooperation
between the two Defendants and Solicitors as there
was no conflict of interest.

Considerable legal research and consideration was
carried out in what was clearly a complex an
novel case, the outcome being of great importance
not only to the private Prosecutors and the two
Defendants but also being of considerable public
media interest. In addition the numerous reports
and inquiries and other articles relating were
considered.     It should be noted that these
Solicitors made no reference to Counsel on any of
the issues..

Following telephone discussion and exchange of
lengthy and detailed correspondence it was
eventually agreed that the summonses should be
withdrawn and the Defendants were granted an
Order for their costs to be paid out of Central
Funds.




                     (2 )
This matter was conducted by a Partner and
Senior Solicitor with Leeds City Centre practice
and who was assisted by and work was delegated
to Senior Litigation Assistants. The charge-out
rates agreed with the Client (ie the hourly expense
rate inclusive o f mark-up for care and conduct)
was £125.00 per hour for the fee earners
involved. Routine letters and telephone calls, all
of which were dealt with by the Senior solicitor,
charged at l/10th of the hourly rate ie £12.50
each. Travelling and waiting time by the Senior
Solicitor charged at £82.50 per hour which rate
excludes any mark-up for care and conduct.

All times indicated in the bill have been recorded
either on the file or computer time recording
system.

        I had received a note direct front B ill consequent upon the paym ent and as a m atter o f
        cou rresy i attach a copy o f the ietttr that I have sent to him for I am sure that the inform ation
        will also be h s b fu \        I attach a copy o f the letter that I have received from South Sefton
        M agistrates’ Court. W e now have an impasse and a decision needs to be m ade b y the
        Authority. Either the A uthority must authorise me to challenge this decision by w ay o f an
        applicaton for Judicial R eview or the Authority m ust m ake up the difference between that
        w hich has been approved by ths South Se^on Court and the total am ount o f the bill.

        I am w c n ie d about the costs o f a Judicial R eview com pared to the am ount at issue. M y Law
        Costs Draftsm an seems confident o f a successfiri outcom e as does M alcolm Goodwin w ho is
        the in-house C osts Draftsm an at W m ekworth Sherwood. I f w e were to be successful th en we
        w ould expect an Order for Costs against South Sefton. The A uthority m ay prefer the certainty
        o f know ing that there is a relatively m odest difference betw een that authorised and that
        claim ed and I w ould understand this if for purely economic reasons they m ade th at decision.

        Please w ould you try to obtain a decision for me as quickly as possible because although there
        is this three-m onth time limit for lodging a Judicial R eview A pplication, there is also the
        secondary rSx. th at it has to b e as quickly as possible, and in any event not longer than three
        months.

Dear Mr. Harlock

Adlington -v- Duckenfield and M urray

As discussed earlier today, I enclose a copy of the letter from South Sefton Magistrates’
Court finalising the assessed amount o f our client’s costs.

Our client’s claim was for £8,716.63 and after representations the court has assessed the
costs at the figure of £2,320.67. The primary reason for such a large reduction was that
only the costs relating to the jurisdiction issue were allowed.

If we do not accept the assessed amount we will have to seek leave for a Judicial Review. It
is understood that we can seek to review the reasons given by the Clerk for items being
disallowed, but the JR will not review the actual taxed bill. In a letter dated 19 August 1999
the Acting Clerk stated that only costs relating to the 'narrow jurisdiction matter' had been
allowed. For that reason all Counsel fees were disallowed, as Counsel was not required to
deal with the jurisdiction point. We need to prove that this decision was incorrect. If we
are successful the bill will be re-assessed by the Clerk taking into account costs to be
allowed following the Judicial Review.
                           . *»


Before deciding to seek leave for Judicial Review it is important for us to clarify the merits
o f our claim. For this reason we wish to seek Counsel's advice. There are a number o f
barristers specialising in costs, and Mr. Nick Bacon is our preferred choice.

We ask that the above details are presented to the Police Authority so that they made decide
to either challenge the decision of the Magistrates by Judicial Review, or agree to pay the
difference between the assessed costs and the total amount o f the bill o f costs.

We will be grateful for a speedy decision as an application for Judicial Review will need to
be made as soon as possible and no later than 3 months after the South Sefton Magistrates’
decision.

   Dear Sir

   Hillsborough Funding

   Your letter of 31 ” January addressed to Anr. Adlington has been passed to me fbr
   consideration. In view of the ridiculously tight timescale tyhich you have imposed, these
   representations will of necessity be brief.

   Firstly, would you please confirm that the affidavit sworn by Dennis Luty on 5th March 1999
   will be circulated to members in advance of the meeting on 4* February. Particular regard
   should be had to his concern expressed at paragraph 8 as to the [surprising high level of costs
   claimed] bearing in mind that the matter was disposed of by way of correspondence No more
   than 6 letters were exchanged on this aspect of the case.

   Membsrs’ attention should also be drawn to the ro’e of the Clerk to the Court in determining
   costs to be paid from Central Funds in each particular case It is well established that the
   Clerk will base his decision using the “reasonableness” criteria. That is, what would a
   reasonable man of reasonable means be prepared to pay for legal representation if he had to
   fork out the funds himself? Obviously, in the present case, the Clerk has exercised the
   Wednesbury principle and decided that no reasonable man of reasonable means would be
   prepared to pay the amounts currently claimed by Walker Morris and Winckworth Sherwood.
   This comes as no surprise to us given that those 2 firms are currently seeking £30,000 from
   Ann Adlington for a judicial review lasting a mere one and a halfdays.

   The Clerk to the Court in exercising his discretion in the present case has quite simply decided
   that to pay the costs claimed by the Defence team in full, would be an unreasonable use of
   taxpayers money which would be open to legal challenge. For police authority members to
   even consider bridging the gap by using South Yorkshire charge payers funds, is too ludicrous
   for words. How much more can South Yorkshire charge payers be expected to cough up?
   Such considerations will not of course bother the defendants or their lawyers as none of them
   live in South Yorkshire

    At least one of the defence teams has recently acknowledged that in having the proceedings
    aborted in South Sefton, they did so with the expectation that proceedings would be instituted
    elsewhere. One therefore has to ask what benefit accrued to South Yorkshire residents by
    employing what can only be described as a delaying tactic? This case is littered with examples
    of such conduct -with the only beneficiaries of course being the fat cat lawyers.

    Please acknowledge receipt of this letter an confirm that it will be distributed to the Authority
    members.


    Yours faithfully

                     b u t there w as a n arg u m e n t lhai the su m m o n se s w ere ineffective unless the defendants
                     s u b m itte d to th e jurisdiction o f this Court. Accordingly, after further co rresp o n d e n ce
                     a n d telep h o n e discussion w*th all parties, it w as agreed that the proceedings should
                     b e bro ug ht forward to the 10* July a n d that the inform ant w o u ld apply for them to be
                     w ith d raw n .

            6,      O n the 10* July in the a b se n c e of all parties, proceedings w e re w ith d ra w n and the
                     Court m a d e an o rd e r for the defendants' co sts lo be taxed a n d paid from central funds
                     in a c c o rd a n c e with Section 16 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 198S.

              7.     I w a s a w a re that proceedings w ere re-com m enced in Ihe Leeds Magistrates’ Court
                     later that month-

              8.     The defendant*1solicitors e a c h subm itted iheir claim s for costa in Seo!emberl998. I
                     w a s extrem ely surprised at the level or costs w hich w ere being claim ed, particularly
                     In view of the fact that neither of the defendants or their solicitors had actually
                     a p p e a re d before the Court in relation ic this m atter. in a c c o rd a n c e with my normal
                     p ractice 1 requ ested that the solicitors should supply to m e their full Hies of papers
                     applying the provisions of Regulation 5(5) of the Costs In C rim inal Cases (Genera!)
                      Regulations 1986.

              9.      Both solicitors subm itted their full files of papers to m e and w h e n I perused those
                      docum ents I discovered a c le a r indication within them that the South Yorkshire police
                      Authority had agreed to pay the defen dan ts’ cos'-s In relation to this matter. 1therefore
                      co m m u n icated with both solicitors suggesting that as the d efen d an ts themselves had
                      not incurred costs, they w e re not entitled to be reim bursed. [ d r e w attention to the
                      c a s e of R. u, Miller (R aym on d ) a n d another 1933 3 All ER 136.

              to.     Once again, ihe^e w as fu rth e rc o n e s p o n d e rc e in relation to this m atter, ire solicitors
                      arguing that their clients had in fact incurred costs in a c c o rd a n c e with the rsuo of MHler
                      a n d that 1 should therefore und ertak e an appropriate taxation.

               11.    Early last m o n th ,! b e c a m e aw a re thai an issue had arisen b e tw e e n the Chief Cons ta bis
                      c f the South Yorkshire P olice an d the South Yorkshire Police Authority In relation to

                      m ay b e subject to judicial review if i declined to pay the d e fe n d a n ts ' costs.

              12 .    O r ihe 11* F eb ru a ry I w roie to both solicitors advising them or my provisional
                      conclusion that the defen dan ts h ad not them selves incurred costs, i dreiv attention tc
                      the fact that 1 was a w a re of the pending judicial review ir. relation to the rilic e

Joint Report o f the Clerk and Treasurer and C hief Constable



FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS - SECOND SUPPLEM ENTARY REPORT

1.    Purpose o f the Report

a)    To draw members attention to a letter received from Walker Morris,
      dated the 2.2.00, relating to costs incurred in the DPP judicial review
      proceedings.

b)     To inform members of applications made by Winkworth Sherwood on
       behalf of Mr Murray:

       i) for financial assistance; and

      ii) for permission to instruct counsel for advice on the recovery of costs
          from HFSG.




      2.      Recom m endations

      Members are recommended to :

      i) note the contents of the letter from Walker Morris ; and

      ii) consider the further applications made on behalf of Mr
      Duckenfield.



3.    Letter from W alker Morris

3.1   The letter attached at appendix 1 was received by Garretts on the
      2.1.00. As the Authority is not being asked today to make a decision
      on the reimbursement of the costs incurred in the judicial review
      proceedings involving the Director of Public Prosecutions, members
      are simply asked to note this letter.

4.    Letter from W inkworth Sherwood

4.1   On the 2 February 2000, Winkworth Sherwood wrote to Garretts, on
      behalf of Mr Duckenfield requesting that the Authority be asked :




                                                                                1
       i)    to consider the reimbursement of certain costs incurred in
             connection with the criminal proceedings in the Leeds District
             Magistrates Court; and

       ii)   for permission authorising Winkworth Sherwood to instruct
              counsel on matters relating to the recovery of costs from HFSG.

4.2    Leeds District M agistrates Court

      The District Magistrates Court has approved for payment from central
      funds, the bill of costs submitted by Winkworth Sherwood for legal
      costs incurred by Mr Duckenfield in respect of the charge of intent to
      pervert the course of justice. Only one small element of the bill was
      disallowed. This related to the costs draftsman’s fee in the sum of
      £2,289.24. Winkworth Sherwood have asked that the Authority
      reimburse this sum. The following letters are attached at Appendix 2.

      i)     Letter from the Leeds District Magistrates Court to Winkworth
             Sherwood, dated 25 .1.00; and

      ii)    Letter from Winkworth Sherwood to Garretts dated 2.2.00.

      HFSG Costs

      Winkworth Sherwood are seeking to recover costs of £40,857.07, from
      HFSG, pursuant to the costs order made in favour of Mr Duckenfield in
      the judicial review proceedings relating to the powers of police
      authorities. A number of points are being disputed by HFSG.
      Winkworth Sherwood’s costs draftsman wants to obtain counsel’s
      advice on these points of dispute. The letter to Garretts referred to
      above, requests the Authority’s permission in this respect.

      Garretts have advised Winkworth Sherwood that it is not for the
      Authority’s role to grant or refuse permission for them to instruct
      counsel. Whilst it may be assumed that what is being asked, is for the
      Authority to meet the costs, this matter should be clarified.
      Accordingly, the Authority is recommended to note the request at this
      stage.

        Dear David

        Thank you for the orompt response to my fax o f the 1“ February.

        I apologise if my memory has failed me. It is not surprising at my old age!

        I thought that the AUlbonty hfid agreed that the D PP’s costs would be met by them in the event that
        there was a requirement so to do. May I just say in this fcg&rd that we always recognised that If the
        application was n o t successful, then it was likely that the costs of the DPP would have to be met. As
        you know we Almost won end indeed Dtvid Duckenfield succeeded in pan. If I can respectfully
        remind the members o f the Authority that Lord Justice !„iw said rhfiT whilst he did ;>oi fm<J it
        W ednesbury unreasonable Chat the DPP had not intervened he would also not have .foucd it
        unreasonable if the DPP hud intervened. Furthermore you will also remember that it w as not until
        the very last moment that the Coart gave the opportunity to M r. Newell o f the CPS to file a
        supplemental Affidavit Ofld it WOS th b which just about clinched it for him.

        I hope in the circumstances (and having regard to whet is not a very large bill) that the Authority
        will think it appropriate to meet this.

        A d lin g to n -v- D uckeoficld a n d M u rra y

        As the Pclicc Authority is meeting on-Friday 4th February I have reviewed the current costs
        position and have prepared ihe following summary.

        t                  Costs Assessed in the South Sc//on Magistrates' Court

        To summarise our letter to you dated 25 January 2000 our client's claim for costs in the
        South Sefton Magistrates’ Court was for £8,716.63 and the coart has assessed these costs at
        £2,320.67.

        I ant instructed to seek, the Policc Authority’s agreement to either fund an application for a
        Judicial Review or to pay the difference between the assessed costs and the total amount of
        the bill of costs.

        :i                 Costs Assessed by (ha Leeds District Magistrates'Court

        Lhave attached a copy of a letter received from Court. These costs have been claimed '.Voin
        Central Funds following the order dated 26 April 1999 that the charge of intent to pervert
        the course of justice be dropped. The Court has allowed the criminal costs in Full, but has
        disallowed the time spent preparing the bill. As you arc aware I have spent a considerable
        amount of time dealing with the varied costs issues in this matter. This includes preparina
        hi its to recover costs from Central Funds and the preparation of detailed cost breakdowns so
        that your Costs Draftsman nay audit our files. I believe that the costs issues in this mailer
        be exceptional and the costs for the preparation of this complex bill of costs should have
        bwt.n allowed. However I cannot advise making representations tij the Court bccausc the
        criminal costs were tp.xed.-as drawn.

        1 will be grateful for the perm ission o f ihe Police Authority to accept the taxed am ount and
        a jr e e tc pay the Law C osts Draftsm an costs for the preparation o f the bill n f costs.

       tii     Costs Audited by the Pellet Authority's Law Costs Draftsman

       I believe y o u w ill now be in possession o f M r. W hawcll’s report following his audit o f o u r
       files up to 7 January 2000 and look forward to receiving' the Police A uthority's paym ent o f
       these costs. A s I am unaware o f Mr. W hawell’s recom m endations I ask that a copy o f M r.
       W ahw ell’s report be provided so that I m ay respond to any recom m endations that are
       considered unreasonable.

       »‘v.    Costs Recoverable from HFSG for the Funding. Judicial Review

       1 last wrote about these costs on 1 December 1999. Proceedings to recover costs of
       £40.857.0? commenced on 19 July 1999. HFSG served very lengthy and detailed points of
       dispute and our replies were served on 19 October 1999, These were acknowledged but 1
       have had no further response. I now have to lodge the Bill of Costs with the Court, which
       will incur a Court fee of £160.00. We should also consider making a Part 36 offer. The
       benefit of making an offer is that if the offer is not beaten we will .recover indemnity costs
       of the detailed assessment hearing, plus interest at 18%. Given rhe high profile of this ease
       I consider obtaining Counsel's advice on the Points of Dispute and on a Part 36 offer
       advisable. Without Counsel’s advice 1 am of the opinion that an offer around 134,000 (ius!
       under 85%) is appropriate.

       I will be grateful for the Police Authority's permission to instruct Counsel to advi-se on the
       points of dispute and the making of a Part 36 offer.

       v.      Costs Payable by Mr. Duckenfteld for the DPP .Judivin! Review

       Wc have spoken ir, detail about this matter recently. 1 h?.ve again chased the Treasury
       Solicitor about the possible duplication of costs. The Treasury Solicitor has not received a
       copy of the Order for Mr. Murray to pay costs, but without prejudice it was agreed that the
       most likely outcome was that the DPP costs would be split equally between Mr.
       Duckenfield and" Mr. Murray. Mr. Duckenfield will then be liable to pay 2/3rds of those
       costs claimed against him, as he was partly successful, i calculate this to be £2,877.00.

       I am reminded of the Police Authority’s resolution dated 21 May 1999 and hope that the
       Police Authority will consider it appropriate to scale these costs on behalf of our client.

       I will be grateful if the Police Authority during the.meeting on Friday 4ih February 2000
       Czr. consider these costs issues. Please call me if there is anything you wish to discuss.

      RESOLVED - That, in view of the nature of the report before the Authority, under
      Section 100A(4) of the Local Government Act 1972, the public be excluded from
      the meeting for the following item on the grounds that in view of the nature of the
      item it is likely that if they were present exempt information as defined in
      paragraphs 5 and 12 of Part 1 of Schedule 12A of the Local Government Act 1972
      would be disclosed to them:-

      Paragraph 5 -   Information relating to any particular applicant for, or recipient or
                      former recipient, of any financial assistance provided by the
                      Authority.

      Paragraph 12 - Any instructions to Counsel and any opinion of Counsel (whether
                     or not in connection with any proceedings) and any advice
                     received, information obtained or action to be taken in connection
                     with -

                       (a)   any legal proceedings by or against the Authority, or

                       (b)   the determination of any matter affecting the Authority.

                      (Whether, in either case, proceedings have been commenced or
                      are in contemplation).

177   FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      The Clerk and Treasurer explained that the purpose of the meeting was to
      consider applications for financial assistance from two former officers, Mr David
      Duckenfield and Mr Bernard Murray, to meet their respective legal costs and
      disbursements in certain legal proceedings. He briefly explained that the Authority
      had, at its meeting of 5 February 1999, in the light of legal advice received from
      leading Counsel that there was doubt as to whether the Authority had legal power
      to provide such assistance, declared its earlier decisions to provide such
      assistance to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray null and void. The Clerk and
      Treasurer then introduced the Authority’s legal advisers, Garretts.

      Mr Painter of Garretts took the Authority through Garretts’ report dated 13 May
      1999, summarising its contents. Mr Painter described the different proceedings in
      respect of which Messrs Duckenfield and Murray were seeking financial
      assistance. He then summarised the previous decisions taken by the Authority in
      relation to financial assistance applications from Messrs Duckenfield and Murray.
      Mr Painter explained that the Divisional Court had on 31 March 1999 declared that
      a police authority had power, subject to ordinary public law principles, to provide
      financial assistance to police officers and former police officers in respect of their
      costs and expenses incurred in relation to private prosecutions brought against
      them and judicial review proceedings in which they participated.

                                                                                SYPA
                                                                              21.5.99
Mr Painter explained that the Court had not expressed a view on whether the
Authority should provide financial assistance in this instance and that it was for the
Authority to decide, subject to ordinary public law principles, when and how to use
that power.

Mr Painter then summarised each of Messrs Duckenfield’s and Murray’s
applications for financial assistance and handed out a schedule of estimated costs
and expenses incurred and to be incurred by each of them together with a
schedule of the Police Authority’s and the Chief Constable’s costs and expenses
incurred and to be incurred in connection with the applications.

(Paragraph rem oved in accordance with section 100C o f the Local G overnm ent
A c t 1972)

Mr Painter explained that each of the applications in respect of costs and
expenses incurred in respect of each set of proceedings should be considered
afresh and should be considered separately. He summarised the public law
principles of decision making and drew attention to the considerations set out in
Garretts’ report.

In relation to the resources available to the Authority, the financial implications of
the applications for financial assistance and the operational considerations, the
Chief Constable took the Authority through the joint report of the Clerk and
Treasurer and Chief Constable dated 21 May 1999, summarising its contents.
The Chief Constable explained the operational impact on the Authority’s financial
position that the provision of financial assistance would have and commented that,
in his view, the negative effect that a decision not to provide financial assistance
would have on the conduct of the force outweighed that impact.

The Authority then considered whether Mr Trevor Hicks, a representative of the
Hillsborough Family Support Group, should be permitted to address the Authority
in relation to Mr Duckenfield’s and Mr Murray’s applications. Having taken advice
from Garretts and considered and debated the issue, the Authority resolved as
follows:

RESOLVED - That the Authority: -

1     Permit Mr Hicks to address the Authority in relation to Mr Duckenfield’s and
      Mr Murray’s applications for financial assistance.

2     Hear such representations from Mr Hicks before hearing representations on
      behalf of Messrs Duckenfield and Mr Murray.

The Authority then heard representations from:-

(a)   Mr Hicks.
(b)   Mr Manning of Walker Morris on behalf of Mr Murray.
(c)   Mr Eastwood of Winckworth Sherwood on behalf of Mr Duckenfield.

AT THIS POINT THE MEETING WAS REOPENED TO THE PUBLIC

101   RSG PROVISIONAL SETTLEMENT 2000/2001

      A report of the Clerk and Treasurer referred to the Revenue Support Grant
      Provisional Settlement for 2000/2001.

      The overall settlement increased by 5.5% over 1999/2000. The highest increase
      was in Education and the Police Service had done relatively poorly.

      So far as South Yorkshire Police Authority was concerned there was an increase of
      3.1% in the Authority's SSA for 2000/2001 whereas the overall increase in police
      funding was 3.5%.

      The basic guideline increase for the purposes of triggering the council tax benefit
      subsidy scheme was 4.5% but taking account of changes in direct charges for the
      police national computer the effect was that council tax could increase by 6.42%
      before the subsidy scheme was triggered. On that basis, the implied year on year
      budget change was 3.67%.

      RESOLVED - That the report be noted and further budgetary information awaited.

            D ear Sirs

            K U teborougb - F e n d in g

            Wc w rite w ith all urgency to seek the approval o f the Police Authority to the further provision
            o f assistance to M r, Bernard M urray by way o f an indem nity :o him as to costs incurred in the
            defence o f the private prosecution against him and M r. D uekenfidd.

            I.          A pplication to stay the Proceedings

            W e have already provided to you by fax a copy o f the Judgment, Y ou understand th at there
           rem ains e prohibition on any publication o f this Judgm ent H owever M r.M ichael H arrison
           Q.C. obtained confirm ation from M r. Justice Hooper that it would obviously have to be drawn
           to the attention o f the Police Authority as they enter into their decision m aking process to
           continue th e financial assistance. The Judge is aware that the Authority have granted funding
            in stages. H e is also aw are that is the past H.F.S.G. have sought to persuade znwnbsrs o f the
           A uthority not to provide this financial assistance. You w ill note particular referenda within
           the body o f the Judgm ent to th at financial assistance. We do not anticipate that you will have
           any approach from H.F.S.Q. to seek to again interfere in the provision o f funding, but ware
           any such approach to be made to the A uthority wc would im m ediately ask to be told so th at in
           tu rn w e m ay teti th e Judge. The Judge has specifically enjoined the Prosecution to behave in a
           responsible m anner.

           This is a disappointing Judgm ent because in the view o f Leading Counsel and ourselves, the
           Judge seem s to h ave failed to grapple at all w ith the submissions m ade unde- A rticle 6 o f the
           E uropean Convention. This ehould have stopped this prosecution in it s tracks. The Judge
           did fm d fo r the D efence chat th e proceedings did amount to oppression, 2nd that norm ally
           w ould have been m ors than sufficient for th e proceedings to be stopped. W hilst there 15 a
           m odest comfort to our Client in the w ay in Which the Judge sought tc iimeve that oppression,
           it is no re lie f in substance because our Client steadfastly denies the allegations and wants to be
           acquitted. N a person to w hom w e have spoken, who is in any w ay involved in P ehcc work,
           whether as e serving O fficer a retired Officer, a m em ber o f an A uthority or sl'nilaf, zan
           believe that these tw o m en can be guilty o f the offence charged. In our subm ission there m ust
           not be any question o f now abandoning them.

           In our view and ia the view o f Leading Counsel the decision not to stay for oppression j‘ 3
           capable o f an appeal. The decision on the European Law question is alm ost totally avoided,
           as if inviting the C ourt o f A ppeal to sort it o u t No Interlocutory Appeal is possible and these
           issues could only be taken at the sad of trial.

             W s did have sem e success .in that as you can see from the Judgment., the Judge had in mind
             transferring ihs case foi triai to Newcastle. K e has now agreed th at trial should take place in
             L eeds. The financial. consequences so far as the Defence are concerned and the Authority are
             as follow s:

             1.        Sine? both the Q.C, Junior Counsel and Solicitors are in Leeds there will be no
                       additional co/R In relation to their travel tim e to and bom N ew castle, and th sir hotel
                       accom m odation foe at least 5 nights p er week in Newcastle.

             2.        Insofar as M r .M urray will be abie to live at home, there will be no additional cost
                        concerning his travel andsceonuriodatioa in Newcastle.

             3.        I t w eald have been necessary, jofctly with W inckworih Sherwocd, to rent Offices in
                        N ew castle to be tbs repository o f all o f the lever arch flies and other docum ents. That
                        0 fr.e e would also have had to have rented telephones, com puter equipment, fax and
                        photocopier. A ll o f these facilities are now going to be available at this Office.
                        Insofar as w® also provide those facilities free o f charge to Whickwo.rth Sherwood,
                        there (s &relief froja expense in that regard as wall.

            The Judge set down a very tight timetable which is why an urgent decision is requested frctn
            the A uthority. T he Prorecution have to h sve served th eir case, including case statem ents
            and/or w itness statem ents with schedules o f unused m aterial by the 15* M arch. This Firm
            have to reply before Easter.

            Trial lakes place at Leads cn tits 6^ June with s. time estimate o f 6 w?sics.

            W e wjii continue, as before, to liaise with Winckworth Shenvood and respectivs Counsel to
            try to avoid, so fa r as is possible, the duplication o f work, ether than the general preparation c t
            the case o n the facts w hich each hav* to do for their respective Clients.

            2.         Sum m ary o f m ajor areas c f work necessary.

           In a m eeting held at tius Office immediately after the Judgm ent was handed down, w s
           identified the follow ing general areas o f work;

                      so that you can see some o f the issues in that regard end generally* In short the
                      D efence stili do not know the full extent o f the Prosecution case, but yet have tc be
                      reedy to deal w ith it.

              2 ,5     T here is a vast am ount o f unused m aterial. Tbs letter o f the 4 ta February show s you
                        th e intention o f the Prosecution to apply for a W itness Sum m ons against A ssistant

             2.7       T here is a m ajor issue with regard to photographic evidence, and in particular to try to
                       identify th e actual view o f the Defendants, 3© thei one can-try to step into their shoes
                       in the agony o f the m om ent

             2.8       T he Prosecution have apparently been provided w ith (hut have not y et served the
                       D efence w ith) som e tapes containing conversations throughout the course o f the
                       afternoon. These have to be provided and analysed into exchanges between O fficers
                       and Officers, Officers and the Club and all o f these with the control room . In this we
                       need to deal with, and if necessary obtain expert inform ation on the problem s o f radio
                       transm ission, A il o f this is designed to try to establish th e bsst evidence o f w hat was
                       actually happening in the control box.

             2.9       Hold.swo.rth has alleged the disappearance o f a video tape from the control box. Wc
                       n eed to try to replicate what videos were working, what they w ere recording and the
                       inter-reiaiionship between video equipm ent in the Club control and that in the control
                       room sc as to establish what the Police could have seen and woat they could not Lave
                       seen, and then to distinguish this between whet they actually saw. As to Koidswortft>
                       it w as th e view o f Lord Justice Stuart Smith that he was an uarsiiabie w itness but he
                       w ould need to be cross-examined at trial.

             2.10      E xpert evidence. At various stag«3 reports have been received from Mr. Phillips (now
                       C h ief C onstable o f K ent) and Mr. Stalker. We have also had unsolicited offers o f
                       help from a form er Senior Police Officer now in charge at Highbury and another who
                       is a t W em bley Stadium . A decision needs to be m ade about th e areas th at co u ld be
                       considered by an expert witness, the identification o f an appropriate expert an d the
                       necessary liaison end w ork w ith that ex pert No provision has been m ade for the fees
                       on the appointm ent o f an expert, W e would sim ply ask that the A uthority confirm a
                       preparedness to add to the costs estimate in the event that Leading Counsel believes
                       th at an expert is required.

             All of th e above ju s t form s a provisional list o f what preparatory work is clearly going to have
             to b e undertaken. The w ork on the Holmes Com puter alone i$ v a s t bur the Prosecution have
             nearly finished that consideration, having epparently worked for 2 m onths on it,

            3.         Solicitors costs for preparation.

           T here are likely io be tw o principle Fes Earners, nam sly the W riter and his A ssistant who
           h av e he«n involved is th is case throughout, We anticipate tb it for the i 6 weaks between now
           and the start o f the trial, an average o f 35 hours per weak is cbviaris and may be a significant

           4.        Solicitors costs for Trial

           The calculation in relation to the trh i itself is rather easier. W e accept the same basis o f
           w orking nam ely no m ore than two persons at Court, and this has worked weii and should
           continue to fee possible now that we have these Offices as Headquarters. We have norm ally
           started o\ir Court day c o t laier than 9.00.Bin. with s conference here, and then gone over to
           C ourt. W e have taken lunch here and after Court we have com e beck here and w e have
           w orked fo r as lo n g as was necessary. W e have judged our day on the basis o f 9.00.a.m . to
           7.0G,p.m. Obviously w e will give precise figures or, a day to day basis. H ow ever on the
           assum ption o f an average 10 hour working day in Court and the work before and after, and
           w ith two peopie only being catered for as to remuneration, this provides r weekly cost o f
           £12,500 pius V A Tasd disbursam eats. I f the trial lasts for 6 weeks tb«n th e total cost is
           £75,000 pius VAT,

           5.       C o u n se ls Fees

           Leading C ounsel has told Uls C lerk that he expects to undertake betw een ISO to 200 hours o f
           preparation. That o f course &ss.ums3 that a vast am ount o f the preparatory w ork will have
           been done ir. this Office and sifted essentially before it gets to Counsel. T he B rief fee
           suggested for Leading Counsel is £50j000 plus VAT. W hether this is locked at in term s o f the
           hourly rate o f £250.00 previously agreed and simply the preparatory tim e, w ithout anything
           for the first day or is looked at as a combinaticr. o f preparation plus a B rief fa® for the first
           day, seems to arrive at the same figure. The refreshers would be at £1,500 plus VAT for each
           day.

          Junior Counsel would be at a figure o f one-half that o f Leading Counsel, nam ely £25,000
          preparction and Brief, and £750.00 per day. For a 6 week trial tfiat gives you Leading
          C ounsel’s fees o f £53,500 plus VAT end Junior Counsel’s fees o f £46.7SO.00 phis VAT. T hs
          d aily refreshers include ihe conferences before end after Court on a daily basis.

          6.        Feym ent Terras

          W e believe that the M em bers o f the A uthority will be extremely concerned to know th at this
          Firm have not received any paym ent for tim e spent and w ork done since .January 1999. The
          A uthority w ill o f coarse be aware o f authorities given as to constituent parts o f the case from
          that date. N otw ithstanding the fact that this Firm have willingly discicsed all o f it’s files and
          papers to a Law Cost D raftsm an appointed b y Solicitors acting for the Authority, so that there
          can be an audit c f the tim e spent and work done, no paym ents have been made fo r a period o f
          m ore than 13 m onths. There is is our view no issue as to the bona ficcs o f th e claim s for

                 We write following the rscsnt decision o f Mr Justice Kooper reusing the application on
                 behalf o f the defendants to stay the criminal proceedings, and therefore to proceed to trial
                 on 6 June 2000. We understand you will already be aware of this decision, and write to
                 formally request of the Authority agreement to indemnify Mr Duckenfidd in regard to his
                 reasonable legal costs and disbursements incurred in defending this matter to trial. We
                 have, since receiving Mr Justice Hooper’s recent decision, discussed this position at length
                 with Messrs Walker Morm, solicitors for Mr Murray, and have had the benefit of seeing
                 their detailed letter to you prepared after that discussion, ir« regard to Mr Murray, and
                 matters generally. We confirm our agreement with the details contained therein, and the
                 sentiments expressed in that letter regarding the future conduct cf the matter.

                 it nivv bs heipfui for the Authority to have ou? further comments on sotne of the matters
                 that may be of interest when this application is next considered,

                A copy of that decision has been made available to ± t Authority. All those Involved in the
                defence of this matter are extremely disappointed at the reluctance of the Learned Judge to
                take the appropriate steps to ensure fairness for the defendants, notwithstanding his finding
                of oppression, and his obvious concern that it has taken 10 years for criminal proceedings
                against the defendants to reach this point. The Authority will appreciate the “highly
                unusual course” adopted in -he Judgment confirming to the defendants that even in the
                event of a conviction, they "will not immediately lose their liberty”. This expression, prior
                to the commencement of such a high profile criminal trial may well be unique.

                The Authority should know that those advising Mr Duckeofield are strongly of the view that
                this approach is deeply flawed, in that it does not address, or deal with," the fact that the

            C o n tin u e d               ______                                                 ,

            defendants will have to undergo the stress and trauma of a 6 week trial, leaving them
            exposed to the risk o f a conviction by jury in a trial where oppression has already been
            established.

            The Authority will see that Mr Justice Hooper desis with the question of human rights in
            one pags at the conclusion of the Judgment. The Authority ought to know that the
            submissions put on behalf of the defendants in regard to human rights issues were lengthy
            anti cf the greatest force. It will be self-evident from the Judgment that Mr Justice Hooper
            has declined to deal with this issue at ail, suggesting that if indeed the defendants feel that
            matters are unfair, the arguments can be raised in the Court of Appeal. The unfairness to
            the defendants o f This approach is regrettable, hut unfort unateiy it is not open to the defence
            to appeal this matter presently; and the trial will have to proceed.

            The above comments are made to emphasise to the Authority that the application argued in
           January o f this year was one made with the greatest of force and which, ws suggest, was
           clearly one that the Learned Judge found difficult to deal with. The genera), tone o f the
           Judgment is such that the Judge feels that it is possible to continue and to have ‘"a fair trial”
           notwithstanding the historical aspects, and one means proposed to achieve this was to
           transfer the ina! to Newcastle. As the Walker Morris letter points out- this was vigorously
           opposed by the defendants, and after detailed points were raised as to the personal and
           economic inconvenience that would be fcit by the defence if this step were takes, the
           Learned Judge has resolved for the tnai to remain in Leeds. This is indeed a decision which
           ought greatly assist the defence, particularly w, regard ta pragmatic arrangements, and tha
           importance for the defendants to receive support from friends and family in the Yorkshire
           area daring the course of the trial cannot be underestimated.

           For Use benefit of the Authority, in brief terms the savings in regard to Mr Duckenfidd i::
           having the trial in Leeds are as follows:

            !)         Our junior Counsel resides in Leeds, and a Newcastle trial would have involved his
                        needing to be accommodated in a hotel for 6 weeks, together with travel costs.

           2)          Mr Duckenfield would have been required to arranged hotel accommodation, which
                       may well have been a largely avoidable problem in Leeds given his pexsonal
                       contacts in the Yorkshire area. In addition he would be required to travel
                       considerable distances over fad above the travel to Leeds, and this would have been
                       of particular impact at the end of each week when he would arrive home late on
                       Friday evening, and be required to start travelling back to Newcastle at lunch time on
                       the Sunday.

           3}          Professional infrastructure costs have been kept to a minimum. Walker Morris have
                        set out »h«s yv’isii in thei> letter, and considerable costs would have been incurred in
                        making the necessary office and other arrangements so that the defence could
                        properly be conducted. For the record we ought to record now our deep thanks to
                        Mr Manning, his partners and bis staff at Waiksr Morris who have so far selflessly
                        provided all manner of physical and personal assistance, such that the defence c f

              being provided. There is no doubt &at we could hot have provided the assistance
              we have so far to Mr Ducksnfteld without the Help of Walker Moms. It will be
              ur.dm tood that this arrangement, to achieve the be.?? possible dsfence at trial, is of
              vital .important-.* to both defendants.

       Preparation to trial

       Walker Mom's hava heipfuUy set out the timetable and a number o f matters that or a brief
      review o f work to br done, the solicitors have identified as key points. We should
      emphasise for the Authority that at the moment no detailed review of the work required tor
      trial has been conducted with the benefit of Counsel's input. The Authority and their
      solicitors will be aware that at all times we have endeavoured to concentrate on the
      particular applications at hand, in order to avoid doing what may have turned out to be
      unnecessary work. V/e have, however, been required to carry out certain necessary work in
      regard to general defence issues, tc protect the interests of the defendants, and the Authority
      will appreciate that without delay, we will need to involve ourselves in detailed preparations
      to ensure that Counsel is adequately prepared by the time the trial commences in June*
      which of course is a relatively short period of time.

      Our Leading Counsel is presently overseas, returning in the week commencing 6 March.
      We p)an to have an early meeting with him, and possibly Junior Counsel to pian the
      necessary preparations on a cost-effective basis, and to liaise with Walker Morris and Mr
      Murray’s Counsel so that we can effectively apportion tasks to specific members c f the
      teams to minimise the risk o f duplication.

      Costs estimates

      The estimates set out in the Welker Morris letter are arrived at after discussion between us,
      Wc agree with the estimates set out m rsgaid to preparation, and attendance at trial,
      similarly involving the writer (partner) and one of two assistants on an on-going basis.

      We confirm that our client will be vitally involved in sifting through much of the material,
      although we .are concerned given, previous health considerations* riot, to overburden Mr
      Duckcnfield wita tasks. Clearly, however, he can assist greatly and be has expressed s wish
      10 co whatever he can tc help the legal team with preparations.


     It will be self-evident from the Walker Morris figures that the best estimate figure for
     professional costs to the end of the trial is in the region of £145,000 vlus VAT. On top of
     this, there will be consequential expenses, from the Duckenfield ‘team point o f view
     occasioned by the need to travel to Leads, and for accommodation throughout the trial.

      t he estimates o f course can only be a best estimate, and it seems from the history of this
     mfttttr mat most estimates, although made genuinely in all cases, have been proved to b= on
     tr.c ,ow side. As we have asked previously, in any agreement should the actual costs prove
     to be higher to n the estimate we would wish tc have the opportunity of making
     submission* tc the Authority, and ask that the normal vetting procedures (;e the scrutiny by
           independent costs draftsman) take place to assess whether the work in ail the

              circumstances was reasonable. This process of course applies to the previous resolutions of
              the Authority, and once agsin we make clear our willingness to co-operate as required in
              any assessment of the work done on behalf of the defendants and the indemnities given by
              the Authority.

              Counters fees

              Wc arc aware of the estimate provided by Walker Morris and, «3 our Leading Counsel is
              presently out of the country, we are not in s position to provide a more specific estimate, ft
              may he that our Counsel will be able to provide &different (ie lowar} estimate but for the
              present we ask the Authority to consider our projected Counsel’s fees to be in line with the
              Walker Morris estimate.

              Witnesses

             At the present time no final decisions have been taken as to whether any other witnesses are
             to he callcd on behalf of the defence, although an indication was made in open court before
             the Learned Judge that it is not presently intended to call expert witnesses. This is an aspect
             we wish to discuss urgently with Counsel and it may be that we need to instruct experts for
             further advice a«d indeed call that evidence at trial. It is difficult to estimate the cost of this
             but if an expert were to report, and then to give evidence, the likely costs will be £5,000*
             £i 0,000 including VAT. We would of course give mors specific estimates if this course
             were followed and an expert engaged.

             Terms o f payment

             We do echo Walker Morris’s concern about the considerable delay in receiving payment for
             work carried out on behalf of the defendants, which has been the subject o f Authority
             resolutions

             For the record, w; have; received only 50% of our eosts and Counsel's fees as submitted ror
             relevant work up until January 1999 and nothing further. We understand Messrs Gamrts
             stT.ii wish to resolve matters with Counsel's cierk. Tnc delay in this regard is very difficult
             to sccrpt.

             In regard to work conducted since that time, independent costs consultants have visited our
             ofiiee m d reviewed the files. The Authority is o f course well aware that considerable
             amounts of money arc involved, and we also ask the Authority to enquire with all urgency
             to ensure that early payment of the expenses and disbursements reasonably incurred is
             made..

             W<* support the comments made by Walker Morris in regard tc future billing, and reiterate
             that chese^proposals are made on the understanding that our files of work will be made
             available for independent scrutiny immediately upon submission of any bil ls.

             Wc hope the above information assists the Authority in considering the request for
             indemnity, but in the event that any farther information is required, we will be happy to

              Dear Sirs

              SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICY AUTHORITY

              Following our recent telephone conversation I am writing to confirm that the payments made
              (or due to be made) to Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray in respect of legal action regarding the
              Hillsborough Stadium disaster are free of tax.

              I would point out that the Revenue does not accept that this sets a precedent. The decision
              regarding these two former police officers is based upon the facts specific to their case.

              I hope the above is satisfactory for your purposes.

              Yours faithfully

Dear Sir



Adlington v Murray: Adlinuton v Duckenfield


1.    1 am the prosecutor in the above case, in which the defendants are charged before the
       Leeds Magistrates Court with serious offences arising out o f the disaster at the
       Hillsborough Football Ground in April 1989. [ write on the advice o f leading counsel,
       as solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group to express concern about the
       decision to fund the defence o f these two men. As you know, the defendants were
       senior police officers-on duty at the ground when the disaster occurred. Both are
       charged with manslaughter o f two representative victims, and with misfeasance. Mr
       Duckenfield is also charged with attempting to pervert the course o f justice.

2.    It has recently been admitted publicly by Mr Ian Daines, Assistant Chief Constable,
       that the South Yorkshire Police Authority has agreed to fund the defence o f these two
       men. We have suspected this for some time. The purpose o f this letter is to argue that
       the decision to provide finance appears to have been made irrationally and unlawfully.

3.    We refer to the following documents, all o f which are in your possession.

     G.      The letter o f 25'1' September 1998 from Maureen Oades to me.
     H.      Minute 86 o f the South Yorkshire Police Authority Meeting o f 30th October
              1098.
     I.      The South Yorkshire Police Authority Scheme o f Delegation.
     J.      A document headed “Standing Orders. Interpretation. Issued January 1996"
             on the headed paper of the South Yorkshire Police Authority.

4.   The Home Office Circular No 77/87, suggests that, in the case o f a private
     prosecution, where a police officer has been acquitted and has not been awarded all his
     costs, the police authority may make up the difference. It also suggests that, in the
     case o f a private prosecution, the authority should provide or fund legal advice and/or
     representation if the authority is “satisfied" that the officer has acted “in good faith”
     and has exercised his judgment “reasonably” .

5.   The 1lome Office Circular o f 17lh February 1998, 4/1998, replaces with immediate
     effect the 1987 circular, and suggests that under the very wide terms o f section 111(1)
     o f the Local Government Act 1072, “it could be argued” that payment o f money to
     “officers (either former or serving) involved in criminal proceedings would in some
     way facilitate or be conducive to a police authority’s broad functions.” The Circular
     emphasises that a police authority must take its own advice. It is noticeable that the
     “guidance” has been prepared after consultation with “ACPO”, the Superintendents
     Association, the Police Federation, and the Association o f Police Authorities; it does
     not purport to be an independent legal opinion.

6.   This Circular seems to have coincided almost exactly with the report o f the “Scrutiny”
     o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in February o f this year. I note that on 27lh February this
     year, your authority agreed to authorise the Clerk and Treasurer to consider
     applications from officers, serving or retired, for financial assistance in relation to
     possible private prosecutions arising out o f the “Scrutiny” .

7.   For a reason which is not clear, the Resolution was taken under the replaced 1987
     Circular. There is therefore no lawful authority to validate the decision taken on that
     day. The assertion, recorded in the minutes, that the members o f the Authority
     “remain o f the opinion that the officers acted in good faith” is extraordinary. The
     Enquiry o f Lord Justice Taylor o f 1989 found that there had been negligence, and
     blamed the two defendants (among other police officers). 1 he failure o f these two to
     seal off the tunnel to the central pens at the Leppings Lane end o f the ground was a
     “blunder o f the first magnitude”, and the immediate cause of death. The then Chief
     Constable of South Yorkshire Police, uneqiiivocably accepted these findings.

8.   Further. Lord Taylor found, at page 16, paragraph 98 o f his Interim Report that Mr
     Duckenfield misied Graham Kelly and Glen Kirton o f the FA and Graham Mackrell of


                                             -2 -
Sheffield Wednesday, at a time when h,e knew there were fatalities (and that there
would therefore be an inquest and no doubt other formal inquiries). Duckenfield
indicated that a gate had been forced and there had been an inrush o f supporters, and
pointed out to them the fate allegedly forced on the screen.

In 1998, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith upheld these findings after his “ Scrutiny”, referring
scathingly to Duckenfield's “disgraceful lie” .

In July 1991, the Police Complaints Authority directed that charges o f neglect o f duty
be preferred against both men. These charges were never determined because the
Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire retired Mr Duckenfield on “health grounds”, and
it was thought to be unfair to try Mr Murray,

It is impossible in the light o f this history to understand how your authority could have
been satisfied in February 1998 that “the officers had acted in good faith” ; and also
impossible to understand how the other condition in the 1987 Circular, namely, that
the officers had exercised their judgment reasonably, could be thought to have been
satisfied. The minutes show that this condition was not even considered.

  ( irciilar   ....... -

The 1998 Circular was not applied^ lf.it had been, it would have become clear in my
view that its terms were not met, and that there was no lawful authority for the
provision o f tax-pavers' money in this way to fund the defence in this case. There is
no statutoi-y authority. There is a limited power in relation to civil proceedings to pay
damages and costs; but no power even in civil proceedings to fund an action brought
against an individual officer. Section 88 o f the Police Act 1996 deals with “Liability
for wrongful acts o f constables” , and allows for the provision c f costs incurred and not
recovered

Parliament has not provided for the payments o f any fines incurred by constables; or
for reimbursement o f costs incurred and not recovered. To have done so would have
been surprising, since criminal liability is individual and personal. You will note that
the Circular indicated at the highest that “it could be argued” that to allow the payment
to be made to officers, (either former or retired) involved in criminal proceedings
would “in some way facilitate or be conducive to a police authority's broad functions.
For example, failure to provide financial assistance couid adversely affect the morale of
the force if officers had to meet their costs after acquittal.”

This is legal nonsense. The case law indicates that section 111(1) o f the 1972 Act
cannot be used iii this way. The practice in relation to costs incurred by an acquitted
person is set out in the Practice Direction (Costs in Criminal Proceedings) 93 Cr.
App.R.8 which provides that a person acquitted after trial on indictment should
normally have his costs paid out o f central funds except where the defendant has
brought suspicion upon himself and has misled the prosecution into thinking the case
against him is stronger than it is; or where he has been acquitted on a meritless
technicality. How can it be said that police morale would suffer if the officers o f a
        force heard that one o f its members had been refused its costs on one o f the reasonable
        grounds set out in this direction?


15.     In any event the South Yorkshire Police Authority seems to have gone way beyond
         this highly dubious guidance in the 1998 Circular and authorised, in February 1998,
         any financial assistance to be given by the Clerk and Treasurer in respect o f
         applications from serving or retired officers for potential and future criminal
         proceedings, in which, o f course, a defendant could be convicted. (Is counsel
         instructed on this basis able to advise that a defendant plead guilty?).



/ V /egut ion   and Exclusion of the public

I(>.    Maureen Cades' letter to me o f 25"’ September 1998 says that the public were
        excluded from that pail o f the meeting when this matter was dealt with as it was a
        matter relating to “any action taken in connection with the prevention, investigation or
        prosecution o f any crime.” It seems to have been the basis for granting the financial
        assistance that there was no crime at all, and that the officers had acted in good faith.
        In any event it is submitted that paragraph 14 o f Schedule 12A to the Local
        Government Act 1972, refers to prosecutions by South Yorkshire Police and not by a
        private prosecutor against two former police officers.

17.      Furthermore, 1 do not understand how such a decision, even if it could be lawfully
        made, could be delegated to the Clerk and Treasurer. The Authority resolution o f 27
        February 1908 purports to delegate, absolutely, the decision making process to the
        "Clerk and Treasurer" who is one and the same person. The report presented to the
        Authority on .>0lh October was a joint report of the Clerk and Treasurer and the Chief
        Constable. 1 understand that the Clerk and Treasurer is not a Solicitor. It is implicit in
        your standing order 5.2.5, that any consideration o f applications for financial assistance
        for legal proceedings ought to be undertaken by a person who is legally qualified and
        would thus understand the danger of granting open-ended financial provision.

Some features o f the current criminal proceedings

18.     You also suggest in that letter that this delegation “was not viewed as a delegation
        which would extend beyond six months” . This may have been because Mr Daines,
        Assistant Chief Constable o f the South Yorkshire Police, publicly asserted earlier this
        year that he believed that any private prosecutions would “fall at the first hurdle". Did
        he repeat this at the meeting o f 2 T,h February? We do not know what applications have
        been made by Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield, but we assume, for reasons that appear
        below, that authority has been given for any judicial review proceedings o f the CPS
        decision not to discontinue the case, and for leading and junior counsel to appear at
        old style committal proceedings, as well as at trial.

19.     On 18lh December 1998, the Crown Prosecution Service, after five months o f careful
        study, rejected the applications o f the defendants to take over and discontinue the


                                                -4 -
       prosecutions. It is clear that the criminal proceedings are now likely to be protracted,
       complex and very expensive.




20.    The prosecutions are straightforward. We enclose for your guidance a copy o f the
        informations presented to the Leeds Magistrates Court last July on the basis o f which
        the summonses were issued. You will see that the allegations are based upon the
        findings o f the Taylor Enquiry in 1989, supported by evidence that has come to the
        Family Support Group in 1997-98. Negligence has been admitted again and again by
        the Chief Constable in court proceedings. It has never been disputed that the acts
        alleged against the defendants were the acts o f negligence that caused the deaths o f the
        96 people.

21.    Before the decision o f the Crown Prosecution Service was announced on 18'1'
       December, the solicitor for Mr Murray indicated that it was highly likely that an
       adverse decision o f the CPS would be challenged by judicial review proceedings. At
       the hearing o f the case before the Leeds Magistrates Court on 2 1st December, it was
       made clear by leading and junior counsel for Mr Murray, in the presence o f his
       solicitor. Mi Manning, and by junior counsel for Mr Duckenfield, that a decision had
       already been made to seek judicial review o f the CPS decision. The magistrate was
       told this by counsel for the defendants when he was dealing with the questions o f
       timetable and voluntary disclosure o f documents.

22.    Howevei, it was also made clear, although a concluded decision had been made to
       apply for judicial review, that the defendants had asked the CPS for their “reasons”;
       alternatively, their “policy" behind the decision, and that those reasons or policy might
       be received by 2 !lh December.

2.i.   No legally-aided lawyers could proceed in this way. Professional obligations exist
       which require that a lawyer must assess the prospects o f success before committing
       hard-pressed public funds to an expensive application for judicial review. I am advised
       by leading counsel that the prospccts o f quashing the CPS decision in such proceedings
       are small on the following, among other, grounds. The CPS have told us all what
       criteria they were applying; the defendants argued that the CPS were in a good
       position to assess the public interest involved in the prosecution; the CPS, Police
       Complaints Authority and Coroner were all misled by a cover-up by ihe South
       Yorkshire police, the magnitude o f which has become apparent only after the Home
       Office ordered the release o f documents this year; and the defendants have alternative
       remedies in the Magistrates' court.

24.    The fact that the court was assured that applications for judicial review would be made
       suggests that the South Yorkshire Police Authority has already agreed, before the CPS
       decision, to fund these applications, irrespective o f their merits. Counsel would not
       have told the court that the applications would be made, if funding was not in place.
       Neither would they have told counsel for South Yorkshire Police o f their decision to
       apply to the High Court; they knew that the fact o f impending applications was


                                               -5-
        material to decisions that the South Yorkshire police and the CPS were making that
        day about voluntary disclosure to the prosecution o f documents in their possession. It
        is clear that both those bodies decided to defer any decision on voluntary disclosure
        because o f the assurance from counsel that judicial review applications would be
        lodged (“in the first two weeks o f January” ) on behalf o f both defendants.


25.     The prosecution and the Court have also been told that both defendants have estimated
        that four weeks at least will be needed at committal proceedings. The court has set
        aside four weeks beginning 19,h April 1999, and the time was chose to accord with the
        convenience o f leading counsel for the defence. The court has been told that two
        leading counsel will appear, one for each defendant. No doubt two juniors will also
        appear, and two solicitors. Leading counsel for Mr Murray has indicated that there
        will also be an abuse o f process application to the magistrate to stay the proceedings.
        He intends to argue that this should be heard on a different occasion from the
        committal, and before it. I suspect that the defendants will seek leave to move for
        judicial review o f any adverse decision upon this issue. This is hardly surprising as
        your Authority does not appear to have placed any restriction as to the amount or
        duration of the financial assistance to the defendants.

26.     1 am advised by leading counsel that the prosecution has a strong prima facie case on
         the charges alleged; and that an abuse o f process application is likely to fail. We have
         a mass o f evidence in our possession which has come to us in the last year, indicating
         that the South Yorkshire Police force has covered up facts which are embarrassing as
         to the nature and extent o f its admitted negligence, and that the CPS, Coroner and
         Police Complaints Authority, inter alia, were misled when they were pursuing their
         various enquiries between 1989 and 1992. I shall willingly help you further about this
        on request.
JO




 7      O f course, the trial o f this matter could take many months. From ail these facts, you
        will see that ihe exposure o f the South Yorkshire taxpayer (in relation to its own costs,
        let alone ours) is o f the order o f millions o f pounds. I should make it clear that neither
        1 nor the Hillsborough Family Support Group, on whose behalf I act, wish in any way
        to deprive either defendant o f the means to conduct a proper defence to these charges.
        They should surely apply, like anyone else, for legal aid if they are unable to fund the
        costs o f the defence themselves. In that event they would be subject to the usual
        restraints and disciplines o f the legal aid system. I believe that the defence, with access
        to pubiic funds from your authority, are seeking at present to inflict unnecessary
        expenses upon us by recourse to every possible type o f legal hearing, in the knowledge
        that we do not have such access, and are instead dependent on private donations and
        fund-raising events. Neither defendant lives in South Yorkshire, but the South
        Yorkshire Police has a strong interest o f its own in the discharge or acquittal o f these
        defendants.

Dear Member,

Ad!in<iton v Murray: Adiineton v Pucker-Held



       I am the prosecutor in this case, and the solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Supper
       Group (“HFSG” ), an association whose members are families o f the victims of the
       Hillsborough disaster o f April 19S9. The prosecutions w ere commenced in the Lee
       Magistrates Court in July 199S. I am writing to you about the decision taken pursuz,
       to the Resolution o f your authority o f February 199S to fund the defence of these tv-,
       former senior officers in these criminal proceedings. M uch o f the contents of th;s
       letter is based upon submissions and facts that have been supplied by the H jFSG to t'r
       Crown Prosecution Service on the advice of leading counsel, who has also advisee e
       the present funding issue. I understand that the subject m atter o f last February’s
       Resolution, and other discussions and decisions later in the year, are to be considers
       at your meeting o f S;h January 1999. Attached to this letter is a bundle o f document,
       to which I shall refer in this letter.

       A n n ex A is a copy o f a letter that I sent to Mr W. J. Wilkinson, Clerk and Treasurer
       on 22nd December, setting out objections in law to the grant o f the funding, and to t
       way in which decisions w erejaken. That letter may conveniently be read first. At
       A n n e x B are copies o f earlier correspondence between Miss Oades and myself ar.c t
       two circulars from the H om e Office in relation to these issues, to which reference w
       made in Ati/iex A.

       You will appreciate that my argument is that decisions to grant funding pursuant to
       Resolution last February were unlawful, irrational and proceduraily improper, and in
       a funner such decision would now be unlawful in any event.

i m facts o f the case; Manslaughter cmd Misfeasance

            It is necessary to set these cut, because the South Yorkshire Police Authority
            (“ SYPA”) is recorded as having resolved on 2S’~ February 1998, less than two weeks
            after publication o f the report o? the “Scrutiny5’ conducted by Lord Justice Stuart-
            Smhh,

                    “That in the light o f the findings of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s inquiry and his
                    comments on the outcome, members do not believe that there is any evidence
                    to cause them to reconsider the Authority’s previous view, and remain of the
                    opinion that the officers acted in good faith”.
\r




            Lord Justice Stuart-Smith reinforced the findings of Lord Taylor, whose original
>




            interim report was published in .August 1939. Home Qfnce guidance requires, of
            course, that you have regard to the particular circumstances o f the case, although, this
            does not seem to have been recognised by the Resolution of last February, when
            decisions were made in principle, before it was known who if anyone was going to be
            prosecuted, and, more importantly, for what offences.
\o




            It is clear from the minutes o f the SYPA. meeting of last February, part oiAnm'x 3,
            that Mr Daines made a presentation to the meeting, and on that factual basis the
            .Authority made its decision. Members of the SYPA ought therefore to be aware of the
            attitude o f the South Yorkshire police, as exoressed to the Leeds District Magistrates
            Court on 2 1!*‘December 1998 in connection with an application by the prosecution that
            the South Yorkshire force should disclose documents in its possession. Counsel. Ms
            Louise Yartv«/ 5 instructed bv
                                         J Hammond Suddards said:3




                    “South Yorkshire Police are not privy to the nature of this prosecution and the
                    issues within it and therefore are not able to say or agree what is or is not
                    relevant.”

            So that the Authority can inform itself of the issues with greater confidence, and from
            an Informed source, ! attach for guidance a summary of the evidence on the charges of
            manslaughter and misfeasance charges as A nnex C, and a copy of the relevant parts of
1-m




            the Taylor P.eport as A n n ex D. The charges are soundly based In law and fact.

      he attitude o f the South Yorkshire Police to the allegation o f negligence

            In an offence in this class o f involuntary manslaughter, according to the 1995 House of
            Lords decision in R v .Adomako. the prosecution-must prove: (a) a duty of care; (b) -
            breach of that duty; (c) that that breach was a substantial cause of death; (c) “The
            essence o f the matter which is supremely a jury question, is whether having regard to
            the risk of death involved the conduct of the defendant was so bad in all the
            circumstances as to amount in. their judgment to a criminal act or omission.” per Lord
            Mackay LC [ 1995] 1 A .C .1 S7E.

      1     It is submitted that all elements but the last have never been seriously disputed. The

                                                     n

                                      V}
       remaining element is for the jury. Lord Taylor found, and it is inherent in the
       acceptance of liability by South Yorkshire police in the various negligence cases, that
       the police were under a cut}' of care, and that there was a breach o f that cut]/,
       causative c? death. See also Frost v. Chief Constable of the South Y crkshj-s Police
       [1597] 1 Aii.E.R. 540, 544b-c, in the High Court action brought by police officers at
       the ground, per P.ose U ; ■

               “The Immediate cause of the disaster was a senior officer’s decision to open
               the outer gate without cutting off access to the pens. Liability for the deaths
               and injuries o f those spectators has been admitted by the three defendants, the
               first of v v h O iii 13 the Plantin's Chief Constable.”

       Constable o f the South Yorkshire Pciicel (December 199S)

10     The Taylor reoort was accepted by the Chief Constable of Soutn Yorkshire m August
       1939; and after the Scrutiny, 2vlr PJchard "Weils accented that 2vlr Duci-1emie!o nad oeer.
       rightly blamed as negligent. On Yorkshire Television’s “Camera” on 18" reoruary
       1998 this exchange took place;

                Wells;          “David Duckenfield has been blamed, by Lord Justice Taylor.
                                 The South Yorkshire police are culpable, in the sense of, that
                                 they lost senior officer control that day. W e’ve said that
                                 repeatedly.”

11      The Stuart-Smith reoort, it should be counted out, rejected claims made on benau or
        the HFSG that there was important new evidence. However, it supported the original
        Taylor findings stronulv, and emphasised the criticisms of the police that had been
        made. Cooies o f relevant pans of the report will be made available on request. It must
        be cDDreciated that the charges brought by the HFSG do not m any way ccnira-aict tne
        Stuart-Smith report. They are based upon the original findings o f the Taylor report as
        supported by the Stuart-Smith report. For this reason, it is puzzling to read that or.
        27“ February 1998, the SYPA relied on the Stuart-Smith findings to confirm a view
        previously held that the officers h?.d behaved in good faith. As set out below, Lord
        Justice Stuart-Smith referred in withering terms to Duckenfield’s “disgraceful he"’.

Attempting to p e n :erf the course o f justice

12      It is important to set out the extent of the evidence m support of this charge, because it
        will not be apparent from previous Reports and documents on'the case. The charge
        against Mr Duckenfield is that he lied to a number o f people, either himself or through




                                 V
                                  v;
       others, in the hour after the disaster, in a careful and calculating way, as the bodies
       were being carried away from the £e!d and terraces.-He did so to influence falsely the
       persons or courts who would investigate the circumstances of the disaster. He alleged
       that the supporters had burst the gates opened, whereas he had himself, after
       consideration, ordered that they be opened. He failed to correct this lie after the event,
       and continued, together with many senior officers of the South Yorkshire police, to
       allow the lie to have effect for several weeks. The evidence in support o f this charae is'
       summarised at Annex E.

Trie decision of the Crovm Prosecution Service

13.   At the beginning o f July 1S9S the solicitors for the defendants asked the Crown
      Prosecution Service to take over the prosecutions and discontinue them. The CPS is
      entitled in law to take over any prosecution begun by a private individual, and it will
       discontinue any prosecution of which it has the conduct (Including those which it has
      taken over) if there is clearly no evidence, or if there are public interest factors such as
      ill-health, unacceptable delay, or if the prosecution is likely to damage the interests of
      justice.

14    The CPS conducted a most painstaking and professional review over a period of nearly
       six months, before deciding on IS* December 1993 that they would not take over and
       discontinue the case. The ability o f the CPS to make an Informed and balanced
      decision was recognised by Winkworth Sherwood for 2vir Duckenfield, when they
      wrote to the CPS on 9* October 199S in these terms;

              “It is submitted on behalf of Mr Duckenfield that the power o f the Director is
              far wider than a mere assessment o f the evidence, and embraces a consideration
              of the wider public interest. The Dlrector is well placed to assess where the
              public interest lies having had involvement in the case over a period of nine
              years and having seen the Taylor report, the Stuart-Smith report, the coroner’s
              verdict, the judgement o f the Divisional Court and the review of evidence, and
              the advice of leading counsel obtained when the Director made the decision to
              prosecute.”

15    The representations put forward by the prosecution included the above assertions
      about the strength o f the evidence. Contrary arguments were put forward by the
      defendants, but were obviously rejected. It is very doubifui that the facts were se: cut
      in detail before the SYPA last February, or indeed thereafter. Mr Daines wrote in a
      published article last spring that “It is hard to imagine a private prosecution getting
      past the first hurdle.” Presumably he ventured a similar opinion to the SYPA in
      February 1998, but was not aware of the full facts about the prosecution, nor the
      public interest factors set out below, the existence of which has allowed the
      prosecution to clear the first hurdle ?nd face the next hurdles with confidence.

Wider public interest considerations.

15    The SYPA will no doubt wish, in accordance with paragraph 6 of the Circular

                                                4
      HOC/199S, to “decide in the particular circumstances o f the case,zvA on the basis
      of legal advice, whether to make financial assistance available to officers m criminal
      proceedings.” (Emphasis added.) It is obviously doubtful that such detailed
      consideration was given on 27* February 1998, but the SYPA, in consicenng whether
      to fund the defence in this case, might wish to be aware of the wider public interests
      matters that were put to the CPS before the review was decided in the prosecution’s
      favour. It may also wish to consider whether the advice given by the South Yorkshire '
      police themselves is dispassionate and detached.

17 . It was argued by the prosecution to the CPS that reliance could not be placed on
     previous inquiries that had exculpated the defendants, such as the coroner’s inquest,
     which had returned verdicts o f accidental death, and the DPP’s decision in 1990 not to
     bring prosecutions. The prosecution argued that evidence has been available to the
     HFSG since the publication o f the Stuart-Smith report in February 199S winch showed
     that the previous inquiries had been misled. These wider considerations, are set out in
     A nnex F, and documents referred to therein at A nnex G and A nnex H. They show
     the South Yorkshire police has maintained a tight and unjustified control of the
     paperwork; that previous investigations were misled; and that the proclaimed
     independence of the West Midlands police was false. That force was in reality acting
     as an agent o f the South Yorkshire police, a force which put the protection of its own
     interests at all time before the public interest.

The interest of the prosecution in thefunding issue

IS    I have already set out ip. Annex A that the KFSG has no wish to deny the defence
       access to proper legal representation. I drew attention in that letter to the fact that the
       defence seemed able to call upon the SYPA for unqualified and indefinite funding. I
       should inform you that I have had since then received written confirmation that Mr
       Ivlurray’s lawyers are indeed going to apply for judicial review, whatever the reasons
       of the CPS. I have presumed that this decision to apply for judicial review was made
       pursuant to funding arrangements made pursuant to the Resolution of the SYPA last
       February. It is not reasonable-.?© believe that that firm decision was made in the mere
       hope that the SYPA would agree to fund it on S* "January next.

19    Another concern is the closeness c f the connection between the defence and those who
      hold the archive in the case. At three court hearings at the Leeds Magistrates Court
      (24* August, 7~~ December and 2 l3t December) the lawyers for the defence have
      refused to support the prosecution in calling for the disclosure of papers held in the
      case by the South Yorkshire Police. I am in no doubt that this is because they believe,
      with every good, reason, that the archive will assist the prosecution more than the
      defence. However, it is' clear that it will be difficult for the defence in this case to ask
      for the disclosure o f information which is embarrassing to the South Yorkshire police:
      the police argued successfully last year that the SYPA should fund that defence.

20    From the outside it looks as if a decision has been made to close ranks. It would be
       usual in decisions such as this to inauire what financial consequences would flow to
       the authority if funding were not granted. If would have been quite wrong for
       agreement .to have been made on the basis that funding by the SYPA was the best way
       to ensure that the South Yorkshire force would not face further civil actions.

21      Winkworth and Sherwood, who represent Mr Duckenfield, represented the South
        Yorkshire Police in the ‘'Scrutiny” last year. It is not known whether they, or
        Hammond Suddards advised the SYPA last February, upon this funding question.
        Generous funding arrangements have been sought and granted in an apparent attempt
        to exhaust the resources o f the prosecution, who do not have access to legal aid, and
        who have not applied for funding to the SYPA. If the prosecution did so apply, asking
        for funding to maintain the morale of the force, on the ground that junior officers
        would 1-mow that the negligent actions o f the senior officers of the force would not be
       .protected from a proper criminal inquiry', its claim would surely be more attractive than
        the present claim to fund the defence.

22    So far, the substantial decision to authorise the funding in the two Individual cases has
       been taken in private. Both the defence and the SYPA has an interest in keeping as
       much of the archive private as possible. The Interest of the public and the prosecution
       is different. The force is sitting on material'that is deeply discreditable to the integrity
       of the previous investigations. That is why it has refused to disclose it to the
       prosecution, and why it now seeks to insist or. the most demanding conditions.

Thu alternative o f legal eld feruling

23    It is submitted that there is no reason why the South Yorkshire taxpayers should
       provide such potentially large and apparently unlimited funds to defend people who are
       entitled, like every' other citizen, subject to means, to the provision of legal aid. Those
       taxpayers would surely be disturbed if they were given full information about this.
       The lawyers that would be instructed under legal aid would be subject to the ususal
       constraints and disciplines o f the scheme, but would at least be able to give
       independent advice; even, if appropriate, to plead guilty. There can be no doubt that
       the legal aid fund would be less profligate with its public money than it appears the
       SYPA has decided to be. The legal aid authorities would certainly have demanded
       down payments by way o f contributions from the'defendants. They would have
       recuired a certification by the defendants’ lawyers that there were solid prospects of
       success for a judicial review, before authorising expenditure.

24    No doubt you will wish, to .show a copy o f this letter and the enclosures to your
      lawyers and to the police. O f course, I have no objection, and would encourage you to
      ask them to deal with the matters I have set out In detail, and for which evidential
      references have been given. A good test of the strength of the arguments I have
      presented is whether the police will be-able-to'answer them. Since millions of pounds
      are potentially at stake, a proper and informed public debate can be expected, even if
      you have to postpone your hearing on 8thJanuary. Members of the HFSG will wish to

                                                  OUTLINE SUBM ISSIONS

            1. DECISION OF DIVISIONAL COURT

            The Court decided that a Police Authority has power '‘....but subject to ordinary Law
            principles, to provide financial assistance to police officers and former police officers in
            respect o f their costs and expenses incurred in relation to private prosecutions brought against
            them and judicial review proceedings in which they participate.” The court refused to make
            the decision specific to the two defendants. Furthermore, whilst clarifying the power to fund,
            the court declined to state when that power should be exercised, that is, whether it should be
            exercised at the start o f proceedings, during them or on their conclusion.

            The Court also refused to set out matters which the Authority should consider or disregard in
            determining whether or not it should provide financial assistance td officers. Indeed, to quote
            Lord Justice Laws: “It is important that the declaration should not indicate any view taken by
            the court, for the court has none, as to whether the financing should actually be provided.”

            2. PREVIOUS SUBMISSIONS BY HFSG

            HFSG continues to rely on the written submissions forwarded to the Authority on 22nd
            December 1998 and 5th January 1999 with the exception o f those which touch upon the
            legality o f the funding. The submissions relating to the fourth charge against Mr Duckenfield,
            (attempting to pervert the course o f justice) are also irrelevant at this stage as the DPP has
            discontinued that charge.

            In particular, if the Authority decides that it has power to grant funding prior to any costs
            being incurred, the HSFG relies upon Annex C o f its submissions of 5lh January (copy
            appended). Annex C contains a summary o f the evidence on the charges o f manslaughter and
            misfeasance.

            3 RELEVANT MATTERS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION

            i)           As a primary submission HFSG strongly disagree with the Chief Constable’s
                         contention that the defendants should have all their costs paid “up front”. Parliament
                         could not have intended to provide for a system which is so open to abuse and
                         manipulation. The previous conduct o f the defendants and their lawyers gives rise to
                         serious concern. In the Judicial Review proceedings the Chief Clerk to South Sefton
                         Magistrates provided affidavit evidence. In his affidavit he stated:-

                         “The defendants’ solicitors each submitted their claims for costs in September 1998. I
                         was extremely surprised at the level o f costs which were being claimed, particularly in
                         view o f the fact that neither o f the defendants or their solicitors had actually appeared
                         before the court in relation to this matter'’.

                         Any decision to pay costs “up front” would offend against public policy.

            ii)          Availability .of legal aid or .alternative sources o f funding

                         The question o f the extent and scale o f the supply o f money from the public revenue
                         for legal proceedings is a public and controversial issue. Detailed and highly regulated
                         provision is made by the Legal Aid Act. A proposal to give police officers a more
                         expensive and privileged facility at public expense than is available to others would be
                         deeply contentious and socially divisive.

                         The legal aid scheme is available to a defendant but not to a prosecutor. Section 1 of
                         the Legal Aid Act 1988 declares that its purpose is to establish a framework for the
                         provision o f advice, assistance, and representation which is publicly funded with a view
                         to helping persons who might otherwise be unable to obtain the same on account o f
                         their means. According to Judicial Statistics for 1998, almost everyone who applies
                         for legal aid for criminal proceedings is awarded it. If a defendant is ordered to make a
                         contribution, the Court can remit such an order or order that any contribution should
                         be repaid where there has been an acquittal.

                         In addition, if press reports are correct, it would appear that the Superintendents’
                         Association are prepared to consider funding the defendants if approached. The
                         Association certainly contributed to their legal costs in the recent Judicial Review
                         proceedings.

            iii)         Whether the applicant for financial support has yet been found guilty or acquitted. A
                         police authority’s funds should not be paid to an officer who is said to be criminally
                         liable in his personal capacity. An officer who is later acquitted should receive his
                         costs from central funds or from the private prosecutor. An officer who is later
                         convicted should not be funded by the Police Authority.

            iv)          The extent to which financial support from the Authority, during the course o f
                         proceedings might preclude an award o f costs in those proceedings in favour o f the
                         individual'-so supported. (It is clear from the assistance presently sought by the
                         defendants that the Clerk to South Sefton Justices has not yet decided whether the
                         defendants costs can be met from central funds.)

            v)           The extent o f financial support previously granted to the defendants. During the
                         Judicial Review proceedings, HFSG became aware for the first time that both
                         defendants had their legal costs paid by the Authority throughout the 80 day inquest.
                         Both had separate legal representation. The costs o f this must have been quite
                         staggering, Families paid £3,500 each for block representation at the inquest. Further,
                         the amount expended to date in the criminal proceedings must be quite considerable.
                         It is clear that open ended funding encourages delaying tactics and costmongering.

            vi)          responsibility to serving officers in South Yorkshire Police not to deplete the already
                          overstretched resources of the Police Authority..

            vii)         South Yorkshire Police, presumably with the support o f the Authority has always
                         accepted that the deaths o f the 96 victims were caused by negligence.

                                                               Page 2 o f 3
8/05 '99 12:27    01512361936                  HFSG                  -->01132079001                       P g . 04




      viii)   South Yorkshire Police have accepted, or at least have never challenged, the findings
              o f Lord Tayior that the negligence o f which the defendants are accused was “a blunder
              o f the first magnitude” and an immediate cause of death.

      ix)     The negligence of which the defendants are accused cannot on any view of the facts be
              attributed to a “ split-second decision”.

      x)      The PCA directed in July 1991 that the defendants should face disciplinary charges o f
              neglect o f duty. Mr Duckenfield also faced a charge o f discreditable conduct. (At that
              time, M r Duckenfield had been suspended from duty for two years.) Two weeks after
              the PCA direction, Mr Duckenfield, though suspended, went on “ sick leave” . The
              Chief Constable retired him from the force on “medical grounds” in November 1991.
              The charge against him, therefore, lapsed. In January 1992 it was then considered
              unfair to proceed against M r Murray. Next year, M r Murray, too retired from the
              force on “health grounds".

       xi)    The interests o f the defendants and the Chief Constable may be different in this case.
              It is in the interests o f justice that the defendants are represented by lawyers who are
              not paid for by a police authority whose Chief Constable has a powerful interest in
              maintaining exclusive control over so many documents o f relevance to the criminal
              case. Justice must be seen to be done.

       xii)   The DPP has decided that there is a case to answer. The Divisional Court has refused
              to overturn that decision. This surely is an indication o f the strength of the case
              against the defendants and undermines previous decisions not to prosecute.

       4. FUTURE CONDUCT OF PROCEEDINGS

       The Defendants are, o f course, entitled to legal representation and HFSG has no wish to deny
       them access to proper legal representation. If the Authority does decide to fund them, then
       strict conditions should be attached to the funding to ensure value for money. Checks and
       balances have to be imposed. Regular reviews should be undertaken by the members o f the
       Authority themselves.

                                                      M anslaughter and M isfeasance



                     1       David Duckenneld and Bernard Murray, then respectively a Chief Superintendent and
                             a Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police Force, were on duty in the controi box
                             at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15th April 1989. when a semi-final of the F.A.
                             cup was to be played between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs.
                             Attached are chapters I to 5, 9 to 11, and 16 o f the Taylor Report. The facts set out
                             therein form the basis o f the allegations against the two potential defendants. These
                             extracts from the Taylor report are attached as A n nex I).

                     2       Other sections o f the Taylor report make other criticisms of the police in genera!, and
                             o f other bodies.

                     3       Lord Taylor said at paragraph 265 o f his report;

                                      “The immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was
                                      the failure, when Gate C was opened, to cut off access to the central pens
                                      which were already overfall.”

                     4       The evidence o f forensic pathologists called at the mini inquests in 1990 was that in
                             almost all cases death resulted rapidly from unconsciousness that was caused by the
                             crushing that followed the inrush o f spectators, in full view o f the two men, following
                             the order to open the gates, and a failure to divert the incoming spectators from pens 3
                             and 4.

                     5       Mr Duckenfield was in overall charge, and primarily responsible for the decisions and
                             lack o f decisions which led to the crushing. M r Murray shares in this responsibility. He
                             knew the ground better. He had been in an important position o f responsibility at the
                             identical semi-final the year before, when the Liverpool supporters were also at the.
                             Leppings Lane end o f the ground. A similar concentration o f supporters in the pens 3
                             and 4 had occurred but crushing had" been avoided by the simple expedient of diverting
                             the incoming supporters from the tunnel which led to those overcrowded pens.

                     6       In 1989. M r Duckenfield was entitled to call on Mr Murray’s experience. M r Murray,
                              like Mr Duckenfield failed, in breach o f his duty, to take, demand or recommend the
                              obvious steps to avoid the obvious dangers.

                     7       The decision to open the gates without taking steps to divert the oncoming spectators
                             was, in the words o f Lord Taylor, a “blunder o f the first magnitude” and was an
                             immediate (and therefore substantial) cause o f death. The decision was taken by
                             Duckenfield. with the agreement or acquiescence o f Murray.

         8       The witness statements already provided to the defence provide cogent evidential
                 support for the manslaughter and misfeasance allegations, combined with admissions
                 o f fact made by each defendant in his various statements, and evidence to the Inquest
                 and the Taylor Inquiry. Many exhibits such as videos, photographs, plans etc,
                 gathered and prepared for the purposes o f the Taylor Inquiry by the West Midlands
                 Police, are not to hand because the South Yorkshire police have so far refused to hand
                 them over.

         Some features o f the prosecution evidence already served.

         9       In the course of, and after, the “Scrutiny” , many statements became available to the
                  HFSG which it had never seen before, because the South Yorkshire police controlled
                  the entire archive o f statements and exhibits. The statements o f 3 5 witnesses have
                  been served now on the defence, and show as follows. In. 19SS police officers diverted
                  spectators away from the tunnel leading to those pens, (eg Hilton). The unedited
                  statements o f the officers W hitt and Lang prove the same, and suggest that it had been
                  the practice o f senior officers to ensure that the tunnel was closed when the pens were
                  full, something that could be seen easily by Inspector White from the steps near the
                  Control Box. This police evidence was suppressed until 1998. (The question of
                  editing statements is discussed below.) In 19S9, when the gate was opened, a rush of
                  people carried spectators straight into the tunnel, and it was impossible to turn back
                  (Cook).

         10      There was no obvious alternative to the tunnel (Harvey, Murray. Fellowes, Southern.)
                 There was no diversion away from this tunnel (Odger, Murphy, Langley). Spectators
                 had to go wich the crowd, for fear of falling underfoot. (Edwards). Spectators were
                 carried by the surge o f people into the tunnel when Gate C was opened. (Anderson.
                 Burns, Campbell.) The centra! pens in the terraces were packed at 2.50 pm (Blayney,
                 Mullee). PC Guest said that at 2.40 it was not going to be possible to accommodate
                 the crowd outside the Leppings Lane entrance in those pens. P.C. Walpole says the
                 overcrowding was obvious at 2.55pm. P.C Brooks says the central pens were too full
                 at 2.50pm.

         The position o f the defendants

         11      Duckenfield'-and Murray were in the Control Box. They could see the central pens.
                 Closed circuit television gave them an even better view o f the pens. Five minutes after
                 Superintendent Marshall had asked for help to relieve possibly life-threatening pressure
                 at the turnstiles in Leppings Lane, Duckenfield, with the acquiescence and tacit
                 support o f Murray, finally ordered the gate to be opened without closing off access to
                 the already crowded pens. Thousands surged in: the deaths o f 96 people were the
                 immediate and direct consequence. Murray had been on duty at the semi-final in 1988
                 in the Control Box. He culpably failed in 1989 to give the proper and obvious advice.
                 Duckenfield, in Lord Taylor’s words, “froze” . Both defendants admit their presence in
                 the Control Box, and Duckenfield admits that he lied about matters shortly afterwards,
                 saying the Liverpool supporters broke open the gate. It is a travesty o f the case to
                 suggest that it concerns a “split-second decision.”

           12         The CCTV film, and footage taken by the BBC, photographs and other videos of the
                      circumstances, disclose full pens before the gate was opened, and a horrifying and
                      obvious overcrowding after the gates.opened. The BBC has provided the HFSG with
                      good quality footage o f the disaster and surrounding circumstances.

          Admissions made by D ttckenfield

           13         Duckenfidd does not dispute that he looked round the ground on Is' April 1989
                      (Taylor Inquiry, 24/5 p 116) in preparation for the match. He does not dispute that he
                      appreciated the problems o f tunnel and pens. He was aware o f the central tunnel, (p
                      118)

           14         He accepted that fans were likely to gravitate towards the central tunnel, if they liked
                      to watch the game from the back of the goal (24/5/89, p IT 9), and that the obvious,
                      way to the terracing was through the tunnel; anyone coming in would gravitate
                      towards the tunnel, whether or not he wanted to go directly behind the goal. .

           1-5        Duckenfield's defence, at first, was that crowd management and filling o f pens was not
                      a police responsibility but that o f the club (120), but later he said he did appreciate the
                      importance o f ensuring that there was no overcrowding in the pens. (124B). He said
                      that officers at the back, that is, in the concourse behind the tunnel, should know the
                      problems. Inspector White knew the location (127). Duckenfield’s own document
                      emphasised that “our job is to ensure the safety of spectators” (137)

           16         Duckenfield noticed by 2.30 that there was a concentration in pens 3 and 4 and asked
                      the spectators to move forward and spread along the terraces. (25/5 page 1213). In
                      performing his duties, he was acting on the “advice" o f Superintendent Murray (2SA),
                      About 2.44 pm it was becoming clear that they were not going to get all the crowd in
                      by 3 pm (33 A-B). Duckenfield appreciated that opening gates was “likely to cause
                      potential problems inside” (page 39).

           17         Duckenfield conceded that when the second request came to open the gates, that was
                      the time when he thought about where they would go. (4 IB). There was o f course
                      five minute between the first request and the command to open the gates. He htew
                      that it was p retty crow ded in central sections; and that the tunnel gave on to those the
                      centra! sections; that they would want to g et to positions as quickly as possible: and
                      that they w ould take the obvious, easiest route to terraces. (25th May; p 430-H ). He
                      did not then think o f the tunnel He m ight then have given instructions to close the
                      tunnel, hut he d id not because he did not think o f the risk.

           15         Duckenfield then conceded, however, that he had said in his statement “I watched the
                      Leppings Lane terraces intently for any developments as a result o f the gates opening.
                      (47D-E) “ I was concerned to see what the effects o f opening the gates and allowing
                      people into the ground would have.” (47E-F.) “There was a possibility o f
                      overcrowding everywhere.” (52G)

            19        Duckenfield accepted that “I made a mistake but in fact Other officers should have

                                                                 3
                                               HFSG                  ->01132079001                      Pg .   08

                 remedied that mistake by using their initiative.” (92B). He would have expected that
                 an inspector or individual officers would have raced to the tunnel and taken action.
                 (93 B). (O f course, only those in the Control Box had sight o f ail relevant pans of that
                 end o f the ground and the area behind the turnstiles).

        20       On 26"' May 1989, Duckenfield accepted that it was important to warn police officers
                 and stewards inside the ground that the gates were to be opened. Supt Murray took on
                 the responsibility o f trying to contact Lock of Sheffield Wednesday, (page 10-11). He
                 also told Lord Taylor that he knew when Gate A opened that a serial o f officers
                 formed a funnel to divert them from seeking to enter the stands, where entry was by
                 special ticket. There were no such arrangements for the tunnel. This important
                 evidence shows forethought about the consequences o f opening the gates, and made
                 the possibility o f crushing even more obvious.

        21       The prosecution will invite a court to conclude that these admissions show gross
                 negligence, causative o f death; and furthermore, they will submit that they disclose a
                 wanton and perhaps angry disregard for the safety of people in the pens, when other
                 people, whom Duckenfield regarded as o f the same ilk, were causing him a serious
                 problem outside the ground.

        22       If. alternatively, these facts suggest incompetence, and a very bad or crass attempt to
                  avoid an already dangerous situation, attention is drawn to R v. Bateman (1925) 10
                  Cr. App. R. 8, approved by the House o f Lords in R v. Adom ako, in which
                  incompetence in a person exercising specialised or expert functions was held capable
                  of amounting to gross negligence (in that case the defendant was a doctor)


        Evidence against M urray on M anslaughter and Misfeasance

        23       It is submitted that the responsibility o f Murray for manslaughter and misfeasance is if
                  anything greater than Duckenfield’s. The following extracts from his evidence to the
                  Taylor Inquiry and Inquest are relied on for the purposes o f the present review, as
                  evidence o f these two offences.

        24       Murray had occupied the same role in 1988 and 1939 and had written a report on the
                 match afterwards, in May 1988. He had taken a leading part in policing a Hillsborough
                 game between Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool in January 1989. (Taylor Inquiry.
                 3 1/5, p 63). ( His involvement was well summarised in cross-examination at lsf June
                 1989, page I, by M r Woodward: he had been involved in the 1988 semi-final; the
                 review o f the 1988 semi-final; and the planning and preparation for the 1989 semi­
                 final. A copy o f his review in May 1988 o f the 1988 game was read out at to him at the
                 Inquest (Day 67. page 140)).

        25       The pens were often filled up in accordance with directions from the Control Box.
                 Officers would direct fans down the tunnel. This did not apply to the semi-final,
                 however. No officers were briefed to keep a specific eye on the filling o f pens 3 and 4
                  15/4. (31/5, p 67). Neither Duckenfield nor Murray gave instructions at oral briefing.

                 Murray’s role was overall charge of the Control Room and adviser to Duckenfield.

       26    Murray said his role was as “adviser” to Duckenfteld. (68D-E). The policy was to let
             the fans “find their own level” ("53). At about 2.30 pm, “I did not consider whether
             there was room in any particular pen. I was looking at the terrace as a whole and the
             North Stand and the West Stand.” Murray thought there were gates which supporters
             used to move between pens.

       27    Murray conceded that no instruction was given to close oft'the tunnel to any police
             officers or stewards, and that there may have been four requests to open the gates.
             (3 i/5/89, p 92). The request was to open the gates “in the plural” .

       23        It is submitted that M urray’s account at page 93G is in effect an admission to criminal
                 recklessness. He admitted at E, “When I saw the gates opened I was obviously
                 looking in that [pens 3 and 4] direction” . It was put to Him that “the obvious place to
                 for them to go was down the tunnel:

                         “ It is now that I know. I know the ground. I know where the tunnel is. I
                        know where C gate is. I had never drawn any son o f realisation that people
                        coming through C gate would go towards the tunnel, or whatever, I have never
                        envisaged C. gate as an entry gate o f course, but the two things did nai. register,
                        did not tie up. It seemed so obvious after the event but certainly I gave it r.o
                        thought and no realisation before.”

        29   In cross-examination, Murray emphasised that he thought that fans could move from
              pen to pen. However, he conceded that pens 3 and 4 filled up first because they were
              popular; and they tended to fill up to the back (118D-F)

        30   It is submitted that this fact makes his assertions that supporters could walk through
              the gates between the pens meaningless and irrelevant, when thousands were pouring
              through gates that had been opened to relieve a terrible and constantly intensifying
              crush. Murray conceded to Mr Woodward, for South Yorkshire police, that at 2.46,
              according to photographs, the terraces looked “ pretty full". (1/6/89, page 3)

        31   In answer to- questions from Lord Taylor, Murray seemed to acknowledge that it had
       ^     been an option for the police to fill up the pens in series at the match (17)

        32   At the Inquest. Murray accepted that he had full authority to take steps ro avoid the
              risk to occupants o f the ground as a result of opening the gates, had he recognised
             such a risk. (Day 67, page 3 IB-C). He would not have been dependent on
              Duckenfield’s authorisation for any such steps.

        33   Murray accepted at page 4 3 D that the police “had a role to play as regards the
             distribution o f spectators across the Leppings Lane terraces.” See also 45A. At page
             48C, he accepted that the police had a duty to monitor the build-up and filling of the
             terraces before kick-up. At page 56B-D, he accepted that “there may well have come a
             time when it was necessary “ for him to divert supporters from the central pens. (It is

                         the prosecution case that he should have put in hand this diversion in any event,
                         because the outer pens were sparely occupied).

               34        Ke accepted that if it had been brought to his attention that the centra! pens were full,
                         and there was space in the side pens, he would have taken some action. 5SD-E. It is
                         the prosecution case that that fact was abundantly clear to anyone who looked.

               35        Murray accepted that he could have got manpower to block the tunnel in the five
                         minutes that Duckenfield was considering the request that the gates be opened. (77D
                         and 78 A). Ke knew that the tunnel was in that pan o f the concourse, (page 86C-87E)

               3o        It is submitted that once it is shown by photographs, video recordings and television
                          film that the pens were effectively full, or even nearly full, at the time the gates were
                          open, the cases against both Murray and Duckenfield becomes very powerful. The
                          state o f the pens was clearly visible from (he Control Box and on the cameras,
                          equipped with “zoom" facilities, in that Box.

               37        The nature o f the relationship between Murray and Duckenfield is not manifest from
                          the evidence, but it may be inferred that there was at least coolness between them.
                          Duckenfield v^as entitled to look to Murray for advice and support. Duckenfield had
                          been promoted to a higher rank than Murray very recently. Murray was three years
                          older, and more experienced at policing o f this kind. The question by Murray, ‘"Are
                          you going to open the Gates, Mr Duckenfield?” does not show a warm or co­
                          operative relationship.

               38        It is submitted that the Police Complaint Authority rightly recognised that the charge
                          of neglect was "joint-’. The reckless or grossly negligent decision to open the gates
                          without closing off the pens was the responsibility o f both defendants.

               39        The evidence becoming available, and previously concealed, about practices in I98S,
                         adds to the weight o f the evidence. It suggests that other evidence exists, proving
                         further the-'element o f foreseeability. However, even without that new 1988 evidence,
                         and irrespective o f the belief that the South Yorkshire Police is guarding much more
                         evidence showing gross negligence, it is submitted that there is powerful evidence
                         against both defendants.

               40        It is not proposed to set out further evidence, given by other police officers, about the
                          conduct o f the two defendants. The prosecution may call some of them as witnesses,
                          as they think appropriate after a review of the Sheffield archive, once it becomes
                          available.

                41       All these facts, drawn from the Taylor report and the available evidence, are to be
                         contrasted with Mr Dames’ inappropriate suggestion that funding by the SYPA was
                          necessary to maintain morale among officers who had to make “split second
                          decisions."

        Dear Mr Harlock

        Re: H illsborough Funding

        Your letter of 17 November addressed to Ann Adlington has been forwarded to me
        for response. Please accept this letter as a formal submission to be placed before
        members at their meeting on 26 November 1999.

        Firstly, I would reiterate the submissions made to the Authority on 21 May last and
        in view of the considerable change in membership ask that fresh copies are given to
        all concerned.

        Since that meeting there has been two significant developments:

        1)        The Stipendiary Magistrate at Leeds heard legal arguments from 5th - 9th July
                  99 as to whether or not the prosecutions are an abuse of process. His
                  answer was a resounding “NO".

                  The Magistrate made it d e a r at the outset that the burden of establishing
                  abuse of process lay with the Defence.

                  This was further held to be the case by the Honourable Mr Justice Hooper on
                  3 September in Leeds Crown Court.
                  Despite this basic starting point, the Defence chose not to give any evidence
                  in the Magistrates Court. Mr Clegg QC on behalf of M r Duckenfield, has
                  since indicated that it is highly unlikely that any evidence will be called at the
                  hearing scheduled for 4 January 2000.

                  In contrast to this the prosecutor submitted a comprehensive statement and
                  was vigorously cross-examined at length by Mr Harrison QC and M r Clegg
                  QC In his judgment, the Stipendiary Magistrate found her to be reliable,
                  credible and a responsible prosecutor, mindful of her duties.

      At this juncture I would ask you to confirm that you have been provided with a
      copy of the Stipendiary Magistrate’s lengthy ruling by the Defence?

      This is the prime document which ought to be considered by members of the
      Police Authority on 26 November as it sets out the law on abuse of process
      and the Magistrates’ findings on the prosecution evidence and legal
      submissions.

      It is our view that this is the closest you will get to a truly independent opinion
      on the merits and regularity of the prosecutions. I cannot stress too highly
      how essential it is for the Police Authority members to receive truly
      independent advice.

      W e expect that the Defence Lawyers will make submissions stating yet again
      how strong their case is, and wa believe will over exaggerate their chances of
      success. W e would argue "They w ould say that w ouldn't they!” - especially
      when they have a direct pecuniary advantage in this matter?



      On the 20 July, the Stipendiary Magistrate ruled that the prosecutions had
      established a prima-facie case against the Defendants and committed them
      both to stand trial.

      This is exactly what we have been saying to the Authority for almost a year
      now and I would ask that we are given the credence we deserve.



The Authority may wish to dampen the expenditure figures, but my reading of their
accounts is that to date, the Defendants substantial legal teams have received at
least £1.1 million of charge-payers money. This is considerably more than the
' m a ny tens o f thousands” o f pounds spoken of in the Judicial Review in March this
year and begs'the question of how on earth can you justify this as value for money?

In our opinion you have gone beyond the threshold of “providing m oral support fo r
officers” and to continue to fund further would adversely affect the morale of bobbies
on the beat who struggle to perform their difficult duties in the knowledge that extra
resources are being diverted to the lawyers pockets. This is aside from vulnerable
charge-payers who ultimately bear the brunt.

W e hope that these submissions do not fall on deaf ears and as is rumoured, it
transpires that the Authority has already set aside a further £ VS million for
expenses.


W e can surely be forgiven for suspecting that the real reason that consideration for
financial support is to be limited, at this stag e, “ to consideration o f the costs if the
hearings on 2 0 D ecem ber 1999 and 4 January 2 0 00 “ is that to consider funding up
to the conclusion of the trial would involve members being provided with estimates
of costs which would prove unpalatable in the extreme.
23/11     99 17:02       FAX 01535682211          TREVOR HICKS EWL                              003




    W e suspect that funding is being staggered in this way to cushion the blow with the
    costs of the trial itself being awarded from the budget for year 2000/2001. There
    may even be a hope that the HFSG will have ceased to exist by then! Believe me
    when I say that we still be here, and if you decide to fund in this staggered manner it
    will come back to haunt SYPA for years to come, especially in view of this
    Government’s commitment to “good value".

    W e further submit that the previous membership of the Authority had muddled
    thinking on the availability of legal aid, and in funding, has effectively deprived many
    police officer in this country, when facing legal proceedings, from qualifying for legal
    aid. W e believe that the rationale behind this aspect of the Authority's decision to
    fund is topsy turvy. W e look forward with interest to the time when the Authority’s
    decision is revisited in subsequent judicial reviews when Police Authorities refuse to
    provide financial assistance.

    W e would also draw your attention to the fact that the constraints imposed by the
    Authority on 21 May 99, are more apparent than real. Members of the media were
    staggered at the numbers on the defence legal teams in Leeds Magistrates’ Court.
    You can rest assured that once reporting restrictions are lifted, this is a matter that
    will be commented upon at length.

    This, however, came as no shock to HFSG. Don't forget our solicitor has recently
    been presented with a bill for £80,000 + from the defence for a judicial review which
    lasted barely more than a day - with one defence team claiming the costs of leading
    counsel, junior counsel, senior litigation partner, police law consultant and senior
    assistant solicitor!.

    In closing, we would urge the Authority to refrain from throwing further funds into the
    pockets of the Defence legal team.
    The Authority has already funded:-

               substantial defence representations to the DPP
               an unsuccessful judicial review of the DPP's decision not to discontinue
               a lengthy and expensive hearing on abuse of process in the Magistrates'
               Court.

        That the Authority is even considering further funding for the defence to re-run what
        is essentially the same argument in the Crown Court is frankly quite staggering. As
        our counsel put it in the Magistrates' Court - “same singer, same song". To that we
        would add can you continue to be the “same generous benefactor" or have you
        reached the stage where your duty to others exceeds that to these former officers!!

        Yours fajthfully

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Funding

Your letter of 31“ January addressed to Ann Adlington has been passed to me for
consideration. In view o f the ridiculously tight timescale which you have imposed, these
representations will o f necessity be brief

Firstly, would you please confirm that the affidavit sworn by Dennis Luty on 5th March 1999
will be circulated to members in advance o f the meeting on 411' February. Particular regard
should be had to his concern expressed at paragraph 8 as to the [surprising high level o f costs
claimed] bearing in mind that the matter was disposed o f by way o f correspondence. No more
than 6 letters were exchanged on this aspect o f the case.

Members’ attention should also be drawn to the role o f the Clerk to the Court in determining
costs to be paid from Centra] Funds in each particular case. It is well established that the
Clerk will base his decision using the “ reasonableness” criteria. That is, what would a
reasonable man o f reasonable means be prepared to pay for legal representation if he had to
fork out the funds himself? Obviously, in the present case, the Clerk has exercised the
Wednesbury principle and decided that no reasonable man of reasonable means would be
prepared to pay the amounts currently claimed by Walker Morris and Winckworth Sherwood.
This comes as no surprise to us given that those 2 firms are currently seeking £80,000 from
Ann Adlington for a judicial review lasting a mere one and a half days.

The Clerk to the Court in exercising his discretion in the present case has quite simply decided
that to pay the costs claimed by the Defence team in full, would be an unreasonable use of
taxpayers money which would be open to legal challenge. For police authority members to
even consider bridging the gap by using South Yorkshire charge payers funds, is too ludicrous
for words. How much more can South Yorkshire charge payers be expected to cough up?
Such considerations will not of course bother the defendants or their lawyers as none of them
live in South Yorkshire,

At least one o f the defence teams has recently acknowledged that in having the proceedings
aborted in South Sefton, they did so with the expectation that proceedings would be instituted
elsewhere. One therefore has to ask what benefit accrued to South Yorkshire residents by
employing what can only be described as a delaying tactic? This case is littered with examples
o f such conduct with the only beneficiaries of course being the fat cat lawyers.

Please acknowledge receipt o f this letter an confirm that it will be distributed to the Authority
members.


Yours faithfully

          1. Dennis Luty, m ak e cath and say as foilows:-

          !.      I am a Solicitor or the Supreme Court currently employed as the Clerk to the Justices
                  at the South Sefton Magistrates' Court, Merseyside.

          2.     On the 241’’ June, i 998 Informations w ere laid before this Court by Ann Adlingtcn
                 alleging that David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray had com m itted offences of'
                 manslaughter, wi!ful neglect to perform a pubiic duty and (in relation to Duckenfield
                 alone) doing an act tending I intending to pervert justice.

          3.      S u m m o n se s were issued against the defendants which w ere returnable on Ihe 17''"'
                  July, 1998 at 10.CO a.m.

          4.     Following the issue of ihe su m m o n ses, Winckworth and Pemberton (Solicitors) and
                  Walker, Morris (Solicitors) w ho represented me defendants, contacted m e both by
                  letter and by telephone asserting that the Court had no jurisdiction to deal with these
                  matters. I was also contacted by the Informant, Ann Adlington by letter and telephone
                  in relation to this issue.

           5.     I took the view that the South Sefton Court had jurisdiction to deal with these offences
                   but there w as an argument that the su m m o n s e s were ineffective unless the defendants
                   submitted to the jurisdiction of this Court. Accordingly, after further correspondence
                   and telephone d iscussion with all parties, it w as agreed that the proceedings should
                   be brought forward to the 10* July and that the Informant would apply for them to be
                   withdrawn.

           6.     On the IQ1* July in the ab sen ce of all parties, proceedings w e re withdrawn and the
                  Court m a d e an order for the defendants' costs to be ta.xed and paid from central funds
                   in acco rd an ce with Section 16 of the Prosecution of OfTences Act 1985.

                      later Lhat rr.onLh.

          8.          The defendanis' solicitors each submitted Lheir ciaims for costs in Seoiember'958, !
                      w as extremely surprised at the level of costs vvhich were being claimed, particularly
                      in view of the fact Lhat neither of the defendants or Lheir solicitors had actually
                      appeared before Lhe Court in relation to Lhis matter. In accord ance with my normal
                      practice I requested Lhat Lhe solicitors shcaid supply to m e Lheir full files of papers
                      applying Lhe provisions of Regulation 6(5) of Lhe Costs in Criminal Cases (General)
                       Regulations 1986.

          S.           BoLh solicitors submitted their fuil files of papers to m e and w h e n 1 perused those
                       documents I discovered a clear indication within Lhem that the South Yorkshire Police
                       Authority had agreed to pay Lhe defendants’ costs in relation to Lhis matter i therefore
                       com municated with boLh solicitors suggesting Lhat as Lhe defendants Lhemseives had
                       not incurred costs, Lhey w ere not entitled .to be reimbursed. I d rew attention to the
                       c a s e of /?. u. Miller (R a ym o n d ) a n d another I9S3 3 All ER 186.             ^

           10.         C n ee again, there was further correspondence in relation to Lhis matter, th<s solicitors
                       arguing Lhat their clients had in fact incurred costs in accordance wiLh Lhe ra-jc c ( Miller
                       and t h a t ! should therefore undertake an appropriate taxation.

           11.         Early last month, I b e c a m e aware that an issue had arisen b etw e en Lhe Chief Constable
                       of Lhe ScuLh Yorkshire Police and the SouLh Yorkshire police Authority in relation to
                       funding in this matter. I also b eca m e aware Lhat my decision in relation to taxation
                       may be subject to judicial review i f ! declined to pay the defendants' costs.

           12.         On the 11"' February I wrote to boLh solicitors advising them of my provisional
                       conclusion Lhat the defendants had not Lhemselves incurred costs, i drew attention to
                       the fact Lhat I was aw are of Lhe pending judicial review in relation to the Police

 Dear Sirs

 R -v - South Y orkshire Police A uthority ex parte Chief Constable of South Y orkshire
 Police

Further to our letter o f 13 May we write in response to your letter o f 12 May raising certain
queries, and confirming the meeting is to now take place at 4 pm on 21 May. Adopting the
headings in that letter we comment as follows:

Meeting o f the Authority

The details are noted.

The role o f the HFSG

We note the intended course. You will appreciate from our previous correspondence and
discussions that it has been our view at all times that the role o f HFSG in this matter has
been entirely questionable and we would not agree that it would be appropriate for them to
attend the meeting.

South Sefton

We have provided previous details with our earlier correspondence.

We enclose herewith a copy o f the letter o f 11 February, and a copy o f our terms of
engagement. The latter correspondence is provided strictly on a confidential basis. We do
not believe any other parties, save your client, are entitled to this document, and would be
grateful if the document could be treated on that basis. If it is intended that this document
should come into the public domain we would be grateful if you could advise us by return.

Costs

We have dealt with this matter as far as we can. You will appreciate that in due course
detailed bills o f costs will be drawn, but this will involve a great deal o f time and costs from

the costs draughtsman point of view and it will be some time before the documents can be
produced. We have provided the estimate o f future costs to the conclusion of a two week
committal.

Funding for the Police Superintendents Association

We have dealt with this in our previous correspondence. If there are any queries please do
let us know, and in addition we would be grateful for your advice about whether the
attendance o f Mr Williams at the meeting would be o f assistance to your client.

Legitimate expectation

We are surprised that this issue has now been raised, for we fail to see how there can be
doubt that our client has had a legitimate expectation to have his fees paid on the basis of
the letter o f 5 March 1998 from the Clerk and the Treasurer. The letter expresses the
position clearly, M r Duckenfield engaged us on a private basis, and from that time until the
correspondence from the Police Authority early in January, it was understood that, subject
to proper reporting and approval, we would take all necessary steps to provide proper legal
assistance to him as necessary relating to and arising out of the criminal prosecution.

This is the first express suggestion that we have had that the Authority may not wish to
honour the commitment made in the previous correspondence, notwithstanding that the
legal power issue has been resolved in favour o f making the payment. We request your
specific advice by return as to the reason for this change and how it is that you say the
Authority is not committed to making the payment, if that is the present position.

Legal aid

Walker Morris have been in contact with the Clerk to the Magistrates Court and we
understand they are confirming details. We can confirm that on the basis o f the
understanding that the question o f funding has to be finally resolved with the Authority, Mr
Duckenfield has. not at this time made a legal aid application. It is, o f course, not open to
him to make an application for retrospective assistance.

Our client’s financial resources

We are providing the following information subject to your absolute assurance that this
information will be treated with the utmost confidence, and not be brought into the public
domain nor conveyed to HFSG. We would expect that the detail is not referred to in any
public forum.




                                              2

We have set out the position previously in regard to the potential legal aid implications. In
the event that South Yorkshire Police Authority does not resolve to provide financial
assistance for M r Duckenfield’s legal costs, the clear implication is that Mr Duckenfield
will suffer considerable financial hardship, and that his economic resources will be greatly
depleted without any real prospect o f rebuilding them.

Opinion o f Counsel

In out previous Letter we asked for clarification as to what matters required attention from
Counsel, given that both ourselves and Walker Morris have provided copies o f the detailed
submissions to the DPP which dealt largely with evidentiary matters. In view o f your
comment that you “remain o f the view that the material does not meet our requirements”,
we have referred to Counsel as a matter o f urgency, to see if it is possible to provide further
submissions by the Tuesday deadline.

In regard to fees, we are bound to raise the question as to the costs involved generally in
regard to these submissions and the attendance at the Authority’s meeting. The solicitors
for both defendants are being put to a great deal o f trouble in satisfying new requirements
that have been raised by the Police Authority since January 1999 in regard to funding
matters. In our view it is entirely proper therefore that in the event that the Authority
resumes financial assistance to M r Duckenfield, it also agrees to pay the reasonable costs
associated with dealing with the Authority’s queries and requests since January 1999 on
funding issues generally up to and including representations made in respect o f and
attendance at the forthcoming meeting.

You will appreciate from this and previous correspondence that we are doing all that we can
to satisfy your requests for information. If there are any other potential concerns that you
have in regard to the funding issues, we naturally request the opportunity to address those in
good time for the meeting to ensure that the Authority arrives at a fully informed decision,
whilst maintaining the opportunity for the Defendants to make proper submissions on all
relevant matters.

We await your further advice accordingly.

Yours faithfully

      Dear Sirs

      R -v - South Yorkshire Police Authority ex. parte Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
      Police

      We refer to recent correspondence, and M r Eastwood’s discussion with M r Harlock in
      regard to the further Opinion from Mr Clegg QC we have provided. We confirm that this is
      to be treated as confidential to your firm and the South Yorkshire Police Authority and not
      ro be released further without reference to ourselves or Leading Counsel.

     We are grateful for your fax confirming the venue for Friday’s meeting and will await
     further advice as to the time when we are expected to attend for the oral submissions. In
     this regard, we have o f course seen the Skeleton Argument submitted on behalf o f Mr
     Murray, and have discussed this at length with M r Manning o f Walker Morris. In the
     interests o f cost-effectiveness, and given that much o f that Skeleton deals with matters
     relating to both Defendants, we will not be submitting a separate Skeleton Argument but
     naturally will .adopt the submissions made by M r Manning. We will, in an oral submission,
     deal with particular aspects relating to Mr Duckenfield, as set out in previous
     correspondence , and one or two other aspects which arise from the history o f this matter.

     Naturally if you require any further information or assistance prior to Friday’s meeting
     please let us know.

     Yours faithfully

        Dear D>ayid •

        Soxrtfc^OEkahiDre Fbllce Authority * Dnckenfield

        I refer t o t e l e p h o n e discussions and correspondence, most particularly your letter
        o f 17                 'advising that the Authority has convened a meeting for Friday 26
        N w e n ^ ^ l^ d ith a t you requested cost estimates in regard to the following:

         1)          hearing commencing 20 December on admissibility of Taylor evidence; and

        2)           hearing commencing 4 January 2000, regarding abuse o f process.

         You have also requested some further background information in regard to these
         applications, .and I am aware that there are still ongoing negotiations relating to the Inland
         Revenue position and you have kindly kept me up to date with developments.

         1)          Admissibility application December 1999

                     . As .you will; know from previous correspondence including Walker M orris’s letter of
                       19r November, the prosecution are seeking to admit in evidence the transcript of
                     i evidence o f both Duckenfield and Murray at the Taylor Inquiry in 1989.

                          By its very nature this evidence may well be crucial to the outcome o f any trial,
                          because' •the prosecution have made it clear that they do not intend to produce any
                          othei evidence from police officers who were at the ground on that day! As you and
                          the Authority will know, the basis for the manslaughter charges is gross negligence
                          and we b rie v e it is central to an assessment of any criminal liability in that context,
                          for the prosecution to prove, amongst other things, that the defendants were in
                          breach o f a duty o f care in relation to their personal activities in policing the match
                          in April 1989. We believe that the prosecution bears a considerable burden to
                          establish, this, in the absence o f evidence from other officers as to what information
                          the defendants had, and the circumstances in which they had to take decisions on
                          that day. It will be self-evident that the evidence of the two defendants themselves
                          is to be used against their interest, by way of purported “admissions”, in order for

                      the prosecution to satisfy the evidentiary burden in the case. Accordingly the
                      success or otherwise of our application for this evidence to be excluded may well be
                      crucial to; the conduct.and outcome o f the criminal trial.

                      W e have been making considerable enquiries since the committal in regard to the
                      circumstances in which the defendants gave evidence at the Taylor Inquiry, and we
                      echo the comments made by Walker Morris in their letter o f 19 November that the
                      following comments must be treated in absolute confidence, until our evidence
                      (which is likely to comprise approximately 6 statements) on this application is
                      finalised; We shall of course make available to you any final copies o f the evidence
                      for the Authority’s information and assistance at a later date. It may help the
                      Authority to know at this time that our enquiries suggest that the defendants gave
                      evidence at the Inquiry against the following background:

                      * a letter raising potential criticisms of South Yorkshire Police (the so-called
                        “ Salmon” letter) was sent to the Police solicitors, Messrs Hammond Sudd aids,
                         but neither defendant appears to have seen a copy o f that letter prior to giving
                        .evidence;

                      ■    South .Yorkshire Police were represented at the Inquiry, through Messrs
                           Hammond Suddards and counsel who at all times believed they were acting on
                           behalf o f the force as a body, rather than individual officers;

                      ■    the lawyers involved with the Inquiry appear to have held the view in 1989 that
                           •the legal representatives for SYP as a force were also acting to represent the
                            interests o f individual officers, and accordingly no separate representation was
                            accorded to the officers, and no correspondence was conducted directly with
                            them;

                      ■ ' at no time before or during the Inquiry did Lord Justice Taylor believe that there
                          was any realistic risk of a prosecution for manslaughter of any person arising out
                          o f the Hillsborough disaster;

                      ■    •accordingly, because of the belief that there was no possibility of there being a
                            prosecution, at no time prior to or during the course o f the Inquiry was any
                            individual cautioned in regard to his evidence and the potential risk o f any
                            subsequent criminal prosecution arising out of that evidence;

                      ■     in regard,to our client, Mr Duckenfield, it would appear that he was not afforded
                            the benefit o f any detailed legal advice, guidance or input in regard to his
                            evidence at the Inquiry, and indeed was not actually represented at the Inquiry in
                            the context o f his personal interests.

                      We> stress that we have not finalised the evidence to support the above provisional
                      conclusions, but assuming these points can be established, we are sure you will
                      agree that a very strong case can be put to the High Court judge to exclude this
                      material on the basis of fairness, given the central importance that it plays in the
                      prosecution. This is a view which is shared by leading counsel who has seen some
                      o f the draft statements being prepared.

                      As, ever in this case we must remain cautiously optimistic that the application will
                      succeed (but leading counsel’s opinion is with your papers for the benefit o f the

2 3 -N 0 U -1 9 9 9    17:47     FROM   LI I NCKUiGRTH SHERWOOD            TO             9 01 13 20 79 00 1   P . 04




                      Authority members), but we do believe it to be of the utmost importance and are
                      proceeding vigorously to prepare the necessary material to put this argument with
                      the ,greatest force on 20 December. Naturally counsel is being kept advised o f o u t
                      preparations and has assisted with input both as to general strategy and specific
                      documentation.

                      Much o f our recent activity has been directed to this aspect, and a rough estimate of
                      professional costs incurred since the committal on 20 July to the end o f the week
                      commencing 25 November is £35-45,000.

                      To complete the evidence and other preparations required by the court timetable (see
                      the order 3 September 1999, Mr Justice Hooper) we estimate to be a further £10-
                       15,000... The hearing is set down for 2-3 days, 20-22 December, and the estimate for
                       attendances by 2 fee earners, with necessary hotel and like expenses in attending
                      Leeds is approximately £2,000-2,500 per day. To all the foregoing sums needs to be
                      ■added VAT.

                      In regard to counsel’s fees we propose dealing with these for sums generally in
                      accordance with Walker Morris’ letter of 12 November 1999 (although we may
                      choose to calculate as hourly rates rather than brief and refreshers) subject to any
                      additional expenses incurred by leading counsel in travelling and staying in Leeds.
                      This o f course is a factor relevant to the claims for refreshers for earlier attendances.

                      In conclusion, we cannot over-emphasise the importance o f this application, nor our
                      belief, having made considerable investigations, that the application is a very strong
                      one. The success of the defence o f this case may well depend upon this application
                      alone.

         2)           A buse o f process January 2000

                      We have already corresponded at length about this, and you have the benefit o f
                      counsel’s advice. We note from your previous correspondence that the Authority
                      members may have concerns as a previous application has already been made before
                      the magistrate.

                      We echo the comments made in counsel’s advice of 1 August 1999, and the
                      comments made by Walker Morris to you in their letter o f 12 November regarding
                      the cost/benefit analysis in making this application.

                      If we may paraphrase leading counsel’s advicc further it is important to note
                      counsel’s view that “a strong case exists that this prosecution amounts to an abuse of
                      process o f the court”. Counsel’s further comments about the likelihood o f this
                      application succeeding before the judge reflect a natural, proper and fair
                      consideration of the vagaries of judicial pronouncements and the difficulty of
                      prediction. Notwithstanding that the matter is one o f great “speculation” leading
                      counsel says that this “must be evenly balanced”.

                      Once again the importance o f this application to the prosecution overall must be
                      bome in mind by the Authority members. Those conducting the defence on behalf
                      o f M r Duckenfield believe that in reality, the High Court judge is much more likely
                      to be attracted to the arguments o f abuse, in this high profile and unique case, than
                      was the magistrate, for a variety of political and legal reasons.

                                                               3

•N0U-1S99     17:47    FROM    WINCKUJORTH SHERUJOOD            TO            9 01 13 20 79 00 1   P . 05




             The Authority will have seem leading counsel’s advice that the magistrate erred as a
             matter o f law in considering the abuse application, particularly in dealing with the
             human rights legislation. You will be aware that The Human Rights Act comes into
             force in October 2000, and we believe come January of that year, M r Justice Hooper
             will have this aspect in the forefront o f his mind when deciding on the application.

              The application as put to the magistrate will of course be reviewed and refined for
            : the purpose o f the January hearing and we believe that it can be put with even
              greater force at that time. The question of the Inland Revenue impact on potential
              costs indemnity for the defendants does o f course raise the question o f potential
              prejudice to the defendants which did not exist in July when the matter was argued
              before the magistrate. We wish to be appraised o f developments on this point so
              that we can raise this before the judge notwithstanding the likelihood that this issue
              will remain unresolved by January 2000.

             Those defending Mr Duckenfield are o f the view that the arguments in relation to
             admissibility may also assist in the abuse of process argument, and you will
             appreciate that this aspect has been much advanced by our recent enquiries and
             therefore will form part o f the enhanced abuse application next year.

             In short, we believe the abuse o f process argument to be argued before the judge has
             a realistic chance of success and for the reasons set out in counsel’s advice we
             believe that the interests of justice for the defendants make it com pellin g for this
             matter to be argued, and for the costs indemnity to be extended to that hearing.

             In conclusion on this point we echo the comments o f Walker Morris that the
             potential success of this application could lead to a saving o f hundreds o f thousands
             of pounds’ worth o f costs, with the complementary Central Funds Order being made
             in the normal course for costs incurred in the prosecution to date and that as the
             discrete costs for this application are relatively modest it is both legally and
             commercially justified for the Authority to indemnify the defendants in regard to the
             application. It would also see our client’s nightmare ended in January rather than
             June. .

   In regard to our costs, we think the abuse preparation to be in the order o f £5-10,000, with
   Leeds-attendance costs, including hotel and like expenses, to be £2-2,500 per day for up to 4
   days. VAT needs to be added to these figures. We have referred to counsel’s fees earlier
   on an overall basis.

   We stress that all the above figures are best possible estimates, on a reasonable basis, but as
   the conduct of this case has not so far proceeded on a predictable basis, we anticipate these
   estimates may subsequently prove inaccurate for reasons beyond our control We would ask
   the Authority, if this proves to be the case, to consider any subsequent submissions as to
   work properly , and reasonably carried out, subject to assessment by an independent costs
   draftsman in the normal way.

   We trust the above assists you and the Authority in the meeting. It may be helpful to the
   Authority to' confirm that we would strongly advise our client, regardless o f funding issues,
   to make the above applications. May we respectfully remind you of the key words of the
   Chief Constable; when he: referred to damage to police morale if funding were not approved.

       were not granted now? We note that you do not require at this time an estimate o f costs
       generally in. regard to the defence o f the prosecution, and you will know that we are
       attending to;matters on an ongoing basis, particularly as a result of ongoing disclosure of
       material froth HFSG, as a result of their perusal of the SYP archive.

       There is one remaining matter we would ask that the Authority reconsider. In your without
       prejudice correspondence o f 17 September you advised that the Authority having met on 10
       September had decided, amongst other things, to reject an application for Mr Duckenfield’s
       travel and incidental costs to be reimbursed. We respectfully ask for this matter to be
       reconsidered at the forthcoming meeting, and make the following observations to assist in
       that consideration.

       The present prosecution has been brought in Leeds, after the aborted attempt to prosecute
       the defendants m Liverpool. Mr Duckenfield unfortunately now lives on the
       and is required to endure considerable personal hardship in attending the hearings both in
       regard to travel and personal costs. At all times he has attempted to minimise his personal
       expenditure in that regard, for common-sense reasons, and where available has taken up the
       offers from friends and relatives of accommodation. He is nonetheless required to incur
       considerable expenditure in travelling to and from Leeds. Pursuant to previous decisions of
       the Authority, earlier expenditure has been reimbursed, and with respect, we do not see any
       basis for this expenditure being denied. Previous figures have been submitted in regard to
       the committal hearing, and Mr Duckenfield will be required to attend in December and
       January for the two hearings.

       We can see no:basis for differentiating between his personal costs, in attending court, from
       those o f ourselves and other legal representatives who of course must travel and stay in
       Leeds for the: duration o f the hearing. The sums involved are relatively nominal in relation
       to the large amounts of legal fees being necessarily incurred. In the interests o f fairness, we
       therefore ask the Authority to reconsider this decision, and to be mindful o f the personal
       impact that refusal to pay these expenses has had and will continue to have on Mr
       Duckenfield at a time when he has to endure the utmost stress and anxiety.

        1 am aware that you are still awaiting various reports and outlines from us regarding
        costings to date, and will deal with those in separate correspondence. If there is any other
        matter we can assist the Authority with in regard to its meeting on Friday please do not
        hesitate to contact me or Duncan McGill of our office at your convenience.

        Yours sincerely

   Dear Sirs

   South Yorkshire Police Authority - Duckenfield

   We refer to your letters o f 24 January and 31 January 2000. A number o f matters arise as
   follows:

   1)           It was previously indicated to you we agree with the terms o f the funding letters to
                be placed before Mr Duckenfield. The only issue outstanding is the figures to be
                inserted in the letters. If you are unable to settle on these figures we would suggest
                that a “reasonableness” test be applied in respect o f the same. We suggest that you
                forward final copies o f the letters to us so that the same may be put before our client.

  2)           We have referred the question of Counsels’ fees to Counsels’ clerks and trust that
               direct contact will be made to try and finalise this matter.

   3)          In relation to your letter of 3 1 January 2000 wc have perused the correspondence of
                Mr Manning to you dated 1 February 2000. We, like Mr Manning, are extremely
               surprised that you have invited comments from the HFSG in relation to this funding
               issue. We endorse the comments made by Mr Manning wholeheartedly and invite
               you to place this correspondence before the Authority when it considers matters on
                Friday 4 February 2000.

  Yours sincerely




  Duncan McGill

           Dear Sirs

           R -V- SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY

           We acknowledge receipt o f your letter o f the 12th May.

           1.       M eeting o f Authority. We note the date and time and await details o f the
                    venue. It would be intended that our Mr. Richard Manning will attend to
                    make the oral submission and we note the request for a written submission.

           2.       Role o f H .F.S.G . Having regard to the comments made in the Divisional
                    Court to Mr. Alan Jones, Q.C. namely “what are you doing here” we are
                    surprised that you are even asking H.F.S.G. whether in the circumstances
                    they believe it appropriate to question the use of Public Funds for the funding
                    o f our Client. We reserve our position as to what action we will take if
                    H.F.S.G. indicate a wish to attend and to make representations,"and you
                    allow them to do so.

           3.         South Sefton. Attached is a copy of the letter o f the 11th February 1999.
                     The Magistrates’ Clerk at South Sefton has not made a final decision because
                     it will depend upon your decision. If, as we expect, the Police Authority
                     confirms the continuation of funding to our Client from the 12th January, and
                     ongoing, then we think it very likely that the Clerk at South Sefton will
                     confirm the decision he has provisionally reached, and in which event both
                     ourselves and Winckworth Sherwood (who are in an identical position) would
                     want to jointly mount an application for Judicial Review o f that decision.

           4.        Costs.

                     4.1              The Schedule that we have provided to you post the 12th January is
                                      for the most part work on the two Judicial Review Applications.
                                      You know the date that we made an application in relation to the
                                      funding, which was precipitated by the challenge from H.F.S.G. to
                                      the locus o f the Chief Constable.

                                                               M essrs. G arretts
                                                                 14 M ay 1999
                                                                         Page 2




4.2      That necessitated the Application and we had to do a bundle of
         documents because of i t Up to that time the majority of the work
         had been in relation to the Application for Judicial Review of the
         D.P.P.’s decision. It is going to be impossible within the timeframe
         to extract detail of what work was done in relation to each o f those
         two Applications. The best guesstimate is that taking things as a
         round, possibly slightly more was done in relation to the
         D.P.P.Application because we had the conduct of it as the Applicant,
         and because it was over a longer period of time.

4.3      Notwithstanding the fact o f the communication o f the 12th January,
         there has obviously been work done in relation to the Magistrates
         Court proceedings and the prosecution, our best estimate is that
         probably about 15% of the costs would fall into that category. You
         are aware that there have been Magistates Court hearings on the 1st
         March, 2nd March, 26th April and o f course last Monday the 10th
         May and we are back on the 24th May, but neither of those are in
         the schedule.

4.4     I f there had not been the intervention by H.F.S.G.so that funding
        had continued uninterrupted then insofar as the Order for costs
         obtained against Ann Adlington is concerned, we would have
        proceeded to tax the bill and reimburse the Authority for that
        portion of the costs that were recoverable against her as against the
        charging rate agreed with the Authority, and that in our view is the
        sensible way to deal with the matter in any event.

4.5     We have heard nothing from the D.P.P. and therefore do not
        propose to make an approach to ask them about the level of their
        costs just in case they forget about them.

4.6     We will have a look at the disbursements between the bill to the
        Clerk to the Justices at South Sefton and the amounts in the
        enclosures to our letter of the 29th April and try to resolve this, but
        that is not an insurmountable problem between us.

Funding from Police Superintendents’ Association. We do challenge the
relevance of this information. However again we would not want your
Members to feel that this is in any way controversial as between the
Authority and ourselves. Thus although we reserve our position as to whether
there is entitlement, the money from the Superintendents’ Association would
only be provided up to a maximum of £20,000 if the Police Authority
refused to provide the funding requested, and further insofar as it may be
necessary to meet any shortfall that may arise cither in whole or in part in

                                                                              Messrs. Garretts
                                                                               14 May 1999
                                                                                       Page 3


                relation to the Order for costs against Adlington. In short therefore it is an
                amount that only would become available by way o f indemnity if all else
                fails.

        6.     Legitimate Expectation. We have to fundamentally disagree with you on the
               way in which you put this matter. In our view there is a contractual position
               between the Authority, our Client and ourselves in relation to costs. Having
               regard to that authority given and only stopped on the basis that you were not
               certain that your Clients had power to grant that authority, and having now
               been told that they did indeed have power, it would be in our view
               Wednesbury unreasonable and Padfield perverse for the funding decision not
               to be confirmed from the 12th January and not to be met to the 12th January.

        7.     Legal Aid. The Clerk to the Justices will not determine a Legal Aid
               Application unless the Policy Authority refuse to grant funding. There is no
               fresh Application, the original Application is held in abeyance on this basis.

               The means determination done by the Legal Aid Board under the Leeds
               Magistrates’ Court Pilot Scheme and the Legal Aid Board concluded “if the
               Court is minded to grant Legal Aid we would suggest a contribution of
               £163.33 per week from income, and £95,148.00 from capital.

        8.     Our C lient's Financial Resources. We reserve the position as to whether it
               is appropriate for the Authority to take into consideration our Client’s
               financial resources. We are instructed however that on the confidential basis
               o f this letter we can disclose our Client’s position.
                                                                       M essrs.G arretts
                                                                         14 M ay 1999
                                                                                Page 4




9.       Opinion o f Counsel. We appreciate that the written. Opinion was not long, but
         it very powerfully repeated the view o f two eminent Q.C.’s that there is not
         any reasonable prospect of a conviction. We will deal with Counsels’fee
         notes separately with you.

10.      General. It would seem to us that there is no way in which the Authority can
         refuse to meet costs for the period for which they have committed
         themselves, and indeed that goes to the date o f the meeting where they
         actually made the decision. Having now been told that they were empowered
         to grant funding, they should continue that funding on the same basis as
         previously agreed. We would view it as entirely responsible that the
         Authority should want to know o f any material change in the view of
         Solicitors and the two Q.C.’s. A prudent course would be therefore to grant
         funding up to the date of the conclusion of the committal proceedings. I f of
         course the case is not committed to the Crown Court, then no further decision
         is likely to have to be made by the Authority. If on the other hand the case
         is committed, then the Authority would be justified in asking for further
         advices from Leading Counsel, with an estimate o f the costs that were likely
         to be incurred. For our own part we would have no objection to a quarterly
         review so long as absolute confidentiality could be guaranteed.

          9.1.   C hief Constable has duty to maintain an cffcctive and efficient Police Force for
                 its area.
          9.2.   Principle remains, a Police Officer should be able to carry out his duties in

                 his Police Authority will support him;
         9-3.    Chief Constable has said that if this support is not given he will have a discipline
                 and recruitment problem;

                               PROCEEDINGS
                      (As Approved bv the Court)
                             CROWN COPYRIGHT




  LORD JUSTICE LAWS: Ms Baxendale,         I am sorry but before you

        start there is a preliminary matter I want to raise.           We

        had a fax from Mr Jones which T have temporarily lost

        saying that, this is right Hr Jones, you may be required

        to be in their Lordships.House this afternoon and so you

       would wished to be released after lunch today and be

        heard tomorrow morning.     In the ordinary way the court

       would at once accede to that but I have a deeper

       problem.     At the moment I do not understand what your

        c l i e n t ' 3 legitimate -- and I emphasis that adjective --

        interest in these proceedings is.

  MR JONES: My Lord, would you like me to deal with that?

                If I deal with the matter of history in the

       instant matter.     When leave was granted in this case by

       Latham J.    We - - I am talking from recollection -- leave

       was granted on Friday 12th February.        We had sent in a

       note on that day or the day before indicating that we

       wished to be heard in opposition to the application or




                                  Page 2

       had rightly said without: any opposition at the time.           j,

       however, did not have in mind that your clients would be

       putting forward any arguments which were the arguments

       of the Police Authority.        You would simply be there to ‘

       deal with any discrete point which may affect your

       client and no one else.        That would be the normal course

       that one would expect of the second respondent.           So

       I would certainly feel that you ought not to be under

       misapprehension when I directed that you be made second

       respondent because that wa3 afforded to enable you to

       range widely in the debate, again in relation to any

       discrete point that your clients felt you ought to

       raise.

  MR JONES: My Lords I am grateful for the indication and

       I   will put that argument t o m o r r o w morning.

  MR JUSTICE CRSSSWSLL: Mr Jones,         for my part, as my Lord has

       pointed out,     the court: has your skeleton and I would

       encourage you to reflect on the position and the role of

       a prosecutor and the importance of the position taken by

       a prosecutor.      It would be most extraordinary in my

       experience if any prosecutor attacked the funding of the

       defence.
  MR JONES: My Lord,      if I may say so, my Lord,      it is now a

       regular event in prosecutions by the Serious Fraud

       Office and the Crown Prosecution Service in cases in

                    ptovjjiaas^ taken with s.6((2) ■ (4)). T ic police aptfaorrty Holds the pnrse (s. 14). Those
                    provisions specifically concerned with the police authority's role confer duties ratfeer
           3             powers, though in sotne c iiw there is cletrfy &ducrotxm i s to }iow the duly is to
                    be performed (as Sot cxiraplc under 3.37). Other powers (including tho*e contained in

                    s. 111(1)) are conferred ca the police authority by fte local government legislation, to
           5        rhe extent that measures there contained were applied to police authorities by
                  5_I46A(1) o f tfce A ct o f 1972. The powers so conferred t t t listed in a helpful note
                  provides! by M ias BaxmcUle. I do act propose to set them o u t They include (apait
          9       from s. 111(1)) such matters--as fee.; disposition and treatment o f staff tnd the
                  acquisition and disposal o f laud.



      12                           H ie critical point which in my judgment emerges from i consideration
                  o f the interlocking roles o f Chief Constable, Secretary o f S ate and police authority is
                 rfut it cssxnot have been within the contemplation Of Parliament in enacting the
      15         scheme, tnd in embracing within it s.II 1(1), that the police authority should only be
                 empowered to incur expenditure in support of those duties, and ancillary powers,
                 winch are specifically conferred upon it. The police authority holds the funds from
     18          which expenses for its local police force w ill be supplied: s. 14. It is inherent in the
                system (w Mr Baker submitted in reply) that die Chief Constable will apply to the
                amhority for authorisation to incur expenditure; it m ay be for the use o f resources snch
 21
                as helicopters, or the installation o f video suraiU snce systems in city streets, or a host
                o f other things. No doubt the Chief Constable presents a general budget. We were not
               referred to any provision in statute which shows or suggests that the police.authority's
 24
               power to accede to such requests rests in anything other man the combination o f s.6 (l)
               **d sA1KlX Given this, it seems to me plain that, in the particular coaiext before us
               m this iase, die lc p tx u ts scopc of the ancillary power provided by 5 . 1 1 1( 1) cannot be

                Chief Constable might propose as bciag conducive to “the eaainteaan-ee of an
                ritid c a t and effective police force for to area1*.
      8
                                This result is supported, if only cr silemio, by the decision of this court
                in J? itberbyshirt Police Authority ex p. Wilson (8 August 1989, unreported save in
      9      The Times). The court had to.:consider a decision of the police authority not to
            ■ contribute to the legal expenses of two police            q£ 2 c c t   ia- relation to an auditor’s
                enquiry. The court assumed tfcats.4of 4 c Police Act 1964 (die predecessor of $.6(1})
     12      provided the power to grant financial assistance. However the point of principle was
             not argued. The applicant also point to other materials. In 1962 the report o f the
             Royal Commission on the Police wis published. It indicated the then current practice
     15      in relation to the provision of financial support to police officers in aval proceedings,
            which included a requirement that “a constable most have acred in good faith in the
            intended execution of his duty”, (para 196(a)). Para 197 stated:
 18                  “In England and Walat<« distinction h made between a private prosecution,
                     m which the decision as to the support of the constable wi» be taken on the
                     same basis as in the case ofa civil action, and a pubRc prosecution brought
 21                  by the police or the Director of Public Prosecutions.”

           Home Office Circular 77/1937, published chi 4 December 1987, stated:
 24
                     w... acting in pursuance of Its general statutory duty to maintain an

Dear David

South Y o rk sh ire P o lic c A uthority
R c : C osts

Thank you for agreeing a meeting on 1 1 November. Wc believe that w e have persuaded you
that som e o f the proposed deductions from our account, as suggested by the law C O S ls
draftsman would not be appropriate upon the explanations that you have received. W e aoocpl
the initial deduction o f die m onies which axe referable to the South Sefton proceedings. In
that regard as you appreciate, the indications from South Sefton are that they arc not goin g to
pay all that has been requested, and therefore w e obviously then would revert to the Authority
for the balance with the Authority having the ability to instruct us i f they w ish to fund a
hearing for assessm ent o f costs.

A s to the payment o f costs w e understand the problem o f the Inland Revenue considering this
to be a benefit in kind. We think that our Client is in a unique situation in that he is no longer
em ployed b y the Authority. You have told us o f the interest o f the Metropolitan Policc. You
have told us that you are going to see Leading Counsel next week. We will certainly leave the
matter in short abeyancc but as you will appreciate there are considerable strains in cash flow
terms and w e trust the Authority will both accept your recommendation in relation to fees and
C ounsel’s fees and w ill take steps to make a quick payment. A s to the future, w e obviously
understand w hy the Authority would like to see the tax position resolved. W c trust that w e are
not misplaced in our b elief that the Authority does intend to provide continuing financial
assistance to our Client and Mr Duckenfield. There is o f coursc a w ay in which tax would not
be a consideration and that is if w e believe that the Authority made a direct agreement with
this firm. The dow nside o f that is the ease o f Miller, which would suggest that in that event i f
and w hen our Client is succcssful w c may not be able to claim costs out o f Central Funds.
Y ou w ill he considering this method.

The urgent decision that is needed is with regard to the hearings on 2 0 D ecem ber
(adm issibility) and 4 January (abuse o f proccss).

A brief w ill have to be delivered to Counsel. W c think for this little package o f tw o discreet
hearings, Counsel w ould be persuaded to deal with the matter separate from the main issue.
The suggestion is that Leading C ounsel’s brief would be £15,000.00 plus V A T with refreshers
o f £ 1 ,5 0 0 .00 per day plus VAT. Junior Counsel would be one half o f both brief and refresher
fees. This takes into account that quite a lot o f the work has already been done in relation to
the abuse o f process hearing. You apprcciatc o f coursc that an enormous amount o f tim e and
work is going to be required i f this case goes to full trial and w c expcct that counsel then w ill
deal with the preparation on a time basis and then there will be agreement about a brief fee.

W e kn ow that you are concerned about whether it is right that the Authority should fund this
“‘second bite at the cherry” in relation to the abuse o f pi'occss application.

One could n o t unreasonably say that with such a high-profile and difficult case it would have
been a very brave Stipendary Magistrate who would have stayed the proceedings hi the                ;
M agistrates’ Court. Nonetheless the authorities quite clearly point to the need for the defencc
to m ake application at the earliest time available a n d 'th a t was before the Stipemiary
M agistrate. The High Court Judge is likely to be much more robust and o f course is a person
w ith significant additional legal stature who is more familiar to taking brave decisions and to
dealing w ith this sort o f application. We understand that you have had a copy o f the w ritten------
advice from M r William Clegg QC and that he believes that the application is evenly
balanced. I f Leading Counsel says this and you know that a success at this stage could
perhaps save hundreds o f thousands o f pounds o f costs, and with a Central Funds Order which
w ould overcome the problems mentioned above, and return substantial monies to the
Authority, and i f the costs actually involved are relatively modest then surely the Authority
should take the view that they would be prepared to fund this application.

We have not mentioned our own fees in relation to the two hearings.

W e told you that the cost o f tim e spent and work done between th e end o f the committal and
the beginning o f this m onth amounted to some £20,000.00 plus V A T and the majority o f that
really relates to these forthcoming hearings, particularly the attendances on M r Justice Collins
and M r Bill W oodw ard QC add some ongoing work with regard to abuse o f process. If you
strip out that w ork which is with regard to the general p 2rt o f the case w e think that our costs
up to and including 20 Decem ber can be discreetly stated as to the adm issibility and abuse at
an am ount o f £20,000.00 plus VAT. Our attendance at the hearing will be on the basis as
before o f no m ore than two people that is m yself and a trainee/paralegal at C ourt and one
person in the office to retrieve any papers or do any research as required. That should be able
to bo accommodated within the £2,000.00 plus VAT in total per day with the expectation o f
eight days in air.

Can yoti please see if you con obtain authorisation for these amounts.

I did tell you that w e had a meeting with our client on the afternoon o f 11 November. He was
                             p articularly at the news that had been conveyed about the tax
problems and the possible unwillingness to assist in the funding o f die abuse of process
iie^ihg 77If would Vc~ntcc' to tbink~that wheh welnext w rite to him we can .bring him some
more encouraging news.                   ...                       '

Y ours faithfully ; •

         Dear David

         South Yorkshire Police Authority

         Thank you for your tetter of 17 November following the two telephone conversations of that day.
         As I told you I am seeing Michael Harrison in conference on 18 November and I will contact you
         immediately thereafter to let you know whether he is going to be available for the hearing on 20
         Deoember. I spoke to Simon Myetson on Monday and he is almost definitely not going to be
         available.

         If Michael Harrison cannot attend then T expect that his fees will be reduced by three refreshets at
         £1,500.00 plus VAT each and Simon Myerson’s by the £750.00 plus VAT each day. I do not seek
         any additional amount for my own attendance or for the attendance with me of a colleague at Court.
         I have told you of the system used throughout the committal and which will be carried forward to the
         Crown Court namely, myself and one colleague at most at Court and one colleague back at the office
         to do any necessary research or location of papers as required at Court. 1 know that when we met I
         told you that my costs post committal to now axe approximately £20,000.00 plus VAT. I think that 1
         would estimate another £7,500.00 plus VAT up to the 20 December bearing.

         I note the meeting and that the members do not intend to invite any party concerned or legal
         representative to dejiver oral submissions.

         My own view is that with the help of the recent meeting, the quite voluminous correspondence and
         particularly the written opinion of Bill Clegg QC, that you art In a fall position to deal with any
         issue. You know how passionately I believe that both of these hearings are fundamental to the
         defence and the. possibility of actually stopping the proceedings now. if there is any other
         information that you feci I could usefully provide, I would be heppy to do so.

          I noticed that you have copied the letter to Simon Eastwood (to whew I am copying this letter) and
          he will obviously need to cheek whether, if Michael Harrison is not going to be present, Bill Clegg
          (who we know is going to be present) will want an extra brief fee for effectively dealing with the
          admissibility hearing for both defendants.

      D ear David

      South Yorkshire Police Authority

      I hope that you have had a note of the telephone call made to your office on 18 November,
      following my conference with Counsel. I am pleased to say that my Counsel will be available
      for the bearing on 20 December. It is an absolutely intriguing situation because we have
      ccrtain evidence (of which HFSG ate not yet aware) which we believe will persuade the Judge
      to rule as inadmissible the evidence given by both Defendants to the Taylor Enquiry. It also
      has consequences sofar els the admissibility of the enquiry itself is concerned. Finally, as you
      might anticipate, it strengthens our hand in relation to the application to stay for abuse of
      process.

      The practical consequences are:

      1.            The figures initially given to you for brief fees and refreshers for the two hearings will
                    stand with neither Counsel seeking extra fees for the work that will have to be done
                    between now and tht conclusion of the two hearings.

      2.            Our prospects of success in the abuse hearing are improved. Certain s'^tements are in
                    the course of preparation. I very much doubt whether they will be available to you
                    before the meeting on 26 November, but if I can make them available I will do so.

      I hope that this further information will add a little mere to the already very cogent reasons
      why furdlng should be provided to the two defendants from the committal through the
      admissibility and abuse hearing*.

      Yours sincerely

             Dear David

             South Y orkshire Police Authority

             I refer to the e-mail timed at 20.22 on 18 November. You will earlier today have received a fax
             from rr.e which was actually dictated at approximately the same sort of time last night as you were e-
             mailing me.

             Sofar as I can tell, as long as the bottom Une is that my Client will not be placed in any worse
             position and will always be indemnified as to consequences, there would be no objection to the
             instructions now becoming joint instructions.

             He will be encouraged by the advice that you have received from William Massey QC. What
             worries ma of course is the length of time that it will take the revenue to consider the matter and that
             is why some short term solution needs to be found which will indemnify ray Client for his costs post
             committal up to,and including the hearing on 3 January.

         1 have to say that the information that I am going to give you with regard to the hearing on 20
         December must be absolutely confidential at this moment in time. The Police Authority meeting is.
         I think, a public meeting, but even if it is confidential what I set out below must be treated with the
         utmost confidence. The public enquiry in which Lord Justice Taylor said that the question of
         prosecution of the two Officers or Indeed any Officer was not within contemplation, and on that
         basis neither Mr Murray nor Mr Duekenfield          cautioned before they gave evidence at the Taylor
         enquiry.

         It has been a "plank" of the prosecution use that they simply want to “admit the Taylor Enquiry”
         whereas they have difficulty with both the inquest and the Stuart Smith Scrutiny. Leading Counsel
         believes that it will be possible to persuade Mr Justice Hooper that since no caution was given that
         the Officers’ testimony to the Taylor Enquiry can be excluded, it follow* in the same w&y es any
         other criminal trial, but if their interview is excluded then much else can also be excluded unless it is
         capable of being directly led. Not only do we believe that this is a very important point, but the
         witnesses who speak to it are extremely eminent. I cannot say any more at the moment, bu t! am
         sure that you accept my word for it and I will bring you more information in that regard just as soon
         as 1 can.

        Hillsborough - Funding

        Dear Sirs

        Thank you for your letter of the 31s1 January. We have to admit great surprise that you have felt it
        appropriate to invite KFSG to make further comments on the funding issue.

        We have always felt that it was inappropriate for them to have any part in this argument, and they
        have been judicially criticised in the Divisional Court when Lord Justic Laws effectively asked Alan
        Jones, Q.C. “what are you doing here”.

        It has always, in our view, been unconscionable that the Prosecutor should try interfere with the
        funding of the Defendant being prosecuted.

        Turning to the discreet issue, the short position is as follows.

        This Prosecutor issued proceedings ill-advisediy in South Sefton. They ought to have known that the
        South Sefton Court had no jurisdiction because neither of the Defendants lived in that Division, nor
        had the circumstances of the alleged offence occurred within the Division.

        The Defendants therefore having sought legal advice did not attend to answer the Summons and an
        argument was successful mounted which caused the Summons to be withdrawn with an Order for
        costs out of Central Funds.

        The whole fault lay with the Prosecutor and with the Clerk to the Justices at South Sefton for
        accepting the information without making a proper enquiry.

        The one person who can said to be blameless in all of this, is our Client (and Mr. Duckenfield).

        This Firm carried out work at very short notice of a technical nature, and with considerable expertise
        and we were successful.

        We believe that to protect his own neck the Clerk at South Sefton is trying to reduce the damage to
        himself. He is accountable to the Lord Chancellor for moneys.paid out of Central Funds.

      We had our file sent to an independent Law Cost Draftsman. He was the one who prepared the
      detail of all of the work that had been done, and the cost of that time spent and work done. The bill
      was submitted to the Clerk at South Sefton. We have no doubt that applying the rules of self
      protection, that Clerk Firstly tried to find some technical basis upon which he could refuse payment
      altogether, and then secondly having had to concede that he was wrong in law, has sought arbitrarily
      to cut down the amount that is payable.

      Our Law Cost Draftsman (and we believe the Draftsman employed by Winckworth Sherwood) is
      convinced that were we to appeal against the South Sefton determination we would succeed.
      However there is a risk element and there is a substantial further liability for costs.

      Frankly we would like to take this Clerk to appeal and put egg on his face when he loses. On the
      other hand we understand that the Authority may very %vell feel that notwithstanding the sharing of
      these same thoughts, they are not prepared to risk further moneys and that a pragmatic view has to
      be taken. That view would see the Authority being responsible for the difference between the costs
      that South Sefton are prepared to pay and the actual costs incurred. You have those figures.

      What would be totally unfair is for Mr. Murray to have to meet costs in circumstances where one
      can truly say that this %vas in no %vay his fault.

      In relation to the costs claimed by the D.P.P. no bill has been sent to this Office and we believe that
      the bill delivered to Winckworth Sherwood represents the costs of the D.P.P. The Authority has
      already resolved that it would meet those costs, and therefore we believe that it would be in order to
      resolve to do so.

      Yfiurs faithfully

H illsb o ro u g h - F u n d in g

Dear David

I hope that this letter will arrive in tim e for you to carry it with you to the m eeting o f the A uthority
on the 4tfl February. I am in receipt o f a copy o f the letter sent to you by W inckworth Sherw ood on
the 2ad February.

I think there is nothing m ore for me to say with regard to the South Sefton costs. The issue is a
pragm atic decision for the Authority.

I note the costs assessm ent by Leeds District M agistrates C ourt o f that part o f the bill o f W inckw orth
Sherwood. It w ould seem to m e that if the M agistrates Court have accepted without reduction, the
whole o f the bill o f W inckworth Sherwood and are prepared to pay out o f Central Funds onc-quartcr
o f that total relating to the charge which was dismissed, then it would be, I would respectfully
suggest, im possible for the Authority (even advised by their Law Cost Draftsman) to then challenge
the reasonableness o f the bill.

You too are subject to the pressures o f private practice. We have been carrying huge amounts o f
unbilled w ork for a long time. I think it would be reasonable for the Authority to authorise the
paym ent o f our costs in relation to everything up to the conclusion o f the M agistrates C ourt and to
authorise the. paym ent o f the costs o f Winckworth Sherwood for the balance thut has not been m et
out o f Central Funds.

1 agree with the com m ents m ade in sub-pararaph 4 o f the letter as to the costs recoverable from
HFSG in the judicial review of the funding challenge. In my view the sooner that we do this the
better. T am worried that HFSG will be running the case on the basis that they w ill have enough
m oney (one way or another) to sec the prosecution through, but then wi l l have cleared out their
Bank. U ltim ately if we reach a situation where albeit that w e have the Order, we caimut enforce it,
those eosts are going to fall back on the Police Authority. I think it therefore not unreasonable that
they should authorise w hatever action is going to be necessary to try to pursue this b il l o f costs and I
agree with M alcolm Goodwin that instructions to Counsel are appropriate.




I think that w e could probably deliver a joint instruction.

 Sub-paragraph 5 of the letter really confirms my belief, namely that there is only one bill from the
 DPP, albeit that they would seek to spit it essentially between the two Defendants.

From a purely practical point however we are asking that the Police Authority meet the costs of the
Treasury Solicitor and I shall look forward to hearing from you in this regard, and indeed in relation
to the other points.




i  ours sincerely

        Dear Chief Officer.-'Clerk.

        This circular:

        • provides updated guidance to police authorities on financial assistance to police
          officers in legal proceedings.

        • distinguishes between .officers involved in civil proceedings, criminal
          proceedings and other types of legal proceedings.

           replaces HO Circular 77/1987.
 In tro d u c tio n

 1.      It is important that police officers should be able to carry out their duties in
 the confidence that their police authority will support them, if they act in good faith
 and exercise their judgement reasonably. The following guidance, which has been
 prepared in consultation with ACPO, the Superintendents Association, the Police
 Federation and the Association of Police Authorities, should be read against this
 principle.

 Civil Proceedings

 2.      Under section 88 ( D o f the Police Act 1996 which re-enacts section 4 8 0 ) of
 the Police Act 1964 chief officers are liable lor torts committed by officers under
 their direction and control. Section 88(2) provides that any damages or costs
 awarded against the chief officer and any costs they incur themselves (which are not
 recovered) should be met from police authority funds.

 3.     Alternatively, a court may award damages against individual police officers.
 Section 88(4) of the Police Act 1996 empowers a police authority “to such an extent
 as appears to it to be appropriate” to pay any damages or costs awarded against
 officers (this includes both officers of other forces serving in the police area under
 mutual aid arrangements and special constables), any costs incurred by the officers
 themselves and any sum paid in connection with the settlement of a claim. It is for
 police authorities to decide when to make assistance available, taking account o f the
 circumstances of a particular case.

 4.      Police authorities are reminded that the discretionary powers in sections
 88f4') and (S'! .of the Act, enabling them to provide financial assistance to officers
 involved in legal proceedings, apply to civil proceedings onlv. Sections 88(4) and
 88(5) may also apply to police officers who were members at the time of the action
 which gave rise to the claim but who are no longer members.

 Crim inal Proceedings

  5.     Section 88(4) does not apply to criminal proceedings, but police authorities
  may wish to consult their legal advisers as to whether they have any other power to
  provide such assistance (whether in respect of private prosecutions or prosecutions
  brought by the CPS). In this context, they may wish to note that section 111(1) of
  the Local Government Act 1972 enables police authorities to do anything “which is
  calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their
  functions” . The provision applies to provincial authorities (but not the Metropolitan
  or City of London police) by virtue of Section 146A of the 1972 Act (as inserted
1 by Schedule 14 to the Local Government Act 1985 and amended by Schedule 4 of
  the Police and M agistrates’ Courts Act 1994). It could be argued that to allow
payment to be made to officers (either former or serving) involved in criminal
proceedings would in some way facilitate or be conducive to a police authority’s
broad functions. For example, failure to provide financial assistance could
adversely affect the morale o f the force if officers had to meet their own costs after
an acquittal.

6.      It is for individual police authorities to decide in the particular circumstances
of a case, and on the basis o f legal advice, whether to make financial assistance
available to officers in criminal proceedings.      —             '

O ther tvpes of legal proceedings

7.      S i” MlarIv there is no exDrfiC<: statutory authority fo r providing financial
assistance in proceeumgs brougnt against poncc officers m tribunals orner than me
w u iis. It is for police authorities outside London (bearing in mind the
recommendations o f chief officers) to decide whether to make financial assistance
available to officers (either former or serving) involved in Public Inquiries and
Tribunals. Police authorities will therefore need to consider whether section 111(1)
of the Local Government Act 1972 provides sufficient scope to enable financial
assistance to be given in any particular case. In this respect tribunals may include
certain industrial tribunals where it is clear that officers have acted in good faith in
pursuance of their duties and the interest of the force as a whole is involved. It is to
be expected that, where appropriate, the service’s grievance procedure
arrangements should be exhausted before there is recourse to legal proceedings.
These arrangements are set out in Home Office Circular 16/93, issued 10 March
1993.

8.      There are specific provisions in the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Sex
Discrimination Act 1975 for compensation, costs and expenses awarded against the
chief officer of police and any sum required for settlement, if approved by the
police authority, to be paid from the police fund.

9.      There is no express statutory authority for providing financial assistance to
an officer wishing to initiate court proceedings. The considerations set out in
paragraphs 5 to 7 above apply to such cases.

  Dear Sir


  HOKE OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 77/87

  FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


   There is statutory authority in section 48 of the Police Act 1964 for
   payments to be cade fron the police fund to meet expenditure incurred
   by police officers in defending proceedings in tort. Also, acting in
   pursuance of it s general statutory duty to naintain TrP^d'Squar'e' and
   e f^tdreHt" police" force for its area, the police authority has
   discretion to neit expenditure~~inciirred' by officers in all kinds of
   legal proceedings where the officers have acted in good faith in
    pursuance of their duties, ‘or the interests of the force as a whole
   tre involved.    The purpose of this circular is to give guidance to
  .police authorities to help then in considering requests on behalf of
— 'officers for financial assistance.    This guidance has been discussed
   and agreed with the local authority and with the police staff
   associations.

  2.    The central principle which should guide consideration of
  individual cases is that, where a police authority considers that an
  officer has acted in good faith in pursuance of his duties or that
  the interests of a force- as a whole are involved, the officer should
  have the support of the police authority to ensure that he has the
  services of a lawyer and that he should not be out of pocket.     The
  following paragraphs provide general guidance to the different
  classes of proceedings.  Payments Bade to officers in accordance with
  this guidance will be eligible for police grant.
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

Prosecution bv the Crown Prosecution Service

 3.   An officer vho is the subject of a public prosecution for an
 alleged offence committed while carrying out his duties as a police
 officer is in the sane position as any other defendant and must be
 expected to bear the costs of his defence.    If he is acquitted, he
 should,   like  any   other   defendant,  look to the court for
 reimbursement cf his expenses.    If the costs are not paid, or not
 paid in full from central funds, the police authority are in a
 position to decide, on the full facts, whether or not to make a
 payment to the officer or to the Police Federation if they have
 provided the funding.    There nay be cases where it is proper to
'provide legal advice and/or legal representation even where the
 officer is found guilty.   This nay arise for example in test cases
where the officer has been carrying out a practice hitherto
approved of but is found guilty as a result of that practice being
 found unlawful by the court in the light of the circumstances of
that particular case.


Private Prosecutions

4.  A police officer should be able to carry out his duties in the
confidence that,   if he acts in good faith and exercises his
judgement reasonably, his police authority will support him.    If,
in a case where a merber of the public brings a prosecution against
an officer, the authority is satisfied that the officer has actec
in thip vav, the authority should provide or fund legal advice
and/or representation.

5.   Where a court decides that, a prosecution brought against an
officer was not brought in good faith, it cay order the prosecutor
to pay the whole or any part of the costs incurred by the defence;
again, if the officer is acquitted on indictment, his costs cay be
net from central funds.   In either of these cases, the question of
the police authority providing financial support to the officer nay
not arise.   However, where the costs of an acquitted officer are
not awarded by the court or awarded only in part, the police
authority should consider whether to reimburse any costs not
covered, taking into account the reasons, if any, given by the
court for failing to award all costs clained.


CIVIL PROCEEDINGS

Civil Actions   Against   the   Chief   Officer   for   Wrongful   Acts   of
Constables

6.    Under section 48(1) of the Police Act 1964, the chief officer
of a force is liable in respect of torts committed by constables
under his direction and control (which includes special constables
and officers of other forces serving in the police area under
mutu a l  aid  arrangements)   in   the  performance   or purported
performance of their functions.   Under section 48(2) any damages or
costs awarded r.cainst the chief officer in such proceedings, any
costs he incurs hies elf, and any. sun paid in connection with the
settlenent of a clain, provided the settlement is approved by the
police authority, nust be paid out of the police fund.      In such
cases, therefore, the police authority's discretion extends only to
whether or not to approve a proposed settlenent of the clain.


Civil Actions Against Individual Police Officers

 7.   Alternatively, the plaintiff nay be awarded danages against an
 individual police officer, though he cannot recover the danages
 twice over against the chief officer as veil. Section 48(4) of the
 Police Act 1964 specifically enpowers a police authority "to such
 extent as they think fit" to pay out .of the police fund any danages
 or costs aw’arded against an officer, any costs he incurs hinself,
 and any suns paid in connection with the settlenent of a clair..
 This   provision   applies  to   actions against    officers  of the
 authority's own force, officers of another force serving the police
 area under nutual aid arrangenents, and special constables for the
 police area.    In considering whether to.give financial assistance
‘the authority will wish to consider in particular whether the
 officer concerned acted in good faith and- exercised his judgener.t
 reasonably.   Where the court finds for the officer, he nay seek his
 costs fron the plaintiff?      should the costs not be ^ awarded or
 awarded only in part, the police authority should consider whether
 to reinburse any costs not covered,        taking ’ into account the
 reasons, if any, given by the court for failing to award all costs
 clained.

8.  Joint actions naning both the chief officer and an individual
police officer nay be brought in sone cases.  In such cases it is
inportant that any discussion of the nerits and quantun of the
proposed settlenent should involve all the parties naned in the
clain together with advisers even if they are represented by
different advisers.


Civil Actions Under the Data Protection Act 1984

9.    Under sections 22 and 23 of the Data Protection Act 1SS4 ar.
individual vho suffers danage as a result of the inaccuracy, loss
or   unauthorised   disclosure   of personal data    is entitled to
conpensation fron the data user.    In the absence of any case law on
these provisions,     it is unclear whether the acts covered by
sections 22 and 2 3 anount to. torts, to which the guidance in
naragraphs 6 and 7 above applies.    If not, section 48 of the Police
Act 1964 does not apply. However, the position         is broadly the
sane.     Under   section 38(3) (a) of the 1984 Act    constables are
treated as servants of the chief officer for the purposes of the
Act.    A chief constable is therefore liable for the acts of his
officers falling within sections 22 and 23 in the cane way as he is
liable for their torts under section 48(1).      The position of non­
police officers is less clear but it is possible that in sone c*sfs
the chief constable might be regarded as having liability for their
acts.    It follows that it would be proper for the police authority
to meet all costs, including any award of compensation, arising
frcm this liability.  It should be noted that the liability of the
"data user" under the Act is not vicarious but his personal
liability.  Therefore his own care in having instituted a system of
obtaining, checking and racording data which would reasonably guarc
against error and loss under section 23(3) of the Act should meet
his responsibility under section 22(3) and he should not be held
liable if one of his officers disregards the system established.

10.   Where compensation is sought fron an individual officer, the
police authority will wish, in considering whether to meet the
costs which would otherwise fall on the officer, to take account of
the same matters as in exercising their power under section 46(4)
of the Police Act 1964 (see paragraph 7).        Police authorities
should apply the same broad principles and in particular, meet the
costs of any compensation awarded against a chief constable where a
non-police officer is at fault and the chief constable is found to
have liability for the actions performed.


Police Officers Bringing Civil Actions for Defamation

11.   There may be occasions when financial, assistance is sought
from a police authority to enable an officer to bring or consider
bringing   a civil   action for defamation.      An authority has
discretion to give such assistance but it will be eligible fcr
police grant only if the following criteria are all met:-

     (a)   the defamation is serious;

     (b)    it relates to the actions of an officer acting       or
     said to be acting in the discharge of his duty;

     (c)   it has attracted public attention;

     (d)   to bring the action     is   considered to be in the
     interests of the force or     of   the police service as a
     whole; and

     (e)   the action stands a reasonable   chance of success.

Criterion (d) is central.  If only the reputation of the individual
officer is in question, he is in the same position as any other
citizen and must be expected to seek his own ramedy.         But an
allegation against a particular officer may well reflect on the
reputation of the whole force or be an example of wider allegations
against the force or a significant section of it.     In such cases
the police authority," provided the other criteria are satisfied,
may reasonably be expected to help to defend the reputation of the
force.




                                                                      4
        INQUESTS, PUBLIC ENQUIRIES AND T R I B U N A L

        Lecal Representation for Chief Officers

        12.  Any interested   arty nay be legally represented at an inquest
        but at his own expense since expenses are payable only to witnesses
        and jurors.   An interested party will n o m a l l y be entitled to be
        legally represented at a public enquiry or other public tribunal.
        Khere the interest of the force is affected, it will be appropriate
        for the police authority to provide at its expense for the chief
        officer to be legally represented on behalf of the force.


        Lecal Representation for Individual Officers

    13.    Separate representation for individual officers whose interest
    is involved nay be necessary.   For example, there will be occasions
    when (a) the chief officer's legal representative cannot reasonably
   ■be expected to represent the separate interests of such officers
    and (b) the police authority considers that such interests should
    be represented.   In such cases the authority should give financial
* / assistance to the officers.        In considering    (b) above,^ the
    authority will wish in particular to assess whether the officers
    are at risk of being held to blane for actions in connection
    the death to which the inquest relates and whether any such finding
    r.ight give rise to legal proceedings for the costs of which the
    police authority would be liable under section 48(1) of the Police
    Act 15 64 or for which financial assistance night be appropriate
    within the terns of this circular.


        APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

        14.    An officer wishing to seek financial assistance fron his
        police authority should have the opportunity in advance of as well
        as on the conclusion of the proceedings to subnit to the chief
        officer an application for financial assistance.  The chief officer
        should put this, together with his own reconnendation to the police
        authority for decision. * The officer should noraally be given the
        opportunity by the police authority to Bake representations to the^.
...■>   if he wishes to do so.

        15.    If it decides to give financial assistance, the authority
        should inform the officer concerned that, if the information or.
        which they based their decision to grant the assistance is shown m
        subsequent legal proceedings to be inaccurate or inconplete, >_he
        authority will normally expect to recover the money unless it is
        satisfied that no culpable misrepresentation was involved and that
        to recover the money would involve the applicant in substantial
        hardship.   On the other hand, if an authority refuses financial
        assistance and then discovers in the light of subsequent events
        that such assistance would have been warranted, then financial
        assistance should be granted in order to meet the reasonable costs
        incurred by the officer in seeking legal advice or assistance.


                                                                             5




                             *      (aq
Assistance fror. Police Federation Funds

16.  Under Regulation 19 of the Police Federation Regulations 1S69,
as amended, Federation funds m a y ’be used to defray legal charges
incurred by a Eerier in connection with criminal proceedings
brought  against him for an offence under the road traffic
enactments (other than offences involving driving vhen impaired by
drink or drugs or taking a vehicle without authority), or for
offences of causing the death or injury of any person, or for any
assault, or in connection vith his action for libel or slander. An
officer seeking financial assistance in circumstances covered b y
Regulation 19 should seek such assistance fron the police authority
in the first instance.   if the police authority does not consider
the request to fall within the terns of this circular, the
Federation nay then consider the application within the terns of
Regulation 19.   If the officer receives legal assistance fron the
Federation the terns of Kone Office Circular No 2 6/19 67 will
continue to apply.

17.   General enquiries about the content of this circular nay be
addressed to Kr Waghorn, Kone Office, FI Division on (01) 213 4208.

APPENDIX 21
                        ADLINGTON -v- MURRAY and DUCKENFIELD



                                                OPINION




1.      We are asked for a written Opinion on whether it is appropriate for Mr Murray and Mr
Duckenfield to continue defending the charges of manslaughter and misfeasance in public office. It
is understood that the Opinion will be considered by the South Yorkshire Police Authority.


2.      We have no doubts. Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield must continue to defend the charges. The
alternative, namely pleading guilty to the charges, is in our judgment unthinkable.


3.      It is perhaps a sufficient indication o f the merits o f the defences to state the consistent view
of the D.P.P. over the past ten years. In 1990, having received the Opinion from two leading counsel,
the Director announced that there was not a reasonable prospect o f conviction in respect o f any
potential criminal charges arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy. This view was re-stated by the
Director in 1997, following pressure from HFSG lo re-consider the decision not to prosecute. In 1991,
the Inquest juries returned verdicts o f accidental death, (and thus rejected verdicts of unlawful killing).
In February 1998, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny concluded that there was no material to be put
before the D.P.P. which might cause reconsideration o f the decisions not to prosecute; and further
concluded that there was no basis for re-opening the Inquests. On 18 February 1998, the Home
Secretary, the Attorney-General and the D.P.P. publicly stated that they had considered Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith's Report very carefully, and that they had no reason to doubt his conclusions.


4.      It is important that the HFSG justification for these private prosecutions has been a claim to
have found ‘new’ evidence, such as to undermine the earlier decisions not to prosecute. In 1998, Lord
Justice Start-Smith’s Scrutiny concluded that there was no basis for these claims. There is no
genuinely significant; new’ evidence, merely substantially the same evidence from different witnesses.


5.      Against that background, we are confident in our own assessment of the case. We, too, believe
that there is no reasonable prospect o f conviction. Indeed, it is our judgment that there is a strong
argument that there is no prima facie case o f manslaughter and misfeasance. We intend to make
submissions to that effect to the stipendiary magistrate at the committal proceedings. For that reason,
we are satisfied that it is a proper course to contest the committal. Further, at the same hearing, we
shall argue that private prosecution is oppressive and an abuse o f the right of private prosecution. If
the magistrate agrees with either submission, the effect will be to bring the proceedings to an end,
without the necessity for a Crown Court hearing.


6.      It was a considerable disappointment that the Divisional Court did not quash the D.P.P.’s
decision not to intervene and withdraw the manslaughter and misfeasance charges, (although our
challenge to his failure to withdraw the charges o f perjury against Mr Duckenfield was successful).
It is important that the Court’s decision is not misinterpreted. In view of the representations which
HFSG made to the Police Authority (claiming that we were profligate with public funds by making
a judicial review challenge against the Director), we think it right to record that Lord Justice Laws
expressly commented to Mr Jones Q.C. that the submissions made to the Court on behalf of the
defendants had been ‘highly arguable’. The fact that the Court ultimately rejected our submissions that
the Directors policy and decision were both unlawful is not an indication that our decision to take the
proceedings was wrong or unjustified. We are satisfied that, had it not been for the decision of the
Court to allow the Director, on the second day of the hearing, to produce affidavit evidence giving
some reason for his decision, we would have succeeded in all our challenges. Our sole purpose in
taking those proceedings was to bring these unjustified prosecutions to an end by the most speedy and
economical means open to us.


7.      In view of the tone of the representations HFSG has made to the Police Authority, we wish
to give our unreserved assurances that the advice we have given to these defendants throughout has
been precisely the same as we would have given to the defendants had they been privately paying
clients or defendants with a legal aid certificate. We consider it to be professionally improper to do
otherwise.

              responsibility to others.                 It i s not suggested that he

              was negligent in doing ao on this occasion.




              2:5     As the disaster hae been the subject of continued

              examination over the last ten years it is perhaps not

       APPLICATION OF LAW TO TBS FACTS

       4:1         It    is    this     crucial       exercise        that    determines .

       whether a prima facie case exists against Duckenfield.




                   First it ie cledrthat a duty of care exists and

       secondly, at least for the purposes of committal it is

       conceded, that the deaths resulted from his decision.

       In other words for present purposes elements one and

       four        are     agreed.         It    is   element     two       that    is    the

       crucial factor in this case.                       The prosecution would

       need -to           prove     that    the       decision        to   open    Gate     C

       amounted to              a breach        of hia duty of             care.      In my

       judgement this essential element cannot be proved.

       4:?         It is of course applying entirely false logic to

       look at the consequences of the decision and to say

       that because 95 deaths resulted there must have been

       a breach of his duty*                    When the S.S. Titanic sunk in

       mid-Atlantic the reason for the sinking was steaming

       at night in waters where icebergs may be found.                                   That

       not necessarily amount to a breach of                                 his   duty    of

       care.            In the light of hia knowledge at the time he

       may     hav«        made     a   perfectly        reasonable          and    lawful

       4:3         I aw eouaoiauB that no analogy ia perfect and in

       this         case       analogies      are     particularly     dangerous.

       However I aj» anxious to illustrate tho fact that in

       law you peed to separate the decision to open the gate

       froat the consequences.




       4:4         in this       ease Ducfcenfield was told by officers

       outside the Leppinga t«ene entrance that people would

       die ia the crush outside unices he opened the gate.

       In the agony of the moment he had to nake a decision

       in         the   light of the circumstances               as they    existed

       then*            Judgod against the evidence in the case in ray

       opinion           it     cannot          argued    that    that     decision

       amounted to a breach of duty.




       4:5         It must be remenbered that Duckeafield cannot be

       held vicarioutly liable for the failings of others.

       It io not alleged against him, nor could it be, that

       he failed to arrange adequate policing outside the

              police plan as used in earlier m&tchaa amounted to a

              breach of duty.             I emphasise that the prosecution do

              aot        rely    upon    «ithex   of   theae     as        evidence    of   any

              breach of duty by DuoJt«n£ield.                    They may, in certain

               circumstances, amount to a breach of duty by the force

               for the purpoeea of the civil law but they cannot form

               the       basis     of     a    case        of   manslaughter          against

               Diickenfiald.




               4:6       It is for this reason that it is possible that

               negligence could be proved for the purposes                             of the

               civil courta while no crime could be proved against

               any individual.             Indeed this hae been recognised by

               Lord Justice Taylor, Lord Justice Stuart*-Smith,                             the

                        prosecution.             In my opinion the magistrate ought to

                        dismiss the charges.




                        5*2        1 have not. addressed the third element that the

                        Crown need to prove namely that the breach of duty ia

                        groas.          This question does not arise if the primary

                        submission            succeeds.     Hovever    it would be arguable

                        that a daciaioa Bade in “the agony of the monient" in

                        the circumsrtajocaa prevailing at the time could not

                        anount          to   gross    negligence.      Although        normally    a

                        matter for a jury to decide it is capable of being the

                        basis of a. eubraipgion but if this were the only basis

                        open       to    the defence        I would be      less     confident    of

                        success than 1 pa<




                        5:3        puckenfield also haa open to him strong arguments

                        ten years he cannot have a "fair" trial,                         that pre­

                        trial publicity haa so prejudiced the potential jury

                        paael that a fair trial is not possible and that the

                                                NOTE




             This note is written for the benefit of the South

 Yorkshire Police Authority and represents my views on

 the merits of the defence of Mr.                              Duckenfield to the-

 two charges he has been committed for trial on.




             It         was'   obviously .a. ‘disappointment                  that       the

 magistrate found that a prima facie case existed and

 furthermore declined to                        stay the proceedings             on the

 ground that the continued prosecution of the defendant

 amounted to an abuse of the process of the court.                                         I

 propose to consider each of these separate submissions

 in         turn.         Annexed     to    this       note    is    a    copy   of      the

 skeleton               submissions        submitted          to    the    magistrates
1999    10:49       FROM UINCKUORTH SHERUOOD                T0       901132079001

court to support the application to stay and a copy of

the    judgement        of     the    court.      I have         no doubt       that

these     submissions          ought     to be    refined            and advanced

afresh before the trial judge.                        As can be seen from

the    skeleton         the    submissions        are      advanced        under      a

number        of    separate         heads   of   which         I    believe        two

warrant some further explanation in this note.




        The        submission         advanced        on    behalf         of       Mr.

Duckenfield that the prosecution contravened Article

6 of the European Convention of Human Rights requires

further explanation.                  This submission was dealt with

at page 24 - 25 of the judgement when the magistrate

held having reviewed some of the European authorities

        "The principles              laid down in these authorities

        therefore are no different,                    in my view,          to the

       principles          I   have     to     decide      in       the   abuse      of

       process application according to U.K. law s.“




       With due respect to the magistrate this is not a

correct         statement       of     the     law.        One        fundamental

difference exists between the domestic law on abuse of

process       and    the     protection        a citizen         receives       from

       Article 6.




               Under domestic law the burden is on the accused

       to prove on the balance of probabilities that he has

       suffered           prejudice           by    reason         of   the        delay.     Under

       Article           6     no      evidential             burden      is        placed     on     a

       defendant at all and the existence of prejudice is not

       a necessary ingredient of a "breach".                                       The Convention

       provides

               “in        the        determination            of   his    civil        rights       and

               The       Convention does not require a defendant                                     to

       prove prejudice to his case by reason of the delay as

       U.K.    Domestic              law does       and this crucial distinction

       was not recognised by the magistrate.




               The second submission that attention ought to be

       focused           on    in     this     note       relates        to    the     impact       of

publicity               in    the   case.     It was        submitted      that      the

effect            of    the    media    coverage      was    such    that     a      fair

trial          of      the defendants        is not possible.              Although

rejecting this submission the magistrate did describe

the coverage as

             "widespread,               extremely            v oluminous             and

            unrelenting"

and concluded that,

             "I do accept that the media coverage in this case

            is bound to create some prejudice against these

            two defendants, more so against Mr.                        Duckenfield

            than M r . Murray.“




            The        assessment      of   the   degree      of    prejudice         is

obviously a'personal one. and- the. trial judge would be

perfectly               entitled       to   conclude    that       the   prejudice
       t


found by the magistrate was such that no fair trial

was possible.




            I have no doubt that a strong case exists                             that

this prosecution amounts to an abuse of the process of

the court, whether in fact the trial judge 'will come

to the            same       conclusion is difficult           to    assess.          He

          will         need    to    balance    the   right   to    bring       a private

          prosecution               in   circumstances     where        the     state      has

          declined            to     prosecute    against     the        rights       of    an

          individual                to    a    fair   trial        not        brought       in

          circumstances of oppression and not prejudiced by pre­

          trial publicity.




                    It is clearly impossible to predict the decision

          of the trial judge, grounds certainly exist that could

          justify a decision in favour of Mr. Duckenfield while

          in one sense the high profile nature of the case may

          be       a        subconscious        influence     in         favour       of     a

          prosecution.

          application to stay, many cases in the past have been

          stayed on grounds less strong than those in this case.

          Whether in fact the trial judge will actually order

          the proceedings be stayed is a matter of speculation

          but must be evenly balanced.




                    In one sense I am more confident that the trial

          judge will direct verdicts of not guilty at the close

       of the prosecution case.                 This is a decision that does

       not depend on the exercise of                      judicial     judgement as

       does     the       decision     whether      to    stay   but    more    on     an

       analytical assessment of whether the Crown have proved

       the necessary legal ingredients which make up a prima

       facie case.




              In my judgement the Crown at committal failed to

       prove a prima'facie case against Mr. Duckenfield and

       the magistrate             erred    in   law in     committing them            for

       trial.




              The charge is one of involuntary manslaughter and

                  apply the principles of the law of negligence to the

                  facts of this case.




                              Arguably Mr.            Duckenfield               owed       a duty           of    care

                  to all those who attended the match and the standard

                  of     care       that    he    owed          was           that    of       a    "reasonably

                  competent          commander".                The           important            question           is

                  whether the Crown can prove a breach of the standard

                  of care owed.




                              The    causes       of     the           disaster            were       many        and

                  included          a dangerous         build-up               of     supporters             in the

                  area       outside       the   stadium prior                   to     the        match,        poor

                  police/stewards                to     control                 the        queue        at        the

                  or onto the pitch.

                  the        disaster       these      are        all          causes          that    are        not

standard of care to the supporters.




        With hindsight it is easy to see how the police

plan     for      the        match   was     defective       and    it    may       have

fallen below the necessary standard required under our

civil      law.         If it did this was a fault of the plan

generally          and        was    not     the     responsibility           of        Mr.

Duckenfield.              A person in command is entitled in law

to delegate             responsibility to someone he reasonably

assumes is competent.                      Here the plan was prepared by

others and Mr. Duckenfield acted reasonably in law in

accepting the plan as a basis for policing the match.

Indeed .it             was    not    suggested        at    committal         by        the

prosecution that he had been negligent in following

the plan or -allowing, the build-up of fans outside to

reach        a    dangerous           level.          This        area     was          the

responsibility of another senior officer who had been

delegated the task of policing that area.




        The       immediate          cause    of     the    disaster        was         the

decision          by    Mr.     Duckenfield          to    open    Gate     C    which

       overcrowding and consequent deaths in each pen.




                   The       order to open the gates was made following

       the        receipt           of a radio message by the control                   room

       stating               that     unless   the   gates    were    opened       someone

       would die.                   Against this background the prosecution

       did        not        suggest     that the        opening of       the   gates       was

       negligent and based the case against Mr. Duckenfield

       on the proposition that he ought to have prevented the

       supporters from entering the tunnel after the gate had

       been opened and that it was negligent of him not to

       have done so.




                   This       raises     the   issue      of whether       a reasonably

       competent              commander- ought £ 0._have         foreseen          that      by

       opening the gate he would cause gross overcrowding in
              *

       the central pens.                   It must be emphasised that it was

       never suggested that he foresaw any danger to anyone

       (this is not, of course, a defence to the charge, the

       relevant              question     is whether        a reasonably        competent

       commander              ought to have foreseen the risk and taken

       action accordingly).

                 Normally              in a case of involuntary manslaughter

        the    court will be assisted by expert                                evidence,       from   .

        for example a doctor, who will give evidence of what

        in certain circumstances a reasonably competent doctor

        ought to do.                  In this case no expert evidence is being

        called            by     the prosecution.                It    follows        that      the

        assessment               of whether       the       hypothetical reasonably

        competent commander ought to have foreseen the danger

        must be based on the other evidence in the case.                                       This

        all points one way and in favour of Mr. Duckenfield.

        Not only did he not foresee the danger but none of the

        pther officers in the control box did who all had more

        experience               of the       stadium       than       him,     nor    did      the

        officer requesting the opening of the gates,                                    nor the

        officer who opened them, nor any of the officers who

        had the responsibility of policing that area of the

        ground            and         could    hear        the        radio    transmissions

        requesting               the opening of            the   gate     and            latter

        complying with the request.




                In my opinion there is no evidence that can prove

        that a reasonably competent police commander ought to

        have foreseen danger to those in the central pens when

                giving the order to open the gate.                      If that is correct

                then       Mr.     Duckenfield      cannot        be    convicted        on    this

                 indictment and the trial judge will inevitably direct

                 a verdict of not guilty at the close of the case for

                the Crown.




                          I                         consider that Mr. Duckenfield acted reasonably

                on the day of the disaster, the tragic consequences of

^               opening           the ^gate    cannot         legally     (or      in   my     view

                morally)          be his responsibility and the causes of the

                disaster are far more complex and far-reaching than

                 him.




                          In 'this'       advice    I    have      sought        succinctly        to

           Dear Mr Harlock,

           The Queen v Duckenfield and Murray

           TharJc you for your letter of 24* February 2000.

           The HFSG does not >vish to attend the hearing on 10“ March We submitted comprehensive
           representations between December 1998 snd the judicial review hearing in March 1999,
           which wets delivered in person to meny members of the Authority, They have stood the test
           of time. Since committal, the HFSG now prosecutes in the name of the Crown, and bears the
           responsibilities of the Crown, and we are willing to give any factual assistance you may
           request.

           In the period of twenty months since this prosecution was brought, four unsuccessful attempls
           have been made, aii on effectively the same grounds, to have the case dismissed on the
           ground c? alleged unfairness, oppression by the prosecution, abuse o f process etc.

           In spite of the events of the last year, we cannot and do not suggest that the merits o f the
           defendants’ application for funding are different from this time last year. All costs issues,
           including tax implications, will arise again o f course at the end o f and after the trial.

 Dear David                         GOVERNMENT ACT 1972 AS AMENDED

 South Y orkshire Police Authority - Duckenfield
 M eeting 10 M arch 2000

 We refer to previous correspondence, in particular your letters of 24 February 20C0. and
 \ March 2000 in regard to the forthcoming meeting.

 To assist the Authority at the meeting we make the following farther observations ard as
 requested we enclose herewith the following:-

 1.            Copy Indictment, and
 2.            Junior Counsel’s Observations on Count 5

We have had the benefit o f seeing the Submissions made by Messrs Walker Morris on
behalf o f Mr Murray and adopt the comments made both as to detail and sentiment In regard
to the general issues relating to both Defendants.

The Authority Members will be extremely familiar with the background to this case and
indeed the Submissions already made on behalf of the Defendants. In the contcw of the
present request, which is to indemnify the Defendants in regard to legal costs and
disbursements relating tu the gcuciai Defence of the criminal proceedings leading to tho
trial in June 2000, we would remind the Authority of the Submissions made by our Senior
Counsel in his Opinion dated 1 August 1999, which together with his skeleton «guujcftt
was forwarded to you on 2 November 1999. This Opinion sets out Counsel’s general
comments in regard to the defensibility of this matter which axe still maintained.

What is in issue in the criminal proceedings is the conduct of 2 senior policemen acting in
good faith, in a moment o f unique crisis and in the ordinary course o f their duties as South
Yorkshire Policc Officers.

           Continued

           The Authority will no doubt bear in mind that the Prosecution has to establish, as a general
           outline,, the following:-

           1.         That the officers owed a duty of care in a lego] sense (which may or may no: be the
                      same as a police duty) to the relevant spectators at Hillsborough in April 1989

           2.         (Assuming number one is established) The standard of care that the Defondants
                       needed to attain on the day of the disaster.

           3.         That the Defendants failed to attain that standard (ie breach o f duty).

           4.         That any breach o f duty so established led directly to the deaths o f the victims (it is
                      fcr the Prosecution to prove that non negligent action by the Defendants would have
                      prevented the deaths).

          5.          Assuming all the foregoing are made out, and the negligence is therefore
                      established, that it was so serious as to be considered by the jury “gross negligence11,
                      and therefore worthy o f censure as criminal behaviour.

          The Authority will be aware that it is the Prosecution’s duty to prove its case beyond
          reasonable doubt, that is so that the jury is “sure". It is important to bear in mind that
          negligence issues are normally decided in the civil courts by reference to a lower standard,
          the balance of probabilities ie, whether one version of events is more likely than not.
          Notwithstanding the outcome of recent applications, the Duckenfield Defence Team are
          strongly of the v ie w , based upon the evidence served to date that the Prosecution will not be
          able to make out its case, and that the Defendants will be acquitted. It is important at this
          point to emphasise that the Prosecution have apparently not served all o f their material, and
          have recently applied for the issue of Witness Summons requiring South Yorkshire Police
          to make available further documentation. Naturally if any evidence or material is served on
          the Defence that causes the Legal Team to reassess its view c f the defensibility of this
          matter we will advise the Authority. For the moment however we urge the Authority to
          grant the indemnity request'd, to allow the Defendants the opportunity to vigorously defend
          a Prosecution which, as we have maintained throughout, we believe to be unfair and
          unjustified.

          The members of the Authority will appreciate that the present time is one o f great stress fcr
          our client as he prepares to deal with the emotional and physical burden of the trial, whilst
          at the same time awaiting the outcome of funding consideration,

          We have been asked to confirm his financial position, and advise that his financial resources
          are largely set out in our letter of 14 May 1999. The Authority will appreciate that he
                                                                                                     The
          implications oi maKing s Legal Aid application, and the potential risks involved will no
          doubt be to the forefront o f his mind in the event that the Authority is not prepared to grant
          the requested legaJ costs indemnity. In this context we reiterate our previous request that
          the Authority indemnify our client for his reasonable expenses incurred in relation to the
          Defence o f the Prosecution. The Authority members wjH appreciate his limited resources,


                                                                       TO     531122379031             P . 0 2 /1 1

                 Continued

                 and we strongly submit there ij no valid reason tc differentiate between        Mr Duskenfidd *
                 reasonable legal costs and disbursements, and his personal expenses.




                 We appreciate that the Authority must consider wider implications of this request, and
                 exercise its duty as a publicly accountable body in a fair and reasonable way. Given the
                 history of this matter, end the previous decisions, we strongly submit that the only fair
                 resolution to take at the forthcoming meeting, is to continue the support which die officers
                 have been given so far. Once again in this context, mindful that the request for indemnity
                 involves the payment c f large sums of money, we confirm our desire to continue the
                 transpzrency end openness with which we have liased with you in respect of the legal costs
                 and disbursements incurred. As ever, all aspects of w'ork carried out in regard to our client,
                 will remain open for scrutiny to justify any sums expended.

                 We would be grateful if this letter could be circulated together with our previous
                 Submissions and request, at the forthcoming meeting, and will happily clarify any further
                 issues that remain outstanding. Accordingly we await your advice of the Authority’s
                 decision at tire earliest opportunity.

           R v David Duckenficki
           Observations on Count 5
           1. Count 5 of the indictment alleges an offence of Misconduct in e. Public
           Office against DD

           The particulars assert that on 15th April 1989 ..h i
           •"Wilfully neglected to perform his public duty b y ......

                   (a) Telling persons inquiring into the causes cf the fatal overcrowding
                              that the overcrowding end casualties had been causcd by
                        supporters who had broken dowo a gate or gates to enter the ground
                        end
                   (fa) Allowing other persons *o Inquiring to continue to believe that the
                        overcrswding and casualties had been causcd by cup porters who had
                        broken down a gate or gates to enter the ground

           The prosecution rely cn whet DD allegedly said to Mr Kelly and Mr Kirton
           when they entered the control room at approx 3.15pm {the control room
           conversation) and a discussion that allegedly took place in the club
           bocitirooci later in the afternoon.

           2. DD originally the subject of an information alleging ‘attempting to pervert
           the course o? public justice*. Prosecution relied upon the alleged      to Mr
           Kelly and Mr Kirtoa rabout the circumstances in which Gate C came to be
           open*- per Divisional Court judgement in judical review.

           3. DP? / CPS considered th&t (a) not only no reasonable prospect of
           conviction but 'clearly no es.w to answer* -ie . no evidence of commission of
           affsase -hcwaver decided not to take over end discontinue - because
           associated v^itb ctlicr o^Tense of ajanslaaghter.
           Divisional Court quaabed decision of DFP/CFS with result thnt priar to
           coiattittfel hearing DP? took over and iritfcdtsw.
           Therefore no committal on any offence the basis of which was the ccntrol
           room conversation.

          4. After committal pros reinstated chfuge that DPP had tTjthdrswn • alleging
          that DD guilty of " making statements tending and intended to pervert the
          course of justice.*
           IS46 October 1999 Attorney General enters nolle preeequi on the         that
          there is clearly nc ease.
          Count S is variation of Count 4. Same facts different criteria. Important to
          note that prosecution da not have to prove corrupt or dishonest behaviour
          but a feUure to perform s duty which he was bound to perform anr* which is
          so calculated to injure the public interest as to call for condemnation. The
          failure to act in accordance with one’a public duty being without reasonable
          excuse or justification. The burden would be on the prosecution to prove
          that there was no such e«euae or justification.

          5. It is important to note that DD has not been committed for trial on this
          count so unlike counts 1,2- and 3 cannot be said that the stipendiary
          magistrate had considered the evidence and found that there was a prime
          facie case. Therefort: no judicial or other authority (magistrate at issue of

             Crown Court) has found that on this count there is a ease to answer.
             6. On 6^ June, at beginning of trial, defence will make application that
             count 5 ehould be quashed as:
             No sufficient evidence in committal statements to justify Count 5 toeing
             joined an Indictment The only evidence in committal statements of what
             was «f>id iti the control room is what said by DD to Taylor Inquiry.
             (i) The defence wall argue that what field at Taylor Inquiry on this issue is
             inadmissible* If inadmissible then count must be quashed as no other
             evidence. Similar grounds as those advanced in application on counts 1.2
             end 3 but on this occasion it can also be argued that DD had not been given
             any notice c f the issue or that he was going to be asked about it. Nor does it
             appear that Taylor UJ or Mr Collina was aware of this line of questioning and
             consequently had no opportunity to consider whether warning against self-
             incrimination should be given. This would be allied to the arguments about
             lack of representation and legal advice,
             Hooper J did not concern himself with Count S in either admissibility
             bearing or the abuse hearing. Judge said, that defence entitled to renrw the
             arguments on admissibility of the replies to questions on issue of whs* said
             (end what not said) to Kelfy end Karton.
             (i$ Even if admissible, what said by DD to Tayjcr Inquiry is 'insufficient to
             establish prima facie case on count S.

             Important to consider what DD actually accepted he said in control room
             and what he Aid not say and his explanation. pistLnguish from what «?an
             being alleged - for which there is no evidence in the committal statements)-

                   Conclusion,

                           1. In tbs history of this matter Count 5 first alleged only aitcr committal
                          2. Eased on same facts b s alleged in an information ( became Count 4)
                               which DPP found was not supported by any evidence and was
                               therefore withdrawn against wishes of this                    prosecutor.
                               Notwithstanding that charge withdrawn before committal reinstated
                               by prosecution after committal and then consequently subject of nolle
                               prosequi
                          3. This allegation never subject to any consideration by judicial
                               authorities as to whether there is case to answer. There are cogent
                               arguments that prosecution should not be allowed to proceed on it.
                          4. Ths only evidence on. committal papers on this issue te what DD said
                               to Taylor. If inadmissible then count must be quashed.
                          5. Even if admissible, the effect of DD evidence to Taylor was that DD
                              said that he had told Mr Kelly that a gate had hczn opened and that
                              fens had entered the ground but he had ncj told Mr XelZy that he had
                              given authority for the gate to be opened. What he had said to Kelly
                              was not a lie but not the whole story, He had given an explanation for
                              not telling b im the whole stoxy namely that in thfc crisis of the
                              moment he had he had made a decision not to tell him believing that
                              there v^as a xi?k of major public disorder if he had done so. There is
                              no evidence contradicting DD's account and explanation.
                          6. It is clcar that on DD’s account his behaviour osust be seen in the
                              light of the difficult ci?cutastances ir, which he had to make an
                              operational decision in good faith. Whilst it may be argued that he
                              made the vrong decision tbere is no evidence that it was net made in
                              the circumstances cf which he speaks.

             SUBMISSION ON BEHALF 0 7 MR. BERNARD DEAN MURRAY




TO:   South Yorkshire Police Authority




1.    We should like to record that Mr. M urray is grateful for the financial support •which he has been
      given by the South Yorkshire Police Authority and the w e'fare su p p o rt’which he has had from
      the South Yorkshire Police.


      Ie a written O pinion Mr. M ichael Harrison Q.C. has said th at no step has been taken in this
      action w ithout very considerable thought and that he has not advised w y eotion on behzJf c f
      Mr. M urray that he w ould not have advised had Mr. M urray besn m eeting his ow n fees, or if
      Mr. M urray had a Legal A id Order.


J.    As recently as the 2nd March Mr. Harrison has re-confirmed his view about the conduct of this
      case, and re-stated his preparedness to attend before the Police Authority personally to seek to
      persuade by oral representations that further fending shoulci be granted.

      Although it m ay be suggested that no success has been achieved in the hearings thus far, thst
      would be a m istaken conclusion because:


      4.1     Although he had no; intended to do so Mr. M urrey was obliged to be involved in the
              Judicial R eview proceedings as to funding, because o f the action o f H.F.S.G. in
              doubting the ability o f the C hief Constable to S-ek the Judicial R eview against die
              Authority, and the A uthority’s Legal Advisers were found to be in error.


      4.2     In relation to the substantive Judicial R eview proceedings. Lord Justice Law said that
              whilst he w'ould not intervene to quash the decision o f the Crown Prosecution Service
              not to stay the proceedings, he w ould also not have intervened had the Crown
              Prosecution Service intervened and quashed the proceedings. It w as that close, and it
              was only determ ined w hen the Crown Prosecution Service w ere allowed on the second
              day o f the hearing to file a further Affidavit.




                                                                 3W .1DS A i l O 1        Si'Ll   (S.lilO O /H V K -
\




                    4.3     In die view of both Leading Counsel the proceedings should have been stayed by Mr.
                            Justice Hooper at the last hearing and his decision is probably one which could be
                            appealed. However no such appeal can be taken until the end of trial. Nonetheless a
                            significant concession was achieved for the Defendants to relieve them from some of
                            he oppression of this prosecution.

              5.    Instraight forward terms the Authority has always intended “to defend” our Client. He has
                    always adamantly denied that he is guilty o f any offence.

              6.    The trial is the most vital time for support to Mr. Murray to be given.

              7.    The Prosecution have an extremely eminent Q.C. and Junior and very sophisticated hardware
                    and software,. .They have money still pouring into them in ?dd_ition_to the £J'2 in which was.
                    raised at the pop concert.

              i.    Press coverage has suggested that the decision to fond has already been made by virtue of the
                    public notice that £2m had been reserved from the Police Authority budget for the purpose.
                    Press coverage also suggests that Home Office funding is being provided against other
                    contingencies for which reserves had been made, and which may net now be required for that
                    purpose.

              9.    The costs claimed are scrutinised by a Cost Draftsman before approval. That way the Authority
                    can be certain as to the fulfilment of their duty as to public accountability.

              10.   In an unsolicited discussion whilst we were at the. Heeley Road Police Office a Senior Officer
                    expressed support for Mr. Murray and Mr. Duckenfield believing that they should never have
                    been charged, but at least were being vigorously defended and being supported by the Police
                    Authority. In our view were that to change there may be an enormous difficulty in discipline
                    and morale within the Force and it’s ability to recruit We anticipate that the Chief Constable
                    will deal mort ful’v with this point.

              11.




              12.
    IO




         10                                                                  3«VMDS A1I0             9 T : ; i 13 . 1 1 ) 0 0 , ' H V ! \ - : 0
       13.   The nature of these Prosecutors is again demonstrated by the fact tha; they are considering
             whether to make representations about this request for funding. It flies in the face of what they
             v,ere told in the Divisional Court.


       14.   In his judgement, Mr Justice Hooper remarked on the support being given by the Authority      10

             the Defendant and cleariy believed that the assistance was appropriate.

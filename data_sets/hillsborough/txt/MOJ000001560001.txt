                  Introduction

                  1            There are two sets o f applications, relating to decisions o f the South Yorkshire Police
                                Authority and the Crown Prosecution Service. For the first o f these, the South Yorkshire
                                Police has leave to move, but the applications for leave to move o f David Duckenfield and
                                Bernard Murray in relation to both decisions have been referred to the full court,

                  2            The Second Respondent has argued that the Chief Constable does not have locus standi.
                               This argument has been rendered academic by reason o f the applications made by the
                                defendants to the criminal proceedings, David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray,

               3            Issues


                            It is submitted that the following issues fall or may fall to be determined:

                            a)       Does the South Yorkshire Police Authority have power to pay the legal costs,
                                     expenses and disbursements incurred by the defendants in the criminal proceedings
                                     brought against them and any applications they may make for judicial review in
                                     connection with those proceedings?

                            b)       If the police authority has power to pay the legal costs, expenses and
                                      disbursements o f David Duckenfield or Bernard Murray, does that power arise as
                                      and when the costs and expenses are incurred or is it limited to meeting any costs
                                      and expenses incurred and not recovered from other sources?

                            c)       Were the decisions o f the authority taken in relation to this matter “null and void”
                                     on any other grounds?

                            d)       Do the defendants have a legitimate expectation that the police authority will pay
                                     their legal costs and expenses?

                            e)       If there is a power to grant financial assistance, should substantial relief be granted
                                      in the circumstances o f the case?


               Issue A               D oes the South Yorkshire Police Authority have pow er to p a y the legal costs.
                                     expenses and disbursements incurred by the defendants in the criminal
                                     proceedings brought against them and any applications they may make for
                                     judicial review in connection with those proceedings?

               4             It is submitted that there is no such power.   The police authority is a creation o f the Police
                            Act 1996 (and previously o f the Police Act 1964.) It may act only in accordance with the
                            powers conferred by statute. There is no provision in that Act allowing for the payment
                            ot funds for the legal costs, expenses and disbursements incurred by a policeman or
                            former policeman in defending himself in criminal proceedings, or in instituting ancillary
                            judicial review proceedings.

               The scheme o f the Police A ct 1996

               5            The 1996 Act requires;

                                     by section 2, that there shall be a police force for every area listed inSchedule 1,
                                     which excludes the Metropolitan and City o f London forces;

                                     by section 3, that there shall be a police authority for all the Schedule I forces;

                                     by section 6, that such police authority “shall secure the maintenance of an
                                     efficient and effective police force for the area” ;

                                                                        2
, 1 8 / 0 3 , 199 14 :26     01512361936                  H F S G                — >01719366802                       Pg. 04




                                   by section 14, that such authority keeps a “police fund”, into which all receipts of
                                   the police authority shall be paid, and out o f which all expenditure o f the
                                   Authority shall be paid.

               6           The Act provides expressly for the payment o f money from the police fund;

                                   Section 31 provides that the police authority may pay rewards to policemen from
                                   the police fund;

                                   Section 49 provides that the Secretary o f State may direct that the costs o f a local
                                   inquiry shall be paid from the police fund;

                                   Section 88 (2) provides that the police authority shall pay damages and costs
                                   awarded against the Chief Constable in claims in tort brought against constables
                                   under his direction and control; and any costs awarded against him and not
                                   recovered in such proceedings;

                                   Section 88 (4) provides that the police authority may “in such cases and to such
                                   an extent as appear to it to be appropriate” pay from the police fund damages and
                                   costs awarded against a constable, and any costs incurred and not recovered in
                                   tort proceedings;

                                   Schedule 6, paragraph 9 makes provision for the payment o f money from the
                                   police fund in connection with appeals to Police Appeals Tribunals.

               7           Sections 93 and 94 provide expressly that a police authority may accept giftso f money
                            and may borrow by way o f loan or overdraft.

               8           The Act provides further for the Secretary o f State to make regulations.

                                   Section 50 allows him to make regulations as to, inter alia, "‘conditions of
                                   service” with respect to




                                           (e) the conduct, efficiency and effectiveness o f members police forces and
                                           the maintenance o f discipline;




                                           (i) the hours o f duty, leave, pay and allowances o f members o f police
                                           forces.

                                   Section 50 (5) provides for certain regulations, applying to pay and allowances,
                                   to have retrospective effect, and subsection(7) provides that “Regulations under
                                   this section may make different provision for different cases and circumstances” .



                                                                     3
, 1 8 / 0 3 , ' 9 9 14:27     01512361936                       HFSG                       -->017 19 366 80 2                          Pg. 05




                                    Section 57 allows the Secretary o f State to provide and maintain organisations,
                                    facilities and services if considered necessary or expedient for promoting “the
                                    efficiency or effectiveness o f the police” . He may make regulations in that
                                    connection.

                                    Section 60 gives the Secretary o f State wide powers to make regulations
                                    governing the Police Federation, including regulations as to ‘■‘the use and
                                    management o f funds” (subsection (2) (b).

                                    The Police Federation Regulations 1969 (S.I. 1969 No. 1787) provide for the
                                    payment o f funds o f the Federation to discharge “legal charges” incurred by a
                                    member in connection with criminal proceedings brought against him o f a certain
                                    limited character, including proceedings for dangerous driving in the course o f his
                                    duties, but not driving under the influence o f alcohol.

               9        To the extent that there is any power to provide for the payment o f legal costs and
                        expenses and disbursements o f a police officer in legal proceedings beyond the limited
                         powers conferred by section 88, it is within the powers o f the Secretary o f State to make
                         provision by detailed and specific regulation. He has made provision in the very limited
                         terms set out in the Police Federation Regulations,

               10       The power to spend money, which the Applicants suggest Parliament intended to confer
                         on a police authority for the purpose o f maintaining “an efficient and effective police
                        force", is unspecific, unlimited, unregulated and entirely general in character, It is not
                         reasonable to imply an intention on the part o f the draughtsman to confer wider,
                         unregulated and vaguer powers on a police authority than are given to the Secretary o f
                         State.

                            The importance o f s i 37 and $222 o f the Local Government A ct 1972

               11.          Section 137 o f the 1972 Act reads:

                                    "A local authority may, subject to the provision of this section incur expenditure which in their
                                    opinion is in die interests of [and will bring benefit to] their area or any part o f it or all or some
                                    of its inhabitants...,”

               12.          S222( 1) reads:

                                    “Where a local authorities consider it expedient for the promotion or protection of the
                                    inhabitants o f their area -

                                    a)        They may prosecute or defend or appear in any legal proceedings and in the case of
                                              civil proceedings may institute them in their own name   ”


               13           These sections demonstrate the modem Parliamentary technique for making provision for
                            local authorities to incur expenditure. They provide a sharp and illuminating contrast to
                            sf> o f the 1996 Act and s i 11 o f the 1972 Act


                                                                            4
, 1 8 / 0 3 , ' 9 9 1 4 :27     01512361936                     H F S G                    --> 01 71 93 66 80 2                     Pg. 06




                  14.         The 1972 Act provisions demonstrate that where Parliament wishes to provide that local
                              authorities can fund litigation it does so by express provision, tt is submitted that the
                              Chief Constable therefore cannot call upon public funds to make the present application
                              by reason o f the decision o f his own police authority on 5th February. If it was necessary
                              for Parliament to make express provision allowing a local authority itself to be involved
                              in litigation, no power in the Police Act can be implied allowing a third party, such as the
                              Chief Constable, to institute proceedings at public expense, on behalf o f other individuals
                              (both o f whom, in this case, live outside the area).

                 h th lic policy

                  15.         The functions o f a police authority were identified in the 1962 Royal Commission on the
                              Police. These were (1/3 7fF, paragraph 154):

                              b)     to provide an adequate police force for its area, properly paid, equipped, housed
                                      and administered;
                              c)     to constitute a body o f citizens concerned with the local standing and well-being
                                      o f the police, interested in the maintenance o f law and order, and able to give
                                      advice and guidance to a chief constable about local problems;
                              d)     to appoint, and if necessary remove, the senior officers o f the force;
                              e)     to play an active role in fostering good relations between the police and the public.

                  16.         it is not part o f an authority’s general function to fund legal proceedings. That is why
                               section 88 o f the 1996 Act is necessary to allow for the payment o f costs and damages in
                               tortious actions. The principle o f public policy that makes an individual personally liable
                               for the consequences o f criminal conduct would be o f little value if he could be
                               indemnified in respect o f his costs in criminal proceedings. This principle expressed by
                               Lord Lyndhurst in Colburn v Patmore (1834) 4 Tyr 677,688 was applied by Denning J.
                               in Askey v ( w iden Wine Co [1948] 2 KB 3 5, 3 8 C-F:

                                      “I am clearly of the opinion that the plaintiff cannot recover any of the fines imposed on him by
                                      the justices, nor the costs he was ordered to pay, nor liis own costs       In every criminal court
                                      the punishment is fixed having regard lo the personal responsibility o f the offender in rcspccl
                                      of the ofTcnce. to the necessity for deterring him and others from doing the same thing again,
                                      lo reform him .... All these objects would be nullified if the offender could recover the amount
                                      of the fine and costs front another" [Emphasis added]

                 17.          The general principle that it is not part o f a police authority’s function to fund litigation
                              is specifically abrogated by section 88 o f the 1996 in relation to tortious conduct. If, as
                              the Applicant submits, the effect o f section 6 o f the 1996 Act is to allow wide-ranging
                              funding o f legal proceedings, section 88 o f the 1996 Act would be unnecessary,

                 18.          Further, as Denning J. pointed out in Askey [ibid] where Parliament has intended inroads
                              to be made into this general principle there are statutory schemes, At page 39 he said:

                                      "I am await that in Tiidinc v White Cross Insurance and Janies v British General Insurance Co.
                                      both cases of motor manslaughter, the judges held that policies against third party liability were
                                      enforceable, but as Greer L.J. pointed out in Haseldine v Hosken. in those cases the act to be


                                                                             5
                                                        H F S G                   — >01719366802                           Pg. 07

                               indemnified was one intended by the law that people should insure against. In eases such as the
                               pnjsem. however, the policy of the law is different."'

                       Section 88 o f the 1996 Act is such an inroad.

             Potential fo r abuse in an unregulated system

             19.       Parliament could not have intended to provide for a system, such as the Applicants
                       contend for, which is so open to abuse and manipulation. It is submitted that the
                       evidence in this case gives rise to serious concern The Chief Clerk to the South Sefton
                       Magistrates has sworn an affidavit. It has been placed in the correspondence section o f
                       the court bundles (2/575-6). He says (paragraph 4);

                               "The defendants' solicitors each submitted their claims for costs in September 1998. I was
                               extremely surprised ai the level of costs which were being claimed, particularly in view of the
                               fact that neither of (he defendants or their solicitors had actually appeared before the court in
                               relation to this matter.-'

             20.       By contrast, M r Manning, solicitor to M r Murray, referred in correspondence to the
                       police authority in November 1998 to the ^limited amount o f fees that are being claimed
                       from South Sefton “ (1/136). He also suggested to the police authority, after members
                       o f the HFSG approached the Home Secretary and the chairman o f the police authority on
                       6th November 1998, (a meeting referred to in the first affidavit o f the prosecutor at
                       paragraph 53 (1/175)) ;

                               “I leave you to decide the appropriate way in which you will provide the information as to the
                               financial support that lias been given.” (1/134).

                       The Applicant himself asserts that;

                               “....many tens of thousands of defence costs have been incurred so far.." (1/16, paragraph 34)

             21.       The prosecutor has written asking for clarification o f this figure but it has not been
                        supplied (2/556-8, 562 and 567). However, at the time the application was made, there
                        had then been only three remand hearings at Leeds, on 24(h August, and 7th and 21s*
                        December. M r Manning told the magistrate on 18( March 1999 at Leeds that he has not
                        read the 38 statements and supporting documents served by the prosecution in August
                        1998 because he feared he might not recover the sums on taxation. (2nd affidavit o f
                        prosecutor, 2/484-5, paragraph 40).

             The IW 6 Act; the legislative history

             22.       It is suggested by the Applicant that there is a sixty-year practice by which police
                        authorities have provided public funds in circumstances relevant to this case. The
                        observations in the Royal Commission on the Police o f 1962 at paragraphs 196 and 197,
                        see above, as to preceding practice related to practices before the development o f the
                         modern legal aid system.



                                                                       6
1 8 / 0 3 *99 1 4:2 9    01512361936                        H F S G                    -- >01 71 936 68 02                         Pg. 08




             23.        In any event, it is submitted that those practices did not survive the enactment o f the
                         Police Act 1964. The extracts from Hansard produced on behalf o f the police authority
                         show that it was not intended to include criminal proceedings in section 48 (1/92)

             24.        The authority of H v. Derbyshire Police Authority, ex parte Wilson The Times 8lh August
                         1989, is o f very limited value. No argument was presented that the Home Office Circular
                        did not embody correct principles o f law. In any event, the case dealt with the
                        reimbursement o f costs after an auditor’s inquiry; not with criminal liability and a decision
                        to pay costs and expenses in advance, nor with proceedings initiated by an officer.

             25         No other authority is cited to support the existence o f a sixty-year practice. Large claims
                        have been made on behalf o f the Applicant for such a practice. The Applicant has sought
                        to argue his case in press releases, one o f which, issued on 8,h February, quoted him in his
                        formal capacity as Chief Constable, when he announced the decision to apply for judicial
                        review, as saying;

                                "I hold a very Finn view, as do our legal advisers, that there is a firm basis in law. backed by a
                                long list of precedents, for these officers to have their legal costs paid. ' (2/277)

             26.        The solicitor for Bernard Murray, experienced as a solicitor in criminal matters, observed
                        in a letter to the police authority on 2Q'h November 1998;

                                "I believe that there arc numerous precedents for this view. It would be unconscionable for my
                                Client lo have (o use what Saving he may have and to even sell his house to defend himself."
                                (2/134)

             27.        The Applicant’s Grounds, and M r Daines, assert (Grounds, paragraph 20; 1/11);

                                "...Pursuant to their duly under section 6 of the Police Act 1996, and its prcdcccssor section 4
                                of the Police Act 1964r which is in vciy similar terms, police authorities nation-wide have as a
                                matter of practice over many dccades granted financial assistance to policc officers to defend
                                legal proceedings in appropriate cases."

             28.        Similar claims are made by the Police Federation (2/586-8), ACPO (1/35) and the Police
                        Superintendents Association (1/36). Examples o f such practices have been requested from
                        the Applicant and the police authority. See correspondence 2/264, 2/260. None have been
                        provided. The Applicant at page 2/254 indicated an intention to rely only on the Royal
                        Commission and the Home Office Circulars. The solicitors for the police authority said
                        simply on 18th February ;

                                " Our comments on this practice wen? of particular relevance to the question of leave and
                                expedition." (2/256)


             29.        Mr Robert Wood, o f ACPO and Assistant Chief Constable o f Derbyshire Police, indicated
                        however in a letter dated 25,h February 1998 ;

                                ‘ II is tlic uncertainty that surrounds the advice and discretion wliicli lies with the police authority
                                that has necessitated Ihe provision of legal expenses insurance funded by individual oflicers
                                through their staff association," (2/498-9)


                                                                         7
1 8 / 0 3 ' 9 9 1 4 :2 9   01512361936                  H F S G                 ->01719366802                       Pg. 09



            30.       The Home Office at prosecutor’s request had indicated that funding is being made by the
                      Metropolitan Police o f the defence o f three policemen by the Metropolitan police (2/487).
                      Mr Porteous, formerly o f the Solicitor for the Metropolitan Police, has made an unsworn
                      statement about practice in the Metropolitan police area (Duckenfield’s file CO/1070/99,
                      Eastwood’s affidavit paragraph 6, part o f SBE/1, page 39 o f Tab 4 ). It demonstrates that
                      the practices o f which he speaks derived from the days before the establishment o f the
                      Crown Prosecution Service when the police solicitors operated on a non-statutory basis.

            31        In any event, the Metropolitan Police are regulated by other statutes entirely, and have no
                       police authority: nor does section 111 apply to them. In spite o f the “national
                       importance” and “extreme urgency” claimed by and on behalf o f the Applicant, no single
                       example o f the provision by a police authority o f funds for a policeman’s defence to
                       criminal charges has been advanced.

             The broader legislative context; the relevance o f the Legal A id A ct

            32        The question o f the extent and scale o f the supply o f money from the public revenue for
                      legal proceedings is a public and controversial issue. Detailed and highly regulated
                      provision is made by the Legal Aid Act. A proposal to give police officers a more
                      expensive and privileged facility at public expense than is available to others would be
                      deeply contentious, and would require detailed and express Parliamentary approval.

            33        The legal aid scheme is available to a defendant but not to a prosecutor. Section 1 o f the
                      Legal Aid Act 1988 declares that its purpose is to establish a framework for the provision
                      o f advice, assistance, and representation which is publicly funded with a view to helping
                      persons who might otherwise be unable to obtain advice, assistance or representation on
                      account o f their means. Part V o f the Act contains the detailed provisions for criminal
                      proceedings, including the criteria for the grant o f legal aid (section 22) and liability to pay
                      contributions (section 23). According to Judicial Statistics for 1998, almost everyone who
                      applies for legal aid for criminal proceedings is awarded it. (Prosecutor’s affidavit o f 19lh
                      March 1999)

            34        By contrast, legal aid is not available at inquests. It is submitted that express
                      Parliamentary provision would surely be required for the provision o f legal representation
                      for policemen at public expense, where relatives o f the deceased have no such facility.

            3 5       The public sensitivities o f this matter are evident from the third affidavit o f the prosecutor
                      and the affidavit o f Philip Hammond o f 19* March 1999.

            Professional Responsibilities in relation to legal aid.

            36        Advocates have professional responsibilities in the grant o f legal aid. All members o f the
                      legal profession are under an obligation not to involve the legal aid fund in unnecessary
                      expenditure. R v, Silcott and others The Times 9,h December 1991. Bar Council guidance
                      provides that an advocate injudicial review and other proceedings must give detached and
                      careful advice as to the merits o f a claim. (AMA/2, 1/396)



                                                                  8

   37         It is submitted that it is inconceivable in modem conditions that Parliament could have
              intended to have allowed police authorities to grant funding with no system of statutory
              or regulatory checks, supervision, or monitoring arrangements.

   I he broader legislative context; the relevance o f section 16 o f the Prosecution o f O ffences A ct
   IM S

   38     Section 16 o f this Act provides for the recovery o f costs and expenses by a defendant.
           The Practice Direction (Costs in Criminal Proceedings) 93 Cr. App. R. 89 makes ample
           provision for the fair recovery o f costs where a defendant deserves to recover them. In
           these circumstances, there is no need to imply a power o f a police authority to reimburse
           an acquitted defendant for costs he had not recovered in accordance with this regulation.

   39     The police authority agreed to pay costs as and when they arose. The Applicant goes so
          far as to claim that costs should be payable whatever the eventual outcome o f the trial,
          that is, even if the defendants are found guilty. (Form 86A; 1/4. paragraph (3)) Such
          arrangements would offend against public policy

   The broader legislative context; the relevance o f section 111 (1) o f the Local Government Act
   1972.

   40     The Applicant argues that section 6 o f the 1996 Act in conjunction with section 111(1)
          o f the Local Government Act 1972 impliedly creates such a power.

                      111 "(I) Without prejudice to any powers exercisable apart from this section but subject to the

                                The definition of "function" is important and I would therefore refer at this point lo the recent
                              ease o f Hazcll v. Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council [1990] 2 Q.B. 697
                              (Divisional Court and Court of Appeal); [1991] 2 W.L.R, 372 (House o f Lords) where ccrtain
                              local authorities had engaged in speculative financial transactions and their power to do so was
                              in question. In tile Divisional Court Woolf L.J. reviewed section 111(1) and continued (19901
                              2 Q.B. 697. 722-723;

                                 "This subsection puts in a statutory form the long-established principle that local authorities
                              have implied power to do anything which is ancillary to the discharge or any of their functions.
                              The fact that subsection (1) is expressly made subject to 'the provisions of this Act' make it clear
                              thiil it is important lo construe section 111(1) in its context, Tire reference to expenditure,
                              borrowing or lending, etc.. within the brackets in the subscction do not themselves confer any
                              power to expend, borrow or lend money, ctc.„ but only make it clear that the fact that those
                              activities are involved docs not prevent the activities being within the power of (he authority
                              which are authorised by this subsection. The critical part of the subsection are the words
                              'calculatcd to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to. the discharge of any of their functions.'
                              Before the subscction can authorise an activity which is not otherwise authorised there must be
                              sonic other underlying function which is authorised, to the discharge of which, the activity will
                              facilitate or be conducive or incidental. What is a function for the purposes o f the subsection is
                              not expressly defined but in our view there can be little doubt that in this context 'functions'
                              refers to the multiplicity of specific statutory activities the council is expressly or impiiedly under
                              a duty to perform or has power to perform under the other provisions of the Act of 1972 or other
                              relevani legislation. The subsection does not of itself, independently of any other provision,
                              authorise the performance or any activity. It only confers, as the sidcnotc to the section
                              indicates, a subsidiary power. A subsidiary power which authorises an activity where some other
                              stamtoiy provision lias vested a specific function or functions in the council and the performance
                              o f the activity will assist in some way in the discharge o f that function or those functions."

                       In Credit Suisse v Allerdale Borough Council [1997] QB 306, 330 G, Neill L.J. said:

                              ”ll is clear from the spccch of Lord Tempteman in Hazell's case [1992] 2 A.C. 1 and from the

                              o f a local authority under section 111 o f the Act of 1972 it is first necessary to identify the
                              relevant statutory functions. The word "functions" embraces all the duties and powers o f a local
                              authority, that is. Ihc sum total of all the activities Parliament lias entrusted to it: sec Lord

              42   It is submitted that section 111(1) is of no substantial relevance to this application. Unless
                    the payment o f costs and expenses is part of the functions o f the police authority, section
                     1i 1(1) of"the 1972 Act cannot apply. For the reasons set out above, such provision is not
                    part o f a police authority’s functions.

        apply to the Metropolitan and City o f London forces which do not have police authorities.
        It is submitted that Parliament cannot have intended to confer a wholly new spending
        power upon police authorities by this 1985 amendment applicable only to provincial police
        forces.

44      The question whether it is proper to imply the power to grant financial assistance must
        by virtue o f section 111 be answered by reference to other statutes, notably the Legal Aid
        Act and the costs provisions o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985, as set out above.

                "'It is also accessary to examine the context in which the implied powers arc to be exercised.”

The relevance o f /he Home O ffice Circulars

45      The Home Office Circular of 1987 (1/64-9) is o f historical interest, but is not a good aid
        to the construction o f a later statute. The Home Office Circular 4/1998 (1/62-3), which
        can be used as one o f the aids to construction o f the 1996 Act, is informative:

        a)     it is now hesitant about the existence o f any such power as that for which the
                Applicant contends;

        b)     the test o f whether an officer acted in good faith and exercised his judgement
                reasonably is absent in the 1998 Circular in relation to criminal proceedings. No
                doubt a policeman who acted in good faith and exercised reasonable judgement
                will be acquitted at trial (other than in the case o f such crimes in respect o f which
                the Secretary o f State has provided for funding in the Police Federation
                regulations) and recover his costs. In other cases it would be against public policy
                to a llo w for the recovery o f an officer’s costs if he was convicted;

        c)     the suggestion that a police authority can come to the conclusion that an officer
                was acting in good faith and exercised his judgement reasonably implies an ability
                to prejudge the issue and usurp the function o f the criminal court;

        d)     it no longer makes a distinction between private and public prosecutions;

        e)     it places no reliance on any section o f the 1996 Act as providing the power for
                which the Applicant contends. The reference to section II 1(1) o f the 1972 is
                irrelevant for the reasons given above.

The claim ed distinction between public and private prosecutions

46      The Applicant attributes, apparently with approval, the following “reasoning" to the
        author o f the 1987 Circular;

                "...priim facic a public prosecution is properly justified, while the same presumption cannot be
                made with regard to a private prosecution".




                                                     II
jJ    k'.liL   Ui j .Z vi 61.936                 H F S G                    ">01719366802                             Fg. 13




 47        This argument is unsustainable, and shows a misunderstanding o f the historical basis of
           the prosecution system. The presumption o f innocence applies to each type o f
           prosecution. The concept o f “proper justification” for a prosecution is so vague as to be
           almost meaningless. Neither type o f prosecution is inherently more worthy than the other.
           Stephen J. wrote in “A H istory o f the C rim inal Law o f England" 1883, at Vol 1, pages
           493-5:

                     “The policc in their different grades are no doubt officers appointed by law for the purpose of
                     arresting criminals: but they possess for this purpose of arresting persons no powers which are
                     not also possessed by private persons.......

                     If, as is often the case, there is a private prosecutor, lie can. and does, manage the whole matter,
                     as he might manage any otlier action at law: he employs a solicitor who may or may not instnict
                     counsel, and who takes proofs of witnesses, brings ihem before the committing magistrate and
                     the grand jury, instructs counsel at the trial, and, in a word, manages the whole of the
                     proceedings just as he would in a civil cause. The course pursued is precisely the same in all
                     cases and whoever be tlie prosecutor. A prosecution for high treason, conducted by the Attorney-
                     General differs in no one particular in matter of principle from the prosecution of a servant by
                     his master for embezzling half a crown.

                     The Director of Public Prosecutions, when he has instituted a prosecution for the most serious
                     offencc, and one in which the whole country has a deep interest, lias no other powers than a
                     private person would have in rcspect o f the prosecution of a fraud which affected no one but
                     himself.

                     It is perhaps even more singular that the converse is true. Every private person has exactly the
                     same right to institute any criminal prosecution as the Attorney-General or any one else.”

 48        In Turner v DPP (1979) 68 Cr App R 70, Mars-Jones J. said at page 72 :

                      '..and issued a summons against liim, thus initiating a private prosecution against Saggs at the
                     suit ofTurner but in the name of the Crown, as is the ease in all private prosecutions.”

 49        In C om m v I Inion o f Pont Office Workers [1978] AC 435 at 477 Lord Wilberforce said:

                      The individual, in such situations, wlu> wishes to see the law enforced lias a remedy of his own:
                     he can bring a private prosecution. This historical right which goes right back lo the earliest
                     days of our legal system, though rarely exercised in relation to indictable offences, and though
                     ultimately liable to be controlled by the Attorney-General (by taking over the prosecution and,
                     if he thinks fit, entering a nolle prosequi) remains a valuable constitutional safeguard against
                     inertia or partiality on the part o f authority.”


 50        Indeed a defendant to a private prosecution has the additional safeguards o f particular
           close scrutiny by a magistrate prior to the issue o f a summons. In R v Tower Bridge
           Stipendiary M agistrate ex parte Chaudry [1994] 1 All E R 44, 51e Kennedy L. J. said:

                      So. as it seems to me. in any given case, a private prosecutor will have two hurdles to
                    sunnount. He will l»ave to persuade a magistrate to issue a summons, and thereafter, if he wishes
                    to retain control of the case, he may have to persuade the Director of Public Prosecutions not to
                    lake it over... The magistrate should have regard 10 all of the relevant circumstances of which
                    he is a w a r e '



                                                            12
33            - ^1^61936                     H F S G                   ">01719366802                 Pg. 14




 51        To assert that a police officer accused in a “properly justified” public prosecution must
           rely on his own means or the legal aid scheme, but a police officer accused “privately”
           should enjoy the more privileged service o f police authority funding, is obviously absurd.

 Financial assistance fo r ju d icia l review

 52        It is submitted that there can be no basis, in any event, for implying a power to fund
            applications for judicial review. The concluded decision to make application for judicial
            review of the CPS decision was announced to the magistrate at Leeds on 21* December
            1998 by counsel for both defendants, (First affidavit o f the prosecutor, paragraphs 21-28
            (1/170-1). At that time, a letter o f reasons or statement o f policy was expected, possibly
            within days. It now appears from the affidavit o f Mr Wilkinson that a decision had been
            made to apply for judicial review o f the CPS decision had been made before the CPS
            announcement. The minutes for 1 l ,h December suggested that (Affidavit page 1/173,
            exhibit missing between pages 2/406-7);

                   "The Authority stood ready lo give further support.''

 53     It is submitted that section 6 o f the 1996 Act and section 111 o f the 1972 Act cannot
         possibly provide a basis for decision to make such provision from the police fund.

 54     The proposed judicial review o f the South Sefton decision appears to have been
         contemplated not for the benefit o f the defendants or their lawyers, but for the benefit of
        the funds o f the Authority. The clerk to the magistrates decided not to pay the high costs
        claimed on the basis that the defendants had not incurred them; the authority had incurred
        the costs (see R «. M iller [1983] 3 All E.R. 186; 78 Cr App. R. 71). Nobody could
        possibly have concluded that the proposed judicial review o f this decision was part o f the
        function o f securing “the maintenance o f an efficient and effective police force for the
        area” within the purposes o f section 6 o f the 1996 Act, or section 111 o f the 1972 Act.
        It was an indirect way o f seeking to retrieve the authority’s funds from another public
        fluid.

 Issue B           I f /he police authority has power to pay the legal costs, expenses and
                   disbursements o f D avid D uckenfield or Bernard M urray, does that power arise
                   as and when the costs and expenses are incurred or is it lim i/ed to meeting any
                   costs and expenses incurred and not recovered from other sources?

 55     The Applicants also seek to imply a power to provide such funding “as and when such
        costs and expenses are incurred. (Form 86A, 1/4 (3). The traditional basis by which fees
        w ere paid at the criminal bar was on delivery o f the brief for committal or trial. The
        modern legal aid practice is to pay at the conclusion o f the trial, after taxation, subject
        only to the interim payment o f part o f the “refreshers” . There can be no basis for making
        financial provision on the as and when incurred” basis appropriate to practices at the
        commercial bar.

56              See also paragraphs 37 and 3? above, in relation to the Practice Direction as to the
                 recovery o f costs, and the arguments set out above as to public policy in respect o f
                 persons convicted o f crimes.

Issue ( ’                 Were the decision o f the Authority null and void on other grounds'!

57              The decisions sought to be reviewed include a decision o f the police authority that its
                previous decisions were null and void (1/3). For a reason which is unexplained, the
                minutes record that it was resolved that the decisions, involving perhaps millions o f
                pounds, were to be delegated to be taken in private by a single unelected official, the
                Clerk and Treasurer. (2/402-3) It is argued that this delegation was unlawful.

58              Section 101 o f the 1972 Act provides that an Authority can delegate any o f its functions
                to an officer. It is contended that consideration o f applications for financial assistance in
                legal proceedings cannot be said to be a “function” . Section 100G(2) o f the Local
                Government Act 1972 requires the Police Authority to maintain a list o f powers delegated
                to officers stating the officer’s title, unless the arrangements for discharge o f such powers
                are made for a specified period not exceeding six months.

59              The initial decision to delegate the power to grant assistance, taken on l sl August 1997,
                did not specify a period. Similarly the decision taken on 27'h February 1998 to delegate
                consideration o f applications to the Clerk and Treasurer, is open-ended. The Authority’s
                “Scheme of Delegation” (“AMAS”) (2/414) contains no reference to delegation o f powers
                under Section 6 Police Act 1996, or Section 11 ] Local Government Act 1972. Neither
                does the scheme contain any reference to the Home Office Circulars.

Issue D                   Do the defendants have a legitimate expectation that fu n d in g w ill be continued?

60              The defendants seek substantive rather than procedural relief in relation to their claim that
                legitimate expectation has been created in this case.

61              It is a principle o f public law that a statutory body cannot expand its own powers by an
                 ultra vires representation. If the funding sought by the Applicants is ultra vires then no
                 representation said to be made on behalf o f the police authority could create a power to
                 pay such funds. If it were otherwise any statutory body could expand its powers against
                 the intention o f Parliament simply by the doctrine o f substantive legitimate expectation.

62              If, contrary to the submissions o f the prosecutor, this court finds that the police authority
                 did have power to make the payments in issue, then the question o f legitimate expectation
                 arises. It is submitted that no legitimate expectation has been or could be created.

63              In R v Jockey ( lu b ex parte RAM Racecourses [1993] 2 All ER 225, 236h - 237b, Stuart-
                 Smith LJ set out five criteria which must be met to establish a legitimate expectation:

                          (1)           a clear and unambiguous representation;
                          (2)           the representation was made directly to the applicant o r the applicant was
                                         within a class o f persons entitled to rely on the representation;

                                                                 14

                (3)       the applicant relied on the representation;
                (4)       that it did so to its detriment ( in some cases this may not be necessary);
                (5)       that there is no overriding interest arising from the respondent’s duties
                           entitling them to resile from their representation.

64   In the area o f legitimate expectation creating a substantive remedy the principles are not
     yet firmly settled. The learned authors o f D e Smith W oolf and Jowe II at 13 - 030, page
      572, distilled from the authorities the following principles:

                a)        the representation must be based on full disclosure;
                b)        the representation must be made by a person with actual or ostensible
                          authority to make the representation;
                c)        the representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid o f relevant
                          qualification.

65   There is an application for financial assistance in the papers from M r Murray. Requests
     to disclose the application by M r Duckenfield have been refused. Moreover, the Applicant
     has refused, to disclose despite repeated attempts for disclosure, the ‘clear
     representations’ relied upon in the form 86a at paragraph 34. (Form 86A, 1/16)

66   Itis submitted that the representation made by Murray was not made upon the basis o f
     full disclosure o f all the relevant issues in the case for the reasons set out in in the
     affidavit o f the prosecutor at paragraph 87, embodied here for ease o f reference.

67   The true and detailed facts are set out in the material provided to the Authority on 5*
     January 1999 in Exhibit AMA/1 (l/186ff) , and which were provided to the Applicant.
     They undermine seriously the factual claims and assumptions made in the Grounds. The
     facts show, inter alia, th a t:

                (A)       The Applicant, with presumably the support o f the Authority, has always
                          accepted that the deaths o f the 96 victims were caused by negligence
                          (letter o f 5<h January 1999, paragraphs 9 to 10);

                (B)       The Applicant has accepted, or at least has never challenged, the findings
                          o f Lord Taylor that the negligence o f which the defendants are accused
                          was “a blunder o f the first magnitude”, and an immediate cause o f death;
                          (5lh January, paragraphs 8 to 10, AM A/4, and Dividers C and D)

                (C)       The negligence o f which the defendants are accused cannot on any view
                          o f the facts be attributed to a “split-second decision”.(AMA/4, tetter o f 5,h
                          January 1999, Divider C and D)

                (D)       The Police Complaints Authority directed in July 1991 that the defendants
                          should face charges o f neglect o f duty. (At that time, Duckenfield had
                          been suspended from duty for two years. Two weeks after the PC A
                          direction, Duckenfield, though suspended, went on “sick leave”. The
                          Chief Constable retired him from the force on “medical grounds” in

                          November. The charge against him therefore lapsed. It was then
                          considered unfair to proceed against M urray Next year, Murray, too,
                          retired from the force on “health grounds” ,)

                  (E)    The failure o f the Applicant to disclose the fact o f the disciplinary
                          proceedings on his application for leave in this case is in itself a most
                         serious failure o f the duty to make full and frank disclosure.

                  (F)    The negligence o f the defendants and, vicariously, the Applicant, was
                         much worse than was presented to the Taylor Inquiry, Crown Prosecution
                         Service, Coroner’s inquest and Police Complaints Authority. The South
                         Yorkshire Police, with the advice o f their lawyers, Hammond Suddards,
                         deliberately edited out o f the statements o f over a hundred junior officers
                         factual criticisms o f senior officers, facts about previous policing o f the
                         ground the year before, and other factual material discreditable to the
                         defendants and the force. That force ensured, with the connivance of the
                         West Midlands Police, that only the edited, uncritical versions, were sent
                         to the CPS, Police Complaints Authority, and Coroner. (AMA/4, Divider
                         G)

                  (G)     The lie told by David Duckenfield, when it was apparent to him that
                          deaths had occurred and a judicial inquiry would be inevitable, was not
                          relayed just to Mr Kelly and M r Kirton o f the Football Association, but
                          much more widely and systematically as the disaster became clear (see
                          AMA/4, Divider E).

                  (H)    Even the angle lie attributed to Duckenfield was described by Lord Justice
                         Stuart-Smith, whose report the Authority referred to in agreeing in
                         principle to applications for financial assistance in February 1998, as a
                         “disgraceful lie”.

                  (I)    It has been an important part o f the prosecution’s presentation to the CPS
                          in 1998, and the Authority in December 1998 and January 1999, that the
                          CPS, PCA and Coroner were misled about the strength o f the case, and
                          that the West Midlands police, as has now become clear, was not
                          independent in assisting the four investigations in this case. In reality, that
                          force regarded itself as the agent o f the South Yorkshire police in the
                          collection, disposal and supply of information, (This argument was
                          developed in detail in the file sent to the Authority on 5,h January (see
                          AMA/4, Divider F))

Issue E                  I f there is a power to grantfinancial assistance, should substantial relief
                         be granted in the circumstances o f the case?

68        For the same reasons, substantive relief should be refused, even if there is power to grant
          substantive relief The Divisional Court should deal with this in order to prevent renewed
          and tim c-consum ing proceedings before the police authority.

69    The interests o f the defendants and the Chief Constable may be different in this case. In
      the light o f the matters relied upon in paragraph 66 above it is in the interests o f justice
      that the defendants are represented by lawyers who are not paid for by a police authority
      whose Chief Constable has a powerful interest in maintaining exclusive control over so
      many documents o f relevance to the case.

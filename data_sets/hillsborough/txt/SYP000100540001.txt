BEVERLEY THOMAS



POLICE CONSTABLE 3347



'B' SUB-DIVISION



At 9-00 am on Saturday        15 April       1989,   I came on duty at Barnsley Police

Station, where together with a number of other officers, were transported to

Hillsborough Football Ground for a briefing at 10.00 am.

I was on serial No 14, the Inspector in charge of this serial was Inspector

White.    The other officers on this serial were as follows:-

             PS 13^1 Crawford

             PC 1002 Wild

             PC 1278 Lang

             PC     975 Washington

             PC 3232 Burton

             PC 2806 Butler

             PC     136 Smallman

             PC 1777 Branston

             PC 2819 McManus

             PC 2887 Grant

At 11.00 am, or possibly a little before that time, Serial 14, together with

another    serial    consisting of    'B2'    Sub-Division   officers,   attended   at   the

rear of the terraces on the West Stand, where Inspector White explained what

we were required to do that day.

Serial    14 was deployed    inside   the ground at the Leppings Lane end of the

ground.    We were to search supporters entering the ground at turnstiles A-G.
I    was   working   in    the   company   of   Police      Constable    2806    Butler   and   our

attention was mainly focused on turnstile C.

Shortly after 11.00 am, Serial 14 took up positions at the turnstiles and at

about 11.15 am, turnstiles A-B were open.                   Through the turnstile you could

see that there was another serial deployed outside the ground who were also

there to search supporters.

By 12 noon,     all the      turnstiles     (A-G) were      open,   but supporters were only

coming through in dribs and drabs and the serial outside                         the ground were

able to search those persons.              However, Inspector White insisted that such

persons be searched a second time by Serial 14.                       The supporters'     feelings

about this were mixed, some did not mind, others found this offensive.

By   approximately        2.20   pm,   supporters    were    coming    through   the   turnstiles

quickly and there were not enough officers present to search every person

entering the ground.

Through the turnstile you could see that people were being pushed right up

to them, but I could not see past the first three or four people outside the

ground to see how big the crowd was.                People were coming through and we were

still trying to search them.            However, some people were saying that we would

be better off dealing with the crowd outside rather than searching them.

By about 2.30 pm,          supporters were beginning to climb over the top of the

turnstiles, these persons apparently had tickets and were throwing them into

the crowd outside the ground.

A short time after this I noticed that Gate C was open and a large number of

supporters came flooding into the ground.                   I do not know how the gates had

become opened.

I cannot give a number of how many persons came into the ground but it was a

terrific amount.
                                                 -    3   -




The   mood of these persons was that they were either angry or triumphant-                                         I

will explain this       as follows.           Some people entering by Gate C had tickets

and   some had not.         Due to the enormity of the crowd, it was impossible for

any   of us to control them, to          check to see if they had tickets or to search

them as we had been deployed to do.

After a short time, a matter of about one minute, Police Officers, I recall

Police    Sergeant    Crawford,        Police    Constable               McManus       and    Police    Constable

Grant, were able to close Gate C.

The crowd that had rushed through the gate seemed to congregate around the

area between Gate C and the West Stand congesting the area totally.                                            I was

continually    asking       people    to move        back          or    to    go    to    the   area   they were

supposed    to be    in and     this was        replied            by    them       either saying       they    were

waiting for friends or abuse or people being both abusive and angry.

The   supporters     were    angry because           there         was    apparently an enormous               crowd

outside    the ground and they were insisting that we do something about it.

Unfortunately, we could not do anything, we had no radios for communication

and I had not seen Inspector White since                            about       1.00 pm.         As a matter of

fact, I never saw him again that day.

Supporters    were    saying    get     out     there         do    something,            there's   people     being

crushed to death out there.              I noticed that there was some sort of message

being passed over the ground's tannoy but the noise of the crowd was so loud

that no-one was able to hear.

As all     this had been happening,             people         had still been coming through the

turnstiles.         However,     the     condition            of        some    of    these       was   very    bad,

especially the women and children.                   The people were pale and you could see

that they were sweating and having difficulty breathing.                                         I tried to help

those people as best I could.

The    next     thing    I     remember   was       another       crowd   of    supporters   flooding     in

through Gate C.          I looked over in the direction of the gate and saw that it

was open again and officers were attempting to close it.                                The state of the

crowd was the same as I had described before.                            It was also obvious that many

of the persons had been drinking, however, it was impossible to do anything

about these people.

Needless to say, at this stage it had already become impossible to continue

searching people.            There was nothing whatsoever that we could do to make the

situations any better.

I remember hearing a loud cheer from the area inside the stand and the crowd

that had gathered between the West Stand and Gate C suddenly all ran towards

the central tunnel which leads onto the terraces in front of the West Stand

and the area behind the stand became virtually empty.                              However, people were

still coming through the turnstiles.                     The time was about 3-00 pm.

I must admit it, the last 30 minutes I was the most worried I had been in my

entire       life because       there were      only     11 Police Officers          and god knows how

many fans and we were powerless to do anything.

I remembered next an Inspector, whose name I do not know, come running from

behind the West Stand to us and telling us to go onto the pitch.                                The whole

of Serial 14 followed the Inspector round behind the Police Control and onto

the pitch from the South Stand.

At    this    stage we did not know why we were going onto the pitch.                                 As we

reached the pitch I could not see any players.                            I could see fans running out

on    the    pitch and       it appeared       at    that        stage   that   they were    invading    the

pitch.        There     were    also   other    officers           coming onto    the   pitch   and     they

appeared to be forming a cordon along the 18 yard line in front of the West

    Stand.

    I   was     facing the West Stand and saw fans pushing towards the front,                          some

    being lifted into the stand from the terraces.                       As I looked at the terraces

    I can only remember looking at parts CS and CN marked on the plan.                            However,

    I remember seeing a fan at              the    top of the West Stand swinging along the

    rafters by his arms.           I remember also seeing one fan being lifted from the

    terraces into the West Stand.               He was almost in the West Stand but fell to

    the floor.         At this point it still appeared as though what I could see were

    just acts of hooliganism.

    The next      thing was      that Police Officers ran from the 18 yard line to the

    wire fence at the Centre South and Centre North areas.                           I followed suit but

    did not realise that it was anything more than bad behaviour from the crowd.

    I   canrecall Police Sergeant           Crawford telling our              serial    to try and     stay

    together.

    When    I   reached    the    fencing   I     could      see    that persons     were   being crushed

    against      the   fencing.      However,      it       still   did not   seem     as   serious   as   it

    apparently was.        I could not understand from being stood further back on the

    pitch why persons did not move further back as there appeared to have been

    room.

    Other       officers had begun opening gates and lifting people over the fences.

    I   stood to the left of gate 3 as you look from the pitch and remember                            part

    of a blue barrier being thrown at us Police Officers.

    A Policewoman who I do not know came to me and said,                           "There's little kids

    dying".       I looked at the fence again and saw that people were pushed up to

    the fence with so much pressure that their faces were being pushed almost

    through the fence and some people were turning blue, others were being sick
                                                                                               Ki i t
                                                -    6   -




and it was instantly obvious that some were already dead.

I remember speaking to one woman and trying to encourage her to attempt to

climb up, but the pressure was so great behind her that she was unable to.

I then tried to help people climb over the fence to get onto the pitch.

When a few people had got out, I went to check that they were okay.                     After I

had done       that with two people,      I returned to the fence but was unable to get

near enough to help and realised I would bebetter helping                    the ones as other

officers       were getting them out.

Together       with Police Constable3232 Burton,               I went to one Liverpool fan and

saw    that    his    friends   had brought         an   advertising   hoarding to put him on.

This man was alive, however, he was far from well.                     We helped the fans place

him on the board then we placed him in the recovery position and I placed

something soft under his head.             Then, together with Police Constable Burton

and his friends, we carried the man to the area between the North Stand and

the Spion Kop.           When we reached this part of the pitch I returned to the

Leppings Lane terrace.           There was what appeared to be a pile of dead bodies

of    people    who    had   evidently   been       crushed or    trampled upon.    There   were

approximately 15         to 20 bodies of people who had obviously been dead for a

long time.        On the top of the pile I remember seeing a young woman only a

little younger than myself.



I    realised    there    was   nothing I could do           for the people remaining on the

terrace, so returned to the pitch where I saw a mass of people.                      I was able

to assist some people by putting them in the recovery position and remaining

with them for a little while to ensure their full recovery.

    While     officers    were    trying to help people,                abuse was being received from

    fans,     some of the fans,         although I believe the majority of them genuinely

    wanted     to help.       Others were        trying to help their friends               and would not

    allow officers to show them the correct ways.

    I do not recall while I was on the pitch seeing anyone above the rank of

    Sergeant.

    Eventually, everyone began leaving the ground.                         All bodies were removed and

    our serial was then instructed to escort Liverpool fans from Leppings Lane

    to Penistone Road roundabout.                At this stage, our serial had the addition of

    Police Constable         2083 Parker,        but was minus Police Constable 2819 McManus

    and Police Constable 2887 Grant,                who were still dealing with bodies.                  At

    this time we did not know how many people had died.

    We returned to the ground where we sat in the North Stand awaiting any jobs

    that may need doing.

    Further     to   this    I   have     only    worked         one    previous    semi-final   match   at

    Hillsborough       and   that   was    last     year         when   Liverpool    were   playing   Notts

    Forest,    as    this year.     However,       I was deployed at the rear of the North

    Stand and did not encounter any problems.

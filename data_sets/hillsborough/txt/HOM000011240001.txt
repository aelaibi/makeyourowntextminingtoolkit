The Mirror article contains a number of inaccuracies.   You could
point out:

1.   Safety standards at soccer grounds are already controlled
by law in safety certificates issued by local authorities under
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. They have all the power
they need to implement recommendations from the interim Taylor
report.

2.   The interim report did not call upon clubs to pull down
perimeter fences; merely to ensure that the gates were painted
in distinctive colours and left open during the match.

3.   Perimeter fence gates which release under crowd pressure
would not necessarily meet the criteria for crush barriers in the
Green Guide.   At present the Home Office would regard them as
potentially dangerous for certain uses.

4.   There is no squabbling over the nature of the agreements
between the police and the clubs.    What has been identified is
that there is a wide range of different types of agreement either
in existence    or being prepared,      some of which may be
inappropriate for legal reasons. The important issue, addressed
by Taylor, was that the clubs should agree with the police to
what extent each was responsible for crowd safety.       The Home
Office believe that there is in practice agreement at all league
grounds.   The difficulty over the formal documents should not
affect the practical arrangements and in any case we expect it
to be resolved quickly.

5.   The general position is that the Home Office has been
monitoring the way in which clubs and local authorities have been
implementing the recommendations from the Taylor interim report.
All the evidence available to us is that both clubs and local
authorities have gone out of their way to ensure that the
recommendations are complied with. Practical difficulties have
been identified in one or two cases, but in almost every case an
alternative solution has been found to ensure that safety
standards are maintained.

   You wrote to me m os t h el p f u l l y on 2 O c to b e r 1989 in
   c o n ne c ti on with the above m at t er and I was able s u b s e q u e n t l y
   to copy your l etter to all Chief C o ns t a b l e s to assist them
   in their d i sc u s s io n s with f oo tb al l clubs as toge th er they
   seek to give effect to Lord Just ic e T a y l o r ’s s e ns ib le and
   thou gh tf ul rec ommen da ti on s.

   I regret to say, however, that the s i t u at i on is still u n cl e a r
   and o ther problems continue to arise.              I am b ei ng r equested
   in my capacity as C h a i rm an of the ACPO S u b - C o m m i t t e e to give
   a b etter steer on the d if f i c u l t m a t t e r of ’w r i t t e n a g r e e m e n t s ’
   or ’s t at em ents of i n t e n t ’ . As things stand at the m o me n t it
   is v i r t ua l ly imp os si bl e to do so.

   When I met Lord J ustice T aylo r on 18 O c to b e r to be e x am in ed
   upon the ACPO s u b m i s s i o n to his I nq uiry I e x p l ai n ed the
   legal and p r act ical d i f f i c u l t i e s we face and he was very
   s y mp a th e ti c to our predicament .        I h i g h l i g h t e d in p a r t i c u l a r
   the keen interest w h ic h Police A u t h o r i t i e s are taking and
   the pressure w hich some of them are b r i n g i n g to bear upon
   C hief C o nsta ble s not to enter into any kind of a r r a n g e m e n t
   u n le ss suitable i n d e m n i t i e s are obtained.

   F o l l o w i n g upon the H i l l s b o r o u g h case, Police A u t h o r i t i e s are
   now p o n d e ri ng the p r o s pe ct of huge civil claims for damages
   a r is i ng from a lleged police f a i l u re s or neglect, and are
   fearful of the p o s s ib le c on s e q u e n c e s      of that.

   In this c on ne ct io n I have rece iv ed the e nc l os e d c o r r e s p o n d e n c e
   w h ic h is s e l f - e xp la na to ry .  In l ight of the conc er n now b eing
   e xp re ss ed by the A s s o c i a t i o n of C o un t y C ou n ci l s p e rh ap s I could
   sugg es t it might be p r o d u c t i v e and h e lp fu l if a m e e t i n g were
   convened as soon as pos si bl e at the Home O ff ic e at w hich
   r e p r e s e n ta ti ve s of the ACPO, the Home Office, the Local A u t h o r i t y


                                                                    Continued/2




                                        DR&/VG THEDREAM
A s s o c ia ti on s   and Police A u t h o r i t i e s   couid   discuss   all   the
i mp li ca ti on s     of this issue.

It is far toe coreplex and imp or t an t to be left to local
i n t e m r e t a t i o n , r e s o l u t i o n or agreement. There are
s u bstantial r a m i f i c a t i o n s for the future w hi ch must be
settled now.

Perhaps you will c o n s id er this as a m a t t e r of u r ge n cy and
let me know what you think.              In the m e a n t im e I am c op y in g
the c o r r e s p o n d e n c e to Bob Whalley, S e c r et a ry of the
H i l l s b o r o u g h I nquiry for his information.

courts might well take a different view bearing in mind the
tragedy at Hillsborough and that a judge of the Court of Appeal
had (evidently) taken the view that such provision was not an
unreasonable stipulation when crowds of over 5,000 at assembled
to watch a football match, or indeed any other sporting activity

     Dear Mr. Mould,

    The Hillsboroagh Inquiry - Interim Report

    I thank you for your letter dated 18th ultimo, and note its contents in respect
    of the two initial problems experienced with regard to recommendations 2 and 4
    of Chapter 24 of the above Report.

    In connection with recommendation 2, perhaps I ought to emphasise that the
    eighteen years1 experience which I have had with the Liverpool and Everton
    grounds has taken full account of the spacing and strength of the crush barriers
    concerned, and I would still be happy to exceed the 54 persons per 10m2 which is
    recommended in the Green Guide. Nevertheless, I appreciate that the politics of
    the matter might dictate a firm requirement for not exceeding that figure.

    With regard to recommendation no. 4, I attach hereto an extract of my own
    comments upon this, which were contained in an appendix to my report to the City
    Council on the implementation of the Hillsborough Report's recommendations.
    This explains the problems of principle in slightly more detail, and might be
    helpful to you in your further consideration of the matter.

    One further matter which is causing concern here arises from recommendations 42
    and 43 of the Report.  I would welcome your views on these problems at an early
    date. Firstly, it seems doubtful if either of these two requirements could be
    enforced under the provisions of the existing legislation.  Conditions attached
    to safety certificates can only have as their objective the securing of
    reasonable safety at the stadium.  The provision of transport for persons who
    take ill or are injured at a football match, is really no different to that at
    any other venue used for public entertainment. There must be many examples of
    other such licensed entertainment where the paying public are equally at risk of
    illness or injury as they are at football matches, given that proper attention
    is paid to securing physical safety and adequate competent stewarding.




             When calling or telephoning please ask for   Mr— . ! , B u s h

NBEAAP

         The Ambulance Authority is an emergency service which should be capable of
         providing ambulances required at any venue in their area when a disaster arises.
         It seems unreasonable within the context of the safety of the public to require
         them to be allocated exclusively in numbers, at football grounds, and not at all
         at those other places. This certainly seems to be a matter which requires a
         change in the legislation or the provision of an order under Section 15A of the
         1975 Act.

         You will be interested to know that what I have done here for both Everton and
         Liverpool grounds, is to accept one fully—equipped ambulance provided by the
         St. John Ambulance Brigade, together with two other ambulances provided by the
         Ambulance Authority, situated near the ground. The first ambulance is part of
         the service provided to the clubs by the St. John Ambulance Brigade for many
         years now.  It is paid for by the clubs, and the money received has been of
         great assistance to the St. John Ambulance Brigade in maintaining its
         fully—equipped ambulance, which is used at many other venues between matches.The
         attendance of the St. John Ambulance Brigade within the ground has always been a
         condition of the general safety certificate, but the provision of the ambulance
         has not been specified, and has been accepted by the clubs as part of the

  •      package.

         It has been agreed by all parties, although some friction has been obvious
         between the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the local Ambulance Authority during
         the discussions, that this ambulance satisfies the recommendation no. 42. The
         provision of the additional two ambulances raises two issues so far as the clubs
         are concerned. The first is do they have to pay for this service, and why, if
         it is not an enforceable requirement under the legislation, and included in the
         safety certificate? The second issue is whether ambulances provided at the
         ground ought to be furnished exclusively by the Ambulance Authority.  It is
         currently the case that the Ambulance Authority may be contemplating industrial
         action in support of a pay claim. Therefore, if such action materialises, at
         any time, it is very probable, at best, that only genuine emergency work will be
         undertaken. That has been the case on occasions when the Fire Service has taken
         industrial action.  In those circumstances, the football programme in Liverpool
         (and indeed throughout the whole country) could be brought to a standstill if
         the provision of such ambulances was made a condition of the safety certificate.

         I am sure this last point will be a matter of concern for your Department if it
         is proposed to amend the legislation to include the provision of ambulances
         under the general need for reasonable safety at football grounds.  Does your
         Department support the provision of ambulances only by the Ambulance Service?
         Do you think that is likely to be part of any order made under Section 15A?

               sincerely,




         City Building Surveyor.

              Extract referred to

         *4   Implementation relies upon the Football Clubs and the Police.
              However, the recommendation is a matter for some concern of the City
              Council because it implies a division of responsibility for crowd
              safety and control, which is not provided for, or envisaged, by the
              current legislation. The matter has been the subject of discussion
              and it has been emphasised that, in the absence of any delegation of
              those responsibilities which clearly fall upon the Club, according to
              the 1975 Act, the Certificate Holder and the Club must remain wholly
              responsible. The legality of passing any or all that responsibility
              to the Police, which Lord Justice Taylor considered had been done at
              Hillsborough, is currently a grey area.  It is understandable that
              the Merseyside Police do not wish to alter that fundamental
              allocation of responsibility, but at the same time, it is appreciated
              that the Police uniformed presence within the ground, implies an
              authority and perhaps therefore an accompanying responsibility.
              Football clubs traditionally employ the Police, by private contract,
              to assist with keeping law and order in the ground. They would need
              to be called if law and order broke down. The arrangement probably
              arose from the fact that no other security forces were available when
              it began, and because the Police needed a public presence outside the
              ground. Correspondence is in progress with the Home Office on this
              matter, and the City Building Surveyor will monitor this situation
              although the City Council is not required to take any action itself.

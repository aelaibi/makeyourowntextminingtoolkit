            AS SUB-DIVISION,                   ROSSINGTON            SECTION




            I came        on    d u t y at       R o s s i n g t o n at     8 . 1 5 a.m.       on     15 A p r i l    1989.         I then

            Bradley.            We       got    on the        coach and          travelled           in   convoy      to S h e f f i e l d      to

            We a r r i v e d        at    Hillsborough              and    sat    in the       s t a n d a n d we        we re g i v e n a

            briefing,           by       the O f f i cer       in    charge.



           We    then      left          the   ground         and    proceeded          to    the     Leppings        Lane     end and

           were     on d u t y           on S h e n s t o n    R o ad ,    which     is      the    road a cross          from Vere

            Road.         We    put       barriers          across        the    road and          checked       people       and    cars

           wanting         to       go    into     S he ns t o n Road.            During       this       time      I w^ts    in    cpnrpany

We w e r e         in       position             on    that       road     from about                11,,30 a.m.               Supporters

started            arriving                from Leppings               Lane      en d a n d          passing             towards          the

tunstiles               from          about       12 o ’clock.              There          were          mainly          young       children,

with      their             fathers,             etc.,       obviously           going          to       the       match       early.           There

were      a    lot          of    supporters                stood      around         in the             road       near       where       we w e r e

on   duty          but          I never          saw a ny         trouble; w i t h          any          of    the       supporters.              They

were      mainly                well       behaved          and    enjoying           the       sunshine.




There         were          a    number          of    supporters           turning             up       from about             half       past       one

to Z o ’clock,                    also          waiting       in the        roa d s,        going             to    the    fish       and       chip

s h op.        A    lot          of    them were             carrying           cans       of    b ee r        and       stopped          to    drink

this      beer          anywhere                they     could       sit    down          before          they went             to    the       game.




There         were          also       a    lot       of y o u t h s      and    men,       I couldn't                   say    h o w many,

a s k i ng     p e o p 1 e as              they       w a 1ked     past     if they             had       any       spare       tickets.

Obviously               they          hadn't          got    one     so    they were             asking             people       to       see    if

they      had any                spare          ones.



From      2    o'clock;,               when       the       one    and     only       t r a i n wa s           supposed          to a r r i v e        at

the R a i l w a y               Station,          there       seemed        to       be m o r e          supporters             arriving

after          S o ’ c l o ck              than       there       were; b e f o r e        and       a    lot       of    these,          you    could,

smell         the       beer          and       alcohol       on     t h e m as       they       passed             the    end       of    our

r o a d , a 11 h o u g h              t hey were            not    causing           any    pr o b 1ems             at    this       t ime »




There         was       a       continous             steady       flow     of       supporters                arriving          in L e p p i n g s

Lane.          It s e e m e d              to    get    more       intense           as    it    got          towards          kick-off          time,

there         seemed             to    be m o r e       supporters              coming          l at e        than       there       were       last

year.          A    lot          of    them       because          they     were          late,          or    it w a s        getting          near

kick-off            time,             were       in a big          hurry        to    get       to       the       top    o f | the— toad,            up

We     were    still          on    duty          on S h e n s t o n          R o a d at           about       quarter            to    three.

There        must       have       been       two        or    three          thousand              in a s t e a d y          stream             heading

towards        the       turnstiles.                     I did make                a    comment           to a m o t o r c y c l e

Sergeant           about        them         climbing              up     onto         th e    wall       at G a t e        C.         I saw

someone        in a d a r k             uniform,              I could             not     say       if    it w a s          a Police             Officer

or     not,    pulling             supporters                 up     onto         the    wall           and    obviously               into        the

ground.            I also          made       a    comment              to    the       Sergeant              t h at    1    could          not       see

any Police              Officers             up at        that          end       of    th e       ground,        near        the

turnstiles.                  However,             there        was        two      to     three          thousand            people             up t h e r e

and     it    is    quite          possible              that        they         may     have          been     intermingled                    in

the r e s o m e whiere .




'There w a s        a     lot      of    noise           coming           from         the     Leppings           Lane        end,          a    lot     of

noise        and    chanting             by       th e    supporters.                     There          was     st ill       a steady

At     about       3.15       p.m.       I was           speaking             to a        civilian             who      h a d a. car             r ad i o     on

and     it    came       over       on       local        radio           that         there        had       been      some       trouble,              or

an     incident,             actually             inside           the       ground.               We    were     not        in    possession

of     a Police          radio          at    that        time          and       that        is    h o w we      first           got       the

information              that       something                 ha d      happened.




At     just    after          3.13       p.m.        we       were        rounded             up    by our        serial           Sergeant,

watching.               We    walked          up L e p p i n g s             Lane       towards           the     turnstiles.                     By

this     t i me     people          were          coming           out       in a d i s t r e s s e d            state,           crying          and

calling        us       '’B A S T A R D S * ,      obviously                 we    were        not       aware         of w h a t       h a d g on e

and    blaming          the       Police          for    what      had       happened.



liyself,         Police       Sergeant             Reynolds            and Police           Constable             Pearson          entered

the    ground          through Gate                A and       then went            along        round         the     back     of    the

North       Stand       and       onto       the      pitch       in    between          the     North         Stand      and      the

myself       and Police                Constable          Pearson went                onto       th e     football           field       and

we    just       saw    loads          of    people       running            about       and     people          laid     on    the

ground,          obviously             with       injuries         and       some     being       helped          by F i r s t       Aiders

and    Ambulancemen.                    There         were     people          running          all     over      the     place,

getting          boards,,         the a d v e r t i s i n g        boards          and     putting         injured           people

onto     them and            trying          to    get    them         out     to w h e r e      the      ambulances            were

awaiting          them.



It w a s     obvious          that          the    Forest         supporters             in the         Spion Hop            did     not

know,       at    first,          what       had      taken       place.           I believe            they must            have

thought          it w a s     a    pitch          invasion,            or    something           like      that,        as     the

Forest       fans       were       still          taunting         the       Liverpool           f a ns    who       were      actually

on    the    football             field.




I. a c t u a l l y     went       up    to      the     fence      in the          Spion        Hop     and      told     off      one     of

the    supporters             who       was       stood      on    the       actual        fencing         shouting

and    swearing          towards             the      people       who       were     on    the       fi e ld .        I told        him     to

get    down and          to       behave          himself.             I shouted           to    the      Forest        supporters

that     were        near     me       t ha t     there      were      a     lot    of     injured         on     the     field       and        I

think       then       they       started          to    realise            that     it w a s     not      a     pitch       invasion

and    something             had       taken       place       which         they weren't               aware        of at      the      time.

big    fat    lad,       with    dark        hair,       who       was    being          given       heart         massage.              He

was    placed       in the       back        of an A m b u l a n c e           which        had      come        onto        the

football       field.           I think           he w a s      dead when            he wa s         taken         from       the    field,

but    1 am    not       sure.         We    t oo k     another          lad,       a tall          skinny         lad w i t h       blond

hair.        Myself       and Police              Constable          Pearson             and    someone            else       carried

this    lad    off       the    field,        up      to w h e r e       the    ambulances                were        waiting,

between       the    North       Stand        and       the     Spion      Kop.           He w a s        sat      down       by the

Gymnasium       a n d we        go t    him       some      First        Aid    assistance.




Then    we    returned          to     the    ground          to    see    if we          could        assist           with       any    of

the    other    injured          people.

in a d a zm a n d         obviously           a       lot     in s h o c k .        There       was       a     line of P o l i c e

Officers       across          the     fie l d ,      1 think        this       was       more       to        keep     the    half       of

the    fie 1 d n e ar      the       S p i o n K o p f r e e , so          that          A m b u 1a n ces        could        get    in ,

I was     talking         to a       lot     of    supporters             during          the       n e xt      hour,        trying       to

keep    them    calm and             reassuring             them     etc.           We    then,        after          the     ground

was    empty,       returned           to    the      North        Stand,       where          we    started            off    the       day

with    a briefing.              We     were          sat    there        for    about         45 m i n u t e s , a w a i t i n g

news    of w h a t       had    actually              happened.            It wa s         obvious,             from talking

with    other       officers           that       there       had    been       a     lot      of    pushing            in    the W e s t

Stand    and    a    b a r r i er      had    c o 11 a p s e d ,     but       o t he r t h a n        that        we    st i 11 w e r e n *

fully    sure       of    what       had     happened.



We    then w al ke d       up P e n i s t o n e        Road        towards          C l a y w h e e 1s L a n e,          where       we

were    g i v e n a meal         and        then      stood        down    and       returned             on the         transport             to

Doncaster,          arriving           back       there       at    quarter          to     eight.

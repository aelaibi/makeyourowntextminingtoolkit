by S outh Y or k s h i r e          personnel          and d ir e c t e d to the P . S . V v ’s.



At the outset               it was apparent             that s u pp or te rs       of both teams were

a t te m p t i n g    to by-pass           the T r a n sp or t Police       in the s t a ti on and the

Po li ce     cordons at            the outer          exiti by using        the main exit            in the

centre of the station.                       This was an o b v io us attempt                to a v oi d using

the P.S.V . ' s and get                   into the. city centre.



At    11.00am          I was     d ir e c t e d by      I n s p e c t or Dews    to monitor       the mai n exit

w i t h my serial            and filter           out any football              supporters      from amongst

the general             public       using that          exit.     We were        constantly directing

football         supp or te rs           from this       exit    to the P .S. V.. *s .        It was

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 10pm when the              last    of the    supporters         had    passed

Large      numbers          of N o t t i n g h a m    s upporters     has used the M i d l a n d Station.

I was      s u r p r i s e d by how few s upporters                  from Liverpool           has    used this

station,         especially              in view of the fact            that      only a p p r o x i m a t e l y 330

were     e xp ected to use the special                       train    into Wads le y Bridge Station.



A p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.2 5      p.m.    we      boarded a P.S.V.            together w i t h officers

from other            serials       for     t r a ns po rt .t o Hills bo ro ug h.          The serial

slow to a crawl, b ecause                     of the     volume        of    people making           their way to

the ground.                                                                 •'                  ' , ^ ‘/v;                 *



B e t w e e n 2 .50    p.m.    and 3 o 5          p.m.     we    pulled up           in Leppings

i mm e di a te l y o p p o s e s        the turnstiles.                There was a dens el y                packed

crowd stret chi

turnstiles.            Cr ow ds     of        people were        still       arriving       from either

direction.            There wer e at             least half a dozen men                    climbing         over     the

walls    and gates         su rr ou nd in g        the turnstiles.                  There was         no q ue st io n of

any queue at any of the tunstiles.                                It was just a mass                  of    people.            I

can recall         seeing      individual            Police O ff ic e r s wi th in that                    crowd but

they were        o bv i o u s l y   having        little        effect       on the movement               of the

crowd.       The      two P ol i c e horses            that      I recall          also    seemed       to be having

little     effect       on the          crowd.



It was     obvious        that we w ould             not    be able          to enter the g ro u n d at this

point    for some         cons id er ab le         time.         The    driver,          therefore,         took     us

a r o u n d the ground to Pen is to ne Roa d where we entered                                     the stad iu m at

Insp ector Sewell             a s k e d f o r ’any serials who were a v a i l a b l e and                  I was

d i r ec t e d to take my serial             orvtQ the U « k ;in front                 of Leppi'ngs Lane

terrace.            W e w a l k e d in single     file along: the track                in f r o n t of the

N o r t h S ta nd towards           the L ep pings Lane.           There were          only th e normal

number      of officers you             w ould have      e xp e c t e d       to see on the        back

serial.        The m a t c h had        not started at          this time.



As we a p p r o a c h e d     the Leppi ng s Lane Terr ac e               I found      it strange          that

there a p p e a r e d       to be    large spaces w i t h i n        the       right   hand pen.

S p e ct a to r s    were    climbing     from the ter ra ci ng along all                    the       sections,

into     the s eating area.              I d i r e c t e d my officers           to space out            in front

of the t e rra cing along               the track.        I was      not aware         of any          problem    in

the t e rr ac ing at          this     point.



I tried to m o n it or           the    radio   t ra n s m i s s i o n s as    I wa nt ed to           clarify my

instructions.               I could     not hear     the t ra n s m i s s i o n s      because of the

crowd noise.



My a t t e n t i o n was      d rawn to the       centre      pen by my officers               stood on the

track     b eh i nd the       goal.      I went    to the      track       behind the         goal where          I

could see           that    people     on the ter ra ci ng       next      to the      perimeter          fence

were    being        pushed    into: the     fencing      by the weight            of the      crowd and

appeared        very distressed.             It was     obvious        that the        people          only a

short d istance             into the terracing and only a few feet a way from the

fence,      were       unaware      of the   people     in distress.



I believe at this              point     that the m a t c h      had started and              there was an

h or re n do u s     volume    of noise      from the       crowd.            It was   not    possible          to-

hear any       radio        t r an smissions.                                     ‘                ,

                                                                                                          R 160



I s te pp ed back and               checked the        right    hand      pen to see       if there was

still      space     capacity,          wit h a view to         releasing        people     through the

gates      from the         centre      pen, along the track and              into the       right hand

pen.       It was        riot p o s s i M e    to use the       radio and' 'inform control               of my

intentions.              I w a v e d at the Police            control      box to    indicate that, we

w ere     going     to ope n the gates.              I knew at this time              that there were

not enough          Pol ic e O f f i c e r s    oh the      track    to    control the       people      that

w ou ld    come     t h r ou gh the gates.           However,        it    was   now obvious that          the

people at the .f ro nt               of the    pen next to the             fencing were       e x t r em el y

distressed.



I shouted for             the gates         to the     centre     pen to be opened.              I was    next

to gate 4,         s it u a t e d    i mm ed iately behind the goal a nd I fully e x p e c t e d

a flood of s p ec ta to rs              to surge       onto    the   track.        However,      no person

came thro ug h the             gate     of their own accord.               Eac h    person had to be

pulled through,              the     crowd was       that     tigh tl y    packed.



Peo pl e at the front of the                    crowd were       now shouting and s creaming                    for

help and o b v i ou sl y            being     crushed.        I recall     at this     point     thinking

that      people     in the         crowd w o ul d be s er i o u s l y      injured.       Yet   there was

still a crescendo               of noise from the mai n body of the                        crowd who were

e n g r o ss ed   in the match.



T o g e t h e r w it h    half a dozen officers                fronwny^^               I became

e m b r oi le d   in frantic          efforts     to   pull     people     through     the gate.           1 lost

track of< time a nd was                 totally unaware          of events         other   than those

i m me di at el y s u r r o u n d i n g     that gate.         In spite     of all     our    efforts we

did not      seem to be having any                   impact     on releasing         the   pressure       of the

crowd,      no m at t e r     hou/ man y we       pulled thro ug h the gate.

                           I am sure         that       people    only a short         distance        back    into the     terracing

                           P anic and d e s p e r a t i o n then seemed to                pass    through the crowd           rapidly-

                           P eo p l e a p p e a r e d    from about       ten deep:,      rolled over.,the top of the                crowd

                           in front        of them and down to the gate.                      I was      now aware     of more

                           Police O ff icers a rr i v i n g             on the track and a s s i st in g as           the    crowd from

                           the    pen spilled onto the                  pitch.                          >



                           The    gate was a p p r o x i m a t e l y S*-3*         wide.      Access around the gate was

                           very     r estricted because                of two factors.           The    first was     that    the gate

                      ^    only op ened to form a right angle w ith fence.                               Therefore,         only two

                           o ff ic ers o f a time           could e f f i c i en tl y work at           pulling     people    free     by

                      jS
            f              e fforts     to assist         we were       inevi ta bl y getting          in each others way.             The

      t/1                  s ec o nd factor was           that a d v e r ti si ng    hoardings,         set at an angle,         from

                           the floor         to knee height,             were     up against the         fence and     right up        to

                           the edges of the gate.



                           The s i t u at io n was         now desperate,           people    five or six deep w i t h i n the

                           crowd were             s cr eaming    for    help. Pe op le       at the fencing were             being

                           c rushed m er ci lessly.               Individuals          even in their          panic w ere    indicating

                           that     people were           being    trampled u n d e r n e a t h their feet.            There was

                           nothing we             could do but         pull   people     t h r ou gh the gate       one at a time.

                           Some were at             shoulder      height,       some at waist          height and some were

                           d r a gg ed out along           the floor.



                           I was      unaware        of time,      but after        being at the gate for siqme

                           the gate.              T he y were    pleading       for help,     but we        could not, move     them.

We had to pull m an y              people      thro ug h over         the top of them             i nevitably

causing     them to be trampled, on,                    I was a fr a i d for the                lives of these

m e n at this     point       but there was          nothing           to be done         for t h e m until         the

crush was      relieved.            Still      people    further          back    in the        crowd, w h o    did ?

not a pp ear     to be       in real      danger,       W e r e jumping and              rolling    over the top

of the    crowd down to the gate.                          ;



A m id dl e a ged m a n       in a grey anorak             had been pulled t h r o u g h the                 gate

quite    e arly on.          He    c ontinually tried to get                   p a s t 1 the P ol i c e   officers

to the ga,te.          He was o b v i ou sl y trying             to get to an individual                    t rapped

in the    crowd near          to the gate.           Be was          in a blind          panic a n d all       he

was    doing was       h a m p er in g our best         efforts.           After     r epeatedly          pushing

and    pulling    him away from the gate                   I had to strike                him    in the st om ac h

w it h my fist        in an effort          to keep him away               from the gate,



I could now see             that    there were       spaces          on the terrace onl y a short

d is ta nc e a wa y    from the fencing.                We shouted at the                 crowd ar ou nd the

gate    to turn and          look back         but they were            o blivious an d          c ontinued to

push towards          the    gate.      Not     until    Po li ce O ff ic er s           had pulled       people

a wa y back    into the t er racing              did the        pressure at the gate                 subside.



The two men who             had been trapped at                the     foot   of the gate          for several

mi nu t es must       have    been se ri ou sl y        injured.           The    first was a white

bright    red jumper          wit h a motif an d blue jeans.                       He was        pulled to my

side and was          ce rt ai nl y alive.



The s econd ma n was a white male,                      late teens,           plump build,          wearing a

          The m a j o r i t y of         people who we pulled                thro ug h that gate,             although

          distressed,          were       uninjured.           However,        there w ould still             be a large

          number who w o ul d have                 some* injuries.



          A fter    the     crush had receded I was aware                         that     the mes h at either               side

          of the       gate    had been forced away and bodies were                               being      removed from

          i assisted          to    carry my man from the terracing                          to the      left of gate

I wal ke d back         t o w ar ds : L ep pi ng s Lane.      The    pitch was       now a mass        of

of Police O ff i c e r s was             formed ac ro ss     the w idth of the          pitch and a

confrorttation was avoided.



In spite      of the        distress       of the    people       present    it was     quite     evident

that a large number                of the s uppdrters who were               on that     pitch had been

drinking alcohol                and were    the worse       for drink.



I was    tota ll y unaware             of the time and over what               period of time          the

events     had taken            place,     I had    lost    contact wit h the         personnel        in my

gather my officers                together.



It was a p p r o x i m a t e l y 5,00       p.m.    I left     the stadium wit h six            officers

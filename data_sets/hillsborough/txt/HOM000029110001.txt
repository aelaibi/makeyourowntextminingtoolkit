To:       Chief Constable                              Date: 9th June, 1989




             I was the officer in charge of the policing of the Norwich City
        Football Club versus Liverpool Football Club football match at Carrov
        Road, Norwich on Saturday, 1st April, 1989.

             It is usual procedure to categorise football matches as of high,
        medium or low priority in our pre-season planning. This match had been
        categorised as high priority even before the result became of greater
        significance in the Division One Championship Competition. The Carrow
        Road ground capacity is 26,812 and for this reason it was also decided
        that the match would have to be all ticket, a fact which would be well
        publicised in advance.

             Carrow Road offers limited options for the accommodation of
        visiting supporters and the total available space, talcing into account
        the need for segregation and accommodating home club members, is 5,000.

             There is terracing behind both goals at the football ground. The
        River End terracing is part of a 51% membership scheme and, therefore,
        always occupied by home fans. The Barclay Stand terracing is divided
        into 4 enclosures to limit lateral and forward movement and segregate
        opposing factions. The pens are numbered 1 to A, pens 1 and 2 are
        always occupied by home fans, pen 3 at medium and low priority matches
        remains empty and pen 4 is for visiting supporters. In addition there
        is another area of terracing, the Triangle, which faces obliquely across
        the pitch and is adjacent to pen A and seating in blocks F, G and H
        normally taken up by visiting supporters. Pens 3, 4, the Triangle and
        blocks F, G and H were allocated to Liverpool supporters for this match.
        4,800 tickets were sent to Liverpool for sale in advance.

             Access-to the visitors enclosures is through turnstiles at the
        rear of the Barclay Stand which are completely independent of the
        access points available for home supporters. The rear of the Barclay
        Stand borders the main A.47 Norwich to Great Yarmouth trunk road.

                                                                    »* n u u u n i \ *




                                                -        2      -




                It was obvious, owing to Liverpool’s recent success that there
           would be a large, if not capacity, crowd for this match. Local interest
           was also very high and policing arrangements included the highest level
           of policing for any match during the season. This level was 313 officers
           including Special Constables.

                On Thursday, 30th March, 1989, I saw the Norwich City Football
           Club Chairman, Mr. Robert CHASE, at the football ground. He told me
           that tickets -esiee- for the match were not selling as well as expected in
           Liverpool. He had been told that 1,272 tickets would be returned and
           would be brought to Norwich on the club coach on Saturday. Mr. CHASE
           suggested that pen 3 now be allocated to home fans as pen 4, the Triangle
           and the seating could accommodate the reduced away-support. I told him
           it would be imprudent to take that decision in the light of experience
           which showed that Liverpool always attracted considerable national
           support. The probability being that many people would attend who either
           could not obtain tickets because they were only on sale at Liverpool or
           unaware that the match was in fact designated as all ticket. I
           suggested that the decision be delayed until themoming of the match
           and I would then consider the situation with regard to pen 3, although
           because of access and egress to this enclosure for home fans it was
           most likely that the space would still be allocated to Liverpool
           supporters.

                On Saturday, 1st April, 1989, there was a significant crowd
           assembling outside the Carrow Road Football Ground by midday. Almost
           all were Liverpool supporters and the majority had tickets. By 1300
           hours there was a considerable crowd gathered, a number of whom did not
           have tickets. Many said they were not aware it was an all ticket match
           and others that they could not obtain tickets because they came from
           areas distant from Liverpool. I decided, therefore, to open 2
           turnstiles and sell the returned tickets, after agreement with the Club
           Chairman, to Liverpool supporters for access to pen 3. All the
           tickets were sold in this fashion and there is no doubt that some home
           supporters benefitted in this way. They were, however, met by officers
           just inside the ground who directed them to accommodation reserved for
           home supporters. The visiting fans were quite well behaved and formed
           orderly and quiet queues outside the ground. They did not arrive late
           and all supporters were in the ground by 1500 hours.

                The visiting fans were quite boisterous, generally good humoured
           and totally partisan in their support for their team to the exclusion
           of all else. I attach a copy of the match summary which was forwarded
           to the Merseyside Police on the 3rd April, 1989, and indicates the
           problems that we had faced. A video tape of this match is available
           if required. I attach a copy of the Carrow Road ground plan.

                May r request that the report and enclosures be forwarded to the
           Assistant Chief Constable J. Mervyn Jones^JtiJJ^borough Enquiry Team.

objectively, we conclude that on the material before him, it was not open to the

to be fairly applied, that Customs and Excise, or any other investigating body,
should get its tackle in order before it seeks to rely upon it. In this case, we do not
think they did so. Accordingly, in our judgment, the conviction of Restrepo cannot
stand. It is therefore quashed and his appeal is allowed.                                   R. v. BOW STREET STIPENDIARY MAGISTRATE AND

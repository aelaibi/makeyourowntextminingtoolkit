                      At 9.45 a.m. on Saturday, 15th April, 1989, I commenced duty at the

                       Sheffield Wednesday Football club with regard to the semi-final

       ^              between Liverpool and Notts Forest.

                       My immediate supervisory officer was Police Sergeant Chapman and at

                      approximately 11 a.m. we took up our position at the bottom of the

                      players tunnel on the perimeter track.

                      At 1 D.m. together with Police Sergeant               Chapman we went to the rear
                                 '                                  ■ '           - ..V'. . .   .   .




m                     of the North Stand where we were provided with a hot aaeal, which we

                      consumed and then returned to our original position on the tunnel1«

                      At about 2.30 p.m. as the centre pen began,.to ■                                       :a«w a number

                      of Liverpool supporters doing what I can only describe'-as storming

                      from the top of the centre pen to the bottom, causing a large number

                      of people to be pushed forward towards the security fencing at the

                      front.

                      One of these supporters involved kept standing on a safety barrier

                      and then throwing himself into the crowd, who would then repeat the

                      manoeuvre by pushing            forward towards the front of the terrace.

                      The only description            I have of this man    is that he appeared to have

                      shoulder length dark hair and was wearing a blue checked^ lumber
               shirt.     My attention was then directed on the Forest

supporters.

At 2.41 J.m.    I noticed that the area allocated to the Forest

supporters appeared to be reaching capacity level and again on looking

        the North Stand and Leppinfs Lane area, I said to Police

Sergeant Chapman,       "Where are all the Liverpool s&|»por‘te r s .”   As there

appeared to be ample room in both areas apart .from the centre pen which

Nothing untowards haj?pene<d| until after the match kjjgfelred off when

after a few minutes the crowd Appeared to sur^p^torward a M              there was

what appeared to be an overspill onto the track at the back of the

goal at the Leppings Lane end.

There was nothing else to suggest that t h e l ^ w a s anything othjer than

an overspill onto the track.                                             v

I then saw Superintendent Greenwood run onto the pitch and speak to

the referee', it was then that I realised that this incident was                 ^

something more serious.        **

The pfSEfwrs came off the pitch and the referee arid linesmen stayed

with Police Sergeant Chapman and myself at the bottom of the tunnel.

It then seemed that all hell had let loose as s^||?orters were all

over the pitch.     Throughout the rest of the afternooft, I remained at

the bottom of tfte tunnel preventing a large number of supporters who

appeared, not all, to be the worse for drink, entering the tunnel to

either get at the F.A. officials or to use the club's telephones.

At 5.15 p.m.when the ground had cleared,         I was instructed to report

to the North Stand for a de-brief.

At no time was I involved in the handling of any bodies.            I was stood

down    6.30 p.m. the same day.

                           p^l                supporters in the North Stand and Leppings Lane terraces, I

                noticed that there was ample room either side of the centre pen.

                Mr 0flHuglas Lock, the Sheffield Wednesday Football club Security

                iifficer, did comment at that time words to th»                             that there was

                                         outside the ground at the Leppings Lane ena.

                When Spurs and Wolves played in the semi-final about eight years ago,

                I was oh duty on the track at the Leppings Langs end.                       I am told* due

                 to                                                                                n

                pen and terraces which resulted in the gates having t-o be opened to

                enable the overspill onto the track.                          x         ^ ____ —

                In conclusion I would like to say th^t I have worked every semi-final

                at Hillsborough for the last 23 yp'ars, but my duties have J?een

                usually at the Leppings Lane end(                                                      ;

             I am a P olice              Sergeant          in the       South Yorkshire                Police,       at    present

             s t a t i o n e d at      Rotherham,

             At    08.30       hours        on S a t u r d a y    15 A p r i l      1989       I came    on d u t y at          Main

             Street        Police        Station,          Rotherham          for     transport         to Hi 1 1 s b o r o u g h

             Football          Ground        by F o r c e       coach,        I wa s      in    charge     of S e r i a l       36 w h i c h

             comprised          of     the     following          officers*

             PC    2403 Morton,              PC    13 Ro se,       PC 7 2 L i p s k i ,        PC 3 1 8 3 T r c e k ,      PC    3044

            We were         p ar t     of    Sector        14    commanded          by    Inspector        Ellis      of       Rotherham

            Division.               We a t t e n d e d     briefing       at H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m        as    directed,

            and      then      deployed           to W a d s 1ey S t a t i o n ,         Penistone       R o ad.      We       were       to

            work      with mounted                officers        in the       s u p e r v i s i o n of L i v e r p o o l

             supporters,              leaving        the    trains       at W a d s l e y S t a t i o n .       We    were       to

            marshal 1 t h e m , carry                 out       searches      where        n e c e s s a r y , and    then       escort

             them     to    the      ground.

            The      f i rst    thing        that     surprised          me    w as      the   f act    that    there          was    only

             one    special          tr a i n ,    carrying        reportedly 350               supporters.               I expected

            more      trains         than      this.

            On     reflection            I think         that     the    supporters            are aware        that       these          trains

            a r e met       by the P o l i c e ,           and    they are          then marshalled             straight             to    the
                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                      R'343

gro u n d ,     so       to a v o i d        this     they    come       by    other       means.

The      special          train         wa s    not    expected          un t i l    shortly after                 1400 hours                 but

we    deployed            early         at a b o u t       10.25    hours         and     took     up      duties        in

Peni stone R o a d , outside                        the S t a t i o n .

Between         our       location and Hillsborough                            S t ad i um was          the m a i n         coach         park

for L i v e r p o o l          supporters             at    Claywheels            Lane     a n d all         the      local       pu b l i c

houses         in this             area were          closed and            boarded        up.

It w a s a n i c e             sunny         d ay a n d     there     became         a    constant           stream         of

Liverpool            supporters                going       up the     hill        away     from       the       ground        in s e a r c h

of    somewhere               to    o b t a i n a dri nk.

It be came a w a s t e                  of     time    telling        them        that     they wo ul d            have       a f ai r

distance            to    go       as    such a dvice was             disregarded.                 I remember               one

particular               request          for     directions          to G r e n o s i de W o r k i n g            Hens       C 1u b ,

which      is all             of    two miles          a w a y , they         still       set    off       walking.

Just      prior          to    th e      special       trains       arrival          at    about        13.50         hours       I heard

a    report         of a d i s t u r b a n c e         in a T r a d i n g         Estate        off H a l i f a x R o a d             just

above      our       location.                 I attended with                other       officers           and      saw     t hat       a

grassed area                  in the         vicinity        of G a t e w a y s      Supermarket                was     crowded with

Liverpool            supporters                drinking       from       cans       and    bottles.              There        was      no

disorderly               behaviour             a n d we w e r e     told       to    resumeÂ»            I only          got      to    the

entrance            of    the       Trading         Estate        area      but     that    must        ha ve      contained              in

excess         of    1,000          f ootbal1 supporters                    all     sitting        drinking.                The

his     horse       was      hemmed          in by        supporters            and       there        was      a solid mass                  of

people        in f r o n t        of    him,       I told him about                      the    injured woman                   but      he

already         knew and           said         it was        impossible             for       hi m    to a s s i s t          because         of

in the L e e          side        of    the m e t a l         gate.         I then         began        trying            to    prevent

forward        toward         the       turnstiles.                  Supporters               were       going           under        the

then     heard a voice                  on     the       air    saying          âT h e r e *s g o i n g             to    be     a

I have        no    knowledge             of    the       gates       being          opened         just       a sudden

situation,            and     on       foot     we w e r e       just       useless.

Th e    next       message          I received             on    the       radio          was     for        all     availaole
officers          to go        into       the       stadium             as L i v e r p o o l      supporters                were       on    the

pitch.

1 entered          the       ground with                  other         officers           by G a t e       A,    as we          did    this          we

had    to    prevent           Liverpool                supporters              from trying             to e n t e r         with       us.           I

then    ran to          the       back     of       the N o r t h          stand and went                   up    the       first

entrance          to    get       o nto    the          pitch.           PC     1429 B a s h f o r t h           was    w i t h me at

this    time.           When       1 got           to     the      playing a re a             the      g am e     was       no     longer         in

progress.              There       were        a    lot        of L i v e r p o o l        supporters             on    the       pitch,          and

a Police          c o r d o n was         forming              across          the    pitch       towards             the    h al f     way       line.

I went       towards           the    front             of     the W e s t       Stand       and       if    I had          felt       useless

outside       the       ground,           it w as            nothing           compared          to w h a t       I was          to

experience.                 I approached                  the      central           North       standing area                   of L e p p i n g s

Lane    e n d at        its       junction with                    the N o r t h          standing          ar e a .        There       was       a

huge    crush          of    supporters                 in the          central           North     terrace            area and             fans

were    pushed          r i ght      up a g a i n s t           th e      perimeter           fence.

At    this    stage          there        w as      absolutely                 n o t hi ng we        c o u l d do       to       help       them.

Because       we       were       in uni f o r m L i v e r p o o l               supporters             were          comi ng         up to       us

screaming          and       swearing              at     us    to do          something.

There       was    nothing           they          could        do,       but     they      expected             us    to    do

something.              I have        never             felt       as    helpless           in m y     life.            Some          of the

supporters             in t h a t     area were m an ag in g                         to    get o ver        the        dividing

railing       into          the N o r t h          t e r r a c e d a r e a,          a n d we     evacuated             t hem onto               the

pitch       through          the     perimeter                 gate       of    t h is     area.

The    perimeter             gates        at       the L e p p i n g s          Lane       end are       narrow         only          allowing

one    person          t h r o u g h at        a time           and       there       was     o n l y one         perimeter             gate

for    the    central             North        terracing                w h i ch was        further          over       towards             the

centre       of    thfe s t a n d .            There           were       already Police                officers             there          so    I

remained where                 I was.

Eventually             f ans      managed            to      get    up to         climb       o ve r    the       perimeter             fence,

and    I climbed             up    the     fence             on the         pitch         side    and       began       to       help       them
                                                                                                                                      PAGE           &
                                                                                                                                      R343

over     the       top.

I was        greatly          hampered             in this          by the      fact        t hat    the       strands        of m e t a l

mesh     fencing           had       been      continued             past      the    top     bar        to    form a       row of

spikes        which        was       catching            on    their       clothing.              I began          bending        the

spikes        down       to     prevent            them       from    doing      this.            Eventually            the      crush          in

this     compound             eased        further            and    I could         se e    the     body        of a m a n       lying

on     the    floor        at      the     b as e       of    the    perimeter            fence      near        to   the     dividing

fence        to    the N o r t h         ter r a c e .

He w a s      apparently                ded.

We     then       turned        our      attention             to    the    perimeter             fence w h i c h          consisted

of a s t r o n g         metal          mesh welded             to m e t a l     supporters.                    It h a d    been

welded        on the          inside          of    the       metal     supports            so      it    c o u l d not be    pul led

outwards           towards           the      pitch.

It h a d to         be     peeled          inwards            towards       the      stand          and       this we m a n a g e d         to

do w i t h        some     difficulty,

Persons           were     then able               to    escape       through         this        and     bodies        began         to    be

lifted        through.

I remained            on      the       playing          field and          b e g a n to      give        the      kiss     of    life          to

casualties.                1 had         no    success          at    all      w h i ch was         absolutely             soul

I was w i t h a w o m a n a g e d a b o u t                     26 years         who        had     not       responded          to

s ome    Liverpool              supporters               arrived       with       some       broken           down    hoarding             to

transport           her       to     the      casualty          station         there        weren't           enough       to    carry

h er    so    I helped             to    lift       her       onto    the      boards.            She was          dressed        in

             Police      officers.               This    occurred            while       c a s u l a t ies w e r e      lying         all    around,

             We    we re u n a b l e       to    get    the    hoarding            through        the     doorway          and    I had       to

             lift     the w o m a n        off    and    carry      her       bodily           through       the     gym.        The w o m a n

             was    apparently             dead and       I remember               seeing        Detective           Sergeant          John

             S m i t h wh o    was        part    of    the    team      receiving              casualties.

             I returned          to       help    carry a body               t h at     of a y o u n g m a n a g e d a b o u t              17 to

             18 y ea r s ,     who        I first       tried      to    resuscitate.                  He w a s      slimly       buiIt,

                                                               dressed            in j e a n s    and     *T ' shirt.

             I h a ve    no    c 1 ear      recollections               after         t hi s    everything           seems       to    have    been

             done     in a daze.                I ended       up o u t s i d e        the      gymnasium       understandably                 no

             one    seemed       to       have    much    t im e    for       the m i n o r       casualties,              so    1 assisted

             them where          I    could and          put     them        on    the m i n i      bus      t ype    of a m b u l a n c e     to

             be t r a n s p o r t e d      to    hospital.

             I then a s s i st ed wi th                persons      who       had       lost     relatives           and    helped          them

             where      1 could.

             I h av e w o r k e d         several       matches         at    the H i l l s b o r o u g h      ground           including

             the    last      three        semi     finals.         My       u s u al    duties        have    been        on    the

             Catchbar         Lane/parkside              area      of    the       ground        but    I worked           the L e p p i n g s

             Lane     turnstiles            for     the L e e d s       v.    Coventry           semi     fi nal      a n d we

             experienced             no    difficulties            on    t hi s       occasion.

             I have      n ev e r     seen       so m a n y    supporters               in L e p p i n g s    Lane     still          arriving

             so    cl ose     to a n d a f t e r        kick     off     time.

Further to the statement which I made re the Hillsborough Disaster,
I would like to say that the roar of the crowd which seemed to
incite the crowd in Leppings Lane to push even harder could well
have been when the Liverpool team came onto the pitch at 1^5^ just
prior to the kick off.

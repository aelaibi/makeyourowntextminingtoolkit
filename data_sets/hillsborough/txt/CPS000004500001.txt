^IfcbTE OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION

  HILLSBOROUGH

  Mr Peter Birts QC who is advising in this case telephoned some
  time ago to request that a full note be made on behalf of the
  Hillsborough case by someone who would be present at the Old
  Bailey preliminary arguments in the Zeebrugge ferry case. He
  felt it was important that we have a full note of the precise
  nature of the arguments put by both prosecution and defence
  with regard to corporate manslaughter and the necessary
  elements required to prove such an offence. Of course it
  would be most important to have a note of the detailed
  reasoning given by the Judge in any ruling he may make on any
  particular point in this matter.

  The similarities between the Zeebrugge case and the
  Hillsborough case should reveal several areas for close
  comparison.

  It had been hoped that a Clerk from this office would be able
  to attend and make a full note in the required terms. However
  having spoken to Mr Naunton at some length about this it has
  been decided that the task would be too onerous to impose upon
  a Clerk who was also dealing with matters of considerable
  importance so far as the prosecution were concerned.

  Accordingly I decided to request the Clerk at Mr Birt's
  chambers to nominate a Pupil Barrister who could attend at
  court and make full notes.

  Mr David Buries of Farrar's Buildings will attend a court on
  those four days and make a full note. He has spoken to
  Mr Peter Birts who will give him instruction on what is
  required.  Basically Mr Birts wants a note of everything that
  happens.

  Dear Dr Popper

  JONATHON OWENS

  I refer to the above named who was a victim at the Hillsborough Football
  Stadium tragedy on 15th April 1989.

  Enquiries were caused to be made in June, in relation to the blood alcohol
  analysis of the above, as it had been intimated in a written statement from the
  friend with whom he travelled, Michael Robertson, that Owens had consumed
  alcohol prior to attending the football ground.

  Robertson was subsequently reinterviewed, and confirmed that no alcohol was
  drunk by Owens.    There in some confusion as to whether you have been made
  aware of the result of these enquiries, and as such the statement covering this
  point is attached.

   Yours sincerely

              At     11 „ 15 am Saturday,              15.04 „89 „ I com m e n c e d tur nst i 1 e duties                      on g a t e <1

              A--Q,       leading       to the Leppings           Lane     terracing.              I was      e n g a g e d on search

              duties w ith PC 963 Evans.

              The        gates were        opened at       '12 m i d - d a y and a steady               stream      of Liverpool

              fans went            inside,,     The y were        in good         spirits and well               behaved.

              About 2 pm            (1400)     I saw a youth of               negro        origin a r r e s t e d     by PS3 1282

              Fayne        for a t t e m p t i n g    to enter     the g r o u n d         in possession           of alcohol.

              T here w£*re a number                  of Liverpool        fans         standing       both on the appr o a c h e s

              to and        in the        roadway at L e p pings           Lane        from     converations          ove r h e a r d       it

              appeared          they were        not    in p o s s e s s i o n    of m atch tickets,               but    seemed

              determined            to get     inside and w a t c h           the match.

              At 2.26         pm    (1426)     I a s s i s t e d PC C o l e y         to arrest a male             in possession

              two        cannabis       reefers.        This y o u t h was            later     taken to the          charge

              office.           I returned           via the    rear     of      of    the South S tand and               saw numerous!

              Liverpool            fans    congregating         outside          the     turnstiles         in L e p p i n g s    Lane,

              many were young               persons who were             swearing           continually and their                    breath

              smelled s t r o n g l y         of alcohol.          M any      of these were             the    same      persons        I

              had earlier            seen on the a p p r o a c h e s          to the ground.

              The        crowd surged         towards      the t u r n s t i l e       pushing and shoving and

              despite         continual        pleas     from both m o u n t e d and foot                  o f f icers        they

refused       to form up         in an orderly manner,,

I saw several           y oung    boys        no more       than    14 years         of age       being      crushed

against       the t u r n s t i l e s     at B and a c t u a l l y         saw    Insp.    Purdy       pick       up a

lad and       pull    hirn out.

The L i v erpool        fans     still        pushed f o r w a r d s and          towards a metal              shutter

gate.     They were           r e p e a t e d l y told to       refrain          but a g a i n    refused.            I saw

the    gate    bowing      and    heard a Super i ntendne't                  shouting        to o f f icers           to open

the    gates.        I considered             this    the    right     decision as           persons were

becoming       trapped.
                                                                                                   n U < ^ 4 i- £ M J S s
The gates ware           o p e n e d and there was a surge                       forward of af>'pi»<wiiTi-atie4y

-S-rOee L i v erpool       fans map y of who m were                   drunk and a ggressive.                     They all

rnade their way           down    the      central       tunnel       into       the terracing.

A few minuts          later      I heard a mess a g e              on I think a T a n n o y            system

requesting all            police        onto    the     pitch.        I made my way towards                     the

pitch via the Po l i c e             control         room.      I was about to go onto                     the      pitch

when    Ins p. Sykes          d i r e c t e d me to the         tunnel       on the L e p p i n g s        Lane

terracing.

I ar ri v e d about        3.03      pm    (1305)       to find PC 321 7 W a d s w o r t h giving                     first

aid to a female.

Alongside        this     female        was a male          age d about 25 years,                 I checked him

for a pulse and             could       not    find anything,              he appea r e d        dead.

I then a s s i s t e d PC W a d s w o r t h with the                female        before     going       into       the

rear    of the       tunnel      w i t h other        officers.            I removed a male who was

o b v i ou s l y dead from        beneath the tunnel                  having        been d r a g g e d     there        by

supp o r t e r s and as        I did so         I saw a teenage              boy     laid face         down

u nd e r n e a t h this man.            The youth was           removed          by other        officers         and

taken to outside              an exit.

I a gain went          into    the      tunnel       and a s s i s t e d    other officers             to remove

bodies,       all    male,     several         appeared       to    be dead.

               bodied      fans    to make      a clearance most          refused and       in fact    jostled

               police      officers        carrying     bodies about.           Fans were    continually

               s w e aring and d i r e c t i n g     abuse at my s e l f and       other    officers.

               On    leaving      the    tunnel    I assisted       officers      to form an e m e r g e n c y

               ambulance        bay and to        sort an e m e r g e n c y    priorty   list   of   casualties.,

               I saw a total            of a r o u n d AQ   casualties        toget h e r with S or 9 dead

               bodies all         laid on the main d r i v e w a y        leading     to the    directors        suite.

               Throughout         the    entire    incident at       no stage      did   I hear any

               i n s t r uctions    to officers        given by any senior            officer.

               The      radio   seemed      c o n t i n u a l l y used by PS and P C ’s.

refused          to     form      up       in    an       orderly             manner.

I    saw    several             young       boys          no       more       than       14    years        of      age     being       crushed

against          the       turnstiles                at    B and          actually             saw    Insp.           Purdy       pick        up       a

lad    and       pull       him       out.

The    Liverpool                fans       still          pushed          forward             and    towards           a metal          shutter

gate.           They       were       repeatedly                   told       to    refrain          but       again        refused.               I

saw    the       gate       bowing          and       heard           a Superintendent                      shouting             to    officers

to    open       t he      gates.           I    considered                   this       the       right       decision           as    persons

were       becoming             trapped.

The    gates          were       opened          and       there          was       a    surge       forward           of       numerous

Liverpool             fans,       many          of    whom          were          drunk       and    aggressive.                  They        all

made       their        way      down       the       central             tunnel          into       t he      terracing.

A    few    minutes             later       I heard                a message             on    I    think        a Tannoy             system

requesting              all      police          onto          t he      pitch.           I made          my     way       towards          the

pitch       via       the       Police          control             room.           I    was       about       to     go    onto       the

pitch       when        Insp.         Sykes          directed             me       to    the       tunnel        on    the       Leppings

Lane       terracing.

I    arrived          about       3-05          pm    (1505)             to       find    PC       3217     Wadsworth             giving

first       aid       to    a    female.

Alongside             this       female          was       a male             aged       about       25     years,          I    checked           him

for    a pulse             and    could          not       find          anything,             he    appeared              dead.

I    then       assisted          PC       Wadsworth                with          the    female       before           going          into     the

rear       of    the       tunnel          with       other           officers.                I removed              a male          who     was

obviously             dead       from       beneath                the    tunnel          having          been        dragged          there           by

supporters              and      as    I    did       so       I    saw       a    teenage          boy     laid       face       down

underneath              this      man.           The       youth          was       removed          by     other          officers           and

taken       to    outside             an    exit.

I    again       went       into       the       tunnel             and       assisted             other       officers           to    remove

bodies,          a ll      male,       several             appeared                to    be    dead.

Despite          continued             pleas          from         myself           and       other       officers              for    t he    able

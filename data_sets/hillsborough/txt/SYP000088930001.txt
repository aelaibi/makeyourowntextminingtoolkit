            At 3pm (1500) on Saturday           15th April            1989 ./150489),     I was on duty in

            Doncaster town centre,           carrying out operational             duties, when I

            received information that Operationl&lSpport had been implemented.

At about 4             1630) we were asked to assist with the stripping of

bodies, which were being ho use ^ in the plaster room there,

duty I undertook with                                                                                                                 PCISHOWpEN,

whilst                          was delegated to remain outside the room To

prevent the uKauAhorised entry of persons to it.                                                                      In there were the

bodies gf 10 td/ceased,               3 of whi ch were on trolleys and the r emainder

of which were laid on the floor.                                       All but one were male.



We systernat i cal ly stripped the bodies, whilst                                                                                       comp 1 e ted

was possible,     lists of clothing and lists of the individuals property,

Each dec ea s ed ’s c 1otfcnng was placed in an individual                                                                     plastic sack,

whilst personal p r o p e r t y « a s                   placed in hospital                                      envelopes.               The

body had been dealt with,                       it was removed from the plaster room to the

mortuary by hospital             staff.



After the bodies had been removed it was my res ponsibility to take any

possible positive I/D*s                   (which were only taken on the information on

the Casualty Enquiry Records)                              down to the mortuary where the body was

shown to them so that the proper identification could b e madff.



A short while later all the bptties were removed to the gymnasium of

the Hillsborough Football Gtr/ound and on completion of this task, we
    —                   .  y

generally acted as liaifcip/ between hospital                                                        staff and the Casualty

Enquiry Bureau there.
         At about 8 . 4 5 pm (2045)   that day,    I left the N o / t h e m General Hospital

         and was stood down from the operation.

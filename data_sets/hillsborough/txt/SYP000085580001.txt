             I a married mart and live with my wife at the above address.

            On Saturday 13th April                1989 (130489)        I attended the F .A . Cup Semi

            Final    between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough.


                Q S O S 3
             I completed and signed a questionnaire                      regarding this day,   on Thursday

            4th May 1989 (040589)           and I would now like to clarify one point.



            As the incident        in Pen 3 of Leppings Lane was occurring                  I remember

            seeing something strange happening.



            There was a tremendous            crush of people            in that Pen and I was watching

            this.    The play had stopped and people were attempting to get out of

            the pens,       over the front fence.
                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                      S2984



               As I was watching   I suddenly saw a section of the crowd in Pert 3
C a? C
               disappear,   it appeared as if they had collapsed to the ground.        I
6 £ O K j6 J
               would say approximately 20—30 people in total.     At the time,      I cannot

               say why they collapsed.
       3



               Within seconds the void that had been created was filled from behind.

               I can only presume that those people who had fallen were still on the

               floor.



               I did not actually see the crash barriers    in Pen 3 because they were

               obscured by people,    but when the terrace was clear,   the place that I

               had seen the people collapse was the place that the collapsed barrier

               was situated.



               This   is in the middle of Pen 3 towards the front.      I am sure   in my

               mind that those people collapsing was due to the barrier breaking

                                                                                    SIGNED

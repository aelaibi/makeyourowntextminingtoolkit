Thank you.

On the current authorities there is no power to j/r a decision of the
Attorney General to refuse a fiat for a further inquest. The position is
summarised at paragraph 10 of the attached summary grounds of defence
filed in the case of Porter, which I believe, is being handled at LSLO by
Sally Walsh. We are currently waiting to hear from the Administrative
Court with a judge's decision in Porter on the grant of permission to
bring j/r rpoceedings.

Hello Adam,

I believe that you may be in a position to assist the Attorney with an
issue that has arisen.

The AG has refused his fiat for a further inquest into the death of a
Kevin Williams in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Solicitors have
written stating that they wish to judicially review the AG's decision.

can you assist with what power there is to JR a decision made by the
AG?

happy to discuss if you require further information,

kind regards

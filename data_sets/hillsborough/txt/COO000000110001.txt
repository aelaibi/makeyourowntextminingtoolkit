From the Principal Private Secretary



                                                            31 January 1990




                                   FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME

      The Prime Minister has yteceaved the attached letter and
 proposal from the Challenge/Grmip. The letter seems to have been
 written before the Home Sec/retary's Statement on the Taylor
 Report. I would be gratefuy for a draft Private Secretary reply.
 This should set out what/Mr:/ Long should do next, ie. whether he
 should seek further discussions with DOE or the Football
 Authorities.             /

      Following the Taylor Report, the Government has undertaken
 to continue contingency work on the NMS to see if the
 shortcomings ident^fi4d could be overcome. This particular
 proposal does not appear to me to fall within the category of an
 official membership scheme as it is entirely voluntary and the
 potential hooligap would be under no obligation to use it. As it
 does not fall witnin the legislation I would have thought there
 was no basis on/which the police national computer could be
 involved. Generically it seems to be a comprehensive ticketing
 system which iday indeed be very good for marketing football but
 as such it a^ts only indirectly on the hooliganism problem. I
 would have thought that it was for the football authorities
 rather than the Government to develop it.

               for the        day.           At 4 bout       1X3.30am      (1030)       I went          outside         the ground a nd

               com me nc ed a general                 patrol        of the area s u r r o u n d ing the ground.

               Spec ial C o ns tables              had been delegated duties,                            such as         point duty,

               I c ontinued these                duties           until    shortly after 3 yd o p m                 (15 0 p ) w he n a call

was     taking    place,        there were       people     on the      pitch,       climbing over         the

railings and also               being   lifted up into the stand above.                        I could see

that     the game had been stopped and some                        players were still              on the

to it     I quickly         realised that         it was      something          d r a s t ic al ly wrong.

P eo pl e were      crushed against            the   perimeter         fencing^ and were           in obvious

distress.         I i mmediately          began to assist           people over          the top of the

fencing and         it was       just after       this that        I was     passed the body o f a

              Fu rt he r    to my previous            s tatement     dated 8th Ma y        1989^X080589),            on    12th

              July     1989      (120789)         I was    shown a video        t a pjitR ej/ere n c e Nu mb er      (VRM/2)

              At tape       reference         number 040 8       (Real Time)       I can     identify my se lf            on the

              video,       located      in the       top   right of the        picture.



              At this       point      I was      e n g ag ed with the d ec ea se d              <y COX (NA19)



              At this stage            the    body    is not visible as           it is covered wit h a white

              sheet.        The    body      is   lying at my feet           parallel     to the     table.

            I have    indicated,    on a sketch        plan of the        football       pitch,    the

           approximate     pos i t ion where      Tr ac ey was        first   passed over       the    fence    f rom

           As stated     in my    previous     s tatement Tr ac ey was            left   in this      position,

            I r eturned to her      later and with the a ss is t a n c e            of football        fans

            r emoved her   body to the mortuary.

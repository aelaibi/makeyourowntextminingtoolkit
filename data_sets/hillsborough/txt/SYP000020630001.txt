Dear Sir,
       A.Ciiallenge Cup Semi-Final at Sheffield
        "iflaggflM or          15^ rApril,«I9ft9.
        xnaak you for your letter Ref.H?S/JrtC/14
dated ?Tst.April,1989*
        I have attached a report as .you have
requested.



            Yours sincerely,
     I was present at the F.A..Challenge Cup ttai-
Final at Sheffield Wednesday's ground between
Nottingham Forest and Liverpool on Saturday,15th.
April,198^*
     I travelled as a car passenger and frorr, the
outskirts of the town I noticed m a n y supporters
on foot making their way j.resuwably to the ground.
     I alighted from the car,at what I believe
was the area of the sroundallocated to the Liverpoo
supporters,at approximately 2 :25pm. while the
driverwent to Io o k for a park.
     I waited in the area for about ten minutes,
waiting for the car driver,and I noticed that a
queue had formed for what appeared to be entrance
to the turnstiles.At least one mounted policeman
and others on foot were keeping the people
queuing in line with some difficulty but not
unduly so.
     i'he police had erected and manned a b arrier
which appeared to be for the prevention of
unauthorised entrance to the area leading; to the
main stand entrances.
        Duriner    stay at this entrance I did not
see any pates opened except for the ejection of
one man.
        nhile there ± was approached by two separate
y o u 6 men who politely enquired if I had a sp=.re
tic ft.et.
        k s the car dri ver did not arrive I was allowed
through the police barrier and made my way round
to the -'irectors'entrance at the main stand where
the car driver was waiting.

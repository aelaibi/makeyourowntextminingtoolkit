               marked       this    p osition on the a 11a ch ed                    g r i d p 1an using a f i gur e numbs r

               H av i ng    stood      in p os it i on number           one        for a few minutes myself                and

               d ec id e d to      change       our    location,        because         pen number          three was      tightly

packed with people and together with the movement of the crowd we

found that position to be too u n c o mf o rt ab l e.



We decided to move our       position to the North West upper             terrace (pen

seven),    it was obvious    that it would be very difficult to leave pen

number three by the rear of the terraces and            because of        this myself

and        decided to make our way forwards down the terracing towards

the front perimeter fence and then to move across the front of the

terraces    in an effort to reach pen number seven and the North West

Upper Terrace.



At a time I can only estimate to have been about 2.43pm               <1443)   I was

in a position in pen number three about fifteen feet back up the

terraces from the front perimeter fence and roughly mi.d<y4y, /cross the

width of the pen when I saw a late friend of mine P h i i i ia' STfcSLE.



Phillip STEELE was standing about three or four feet to the rear of my

position further away from the front        perimeter fence.       Phillip was
                             Nl 1 5 G S
standing next to his brother Brian fa c/i                xI cn ,



The position I saw Philip STEELE and his brother Brian standing at in

pen number three    I have marked using a figure        *2* on the seperate grid

plan.



I continued to make my way along the pen and I spoke to both Phillip

and Brian, we had a short conversation, and myself and                    then

continued to make our way out of pen number three.



When I last saw Phillip and Brian at about 2.45pm            (1445)    they both

appeared to be well and excited both looking forward to watching the

            Further to the statement made by me on the 2 n d February 1990,                          ,
                                                                       lS/6(

             Having v/'ewed this material              I have   indicated on another     pian
                                                                                                                22—

             looking at it from the pitch,               than on the previous pl^n which I

             completed which I gave the reference                     1.

             On a photograph refer^hced PR1/9 I have indicated a person who                              I am

             satisfied is Brian^STEELE ,              Slightly to his left is someone who I

             believe     is Philip STEELE however           I cannot be 100% sure.

             On a photograph referenced PR 1/-32 I have again indicated the same two

         am fairly certain.

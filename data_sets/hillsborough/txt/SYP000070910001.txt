(1100).          For    the    next     four     hours    the       suppo r t e r s    entered the S p i o n Kop

in quite         orderly manner.

By 2 . 0 0 p m     ("1400)     the S p i o n Kop was a p p r o x i m a t e l y 907. full                 wi t h a group

of Liverpool            suppo r t e r s    a p p r o x i m a t e l y 200 standing            in the

r e s erved area.             I n o t i c e d at that time             that    the L e p p i n g s Lane         terrace

was    only half         full     and     thought       it strange          that      there were         so few

Liverpool          a^frpFSr^ers in the            ground at          that     time     compared       to the

N o 11 i n cpnam            t Sh p porters.

At _2/12pnQrT412) ^/nuitiber of Mo11 in q ham Forest                                  supporters a p p a r e n t l y

drunV    iria4'6^"their way           down the S p i o n Hop towards                   the L i verpool          fans

in the       reserved area and began making                          obscene       and t h r e a t e n i n g    gestures

at    the Liverpool            fans.       Immediately          several        officers        from our

serial and a number                of O f f i c e r s    from the          serial      s^g^egalt i ng the
                                                                  //sTW      / / / I

fans and a r r e s t e d        them.

1 then went            to the     reserved area and gave a s s i s t a n c e                   to FS       1203

M A R R L E S a nd his        serial      in keeping          the    two    sets      of   rival   fans apart.

At    this    time a number             of N o t t i n g h a m Forest         fans were ma k i n g          their way

to the       reserved are a seeing                plenty of space              but     not    realising         that,

it contained L i verpool                  supporters.           As a consequence               great       pressure

was    being       put on the         fans we were a t t e m p t i n g          to hold back and at                    least

three    female         fans    f a i n t e d and had to be a s s i s t e d                into the

r e s e r v e d area.

S h o r t l y after      the    kick      off    I noticed          that L e p pings Lane           terrace was

still    not       full and/tha/%          the |_iverpoo 1 fans were                   starting       to    climb the

pe r irne t e r f e      e ./ from jrf’he r el^I_ was          stand i n g     on the S p i o n Kop            it    looked

like an a t t e m p t e d       "Pitch        invasion'        was    taking       place.

My    immediate         thoughts        was     that    the    serials at          the L e p p i n g s     Lane      end

were    slow       in r esponding          to the s i t u a t i o n of a likely                'pitch

i nvas i o n ’
                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                   S I S 17

I then saw p o l i c e           Officers        responding and saw serials a t t e n d i n g                         from

the    rear    of the N o r t h Stand.                It was      several         minu t e s    before       I real is*

that    the    sit u a t i o n was        not what        it a p p e a r e d    to be.         It was      only when

people were           being      carried off on stret c h e r s and                     boarding       that      I

realised       something was              d r a s t i c a l l y wrong.         Whe n a St Johns a m b u l a n c e

drove       onto    the    pitch       it was      then    realised by the N o t t i n g h a m Forest

fans    that       the s i t u a t i o n was       not what       people        first     thought and severs

doctors       and nurses          in the N o t t i n g h a m Forest             supporters         carne to where

was    standing        and offe r e d        their     services.

I then        escorted a number                of off duty medical                 staff       to the      first aid

post at       the    rear       of the N o r t h Stand.

Upon  returning to the rear staircase of the S pion Kop I was met                                                     by

enquiring          if the m a t c h was          still     on or what was              h a ppening and           I was

not able       to tell, them anything.

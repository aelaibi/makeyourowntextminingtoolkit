             Dear Sir

              HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

              Thank you for your letter dated 23 May 1989 and invitation to
              submit written material that may be of value to the Inquiry
              team .

              Subsequent to the disaster at Valley Parade, Bradford and the
              Heyzel Stadium, Brussels, the Popplewell Inquiry made
              numerous recommendations which gave rise to amended
              legislation relating to places of sport.   The introduced
              amendments were the product of a comprehensive consultation
              process which permitted all the legislative weaknesses to be
              addressed.

              The resultant Fire Safety and Safety at Places of Sport Act
              1987 strengthened the powers of enforcing authorities and
              brought more places of sport under the close scrutiny of the
              enforcing bodies.   At the same time the 'Guide to Safety at
              Sports Grounds’ was revised to take account of and place more
              emphasis on such issues as management responsibility,
              stewarding, crowd control, pitch perimeter fencing etc.   It
              is inevitable that those very issues are going to surface
              again and the future of pitch perimeter fencing will be
              questioned.

              The Institute is of the opinion that the amended legislation
              and the revised guidelines provide the means by which good
              standards “of safety can be achieved, and public confidence
              restored at places of sport.      However, it is recognised that
              the success of any legislation depends on uniform
              interpretation and application without which anomalies and
              confusion can occur.    Conscious of the need to develop
              uniformity, the Institute took the initiative to run two
              national seminars in 1987 on the subject of 'Safety at Sports
              Grounds’.    The persons targ.et.ed to attend were all those
              with legal responsibilities for exercising the requirements

is, local authority Building Control Officers, the Police,
the Fire Service and County Councils.   Again, at the
Institute's Annual Conference in Scarborough during the week
of 13-16 June 1989 the same subject was addressed.

To assist the process of encouraging uniformity the Institute
compiled the papers of speakers from the national seminars
and produced a booklet that goes some considerable way to the
promotion of harmonization of standards and practices.    The
content of the booklet forms the basis of the Institute’s
response to your invitation for written submissions and may
prove a valuable aid to the work of the Inquiry team, six
copies are enclosed for your assistance.

discuss any aspect of it, please do not hesitate to contact
the Institute's Secretary, Rachel Raywood.

In the Autumn of 1987 the Institute held two seminars on Safety at Sports
Grounds. The seminars which were masterminded by the Senior Vice-President,
Paul Stefanuti, were chaired by the President Peter Hart.
Over 150 delegates attended including representatives from local authorities,
association and rugby football clubs, cricket clubs, consultants and fire and police
services.
The London Seminar was opened by The Honourable D. M. Hogg MP,
Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Home Office with special Ministerial
responsibility in the House of Commons for safety of the public at sports grounds.
M r Hogg said that the safety of the public at sports grounds and at all other places
of public entertainment was of the utmost importance. Since the tragedy at
Bradford steps had been taken to make the public safer but we must maintain
progress with a view to long term improvement.
Building Control Officers were always in the forefront in safety matters, building
regulations included structural safety but they also extended to existing buildings
and structures.
In the past two years there had been a marked increase in participation by
Building Control Officers in safety at sports grounds and this role presented
another challenge to them.
M any of the structures at sports grounds were complex and built a long time ago,
some belonging to small clubs with low budgets.
It was not intended that certification should close down sports grounds under the
weight of regulations. A better understanding of the problems involved was
required.
Mr Hogg concluded by paying tribute to the Institute for organising the seminars.
This booklet contains a summary of the salient points made by the various
speakers.
              Safety at Sports Grounds
              Introduction
              Legislation has evolved because of tragedies at various sports grounds.
             A t Bolton in 1946, 33 people died because two barriers collapsed and at Ibrox
             Park Football Ground, Glasgow, in 1971 66 people died and more than 140
             people were injured. In consequence many recommendations were made
             regarding control of public safety but it was not until 1975 that the Safety of
             Sports Grounds Act came into being and gave the Minister of State power to
             require through designation orders that safety certificates be issued to sports
             stadia with accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators. The intention was
             for the Act to come into force gradually through a phased programme of
             designation orders so as not to place an immediate financial burden on the smaller
             and less well off clubs.
             The first order was made in 1976 making it compulsory for the grounds of first
             division football clubs and certain international grounds to have a safety
             certificate. Later, in 1979 a further order was made to include the grounds of
             second division football clubs. That is how the situation remained until August
             1985 when two further orders were introduced making it compulsory for the
             grounds of third and fourth division football clubs and also the grounds of the
             first and second division rugby league clubs to be in possession of a safety
             certificate.
             The last order, before the Act was amended, was issued in 1986 to require
             numerous sports stadia with accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators to
             be in possession of a safety certificate.
             On 1 January 1988 the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 was amended by the
             Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987.
             Some interesting features of the amending legislation are, a power for local
             authorities to issue prohibition notices, stands with accommodation for more than
             500 spectators to require a safety certificate and powers for the licensing of indoor
             sports premises.
            In order to assist local authorities determine what are acceptable standards of
            safety at sports grounds, the Government issued a document entitled Guide to
            Safety at Sports Grounds. The original version was issued in 1973, the latest
            edition which was re-written in 1986 is far more comprehensive than its
            predecessor and should prove an invaluable aid to local authorities and ground
            owners. It must be emphasised that the document is a voluntary code which
            although intended to demonstrate standards of safety to be achieved is expected
            to be applied reasonably and with a degree of flexibility.

In order to assist local authorities to determine what are
acceptable levels o f safety at sports grounds, the Government
has issued a set o f guidelines in booklet form, entitled ‘Guide
to Safety at Sports Grounds’. This booklet is a guide for
improving spectator safety at sports grounds, it is a voluntary
code and has no legal force although similar to approved
documents, with which Building C ontrol Officers will be only
too familiar. It could be used to demonstrate the inadequacy
of prevailing standards.                                            Exit gate in pitch perimeter fence, (designated ground).
The document deals with the general construction and layout
of spectator accommodation within sports grounds and gives
details of the requirements relating to such components and
installations as terraces, stands, stairways, barriers, etc, and
also sets out the performance standard expected of such
components as crush barriers, balustrades, fences, etc, which
are likely to be subjected to pressure from crowd movement.
The latest edition was published in 1986, it is far more
comprehensive than its predecessor and therefore should be of
 more value and assistance to clubs and local authorities.
 In order to remind safety certificate holders of the
 recommendations o f the guide the certificate, as previously
mentioned, should contain direct reference to many of them,
thus providing the certificate holder with clear guidelines as to
the responsibilities, terms and conditions appertaining to the
 ground for which the certificate is issued.

        HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

        Following recent discussions on the progress of the police investigation
        into the Hillsborough disaster I can now confirm a timetable for the
        submission of the Final Report to the Police Complaints Authority and the
        Director of Public Prosecutions.  The timetable I propose is as follows

        Friday 30 March 1990                        Submission of the report, together with
                                                    the supporting library of material
                                                    statements and relevant documents.

        Thursday 12 April 1990                      Conference proposed between Director of
                                                    Public Prosecutions, Police Complaints
                                                    Authority and ourselves to discuss the
                                                    proposed interview plan.

        Tuesday 17 April 1990                       Commence interviews in Sheffield.  We
                                                    would propose to video and audio record
                                                    these interviews and would have on hand a
                                                    transcription service so that records of
                                                    the interview, together with accompanying
                                                    tapes can be supplied to the interested
                                                    parties as they are completed.

        Friday A May 1990                          We would hope to have completed the
                                                   interviews by this time.

        Friday 18 May 1990                         We would hope that all the transcripts
                                                   will have been supplied by this stage, if
                                                   not earlier.




  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T                  Lloyd_House, Birmingham
                                    -   2   -




The above timetable is our best assessment at this time.      We hope to
achieve the target dates set, however, they cannot be guaranteed.       If
there is any slippage in the process of the investigation and reporting,
then we will give the earliest indication that we can.      However, we are
confident that the report will be^ready by the end of March.      The first
two weeks of April would be a approp"riatfe foF'rnte'restecT parties to
reserve time in their diaries for reading the report and supporting
material.

I would be pleased to receive your reaction to the proposed timetable and
also an indication as to whether a conference would be appropriate on
Thursday 12 April 1990.   If it is acceptable I would suggest that we
"could meet in London at a venue to be determined at say 1100 hours.

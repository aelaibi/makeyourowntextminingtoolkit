     On the 9th April, 1988 I was in charge of a serial of Constables and were
     responsible for the turnstile gates at the Leppings Lane side of the
     Hillsborough Football ground.   This was due to the F.A. Cup Semi Final
     between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.


     Our duty was to search supporters for drink and weapons and to deal with
     any public order indidents at this location.   There was very little trouble
     and only a few persons were arrested although the crowd was dense.

     At no time during this day was either myself or any of the Constables under
     my command used to form any kind of a cordon for any reason what so ever.

AND S T E W A R D S SEE     IT AS QUIC K L Y AS WHAT           I DID.

HOWEVER,       I W OULD SAY THAT WHE N THE POLICE DID REALISE,

THEY R E A C T E D .

ALSO,    WHY W E R E N ’T P EO PL E PUT        IN THE OTHER PENS,           W HEN    IT COULD

043*

DID Yuli WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?

Y E S , IT WAS OBVIOUS FROM 2,35 ONWARDS THAT THE SPECTATORS BELOW WERE BECOMING

MORE AND MORE TIGHTLY PACKED    TOGETHER UP TOWARDS KICK OFF TIME,,

044

WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH,      IF SO,   CAN YOU SAY WHAT 'TIME THIS

HAPPENED?

NO»




04:5

m      YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,   IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT?     (BRIEFLY)

NO, THE PEOPLE WERE ABSOLUTELY JAM PACKED TIGHT TOGETHER AT THE FRONT OF THE

STAND WHICH I COULD SEE FROM MY VIEW POINT,,

046

WERE YOU INJURED,    IF SO, DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL     IN SHEFFIELD?

NO „

NOT ANYBODY ACTUALLY DYING IN THE C R O W D «




048

DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,        IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

NO.

Q49

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS,            OR THE

INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

INITIALLY FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES THE POLICE WERE TRYING TO PUT FANS BACK            IN THE

PENS, OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF THE INCIDENT QUICKLY E N O U G H «

THE PA SYSTEM WAS NOT PUT TO USE UNTIL APPROX        15 MINS AFTER THE TRAGEDY.      IF
                                                                                 PAGE

 THIS HAD BEEN USED EARLIER, AS SOON AS A PROBLEM WAS KNOWN,       EVERYBODY

 INCLUDING THE POLICE AT THE FRONT OF THE PENS WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO MORE,

 QUICKLY AND PUT TO BETTER U S E .


Q2Q

 050

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE 'THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

BETWEEN 4 - 4.30 PM.

031

DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER,        A STEWARD,   A LOUD

SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

“f t R E WAS A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT MADE TO START WITH ASKING PEOPLE TO

REMAIN WHERE THEY WERE,    TO ASSIST THE OFFICIALS   IF NECESSARY.    IT LATER

CLEARED AND I LEFT OF MY OWN ACCORD AT THE ABOVE TIME.

052

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL. OFFENCE?

NO.

053

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS

ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

i^pER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 EVENTUALLY,   WHEN THE ENORMITY OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED BECAME KNOWN,     OFFICIALS/

 FANS AND SOME POLICE DID EVERYTHING THAT WAS POSSIBLE TO ASSIST HELPING THOSE

 IN TROUBLE WITH THE LIMITED EQUIPMENT THEY POSSESSED BUT IT TOOK TOO LONG FOR

 THE PROBLEM TO REALISED TO START WITH.

 THE MEDICAL FACILITIES APPEARED TOTALLY INADEQUATE.      I   THINK THAT THE POLICE

 AT THE LINE ACROSS THE PITCH COULD HAVE BEEN PUT TO BETTER USE, AND WERE

 PROBABLY NOT AWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING DUE TO LACK OF COMMUNICATIONS

 BETWEEN THEMSELVES.

 WHEN THE MEDICAL AMBULANCES EVENTUALLY ARRIVED,     THEY WERE TOO LATE TO DO

 ANYTHING EXCEPT TO PICK UP THOSE WHO HAD ALREADY DIED.

 13     7i-!i™RE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL 13 VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE LINE OF POLICE ACROSS THE PITCH WOULD HAVE BEEN UNNECESSARY IF THE

 NOTTS FOREST FANS HAD BEEN           INFORMED BY THE PA ABOUT THE TRAGEDY ASAP.,

 AS A RESULT OF SUCH AN ANNOUNCEMENT THEY WOULD HAVE NOT TAUNTED THE

 LIVERPOOL FANS,           DURING THE TRAGEDY,     THE MANPOWER USED IN THAT LINE OF POLICE

 COULD THEN HAVE BEEN PUT TO BETTER USE.,               THIS IS OBVIOUS BECAUSE ONCE THEY

WERE INFORMED OF THE TRAGEDY,             THEY REMAINED SILENT AND POSED NO THREAT,,

 THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED,               THIS IS NORMAL PRACTISE WHEN THERE    IS

 TICKETS BY THIS TIME.                ^

 OVERALL,          A LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN POLICE/OFFICIALS AND FANS WAS THE

 MAJOR CAUSE OF THE TRAGEDY,           T H E R E S A S OBVIOUSLY NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE

 POLICE BEHIND THE GOAL AND THE/POLICE OUTSIDE THE G R O U N D »

RE CHRISTOPHER TRAYNOR AND KEVIN TRAYNOR DECEASED


On 25 April 1989 West Midlands Officers saw Mrs Joan Traynor, mother of Kevin
Traynor and returned all items of property known to belong to the deceased.
Mrs Traynor was shown a training shoe which she identified as that belonging to
her son.  This was then retained because:

    i)    We only had one shoe with the body and needed to try and 'match* the
          shoe with the many shoes that were recovered from Hillsborough
          stadium.

    ii)   We would try to locate the matching shoe to a pen on the terracing to
          assist us in placing the deceased to a specific area within the
          stadium.

All retained shoes were subsequently examined and we managed to match the shoes
of Kevin Traynor which were returned to Mrs Traynor on 10 June 1989.

The matching of shoes took some time. We still possess 40 single shoes and 33
pairs of shoes which remain unidentified.

A similar situation existed in respect of Christopher Traynor except that the
officers first saw his wife.

The policy of 'single shoes' being retained was adopted with all relatives for
the reasons outlined. Where both shoes were found on the deceased then these
were returned to the relatives and were never retained.

     The mother of Chris and Kevin Traynor who were killed
at Hillsborough has made contact with me.      Mrs. Traynor lives
                          Birkenhead.     She is anxious to have
a copy of the post mortem report on her two sons and to know
what has happened to C h r i s ’s front door keys and both sons'
shoes.    Would it be possible for these belongings to be
returned to her?

     Thank   you   for    your       help    and    I   look   forward   to   hearing
from you.

RE CHRISTOPHER TRAYNOR AND KEVIN TRAYNOR DECEASED


On 25 April 1989 West Midlands Officers saw Mrs Joan Traynor, mother of Kevin
Traynor and returned all items of property known to belong to the deceased.
Mrs Traynor was shown a training shoe which she identified as that belonging to
her son.  This was then retained because:

    i)    We only had one shoe with the body and needed to try and ’m a tc h ’ the
          shoe with the many shoes that were recovered from Hillsborough
          stadium.

    ii)   We would try to locate the matching shoe to a pen on the terracing to
          assist us in placing the deceased to a specific area within the
          stadium.

All retained shoes were subsequently examined and we managed to match the shoes
of Kevin Traynor which were returned to Mrs Traynor on 10 June 1989.

The matching of shoes took some time. We still possess 40 single shoes and 33
pairs of shoes which remain unidentified.

A similar situation existed in respect of Christopher Traynor except that the
officers first saw his wife.

The policy of ’single shoes’ being retained was adopted with all relatives for
the reasons outlined. Where both shoes were found on the deceased then these
were returned to the relatives and were never retained.

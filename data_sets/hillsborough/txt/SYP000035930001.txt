Dear

Thank you for your letter of 28 June concerning the tragedy at Hillsborough Football
Ground. I have read with interest the article from the Wirral “News” and feel this may
be of interest to Mr Geoffrey Dear, Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police, who is
conducting the police enquiry into the events at Hillsborough. I intend, therefore, to
forward your letter to him.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

One might be excused for getting the impression from the
media that the people outside the Liverpool end of the
Hillsborough ground were in fact from the Merseyside
Temperance Society out on an afternoon's nature ramble -
and that the tranquility was disturbed only by Police
incompetence/harrassment/brutality.

It occurs to me, therefore, that you might like to see -
and possibly make use of - the accompanying letter to the
local press.  I did not particularly notice the earlier
letter from the Wirral borough councillor - but it would
perhaps not be too cynical to reflect that no local
politician is going to be toted into office on a ticket
of criticism of Liverpool football club and Liverpool
supporters.

   Dear

   Thank you for your letter dated 4 July 1989, with press cuttings enclosed
   concerning the behaviour of fans travelling to the Liverpool v Nottingham Semi

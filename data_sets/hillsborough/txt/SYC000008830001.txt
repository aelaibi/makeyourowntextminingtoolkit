    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                          Re

             Dear Mr. Harrison,

             Re; PETER ANDREW HARRISON (deceased).

             There is one other detail which we require for registration purposes in the
             case of young people who died under the age of sixteen.

             That information is the occupation if any of the mother.  Unfortunately we
             have not got a record of this in your case and I would be grateful if you
             could please complete the attached form, sign and date it and return it in
             the envelope provided by return of post.

Dear Sirs,

Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the d at s
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue  will be notified l
due cour se.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarialJ>u
inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the Coroners' Act 1988 and the Coroners' Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing  to you
to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

 May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
 attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

 I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
 names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that thedecision  a=
 to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

 I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
        from you by the end of^Sgptember I will assume you
 h e a rd                                                   have no names to
 submit.

 Yours faithfully

       Dear Sirs,

       RE:       HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - PETER ANDREW HARRISON

      With reference to the above matter.  We act on behalf of Mr. John
      Harrison who is the father of Peter Andrew Harrison deceased who died
      as a result of the unfortunate events at Hillsborough on the 15th April
      1989.  Mr. Harrison has been made aware of the contents of the report
      into the death of Peter and has asked us to write to you to confirm
      that there are several major inaccuracies contained in that report.

       For instance, it would appear to be the case that the report indicates
       that Mr. Harrison identified the body of his son on Sunday, 16th April
       whereas infact Mr. Harrison did attend at Hillsborough on the Saturday.
       In addition it would appear to be the case that one of the Police
       Officers stated that Mr. Harrison told him that his sons name was Frith.
       Mr. Harrison is not surprisingly non-plussed by this reference.
       However as it is understood that no questions may be asked which might
       be seen as attacking any Police Officer presumably such questions
       relating to the compilation of the report will be, as it were, out of
       bounds.  Mr. Harrison will therefore be asking questions mainly in
       relation to the blood alcohol analysis and wishes to know whether it
       is believed that this had any connection with Peter's death.  Other
       than this Mr. Harrison does not have any questions to ask of a purely
       neutral nature.

       We would ask you to note the situation accordingly.

       Yours faithfully,

                    We thank you for your letter of 1st September last. However
                    it appears that our letter of 24th August has been slightly

                    behalf of Mr and Mrs Harrison in respect of their son Peter.

                    We should be grateful to receive a copy of the report if
                    available.

                    Yours faithfully

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

1 have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, 1 have decided not*to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

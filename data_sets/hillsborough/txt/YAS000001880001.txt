1. I was born on May 1944.

2. I am a Station Officer and I am based at Middlewood.

3. I joined the ambulance service in 1965, as a driver, based at

Corporation Street, Sheffield.     I transfered to Longley as a leading

Ambulance man.     In 1977 I was promoted to Station Officer, based at

Longley.     In July 1980, when the new Middlewood station was opened,

I transferred to this station as Station Officer.

4. I recall attending a police breifing meeting at Hillsborough a

few days prior to the 1988 FA cup semi-final.     I was Duty Officer

on the day of the meeting.     Mr Higgins was already going to the meeting

and would normally have been accompanied by the Station Officer

Eason. I believe Mr Eason was on holiday on the day of the meeting

and I -ate|ftp accompanied Mr Higgins in Mr Eason's place.

5. The meeting took place in North Strand itself and was chaired

by Chief Superintendent Mole.     I recall that part of the briefing

to the police officers concerned police call signs and, in

particular, a coded message in the event of crowd trouble or evacuation.

As far as I can recall, there was no coded message to indicate a

catastrophe or disaster.

6. The Fire Brigade also attended the police briefing meeting, but

like ourselves, took no active part in the meeting itself.

7. Further, I do not recall any reference by the police as to where

the SYMAS vehicle attending the ground would park, nor that the

gymnasium was to be the designated casualty clearing post.

8.1   took no further part in any Hillsborough planning, nor was I

involvad with the incident on 15 April 1989.

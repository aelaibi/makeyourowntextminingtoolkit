               I am a S olicitor           of the Supr em e Court and a Partner                                in the firm of

              W e i g h t m a n R ut he rf or ds        of R i c h m o n d House?        1 R u m f o r d Places, L iv erpool               3.

               I have      been Sol ic it or            to Liverpool           Football       C lub since          1975 0 0 0 0 7 5 and

              was a p p o i n t e d a Director                of the Club shortly after Heysel                          trag ed y    in

              May       1985 000585,

               I am a ge d 52 and have                  been a regular attender at f o o t b h a l 1 matches

              since       boyhood.       On S a t u r d a y        15 April      1989      150489          I a tt e n d e d the Semi

              Final       Tie against N o t t i n g h a m Forest at H i l l s b o r o u g h G r o u n d , Sheffield.

               I was      given a ticket             to the D i r e c t o r s ’ Box and took my place shortly
                                                                  ■r      -

               before      the kick        off.

              After       the    game started,               I o bs erved numerous            spectators           spilling      onto

               the      running    track a r ou n d the                pitch at the Liverpool                 end.

               It was      obvious       to me that            there was        o ve r-crowding             behind that       goal a nd
                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                    S2397

that    the spectators were             being     careful     not to e nc roach onto          the    pitch,

T here was ample            room on both sides          but from my       position      in the      centre

of the S t an d        i could see that          the   congestion was dense and that

s pect at or s were ende av ou ri ng         to escape        from that area by any means.

M any were      being       lifted up into the G r a n d s t a n d above.

After    the game        had been stop pe d for a p p r o x i m a t e l y 5 m i n u t shs'T” I felt
                                              A/<b'7 M :%
that    it was        important that Peter R OB IN S O N and I slmtjrlTd investigate and

so we     left the D i r e c t o r s ’ Box and made           our way ^t og et he r     to the      pitch.

As we    left the Players'             Tunnel     and m ov e j K i n the di re ct io n of the goal,

we were      immediately a c c o s t e d     by Liy-^rpoo 1 supporters who               reco gn is ed

P eter ROBINSON.             They were    in jtfr\ angry mood         complaining       of the severe

over-crowding.

T he y s howed us their           tickets,       of w hich the      counterfoils        had not      been

removed and           claimed that      the Police had opened a gate.

At this      stage,       I was   sceptical       about    such a s u gg es ti on as      it has       never

been the       practice at A n f i e l d for the Police              to allow spectators             to

enter w ithout          tickets.       It destroys        s e g r e ga ti on and    control   over

numbers a ct u a l l y       in t he ground       p ar ticularly w hen all          tickets    have       been

sold.

H o w e v e r , the    information      being     given to us was         consistent and from

dif fe re nt    sources.

I estimate        that      I spoke    to around       10 persons at        this time.        A lt h o u g h

Peter R OB IN S O N had a c c o m p a n i e d me out onto           the   pitch,     we did     part

company out there and              I made my own observations.                     There were many

spec ta tors      lying      on the ground motionless.               Others were        sitting      up,

but    in great        distress.       I _sa,w
                                          ^s-
                                               the     body of a boy        in a Liverpool
                                                                            .
                                                                                                    shirt      *

a p p a r e n t l y dead.     I es£4rfnate       that he was     between 10/12 years           of age.

I saw this        boy be^ffg carried             awa y on a s tretcher and someone covered

his frace w i>tfa            jacket,    w hich    confirmed my        impression that he had

died.

              I was      in no doubt            that    there were       other    persons       deadly lying     on the

              I spoke to a number of Police O ff icers                           in an attmept          to    locate a

              Ranking          Police Officer,            but without       success,

              I was also             concerned by the fact              XHgtt   the N o t t i n g h a m Forest    supporters

              and felt that               they were w i tn es si ng an outburst               of hooliganism.

              It s eemed to me e x t r em el y               important      that a public address a nn ou n c e m e n t

    playing       the match that               day    could not be^iffnsi de r e d .

    W he n    the Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t                  d he told us that there had been

    three d e a t h s .         It was        sugg&p<ed,       at this       s t a g e , that Liverpool

    s upporters          had f o r c e d^ fp e n a g a t e .         My    i mpression      is that          the Chief

    S up er in t e n d e n t        fe this allegation,               but    I could not be              positive as to

     his.

    I caaa»^onf i rm that             for the         remainder       of my time at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y

    my a t t e n t i o n was direc te d              to    investigating          this   serious allegation,

    w h i c h ovbvi ou sl y        involved blame on the                   part of our spectators.

    The m ain        concern of the Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t               appeared       tobe       to   prevent

    an o ut br eak of disorder                  between the opposing                supporters.

    He was      not      prepared to have a public addr es s anno un ce me nt made at                                   that

    stage as he felt               it w ould hinder            the arrival          of the eme rg en cy services

    and he was           concerned        lest matters             should get out of hand.                   He did     not

    a pp re c i a t e    that an e x p l a na ti on of the facts would assist a l t h o u g h                           this

    was      s ugg ested to him.
&
    I a s ke d him what was               the    cause       of this disaster and his                    response was

    that      the Liverpool           supporters            had failed       to heed the Police warn in g                  to

    arr iv e     early thus          causing additional               c ongestion and          pressure         on the

    a p p r o a c h to the ground.               He       remained at the meeting              for a p p r o x i m a t e l y

    5 minutes.

    A short       time       later    I a g ai n      returned alone          to    the    pitch     in a further

    endeavour           to a sc e r t a i n    the facts.

    All      the Liverpool           spectators            to w h o m I spoke were          consistent          in their

    reports       to the effect               that a Police Offi ce r              had opened the gates and

    allowed       spectators          in without            showing       their    tickets.

    The y     rejected the s u gg es ti on w hich                   I put to them that a gate had been

               By this         time,     the N o t t i n g h a m   c rowd were    calm and        were applaudi ng the

               the ground at their                end.

               At a     later       s t a g e , Peter R OB I N S O N and     I dec i dejcj^fo make a more          careful

               i ns pe ct io n of the L ep pings Ln e n d .

               Most     of     the    spectators        had    left   by tjperi a l t h o u g h   there was     still some

               We also        e xamined theyrtfumnel           1eading     to the central           area behind the

               goal.         I noticed             the first time          that     there were       lateral    barriers

               escape to be made              in emergencies.

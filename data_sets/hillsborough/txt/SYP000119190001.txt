                    At 10am that date in Niagara club all the mounted officers on duty

                    at the ground were briefed by Insp Hand-Davis the officer        in charge

                    of mounted duties on that day.      I received instructions    to work in

                    Penistone Road area meeting Notts Forest fans and ensuring their

                    safe entry into the ground at the Penistone Road e n d .

                    At 11.23am that date I commenced mounted duties on Police Horse

                    Wentworth,    29 horses walked from Niagara stables to the ground this

                    included contingents from Merseyside and Nottingham Mounted

                    De pa rtm en ts.

                    Ar 11.35am at the rear of the South Stand I was paired with PC 459

                    Hines of Nottingham mounted and commenced crowd control       duties    in

                    the area of the ground.      With PC Hines I made a tour of the ground

                    pointing out to him relevant areas including entrances & routes of

                    approach by opposing fans.

                                                                                 R280

At 1E.30pm we received instructions from Insp Hand-Davis to work in

the Herries Road, Herries Road South area to encourage Nott in gharri

Forest fans towards the ground.      With PC Hines         I carried out these

duties dealing with some minor     incidents csf fighting          in Herr ies

Road,   but no serious   incidents occurred.       At about 2.30pm that date

a large number of Nottingham Forest fans a lot of them the worse

for drink arrived in Herries Road together,           these fans were very

noisy and boisterous and PC Hines and myself escorted them along

Herries Road South to Peni stone Road where we ushered them towards

the turnstiles.    We then remained in the area of the junction with

Herries Road South and Penistone Road encouraging fans towards the

turnstiles.

Sometime after S.30pm I began hearing         radio messages to the effect

that there were problems in the area of Leppings Lane turnstiles

and I heard requests that additional manpower            including mounted

officers be sent to that area.

1 know that PS 399 Sorsby who was on duty in Penistone Road

instructed several mounted officers from Penistone Road to attend

in Leppings Lane to assist.

I can remember hearing radio messages to the effect that people

were being injured at Leppings Lane turnstiles and I believed I

heard a request that a gate be opened to relieve the pre ssure.                  I

believe I heard a negative reply.      That     is the gate was not to be

opened.   Some time after the initial        request for the gate to be

opened I heard the same request again         and on this occasion the

reply that the gate was to be op e n e d .

At about 2.45pm I received instructions from Sgt Sorsby to attend

Leppings Lane with PC E47H Wheat croft.         1 made my way to the

Leppings Lane end via the rear of the         South S t a n d .   We arrived   at

Leppings Lane end at about 2.50pm and         saw a very large number of
                                                                           PAGE.
                                                                           R 280

  fans in the area,     These fans were very noisy and seemed to be all

  pushing towards the turnstiles there seemed to be no signs of any

  orderly queuing.      X saw that a large concert ina gate    (C ) in a

  wall   leading towards the South Stand was open fully and large

  numbers of fans were streaming unchecked through the gate.          This

  gate gives access to the area at the rear of the West Stand, at

  this tiem the area was packed with people and 1 could see        large

  numbers of people entering a tunne1 which leads under the West

  Stand to terracing at the front of the West S t a n d •   A large

  number of fans were climbing onto walls and gates around the

  turnstiles and dropping into the ground.

  I went to a point inside the outer     ring of gates where I

  attempted to slow down the advance fo fans towards the

  turnstiles.   At this point    it seemed that the pressure of fans

  had eased so I pulled my horse out and stood near a wire fence

  across from gate C.     Gate € was then closed and a number of fans were

  left standing outside    it.   It was clear they were not going to gain

  entry through that gate so I asked them to rejoin the queues at the

  turnstiles which they did.      I returned to a position near to the wire

  ■Pence and I then received instructions from Insp Hand Davis to

  control entry of fans through a single gate close to the wire fence

  and to allow entry to fans who had tickets for the match.

  A couple of minutes    later I received instructions from Sgt Sorsby to

  go with him to the Peni stone Road area whi ch I did.       We entered the

  stadium via the main gate near to the gymnasium and were then stood

  by for about the next hour at an entrance to the pitch at a point

  between the North Stand and the Hop.

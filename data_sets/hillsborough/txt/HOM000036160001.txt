 MAIN ISSUES RAISED IN RECENT REPRESENTATIONS



 1.          Video evidence

                         Was all the video evidence which is now available considered by the
                         Taylor inquiry and the inquest?


                         Was police videt? evidence deliberately withheld, or was a misleading
                         account given by the police witnesses of the significance of that
                         evidence?


                        Was evidence from the club’s technician about the operation of the
                        video cameras covered up?


                        Were the inquest jury deliberately shown poor quality video evidence?


                        Some videotapes went missing on the night of the disaster        is the
                        material now produced by Granada and the families this missing
                        evidence?


^           -           If any of those allegations are true, would the evidence have made any
                        material difference?


2.          Medical Evidence


                        Is there new medical evidence that some of the victims were alive after
                        3.15pm?


                       Was medical evidence concealed from the inquest?


                        Does this evidence provide any grounds for questioning the coroner’s
                       findings?

 3.           Police cover-up


                          Is there anything to suggest that the West Midlands Police (who
                          investigated on behalf of the coroner and the Police Complaints
                          Authority) were biased or selective in presenting their findings?


 4.          Ten allegedly unresolved questions


                          Granada suggested there were 10 unresolved questions (attached)
                          about police handling of the disaster: can we be satisfied that all those
                          questions were fully addressed by the Taylor inquiry?

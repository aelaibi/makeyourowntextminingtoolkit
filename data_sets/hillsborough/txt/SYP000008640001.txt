              1345,     to start my d u t y .              After>arbout       one hour       I was     then told to

              pr o ceed to the Le ppi ngs U r s t a n d               where        I was    to^HSe s i t u a t e d    in the

             match      b e g a n , a n o t h e r St J o h n member and m y s e l f            noticed as we           passed

              the L e p p i n g s    Ln mi d d l e   s t a n d that     people       nearest      to the      pitch seemed

              to be     in d i f f i c u l t y and were         been s q u a s h e d up to the metal                 fence.

             Some     of them were          screaming         too us to        let them out.            W h e n we got        back

              to our     base       the St J o h n m e m b e r     that      had   been w i t h me and w i t n e s s e d the

              taking     the two of us w i t h him.

             The     next    thing      that    I remember was that                suddenly       people were          spilling

              over    on to the         pitch.       By this time a p o l i c e m a n had              run on to the

               proceeded          in help i n g       the     inju r e d people.           Most    of the first         to get         on

               the    pitch were          b a d l y w i n d e d and      in shock.          I dealt wit h as m any as                  I

               could     but      then s t a r t e d       to notice       that    some     people       being    carried onto

               the    pitch by f e l l o w L i v e r p o o l          fans were more            seriously        injured and

               After     doing this            I then h e l p e d        carry an      inju r e d ma n to an a m b u l a n c e .

               I then went           back      onto     the      pitch w here       I came across a w o m a n who                had

               help i n g and        comf o r t i n g      the    injured.        This     lasted for about            half an

               hour,     after w h i c h         I went       back    onto the football             field but         by this      time

               all    the     injured         people       had been dealt with.                 At about       five    o'clock

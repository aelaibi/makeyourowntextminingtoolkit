                 At    11.00 a.m.         that     day,     I was      deployed    to the   upper      corridor      on tne

in„     Both myself          and Police    Con s t a b l e B u n g a y    had great          diff i c u l t y    in

ejecting      this y o u t h    owing    to the fans           pressing against              the    gale.

E v e n t u a l l y this   youth was     ejected        via a gate        to the       left, of the

turnstiles        when     looking     outward from the ground.                   These          gates were .

immediately secu r e d again and no await i n g                     fans       gained entry at             this

time*

After     the y outh was        ejected we        both made        our way back- .to tne upper

concourse and on to             the betting           booth    ready for        ine duties          ouliinea

above *

At 3.00      p.m.     1 was aware       that     the    football       mat cn betw e e n N o t t i n g h a m

Forest and Liverpool             had kicked           off.

At 3.07      p.m.     an unknown Liverpool              supporter        came up to.me ana told me

that    there     had been a pi ten            invasion at the L e p p m g s               cane    end.

Sno rtly after         this    numerous        fans    came-into       the     corridor          stating      tnat

a couple       of fans       had died?     all    these       fans were        very agitated.

At 3„11      p.m.     more    fans a p p e a r e d on the       corridor and were                 very,

antagonistic          towards     us    (the Police),-         a large       number        staling,       " it   B

At    this   point we        decided     that we were          unable     to    patrol       the    corridor

owing     to the number         of fans wishing              to vent     their anger             on us-

1 was     in fear      for my own        personal       safety avid that          0+ Police LonswaDie

At 3.13 -p.m.         I went    from the bottom              of the    ramp onto           tne    piayinu a?sa

’w h i c h by this     time was        quite    crowded.         1 saw some u i v e r p o o i tans

 towards      them and       carried     the front           left hand     corner      of    it    iwnen

 facing      them).        I carried     tnis    body    back     in     the d i rection          I had just

 come    from and the         body was     placed       on the     ground       outsiow          ts it yyinna* j.uin

and     left with other          officers.

 1 can only say that             the    b o d y was that of a male              (well       built)      and      1

            cannot     remember who            the   officers      were    receiving    the     bodies.

            I then went         back onto         the    pitch where       I was met with a very similar

            situation       except       the     person was alive,, .maie, about 30 years and

           again,      taken to the area                outside    the    gymgnas x uin and     left with

            I then went         back     to the      playing area ana assisted a S t „ John's

            conscious and talking and                    carried nirn into        the area    in front     of    the

           gym and sat          him    in some       dry     sand where       the 8 t .John's     Amb u l a n c e girl

           dealt with him.

            I was     then ordered to stand with other                      officers -in a coraon across

           the      concrete area,            effect i v e l y   protecting     tne gym n a s i u m area    from

           other      very dist r e s s e d       fans,

            I was     constantly a p p r o a c h e d whilst          in this     cordon by Press,

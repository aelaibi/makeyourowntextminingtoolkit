 The Bus and Coach Council which is the trade association for
 the United Kingdom bus and coach industry is concerned about
 some of the evidence given by the Football League and the
 Football Association at the recent Hillsborough inquiry. Among
 the suggestions put forward was for bus and coach operators to
 have additional responsibilities for the sobriety and conduct
 of passengers both before and after they leave buses and
 coaches.

 As you know, the exisiting regulations contained in the
 Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol) Act 1985 clearly set out
 the responsibilities of bus and coach operators and we are not
 aware of any evidence which suggest that these regulations are
 being ignored by responsible operators. Of course, there has
 been a marked increase in the number of self-drive minibuses
 and vans by groups of fans travelling to designated events.
 Any legislation aimed at the professional operator would have
 little effect on those who seek to circumvent the Act.

Whilst we recognise that the Government is under no obligation
to accept any, or all, of the recommendations contained in the
report of the inquiry, the Bus and Coach Council asks to be
consulted if there are any proposals to amend the existing
regulations. Clearly the evidence of the Football Association,
is not only unreasonable but unrealistic and wholly impractical,

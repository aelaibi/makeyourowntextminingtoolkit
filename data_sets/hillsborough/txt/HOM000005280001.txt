BILL ON TAYLOR OFFENCES


In his final report on the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster (Cm
962jL Lord Justice Taylor recommended the creation of four new
c r W i n a l offences.   H Committee agreed on 22 October to the
creation of these offences and this note is intended to start
the process of drafting instructions for Parliamentary Counsel
on all the offences except ticket touting about which I have
minuted separately.         I attach a copy of Chapter 9 of the
report, which deals with the three offences of disorderly
conduct in grounds.


2.   Taylor recommended that each of the following activities
at a designated sports ground should be made a specific
offence:


        (a)   throwing a missile;


        (b)   chanting obscene or racialist abuse;


        (c)   going on the pitch without reasonable excuse.


3.   He considered whether some sort of generic offence
covering these activities might be better but concluded that
the three individual elements were preferable.        Ministers have
agreed this approach.
Scope


4.      The scope is confined to England and Wales.    The Scots
believe that offences in football grounds in Scotland are
adquately covered either by the Public Order Act 1986 or by
their common law, which they say provides valuable flexibility
to catch a wide range of behaviour without being circumscribed
by statutory definition.      The Northern Irish are still
considering whether to make similar provision in the Province
taking account of the fact that football attendance is not so
great there as it is here.


Common elements


5.^^ There are a number of matters which we think should
probably be common to all three offences and I shall go
through these first.


6.      Subject to any views from C 1 , it seems to us that,
subject to the qualification mentioned in paragraph 15 below,
the behaviour with which we are concerned is not more serious
than the behaviour in section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986
and that the maximum penalty should therefore be no greater.
That is a fine not exceeding level      3 on summary conviction.


7.   On examining Part IV of the Public Order Act it looks to
us as though the offences, because they will occur inside
football grounds, will attract the exclusion order provisions.
We think this is right and should be glad of your confirmation
that they do.     We should also want the restriction order
provisions of the Football Spectators Act 1989 to be attracted
by the offences; presumably this will require amendment to
Schedule 1 (Relevant Offences) of that Act.


8.   Subject to any views from F2, we think that there should
be a power of arrest for each offence.      A prior warning from a
police officer to desist the activity before the perpetrator
becomes arrestable (as in section 5 of the Public Order Act
1986) seems unrealistic when dealing, probably, with a group
of football spectators.     An immediate power of arrest will not
always be used - there are likely to be occasions when the
police chose to arrest later rather than at the time of the
offence - but this is no argument against providing an
immediate power of arrest for use where appropriate.


9.      As for which grounds should be subject to the new
offences I would suggest that we designate them by secondary
legislation.     All three offences should apply to the same set
of designated grounds.     My reading of Taylor is that he may
have had in mind that the offences should apply to all sports
grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
1975.     I am not fully familiar with that Act but it appears to
me^pfiat designated grounds range across association football,
rugby football, rugby league and cricket (and maybe other
venues too).     Our strong view is that this would make the
application of the offences too wide.     We are not aware that
sports other than football create problems against which these
offences are necessary and Lord Justice Taylor himself in
paragraph 85 acknowledges that "so far, happily, misbehaviour
at those grounds has been minimal".     It was put to H Committee
that the offences should apply only at football and it was to
that proposal which the committee agreed.


10.     Taylor's intention was that the activitiesshould be     made
offences inside sports grounds.     The examples of disorderly
behaviour (other than running onto the pitch) which he gives
both refer to activity on the terraces.     However it seems to
us that the offences should apply anywhere within the
perimeter of the ground.     It seems less invidious and easier
to draw the line there than at the entrance to the terraces.
The Football League have pointed out that missile throwing may
take place out of sight of the pitch.     There could be some
anomalies: for example, it would be an offence to throw a
missile over the perimeter fence out of the ground but would
it be an offence to throw the same missile back into the
ground?    Probably it should be.   Perhaps the test is whether
any part of the missile's trajectory is within the air space
above the designated ground.


11.   For the sake of uniformity I would suggest that the
period in which the offences can be committed should be the
same as in section 31 of the Public Order Act 1986 and section
9 of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985.


12.   Now I turn to the particular contents of each offence.


Missile throwing.


13^^ We would not want the offence to catch a hat being thrown
in the air (unless, for example, it contained a razor blade)
but would ideally want it to catch a banana being thrown
towards a black player, because this is offensive, and other
objects such as banana skins and bags filled with urine being
thrown.   Section 8 of the Public Order Act 1986 uses the
formulation of "a missile of a kind capable of causing injury"
which we initially thought may provide a suitable model for
the new offence.    The trouble with defining the offence more
widely as "throwing a missile" is that it might catch entirely
innocent behaviour such as fans and players throwing scarves
or shirts, for example, to each other in jubilation.        We also
need to avoid the match ball(s) counting as a missile.        If it
can be achieved we think that two tests might provide a wav
ahead, one for missiles thrown capable of causing injury and a
second for missiles which while not capable of causing injury
nonetheless cause offence.     But Taylor was looking for
certainty and clarity which is lacking in the concept of
throwing a missile which causes offence.     Perhaps the way to
deal with the banana situation is to regard it as a racially
offensive gesture - see below.    We would want throwing to
encompass other activities such as catapulting and launching
flares, fireworks etc.
Chanting obscene or racialist abuse


14.   Chanting (of a particular sort) is the nuisance which
Lord Justice Taylor recommended should be outlawed.     It is
different from mere shouting.    As my dictionary says, chanting
is to sing or utter musically or rhythmically.     Thus it would
be an offence to sing an obscene or racially abusive form of
words but not to shout them.     It is a fine distinction made
only by the method of delivery of the words.     Having discussed
it with the football authorities and the police we believe
chanting is too narrow.     The offence needs to cover offensive
noises so as to include grunting, for example, as often
happens when black players are in possession of the ball.
Obscene gestures also need to be caught.     And, as discussed
      , this offence might also be defined so as to cover the
thrown banana causing (racial) offence.


15.   Some missile throwing behaviour could be more serious
than that we have been considering.     But we see no need to
provide for it here since it will be caught by sections 1-4 of
the 1986 Act.


16.   I am aware that there are widely differing views on what
is obscene in the existing law on obscenity and what is not.
I see no need to attempt to get round that difficulty in our
proposed offence.    I would not have thought though that the
offence we are trying to construct should include concepts of
depraving and corrupting.


17.   Obscene or racialist abuse is certainly difficult to
define.   What we want to stop is shouting, chanting, gesturing
and grunting which is abusive and either obscene or racialist.
For certaintly and clarity we would like the definition to be
as objective as possible;     but I recognise that subjectivity
is unavoidable in this area.     The Attorney General has said
that he has no wish to play a part in authorising prosecutions
for these new offences as he does for offences involving
racial incitement.
Going on the pitch without reasonable excuse.


18.   This offence is necessary not only to prevent pitch
invasions which can lead to disorder but also to introduce
sanctions to ensure that the lowering of the level of
perimeter fences or their complete removal is not abused.
Defences to the offence will be necessary so that people can
go onto the pitch in the interests of safety, or because they
are injured, frightened, or unwell etc, or because they are
directed or authorised to do so by the police or someone else
in authority.   We need to ensure that the host of players,
referees, managers, coaches, linesmen, ball boys, members of
the emergency services, disabled spectators sitting in their
wheelchairs in front of the stands, press photographers etc
ar^j^not caught if duly authorised to be "on the pitch".    "On
the pitch" I think should probably include any area beyond the
pitch, and also any area such as a running track which may
encircle the area.   In total I think this comes to the pitch
itself and any area which is not part of the accommodation for
viewing spectators and which is between such accommodation and
the pitch.


19.   We are ready to discuss, if you wish.

                                                    OFFENCES IN THE GROUN D
   289. A lthough in c id en ts o f physical violence inside g r o u n d s are now m u c h fewer, th e re r e m a in s an
u n d e r c u r r e n t o f u nruly b e h a v i o u r w h ich can a n d occasionally d o es result in disorder. T h re e ac tivities in
p a r ti c u la r have this pote ntia l: (i) th r o w in g coins a n d o th e r m issiles ( ii) c h a n tin g obscene o r racialist abuse
(iii) going o n to the p itch w i t h o u t r e a s o n a b le excuse.

     i.       T h e r e can be no po ssib le excuse for hurling missiles at a sports g ro u n d . It is not only d angerous in
              itself. It m a y a n d often does incite others to d o likewise: t h a t m a y a n d often does provoke reta liation.
              Violence m a y th e n escalate.

      ii.     N o -o n e could exp e ct th a t-verb al exchanges on th e terraces w ould be as polite as th o se at a vicarage
              tea party. But sh o u tin g or c h a n tin g gross obscenities or racialist a b u s e ought not to be p e r m itte d . If
              one starts, oth e rs jo in in. a n d to th e m a jority o f r ea so n ab le su p p o r te r s , as well as to those abu sed , the
              so u n d o f such ch a n ts f r o m n u m b e r s in u nison is offensive a n d pro vocative.

      iii. R u n n in g on the p itch often provokes a n d is th e p relu d e to disord er. T h is is not ju st b ec au s e it
           in te rru p ts the gam e o r b e c a u s e it invades the hallow ed turf. It is o f te n d o n e with the in ten tio n o f
           attack ing som e o ne. E v en if th e in vasio n is n o t w ith in tent to attack th e referee, a player or o p p o sin g
           fans, it te m p ts o th e rs to follow suit. If rival fans c o m e o n to the p itc h violence will prob ab ly brea k
           out. Even u they do not. th e r e may well be v io len t exchanges w ith police seeking to repel the
           invaders. A fan m a y r u n o n to th e pitch merely to co n g r a tu la te a goal scorer. But his action could well
           provoke o p p osing fans (d isp le ase d by the goal anyway) to i n v a d e th e p itch with less benign intent.

 t         O ug ht not these activ itie s th e re fo re to be m a d e c rim in al offences? T h is has been raised before. M r
 Ju stic e Popplewell c o n s i d e r e d ’ th e sa m e three activities. A fter discu ssing w h e t h e r they should be m a d e

    clearly include throw in g a missile, r u n n i n g onto th e pitch, seeking to clim b over or to pull dow n a p e r im e te r

    w ith a grey h o u n d or horse race. I suggest th a t it sh o u ld be triable s u m m a r ily a n d there should be a pow er o f
    arrest. I re c o m m e n d , therefore, that consideration sh o u ld be g iven to crea ting an offence o f disorderly
     conduct at a sports ground."

     291. T his r e c o m m e n d a t i o n w as n o t ta k e n up. At the ti m e M r J u s tic e Popplewell reported, the Public O r d e r
  Act 1986 was in p re p a ra tio n . It c re ate d new offences rela ting to p u b lic o r d e r b u t n o n e specifically rela te d to
  co n d u c t inside sports gro un ds. E v id e n c e f ro m the H o m e Office gives two re a so n s for this. First, it was th o u g h t
  w ron g in prin ciple to trea t football or spo rts gro un ds as a special case. Secondly, it was ap parentl y th o u g h t that
  the pr o visio ns o f th e 1986 Act, es pecially section 5. sufficiently covered th e field.

       292. As to the first reason, on e m u s t surely look at the n a tu re o f th e mischie f. T h e three specified activities
   would , o f course, be an an ti-so cia l n u is a n c e anyw here. But at a d e s ig n a te d spo rts gro und they are fraught
   w ith p ote ntia l disorderly con s eq u e n ce s. T h e re is good reaso n th e re fo re to treat as a special case the
   p r o h ib iti o n o f these activities at such grou nds. By analogy, havin g alcohol in one's blood over a fixed limit
   has bee n m a d e an offence only in rela tio n to driving, b ec au se it is d a n g e r o u s to the public in th a t special
   context.

      293. T h e se cond reason req u ires a n e x a m in a tio n o f sections 4(1) a n d 5(1) o f th e 1986 Act. So far as is
   rele vant, these provide as follows:-

      “ 4(1) A person is guilty o f an offence if he -

            (a) uses tow ards a n o t h e r p e r so n th rea te n in g , abusive o r in su lting w ord s o r b e h a v io u r . . .


                                                                             50
            with in t e n t to cause th a t perso n to believe t h a t im m e d i a te unla wful v io len ce will be used again st h im
            or a n o t h e r by an y person, o r to prov oke th e im m e d i a te use o f unla w ful vio lence by th a t p e r so n or
            anoth er, o r w hereb y th a t p erso n is likely to believe th a t such violence will be used or it is likely th a t
            such violence will be pro v o k ed . . .

  5(1) A person is guilty o f an offence if he -

    (a)     uses th r e a te n in g , ab usiv e o r insu lting w o rds o r behavio ur, o r d isord erly b e h a v io u r . . .
            w ithin the he a r in g o r sight o f a p erson likely to be caused h ara ssm e n t, a la r m or distress thereby".

    294. T h ro w in g missiles could only be caught u n d e r section 5 as “ d isord erly b e h a v io u r " if the a d d i tio n a l
e l e m e n t were pro ved th a t it was “ w ith in the h ea rin g o r sight o f a perso n likely to be caused h a ra ssm e nt, a l a r m
or distress thereby". To a d d u c e evid en ce o f this la st e lem e n t m a y be very difficult in d eed. It should surely be
sufficie nt to show th a t th e ac cused th rew a missile at a football m a tch .

   295. As to o bscen e o r racialist c h a n tin g sim ila r difficulties arise. A ltho ugh the c h a n tin g may be pro v ed
ab u s iv e or in sulting it w o u ld also have to be show n, u n d e r section 4. th a t it was used "to w a rd s a n o th e r perso n
. . . w ith in tent to cause th a t perso n to believe th a t im m e d i a t e unla wful vio lence will be used against h im etc".
P r o o f o f those e lem e nts m a y not be possible.

   296. U n d e r section 5, whilst again the c h a n tin g m a y b e proved to have c o n t a in e d “ abusive o r in su ltin g
w o rd s" , it m a y be difficult to show th a t this was d o n e “w ith in the hearin g o r sight o f a person likely to be
cau sed h ar a ssm e n t, alarm or distress th e re b y ". T h e w o rds m a y cause n o th in g o t h e r t h a n disgust.

    297. N o r               section 18 o f th e Act help. U n d e r the h e a d in g “Acts i n t e n d e d or likely to stir u p racial
 h a t r e d " , the s ^ p b n p rovid es as follows so far as is r e le v a n t :-

    " 18( 1) A perso n w ho uses threatenin g, ab u s iv e o r insulting w ord s or b e h a v i o u r . . . is guiltv o f a n offence
    if-

       (a) he in te n d s thereb y to stir u p racial h atre d , or

          (b) having regard to all the circ u m sta n c e s racial hatred is likely to be stirred up thereby".

     298. R acialist abuse o f the k in d c h a n te d at footb all m a tc h e s is prob ab ly n o t in te n d e d to stir u p racial
  h atre d . N o r could it readily be p rov ed th a t racial hatre d was likely to be stirred up. T h e effect o f such
  c h a n tin g is to give c h e a p a n d ignoble a m u s e m e n t to th ose p a r tic ip a tin g w hilst causin g offence a n d
  e m b a r r a s s m e n t to th ose ab u s ed a n d to the d ec en t m a jo rity o f fans.

     299. For these reasons. I do not c o n s id e r th a t th e activ ities w hich M r Justice Popplewell co n clu ded sh o u ld
  be the subject o f a c r im in a l offence are covered by the 1986 Act. H e set out th e a rg u m e n ts for a n d again st
  legislation to p r o h ib it th e m at para g ra p h s 4.42 to 4.74 o f his Final Report. I d o not rehearse those a rg u m e n ts.
  I agree with his conc lusio n th a t on balance, d e s p ite the difficulties o f d r a f tin g a n d enforcem ent, these
  activities sh ou ld be pro h ib ite d . M r Ju stice Popplewell c o n c lu d e d th a t a “ ca tc h-a ll” offence o f d iso r d e r ly
  c o n d u c t at a sports g r o u n d should be co nsidered . Ia p pre cia te the force o f his rea sonin g. However, I would
  prefer to see sep arate offences in respect of each of the th ree activities I have m entioned. T he obje ct o f the
  legislation m u s t be not merely to p rosecute offences w hen th ey o cc u r b u t to d e t e r th e m . Ifthere is a specific
   offence of th ro w ing missiles at a d esig nated sports grou nd , a sep arate specific offence o f chantin g ob sc en e or
   racialist abuse there a n d a th ird specific offence o f going on the p itch w ith o u t rea so n ab le excuse there a n d . if
   full publicity is given to the legislation, hooligans will know precisely w h at is p r o h ib ite d an d th a t th e y do
   th o se things at th e ir peril.

       300. As to going on the pitch, Ihave a reason for r e c o m m e n d in g p r o h ib iti o n a d d itio n a l to those w h ich
   c o n v in c e d M r Justice Popplewell. Ihave r e c o m m e n d e d lowering th e level o f fences a n d rem oving spikes a n d
   o v erhanging sections. T h a t relaxation is m a d e in th e interests o f the dec en t m a jo r ity o f sup po rters w h o have
   no yen to in v a d e th e pitch. To back u p the lesser d e te r re n t effect o f lower fences I th ink it p r u d e n t to h av e a
   c r im in a l sa n c tio n ag ainst pitch invasion.

      301. Iap p r e c ia te th a t at som e sports g r oun ds th e re is a tr a d i tio n o f r u n n in g o n to the pitch w hen th e gam e
   is over sim ply f ro m jo i e de vivre o r to pat players o n the back. At M urrayfield. for example , schoolboys sit on
   form s on the p itch side o f the p e r im e te r fencing a n d run on harm lessly at the en d of the game. Again, going
   o n to the pitch to escape so m e h a z a r d on the terraces in an em ergency sh o u ld , o f course, be legitim ate.
   Accordingly, th e offence should be a i m e d at p r o h ib itin g in v a sio n o f th e pitch w ith o u t good r e a so n or
   rea sonable excuse. T he police will in this as in m a n y o th e r s itu a tio n s have to exercise sensible disc re tion a n d
   ju d g m e n t.


                                                                       51

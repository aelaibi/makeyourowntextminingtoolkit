Q36.     HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF FANS IN THE

         STANDING AREA TO THE FRONT OF THE WEST STAND?



 IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE FANS WERE CONCENTRATED IN SECTIONS 3 AND 4

 AND THAT THERE WERE SPACES IN SECTIONS               AND 6.   I SUBSEQUENTLY

 ESTABLISHED THAT THE TICKETS FOR T H E ^ H O L E OF THE LEPPINGS LN TERRACE

 WERE SOLD AS A SINGLE BLOCK A N D ^ N S U F F I C I E N T HAD BEEN DONE TO DIR ECT

FANS TO SECTIONS 1, 2 AND 6 , yfl-iAT IS AN INHERENT FAULT IN THE

TURNSTILE ARRANGEMENTS,      ^/F U R T H E R FAULT IS THAT FANS WOULD BE DRAWN

THROUGH THE TUNNEL INTO SECTIONS 3 AND 4 AS THEY COULD SEE PLAY TAKING

PLACE.




Q37.     DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED

         FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?



 AN UNSATISFACTORY ASPECT OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE DISASTER WAS THE

 LACK OF    INFORMATION GIVEN TO EVERYONE IN THE GROUND.          THERE WAS A

 GREAT DEAL OF HOSTILITY ON THE PART OF NOTTS FOREST FANS TOWARDS

LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS BECAUSE THEY WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THEY WERE

 WITNESSING CROWD DISORDER.       THE HOSTILITY COULD HAVE GENERATED

 VIOLENCE.    THERE SEEMED TO BE AN INORDINATELY LONG TIME BEFORE THERE

 WAS ANY BROADCAST ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE FIRST TWO WERE LARGELY

 INAUDIBLE.     IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE FANS WOULD SEE FOR THEMSELVES THAT

 THERE WERE FATALITIES,     BY BODIES ON THE PITCH THAT THEY QUIETENED

 DOWN.




Q 3 8 . IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

       TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

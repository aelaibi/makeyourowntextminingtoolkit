               play and get             up to A n fi e l d as often as             possible      in a season.

               If    it's an away ground               I always       try to get        into the Liverpool                   end.      On

               this Saturday,               the   first     thing    I noticed was        that        there was         no    cordons

               set up near          the gr ou nd making             sure that       ticket holders              only,      could

              get access           to the turnstiles.                I. was shouting        outside           the grou-
                                                                                                                     P AGE          2

see    if anyone         had got any          ' s p a r e 5 tickets and at about 2 pm (1400)                               I

went     up a hill           going awa y from the ground where                            there were a lot of

people       corning down out of a public                      house           so    I. decided to go that way

because        there were           too m an y     people asking                for    tickets wi th in one area.

At    the    top of the hill             I was        still    shouting              for a ticket and

e v en t u a l l y    I got    one.      It cost me £ 1 4 . 0 0                cash.      It was       for the

L ep pi ng s Lrt Stand.              This was al^out 2.3 0                 pm       (1430).      We went          back down

the    hill     to the L ep pings            Ln / E n d yid there was                  just masses           of

peoples at the t u r n s ti ^ ey f                A         y6f      those          people defi ni te ly d i d n ’t

have     tickets,        I also       noti ce d thatLjLfoe queue                     for the stands was

unusually            long.     There was a lot of                   people          trying to jump over              the

t urnstiles.            The Police          seemed to be short                      of men and disorganised.

T here was           only one       p ol iceman at the              gate       I was at,       which was S ec t io n C,

L e p p i n g s Ln End.         There       was    so many          people          there at the turnstiles

that     I was        crushed       right    up a g a i n s X a corner                of a wall        and    I could see

people       lifting         children up a b o v / their                  heads       to give      them air.          There

was a Police Sergeant                  on a h j / r / f e / f h s    had three           stripes       an his arm)

trying       to break         up the     c r o w / / nd Vt_jthat               point     it seemed         impossible          to

gain access            to the ground,             to get      in.         I e ve nt u al l y did get              in by the

tur ns t i l e at the          s t a n d y ^ T had to throw my ^icjiet stub                          in the        cashier
                                            /                    /    ST

pitch.         I made my-'way to the seat where                            I           t saw a lot of activity,

P olice      running         in and out       of the        control            bo;< which      I was       close     to.       By

then     the game        had k i c k e d o f f , just,              and    I then sajiK'a lot of                  people

near     the front of the L ep pi ng s Lrs standing ar^a/se/fning ly climbing on

people       back off         the    fence.        It was      then that              I saw St John

Ambulancemen              tugging at Police          near and         pointing       to a gate        in the

fence and         I saw a P o l i c e m a n o^en^that            gate,       the g a m e had been stopped

by then.          I saw a lot of Poli/ejrfe^i climbing                       onto    the fence        trying       to

gra b    people      to     lift    them u p / ^ v e ^ t h e   fence and a lot of people                    getting

out     of this      gate.         T hen there was a lot of panic,                       a lot of     confusion

and     I saw     police      offj/cers and St John A m b u l a n c e m e n and some                   fans

giving m o ut h to mtyuth r es us ci ta ti on to                     people w h o were         lying on the

pitch.        I tihen A \ w        Liverpool      fans that          seemed    to be a ttack i ng

photographers// ancjyNotti ngham Forest                        fans were          singing      "Get off       the

pitch'1.        They       probably     thought      it was a pitch               ir^vaj^on.     The    police

a n n o u n c e d that      the m a t ch had been a b a n d o n e d / a n d ^ o u l d / t        be    possible

for us to         remain       inside      the ground while            tHe / n juVa-d^ were         tre a t e d so

the m a j o r i t y of us did,             we were    too stunned to               Ip ave the g r o u n d .

A fter about an hour and a half                      1 headed         back    to the       car and met        up

w it h my mates.             The    crush at the t urnstiles was very very serious

indeed.         It is very          possible      that    I w ould      have       got    injured     if I'd

s tayed outside,             and    I ’m sure     that other          p e op le /w ou ld have       been    injured

too.       In my opinion,            the     reason for this           happen in a was         1a c:k o f

       WITH YOUR TURNSTILE?        IF S O , EXPLAIN THE P R O B L E M .



               No?     not with the operation of the turnstile it

               was operating correctly but when there was a substantial

               increase in supporters wishing to gain entry then the

               numbers made it difficult for the turnstile to move

               its correct distance before allowing entry to others.

            I could 3msII drink on the breath of supporters

            any supporter drinking or in possession of alcohol.




020. DID YOU WITNESS AMY OF THE CROWD PROBLEMS OUTSIDE THE

       GROUND AT LEPPINGS LANE ENTRANCE?



           There became a time when there was a surge of supporters

           attempting    to gain entry into the ground through the

           turnstiles.    I could also hear being said        "Let us in

           t h e r e ’s people dying out here'.      I also heard them

           shouting for a large gate situated between the two blocks

           of turnstiles to be opened.
                                                                        PAGE

G21. DID YOU SEE PEOPLE GAINING ACCESS TO THE FOOTBALL

       GROUND BY UNAUTHORISED MEANS?     BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.



            Yes,   I heard footsteps on the roof of the turnstiles

            and in the crush of people trying to get in I had to

            admit hundreds of supporters who had'nt got tickets.

            It was impossible for me to send them back.       1 could

            not at this time bring this fact to the notice of anyone

            in authority.     Before this surge of supporters   I was

            able to number the tickets to count the persons who

            had got   into the ground through my turnstile.     At this

            time I was able to send them back or if they did

            manage to get in a Police Officer would escort them

            back out.

            From quits early on it was apparent that a number

            of Liverpool    fans had tickets for the Spion Hop.




G22.   DID YOU SEE GATE C OPENED AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO KICK OFF

       EXPLAIN.

       THE OPENING OF GATE C?    BRIEFLY E X P L A I N .



            Only as I've described,     I could only see the front

Q27.   IF YOU WITNESSED IT AT THAT TIME DID YOU KNOW WHO AUTHORISED

       THE GATE TO BE OPENED?




            No




Q28.   IF NOT, HAVE YOU ANY INFORMATION WHICH MAY ASSIST IN

       IDENTIFYING THE PERSON WHO OPENED THE GATE?



            I have heard from speaking with two of the programme

           sellers whom I know only as         that he was present

           when a Police Constable ordered a club steward to open

           t h g a te .

G34.   CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE BUILD UP OF SUPPORTERS IN LEPPINbS

       LANE BETWEEN 2Pivi AND KICK-OFF?



            As far as I was concerned it was a normal match day      until

            2.30pm when there was a notieafale increase in supporters

            entering the ground.    I was also concerned about the

            number of supporters who were offering me money to gain

            a d m it tan ce .




Q35.   WERE YOU AWARE OF ANY TICKET TOUTS OUTSIDE THE GROUND?

       BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.



            When the supporters were entering the ground a number of

            them had said that they had bought tickets outside the

            ground which only allowed admittance   into the Spion Kop

            (Notts Forest end),.   The tickets had been purchased that

            day.



            I could only accept tickets marked

Q37.   DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH OR CROWD SURGE IN ANY OF THE

            No




Q 3 9 . DID YOU WITNESS ANY OF THE DEATHS?   BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.



            1 did not witness any deaths but after the kick off

            I did see people being carried towards gate'C" who

           were obviously very seriously injured.     These   injured

            persons came out of the tunnel area.

(340. DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED?

      IF SO BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.



          No




(341. DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR   IN THE

     DEATHS OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?



          I did admit on© person who was in possession of a

          ticket through the turnstile from Leppings Ln who

          had obviously been injured.    One of two persons who

          was accompanying him told me to let people through

          quickly as people were dying outside.    That was about

          2.35pm.   I consider that the build up of supporters

          trying to get   into the ground was too much for the

          turnstile to cope with.




<342. DID YOU WITNESS ANY OBSTRUCTIVE ACTION BY FANS TOWARDS THE

     POLICE, STEWARDS OR OTHER PERSONS IN AUTHORITY DURING THE

     DISASTER?   BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.



          I was subjected to abuse by Liverpool   supporters.     I

             wasn't particulary frightened by this as I was

             protected by the building which houses the turnstile.




<543. WERE YOU SUBJECTED TO ANY THREAT OR VIOLENCE? BRIEFLY EXPLAIN,




            Only as I ’ve described




044. WERE YOU INJURED?    IF S O „ EXPLAIN,



            No




Q45.   DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL

       OFFENCE?



            No
                                                                        PAGE    16

<346. DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE DISASTER

        WAS HANDLED AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?



             I could hear announcements    coming over the tannoy

             system asking Liverpool   supporters to leave the

             terrace through the tunnel.    However,   I consider the

             content of the information was insufficient for persons

             to understand what had happened.




<347. FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A TURNSTILE OPERATOR,       IS THERE

        ANYTHING SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS MATCH WHICH

        IN YOUR OPINION MADE IT DIFFERENT FROM SIMILAR PREVIOUS

        MATCHES?



             I had not operated a turnstile    in a match of similar

             signit i cancs




<348.   IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO

        THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?



             I don't consider that there was enough communication

             between the persons   in authority between the Police,

             Stewards and other groundstaff.

             I consider that whatever the reason the wrong ga
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 D96'5

              was opened as the other gate        *8 5 did not give direct

              access to the tunnel.         As it was     if the communication

               between Police Officers had been better 1 saw enough

              Police Officers within the enclosure to block off

              entry into the tunnel.




Q49.    IT MAY SE ALLEGED THAT YOU ALLOWED SUPPORTERS THROUGH YOUR

       TURNSTILE WHO HAD NO TICKET AND THAT YOU MAY HAVE THEREFORE

        INCREASED THE NUMBER OF AUTHORISED SPECTATORS TO THE GROUND

       IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO SAY AT THIS TIME IN RELATION

       TO THAT POSSIBLE FUTURE ALLEGATION?



              Money was offered to me by supporters and in some cases

              put onto my s i d e X T    the turnstile.     Without exception I

              handed all tly's money back to the person who had given

              i t rne .

              I did admit hundreds of supporters           into the ground

              through the turnstiles without tickets because,           due

              to the crush,        there was nowhere else for them to go,

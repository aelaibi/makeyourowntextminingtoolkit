was     fairly           quiet           at     the       turnstiles              at       that       time       with       just     a    few        people

hanging            about         by      Ihe        turnstiles.                  We    thought          it       was       too    e a r 1y      to    go

i nto    the         qround           at      that        t ime      so    we     went       and       got       some       chi ps       and      a.te

them     in a           park        near        to       Lepping          Ln.         There       were       a    few       other        supporters

in    the         pa r k ,     some        were          playing          football.               I    can       remember          seeing            some

supporters               with         cans          of    beer       in    the        street, walking                      towards        the

ground.              There          was       no     disorder             or     drunkenness,                all       the       supporters

searned           happy        and       in     high       spirits.               We       remained          in       the    park        f or     about

half     an        hour        and       then        we    had       a    general           walk       round          the    area.           The

numbers            of    supporters                  was       building           up       gradualy.              There          were     supporters

with     cans           of     beer        in       the    street,             but     again          there       was       no    drunkennes,

they     were           all      in a         happy        mood.




At    about          quarter             past        two       (1415),           we    decided          to       go    into       the     ground,

and     made         our       way       to     the       Lepping          Ln     turnstiles.                    Upon       arrival          at      tne

turnstiles               I was           very        surprised             to     see       I"?ow q u i e t       it       was.      x expected

i t to       be      very        busy,          but       the       queues        at       the    turnstiies                were     about           tive

deep,.         It only took          as a couple         of minutes          to enter       the ground.             I

knew which set of turnstiles                       to go through,,            because       I a t t e nd e d   the

corresponding match at H i ll s bo r ou g h                     last year.        There were            H o 1 i c em s n

with       helmets         outside    the     turnstiles who were              generally keeping

people         in line,       but    there were       no real      problems at that                time.       I did

not      see any stewards             outside      the turnstiles.              I handed my ticket                  in at

the      turnstile and             retained the stub.             I still       have    the stub          in my

possession.                I did not      see any gates          open other       than the turnstiles.

I did not see any sort                    of unau th or is ed entry            into the ground at               the

rf y s e l t   and             then made       our way up the stairs at the                        rear of the

we had         left him outside             the ground as he was meeting                     up w ith someone

else.          We diet not have any             problems        finding       our seats.           ifie r e were

.1.e 11 e rs on the          r ear of the West S tand whi ch ass i sled us i n t i n a x ng ouf

seats.          My seat was about             eight      rows    back from the front and was

vi rtually           in a line with the            left    hand goal          post.     We got        to our seats

at about         twenty       past    two     (1420).      i-rom the time         that       I. entere d       uie

ground,         I did not see any disorder,                     drunkennes       or any        people      drinking.



Fro m my seat              I was    o verlo oking     t h e two    c e n t ra 1 o e n s be hi net the          goal.

At twenty            past two       (1420)    it was very packed in both                     p e n s , more     so in

the      right       hand    pen,    w hich    I now know as           pen three,       and       it was

obvious         that a lot of people were                  still       entering       both pens.           It was

very       packed      in those       pens at that         time,       but    not a crush at            that     stage.

I could see            the fans       in the      pens    being g r ad ua ll y        pushed forwards               as

Whlist       I was        in    there         I remember             looking           o ut      of    a    window             tha.t

overlooks          the       rear     of      the       turnstiles.             As     I    looked          out       I       could        see     it

was    very       congested           outside            the    turnstiles.                   I also          saw         a    lad        sitting

on    top    of    the       turnstile             block.       He    was       sitting           at       the     end         of     t he

turnstile          block        near       to      what       I now       know       to     be    Gate        ’8 s .           The        l ad    was

offering          his    ticket          to     Police         and    stewards              who       were       on       the       inside         of

he    did    io,       lots     of    people            climbed       up    onto           the    top       of     the         turnstile

block,       there       was       about        thirty.             All    of     these          people          ‘

helped       down       inside        the       ground         by    stewards              and    Police.                 Because            of

events       outside,           we    remained            in    the       toilet           and     carried            on       looking            out

of    the    window.




Ac    about       ten    to     three         ( 1430) , I           could       see        tnau       there        was         a    lot      ot

Police       and       stewards          running          over       towards           it,       as    if     to      see          what      was

to    three       (14*33)       so    we      made       our    way       Pacts        to    our       seats.




Having       got       back     to    my      seat,       I    could       see         that       it    was        even more               packed

in    pens    three?         and     four       and      people       looked           very       uncomfortable                       in     there.

The    players          were       not     yet      on    the       pitch       when        I got          back       to       my     seat,        b ut

This        was       caused            by    a. F o r e s t             striker?             Nigel          CLOUGH,                  intercepting                   a       back

pass        and       threatening                      the    Liverpool                  goal.           Bruce                  GROBELAAR              came      forward

to      challenge             ClOUGh            and          it      was       as    though             tne         people             in        the    pens         went

forwards              with        him.             This       is         my    only       real          recollection                        of        the    match

itself           as     my    attention                  was         drawn          to    events                 below           me.        More        and      more

people           were        getting               out       of      the       pens       as       time           went           by,       by        getting         over

the       dividing            fences               and       over         the       top       of    the           front           perimeter                 fence.




I       remember         the           game        being          stopped            and       by       this           time           it    was        chaos         down

below         me.        It       appeared               to       me      at       that       stage          that               people           may    have         been

injured.                I never              realised                that          people          may           have           died.




We      d e cid e d      to       re m a i n           in our            seats       in       ca s e                            wanted           to    try    and            Find

                         eventually                     came         up       to    us    as. about,                twenty             tive           past     t,nree

(1525>.               Shortly             after          this            we    decided             to    leave                  the    ground?              stiii

unaware            as    to       how        serious              things            were       on       the         pitch.                 There        was      a       man

behind           us     in    the         stands             with         a    radio.              It    came             over         the           radio    just

before           we     left           the    ground,             that         there          had       been           five           deaths.               I c o u l d n ’t

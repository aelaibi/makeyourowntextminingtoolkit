HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - COMPENSATION PAYMENTS

I refer to Mr Walker's letter of 25 January and my letter of 26
January to Mr Farmer, Lord Chancellors Department, which were
copied to you, about the possibility of the South Yorkshire
Police Authority making compensation above the "statutory"
bereavement provision. I now attach a copy of Mr Farmer's reply
of 30 January for your information.

2.   Mr Farmer mentions that the Lord Chancellor is conducting
a review of the level of bereavement damages and that in some
recent cases settlements have been made for sums above the

•
present statutory level of £3,500.      (In the Zeebrugge case
payments in the region of £10,000 were made and in the Kings
Cross disaster the minimum payment was set at £7,500.) He also
points out that the level of settlement must always be a matter
for the parties concerned.

3.   Mr Walker said that a figure of £10,000 had been discussed
by the Authority's insurers and the Steering Committee.     South
Yorkshire are asking us whether any payments beyond the statutory
requirement, which the Authority considered to be appropriate,
would be grant-aided.

4.   When South Yorkshire Police Authority asked us whether the
Home Office will consider giving further special assistance to
them in connection with uninsured compensation liabilities which
might arise out of the Hillsborough disaster, we said that our
expectation would be that the Authority should take steps to
cover this contingency from its own resources (including the
grant it receives from the Government).

5.   I consider therefore that we must agree to pay police
specific grant at the usual rate on any compensation payments
agreed between the parties.   If their legal advice is to offer
a payment for bereavement above the statutory provision then
police grant should be payable on those amounts.      However, I
consider that we do have a right to know and comment on amounts
which are well beyond the statutory bereavement figure, but I
would have considered payments up to £10,000 to be reasonable in
the circumstances.

6.   According to Mr Walker 44 of those who died have families
who would be entitled to bereavement damages; there are possibly
25 more.   If settlements were made at the £10,000 level there
would be costs of at least £440,000 and a maximum of £690,000
depending on the final number of payments. We would be expected
to meet 51% of this cost. South Yorkshire are insured fbr claims
of up to £8 million in all.
6.   I attach a draft letter to Mr Walker giving our views on
these payments and I would appreciate your comments before I
reply.

                        HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - COMPENSATION PAYMENTS

                        Thank you for your letter of         25 January about the
                        possibility of the South Yorkshire   Police Authority making
                        compensation payments above the       statutory bereavement
                        provision of £3,500.     You asked    whether such payments
                        would qualify for police specific     grant.

                        We understand that the Lord Chancellor is to review the
                        statutory provision for compensation and that there have
                        been some recent cases where payments have been made above
                        the amount specified. Ultimately it is for the parties
                        involved to negotiate the level of settlement in each
                        case. As far as the grant position is concerned, I can
                        confirm that if, on legal advice, your Authority proposes
                        to settle at a higher level then the statutory figure than
                        police grant will be payable on these amounts.




        H.O. EST. 112
S 536                                                                       35688 9.85 XNW
Obviously we have a direct interest in the level of
payments in public expenditure terms and therefore if your
Authority proposes to settle at a figure in excess of
£10,000 per case we would like to be consulted beforehand.

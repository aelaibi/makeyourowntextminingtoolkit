             Fu rth er    to my answers         given    in ttfe que stionnai re I wo uld                   like to add

             that     I had supporters          from Liv erpool           and N o t t i n g h a m Forest,       they mixed

             well     and w e r e really well Jjfehaved.                  I, nor my staff,         received any             bad

             tr ea tme nt      from them a n d U o      damage was          cay'sed to my       property-         As    I

             said     I was     surpr ise d how well         behaved /they were.               In answer       to the

             allegation         I was    selling     dr i nks    from a van on my           car    park,      I deny

             this.       I never      had any    out    sa         t all,      the only        beer    taken awa y          from

             my     premises was        in my glasses.           I was so busy         I never        had    chance     to

             leave the         bar.     My   15 year    old son,                     was    outside         co lle cti ng

             glasses     all a f t e rn oo n and he wo uld have               told me      if any beer was             being

             sold outside.

             I have a small           car    park,   maybe      15 cars.        It was     quite full         on the        day

             due to a bowls match being                 played     on the      bowling      green.          There was a

            blue Transit        van parked on the           car   park with side windows          but   I

            believe        that was    dr i v en by football       fans,    as    I had never seen      it

            before and        it d i s ap pe ar e d after   the fans       left   the match.      I d o n ’t own

            a van or have access             to one,    the only vehicle          I own is a V a u x h a l 1

            C a va li er   saloon     reg.   no.                  On   that      lunchtime my sales         show I

            sold ap p r o x i m a t e l y 400   pints   of beer and some          bottled   beers.

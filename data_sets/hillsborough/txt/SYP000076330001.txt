    be    about         1 . 4 0 pm         (1440)       maybe          a    bit        earlier,

    We    continued               on       our    journey          and          generally             the      traffic         flow was          quite

    g ood y although                   it    did       become          a    little              slow     in     places,, As          we

    travelled               on    the       A61    we    were          diverted                along     another         road,        which

    on    looking                at    the       map    I believe                it    to       be    the     A616,      which        then       brought

    us    onto         the       A 6 102«

    On    that         road,          once       ypu    hit       the       built          up    area         I would       think         that       there

    must       have         been       s^e        five       to    ten          pubs       that       were     open.At          each       pub       as    we

    passed         them          lysfaw      fans       drinking                alcohol          sat     out     and

^   stood         aroujra         on       the    pub    car       parks,,             I am          unable      to     estimate           numbers,

    but      it    struck             me    that       the       time       which          would        be    about      five        to    two,       two

    firink        their          drinks          and    get       to       the    ground,,              I assumed         these           supporters

    to    be      for       Liverpool             due    to       the       way       we       were     travelling            into        Sheffield.I

    can      also           clearly          recollect             a    van parked               at     the side        of     the        road       with

    a    roller             shutterdoor            which          goes           up    a nd over         the    too,      with            between

    ten      and       fifteen             supporters             sat       on    the          tail     gate     and     standing           round          and

    about         it,       drinking             alcohol          from          glasses.              Although          they     were       parked           on

    the      road       they          were       actually          outside             a       pub.

                  then       continued             along          that          road       and       eventually          parked           the    car       on

    that       road         <A g 102)        about       ten       minutes             walk          from     the     ground,         and       we    a ll

    got      out       to    walk          the    rest       of    the          way.

    As    we      walked          along          again       I    could          see       a    lot    of     fans     stood         and    sat       about

    mini       buses         drinking             alcohol          from          cans.           I    can't      recall         if    there          was

    any      police          presence             amongst          the          fans.

I    feel          that       the      drinking            aspect          and       the    numbers          of     people         asking        fo r

tickets,                 I think        with         experience             should          have        indicated          to      somebody             a

late         surge         of    arrivals             at     the      ground          and    perhaps            consideration                  should

have         been         given        to    delay         the       start.

Another             aspect          that       I feel           should          be    looked        at,      is     the    access          to    t he

this         is     very        poor.        Also         the    crowd          should       have        been       told      a    lot     sooner

STATEMENT



                          of                               Liverpool
I,

     ;d o b        ) will say as follows




I had a ticket to Entrance B of Leppings Lane.       I went by Coach from

the Huy ton Labour Club and we arrived at the ground about 10 to 3.         I

was with two mates and my Dad and his mate and my Uncle on the Coach

and we all had tickets.



We got there and walked up the road and myself and |        |walked through

the gates and down the tunnel, no-one asked for my ticket.



We got into the ground and it was packed and we moved with the crowd

being pushed forward by the mass.     I grabbed        by the hand and he

screamed, he couldn't breathe,                    then got separated from me

with                  X was squashed down to the front and X couldn t move.

The crush ceased and I made my way to the barrier, it was with the flow

of the crowd.   People were screaming and distressed all around me. I

was terrified but somehow managed to get down the tunnel and a fireman

ran into me and I got out through the gates that I come in.        People

were still coming in and out.



 I walked down the road looking for the coach and I sat down to gather

 myself together.    My Dad’s mate                   came along and he told me

 that h e ’d lost my Dad and I went backwards and forwards looking for him

 and my friends.     I went back into the Ground to find my Dad and mates

 and returned to the Coach and my Dad and mates were already back there.

 We tried to phone home but the lines were engaged and we couldn’t make
 tke call until we were on the motorway home



 I got Counselling help off
                                        who is the Counsellor for me
 and my Dad.




I never went to the hospital as my mates got chased at Alder Hey and

they didn't seen, to get any treatment and so I didn't bother and I

thought it would be a waste of tine.   It is only by persuasion of

my Counsellor that I have come in for advice now.    ’

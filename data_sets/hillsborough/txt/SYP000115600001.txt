Transits are required to act as ambulances. PC HUTCHINSON takes
the transit to Penistone Rd and we don't see him again* At the
Leppings Lane end we are directed to the gymnasium. I see a line
of Police Officers accroes^the tarmac between the North Stand
where it joins the kop^%iey lire*preventing peo|jle getting acceJI
to the gym area* I see stretchers being brought out of the gym
with injured people on that are being placed into ambulances
and taken away. People arrive at the line of Policemen saying
they have lost relatives and frieads* They are not allowed
through. We set up a makeshift casualty enquiry desk and fill
sheet after sheet wit|t details of missing people. Inspector
Robinson comes back from the gym and tells me that there are
at least seventy five dead and possibly more. We initially sit
the relatives and friends in the North stand and some time later
a coach arrives for them.
When everyone had gone we walked to claywheels lane where we
found our transit. We were directed to take a ipealbreak but we
didn't feel like it. We attended two reports of football fans
fighting at the Northern General Hospital but on each occasion
they had gone and it was quiet.
We eventually got back to Claywheels Lane around *l$00 hrs and
went off duty. It
It transpired th^jf of the six prisoners, only three had tickets
for the game.

PHILIP SHAW, POLICE SERGEANT 220?   F2, SUB DIVISION.
HILLSBOROUGH, SATURDAY THE 15th OF APRIL 1989.



On duty at 0900 hrs, Ecclesfield Police St *n.
Briefing in North Stand at Hillsborough at 09^5 hrs approx,
designated serial     mobile transit patrol, call sign TANGO
FOUR.
Other Officers on this serial are 83? CAROL, 2976 WILLIAMS, k
333 OGILVIE, 1822 HUTCHINSON and kO? JOHNSON. Insp ROBINSONl\
in charge of serials M>T-5Q -andi51 decides to ride in oar 'kV _pr-
vehicle.
After a quick packed steal we drive out to the Foxhill area.
Things are very quiet for ages. After a while we recieve a
report that there are a lot of football fans in the Fox public
house on Foxhill Road. Insp ROBINSON and 333 go inside but iT's
not too busy. They have words with the landlord and we leave.
This was probably around 1230 hrs. A short time later we have
a report of youths urinating outside a chip shop, in Trafalgar
Road. When we turn up the youths have gone and the area is quiet.
Shortly afterwards we are told that a youth has just urinated in
someones garden on Wilcox load. We stop a group of about four
Liverpool supporters walking uphill away from the ground. They
are all drinking beer from cans, none admit urinating. We turn
them around and direct them towards the ground. It's prettyvobvious
that they intend drinking for a bit longer before going to the
match.
We carry on patrolling the Foxhill area and it's still comparatively
quiet. The Fox is getting busier but nothing exceptional happening.
The Gate and the Travellers are closed and just letting regulars in
the back doors by the looks of it.
At approx 130g hrs we are directed to
                where some youths have allegedly stolen some property.
We see the complainant who states that six youths have been into
the shop. They've all picked up a handfull of sweets and run outside.
She attempted to stop one of them and was clouted on her head for
troubles. They all got into a white van and she took the reg no.
At 1320 hrs the van is spotted and we follow it into the car park
of the White Horse, on the opposite side of Halifax Road. The six
youths are arrested. They all smell of drink apart from the driver.
They all deny being involved, a couple are a little aggresive. We
take them to Ecclesfield police Station and book them in etc. This
takes until approx lMf5 hrs. PC OGILVIE is left at Ecclesfield with
the prisoners.
We actually resume from Ecclesfield shortly before the last prisoner
is incarcerated. When we begin to recieve transmissions from the
ground again we can hear that there is a problem with the crowd at
the Leppings Lane turnstiles. Someone is requesting permission to
open a gate to relieve the pressure. There is obviously a problem
with the communications due to the noise of the crowd. We are having
problems hearing messages ourselves. Foxhill appears quiet, we drive
around the ground and this area is also rather quiet. We don't go in
for our scheduled mealbreak as they are obviously having problems
inside the ground. We start hearing requests for ambulances. We park
in Leppings Lane and people are leaving the ground. We hear that there
is a fatality inside, then we hear that three are dead. We can't
believe it. More people sure leaving the ground now and Leppings Lane
is filling up. A lot of the fans are having a go at the Officers on
horses, who are at the side of us. They are dragged away by their mates.
All available Officers are then directed to the Leppings Lane stand.

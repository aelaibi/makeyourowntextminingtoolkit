 Q5Q

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 3.30 PM <1530)

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, f>

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OWN ACCORD,   WHEN THE CROWD   EASED OFF,    I MOVED BACK AND GOT PULLED     UP IN

 WEST STAND, THAT WAS AT ABOUT 3.25       (1525).

Q18

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDL

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE ATTEMPTING TO GET OUT OVER THE FENCING WERE BEING

 PUSHED BACK IN BY THE POLICE.        I THINK THE POLICE AT THE FRONT WERE VER

 TO REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.        IT WAS THE SUPPORTERS WHO TOOK THE INIT]

 TO ACT.   THAT APPLIES TO WHAT WENT ON, ON THE PITCH, WITH REGARD TO THEj
                                                                                   'I

 HELPING OF THE FANS.    EVEN   WHEN EVERYONE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING       ON SOME   PC

 OFFICERS STILL D I D N ’T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I REMEMBER AT ABOUT 2.10    (1410)    I WAS OUTSIDE THE GROUND WITH MY FRIEND

 LOOKING FOR A TICKET FOR HIM, EVEN AT 2.30         (1430) THERE WERE ABOUT A CO

 THOUSAND LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS JUST SITTING AROUND THE LEPPINGS LANE ARE
                                                                      9 j   PAGE
                                                                        I
                                                                        I
DRINKING OR WHATEVER , INSTEAD OF GOING INTO THE GROUND, JUST GONE 2.30 I

POLICE ON HORSEBACK THEN STARTED TO MOVE THESE PEOPLE ALONG TO GET INTq

GROUND,   AS WELL AS OTHERS STILL ARRIVING FROM THE OTHER END.                        j


LAST YEAR AS I HAVE SAID THERE WERE MORE STEWARDS AND POLICE OUTSIDE Thj
                                                                        I
GROUND CHECKING TICKETS WHICH HELPED.               I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DIDlsj

THE SAME THIS YEAR.

EVEN THE POLICE ON THE TURNSTILES D I D N ’T HELP, THEY JUST STOOD THERE WA
                                                                                      !

THE CROWD.                                                                            i
                                                                                      |

IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THEY FLOODED THE AREA CLOSE BY WITH THE STEWARDS A

POLICE.    AS WHERE PEOPLE WERE ENTERING,           BUT NOTHING NEAR THE TUNNEL IN

TUNNEL OR AROUND THE PENS.

IT WOULD ONLY HAVE TAKEN TWO OR THREE POLICEMAN OR STEWARDS STANDING Oisj

TUNNEL TO HAVE SENT PEOPLE AROUND THE SIDES, AS I SAW LAST YEAR.

MY F R I E N D N E V E R       HAD A TICKET, SO HE JUST STOOD CLOSE BEHIND ME BY

TURNSTILE, THE STEWARD LOOKED AT            ME, KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON, BUT JUST     Lj

THROUGH TOGETHER, WHILST LOOKING            AWAY.                                     j

I C A N ’T UNDERSTAND WHY THE POLICE OR WHO EVER DID NOT NOTICE THAT THE M

PENS WERE FULL AND THE SIDE ONES            EMPTY IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS    FROM EARLY C

EVEN LAST YEAR PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING UP INTO THE WEST STAND BUT THEN POL

WERE STOPPING THEM.

I JUST D O N ’T UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR

YEAR THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.

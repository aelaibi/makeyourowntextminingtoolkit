                                                                                                      S
As you know, I have been considering whether there is a case for a further public
inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster in the light of the many representations which
have been received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster
remain unresolved received renewed attention following the Granada television
documentary drama “Hillsborough” last December.


I have had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been put forward,
calling for a new public inquiry. I have decided, in all the circumstances, that there
should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of significance is
overlooked before a final decision is taken. I have, therefore, announced in the
House today that there will be an independent scrutiny by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith,
a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal. I enclose for your information a copy of
my statement to the House, which includes Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s terms of
reference. You will see that I have undertaken to make public the advice which Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith gives me.

All of w h i c h actions were, together w i t h others,

 Rose d a t e d the 14th day of May 1990.



        SKELE TON ARGUMENT OF THE APPELLANT PETER WRIGHT

         IN SUPPORT OF HIS APPEAL AND S K E L E T O N ARGUMENT

         AS RESPONDENT TO THE APPEALS BY ROBER T ALCOCK,

         PE T E R RICHARD COLDICUTT,           CATHERINE M A R E A JONES,

      JOS EPH K E H O E ,   JOHN JAMES O'DELL AND A L E X A N D R A PENK .



 1.      On the      31st day of July 1990         judgment   was     given in a

 number     of test actions brought to establish the

 circu mstanc es and limits within which damages were

 r e c o v e r a b l e in respect of "nervous shock"          arising from

  the d i s a s t e r at Hillsborough Stadium on the occasion of


                                          -3-
the Semi-Final of the F .A . Cup on Saturday the 15th of

April 1989.



2.     On.the occasion of that match severe crushing

occurr ed in..the Leppings Lane end terraces,       pens   3 and 4

leadin g to injuries and loss of life.         None of the

Plaintiffs were themselves      involved in that crushing and

m a n y were not at the ground.     Their claims all arise in

respect of,    it is alleged,   and was assu med by the Learned

Judge for the purposes of these test actions,         psychiatric

illness suffered in consequence of their apprehension for

the safety of, in each case,       an individual w h o m they

bel ieved to be in that crush.



3.     The Defendant appeals against      judgment given in

favour of nine of those Plaintiffs who were successful

and is    Respondent to appeals by six Plaintiffs who were

unsuccessful.



4.     Of the nine successful Plaintiffs       three were parents

of    "victims" namely Agnes Copoc and her hu sband Harold

Copoc and Maureen Mullaney.        Karen H a n k i n was a wife of a

victim.     Brian Harrison and Stephen Jones were brothers

 of victims,   Brenda Hennessey and Denise Hough were

 sisters of victims and Robert Spearrit was the brother of

 one victim and the uncle of a n o t h e r .



 5.     Of the foregoing nine Plaintiffs       only Brian Harrison

 was at the match.     He was   in a stand observing.        The

 remaining eight successful Plaintiffs         succeeded by reason



                                  -4-
of their having perceived the events by means of

t e l e v i s i o n in situations many miles   from the ground.



6.    Where the Plaintiffs'       perception was     by way of

tel-evision that is appealed against and .where the

re-l'at ions hip with the victim was not that, of parent or

spouse that too is appealed against.



7.     It is submitted that for there to be liability for

"nervous      shock" there must be:-



       (i)         Foreseeability of injury by nervous           shock



       {ii)        A duty of care owed by the Defendant to

                    the Plaintiff in the circumstances          to save

                    the Plaintiff harmless       from such injury



       (iii)       A breach of that duty w h e r e b y nervous

                    shock is caused to the Plaintiff and



        (iv)       It is fair,    just and reas onable    for

                    liability to be imposed.



        "..in addition to the for eseeab ility of damage,

        necess ary ingredients      in any situation giving rise

        to a duty of care are that there          should exist

        b e t w e e n the party owing the duty and the party to

        w h o m it is owed a relationship cha rac t e r i z e d by the

        law as one of "proximity" or "neighbourhood"              and

        that the situation should be one in which the Court



                                   -5-
     con siders   it fair,   just and reasonable that the law

     should impose a duty of a given scope on the one

     party for the benefit of the other".



     Caparo    Industries pic -v- Di.ckman. 1990. 2. A. C . 605

     Lord Bridge at 617-618.



     See also Yuen Kun Yeu -v- A. G. Hong Kong 1988 1

     A .c . 175 and in particular at pages 190,        191 and

     192.



     and



      "That foreseeability does not of itself,         and

      aut omatic ally lead to a duty of care is,       I think

      clear".



      Lord Wilberforce McLoughlin -v- O'Brian 1983 A.C.

      410 at 420H.



8.    Un u s u a l l y in negligence,   liability for nervous    shock

in this     context requires a double test to be satisfied

namely foreseeability of harm to the v i c t i m in respect of

w h o m the Defendant has a duty of care to avoid such harm,

and a foreseeability of nervous shock being suff ered by a

person in the position of the Plaintiff arising from a

breach or apprehended breach of duty causing or liable to

cause h a r m to the victim.       In the present case harm

actual      or apprehended to the victim arose by reason of,

what for the purpose of these proceedings was admitted to


                                    -6-
be a breach of duty in failing to pr event third parties

h a s t e n i n g into the crush in crowded pens where the

victims were.



9..   : Foreseeability of harm in mat ters      of nervous   shock

is a matter determined by the Court,        not in the light of

expert evidence adduced in the case,        but according to the

consensus of informed judicial o p i n i o n .    To do otherwise

and to treat the question of fore seeabl e causation and

hence the scope of the Defendant's duty as a question of

fact to be determined in the light of expert evidence

w o u l d be to depart from practice and "would be too large

an innovation in the law" see Lord Bridge,          McLoughlin at

4 32 E - H .



10.     Foreseeability of nervous     shock had been limited to

the spouse or parent of a victim.         The    "rescue" cases and

cases such as Dooley -v- Cammell Laird           1951 1. LlR 271

wer e rightly distinguished by the L e a r n e d Judge.



11.     It is submitted that the categor y of persons to whom

the duty of care is owed in nervous         shock should not be

extended beyond the closest of family ties, parent and

child or. husband and wife.



12.     Any suggestion that there may be liability towards

persons outside such category is, it is submitted obiter.

The observations by Lord Wilberforce in McLoughlin "I

think,         however, that it should follow that other cases

 involving less close relationships m u s t be very carefully
                                                                                Â¥


     scrutinized.     I cannot say that they should never be

     admitted.    The closer the tie       (not merely in

     relationship,    but in care)    the greater the c l a i m for

     c o n s i d e r a t i o n â at page 422, ought not to be take n as an

     invitation as to extend, the category.



     13.                        The present catego rizati on is clear and provi

     certainty.     It avoids the necessity for scr utiniz ing the

     relationship with the victim,         which if it had to be

     embarked upon wo uld require the laying down of criteria

     and an assessment upon evidence according thereto.               Such

     a task would not be practicable and is not an exercise

     that the Court should be encouraged to embark upon.                  The

     problems that it would give rise to are legion.               It is

\    submitted that the necessary degree of care co uld not be

     identified or measured.
j

j
     14.   An extension of the category to include brothers and
;!


i    sisters,    or any other relationship,       should not be carried

!    out unless the degree of caring is determined and the

     relationship scrutinized.         Brothers and sisters       do not

     invariably care for each other.           The wider the category

     is extended the more necessary would become the

t    investigation of the relationship.           It is submi tted that

      the Learn ed Judge erred in his assumptions           as to the

      relationship between the brothers and sisters and in

      observing' as to the absence of any basis in logic or in

      law why that relationship should be excluded             (see the

      judgment at page     47 at letter F ) .



                                        -8-
15.    Whilst it may be that criticis m could be made of the

presum ption in respect of the present category,           spouses,

parents and children,      such has the benefit, as the law

stands,   of a presum ption avo iding the necessity for

investigation and scrutiny.         It is not inappropriate when

t h e .presumption is made in respect of bystanders that

they are ordinarily po s s e s s e d of fortitude sufficient to

enable th em to endure the calamities of modern life.



16.    It is submitted that Mr.      and Mrs.   Copoc, Karen

Hankin and Maureen Mullaney apart,         the remaining five

Plaintiffs were not individuals         in respect of w h o m it was

reasonably foreseeable that they would have suffered

personal injury by shock according to the criteria set

out in the    speech of Lord Wilberforce in M c L o u g h l i n .



17.    It is submitted that in the circumstances the

Learned Judge erred and misd irecte d himself in accordance

wit h the grounds set out at Paragraph 3 of the Notice              of

Appeal.



18.    It is submitted that the duty of care arises only in

circumstances of proximity.         See Lord Wilberforce,

McLoughlin page 422.



19.    The strict test of proximity by sight or hearing,

subject to the extension in respect of immediate

aftermath     should be applied.



 20.   Mr.   and Mrs.   Copoc, Maur een Mullaney and Karen



                                  -9-
Ha n k i n were not in the circumstances and at the material

time sufficiently proximate and at P a r a g r a p h 2 of the

Grounds   of Appeal it is submitted are        satisfied.



21.   .In respect of all those Plaintiffs, not. present at

the event or at the immediate aftermath they were not'

owed a duty of care or, if owed a du ty of care no breach

thereof was made out.



22.   The acquisition of knowledge of some disaster is

not, it is submitted sufficient, w h a t e v e r the

consequences may be for the Plaintiff           of the acquisition

of that knowledge, to found a claim for damages for

nervous   shock.   Some direct perception        of the event or

its aftermath is required.



23.   Brennan J. in Jaensch -v- Coffey 1984 54 A.L.R.               417

at 430 observed:-



      "I understand "shock" in this c o n t e x t to mean sudden

      sensory perception,     that is by seeing, hearing or

      touching,    other person thing or event which is so

      distressing that the perception of the phenomenon

      affronts or insults the Plaintiff's min d and causes

      a recognizable psychiatric illness .           A psychiatric

       illness induced by mere knowledge          of the distressing

       fact is not compensable;       pe r c e p t i o n by the Plaintiff

       of the distressing phenomenon is essential.              If mere

       knowledge of a distressing p h e n o m e n o n sufficed,     the

       bearers of sad tidings,        able to have    foreseen the



                               -10-
        depressing effect of what they have to impart, might

        be held liable as tort feasors."



Lord Wilberforce observed in McLoughli.n at page 423



 . . "The shock.must come through sig ht or hearing, of the

        event or its immediate aftermath.              Whether some

        equivalent of a sight or hearing e.g. through

        simultaneous television, would suffice may have to

        be c o n s i d e r e d " .



24.     It is submitted that perce ption via television

broadcast,           though it be live,    is not the direct

perception of the event by the Plaintiff.                 Amongst the

difficulties arising from television broadcast are:-



         (i )            mode



         (ii)             context



          (i i i )        adulteration



          (iv)            intervention    by others.




 MODE



  25.     That which appears upon the screen is as seen

  through the eye of a third party,             the cameraman,    enhanced

  or rendered presentable and             "interesting" for example by

  close up or panning shots,             cutting, may be the result of


                                         -11-
the camera work of the several cameramen and be

interrupted by other material,      replay,      be likely to have

a commentary and "control input"       from the producer.



CONTEXT



26.     It is received in a situation,    far removed from the

scene and* may be associated also wi th radio and other

commentary.



ADU LT E R A T I O N



27.     It is likely to be invested with auth ority and

gravity beyond that obtaining at the scene,           is not likely

to occur without a commentary and c o m m e n t , m a y be

interspersed with interviews and present an impression

who lly different from that likely to be perce ived by the

Plaintiff actually at the scene.



INTERVENTION BY OTHERS



 28.     The reception of such a broadca st will be in a

context wholly outside the control of the tort feasor.



 29.     Apart from the foregoing genera l observations

 relating to a television broadcast which ought to be

 taken into account the Learned Judge failed to take into

 account the evidence relating to the television broadcast

 in this case coming from for e x a m p l e :-



                                -12-
      .Gillian Barbara Owen at pages         66 and 67 of the

      Plaintiffs' b u n d l e .   She spoke of an hysterical

      .commentary, of a BBC p r e s e n t e r and an interview as

      well, as return trips by the cameras to Hillsborough

      during the course of the after noon           (i.e.   its

      intermittent quality).



      Maureen Mullaney at page        79A of the Plaintiffs

      bundle who spoke of the        "cameras     flashing from one

       scene to another".



       Agnes Copoc at page 101A of the P l a i n t i f f s â bundle

       who heard reports on the television and was

       concerned as a .result of what she saw on the screen

       and heard the commentators          say.



       In the statement of facts of Joseph Kehoe at page

       119 speaking of re corded footage being used.



Further the Learned Judge failed to pay regard to the

evidence of Dr. Connell at pages            15 and 16 of the

transcript thereof.



30.    Moreover the Learned Judge came to the conclusion

without any or any sufficient evidence before him

concerning what was in fact broadcast.



31.     It is submitted that the rel ations hip of the

Defendant with the Plaintiff created by the means of

television is the very antithesis             of the directness



                                    -13-
required,   for example by the criteria given in

Donoghue -v- Stevenson 1932 A.C.       562. in the speech of .

Lord A t ki n in particular at page 581,     582. and 599, Lord

Than k er t o n at page 603 and Lord Macmillan at page       620 and

621.



32.    It is submitted that the Defendant's r esponsibility

should not be extended so far as the means of

broadcasting would allow it and should end when his

control ceases    (see Lord Macmillan,     Donoghue -v-

Stevenson at    622) or when some intermediary comes between

the Defendant and the Plaintiff.



33.    It is submitted that in the circumstances the

Lea rned Judge erred and misdirected himself as set out at

Paragraphs 5, 7 and 8 of the Grounds of Appeal.



 34.   As to Brenda Julie Hennessey it is submitted,           in

 reliance upon her statement of facts beginning at page

 198 and her statement of evidence beginning at page            201A

 of the Plaintiffs'     bundle and the evidence of Dr. Morgan

 Connell that her condition was not the result of watching

 television and that the Learned Judge accordingly erred

 and m i s d i r e c t e d himself as set out at Paragraph   6 of the

 Grounds of Appeal.



 35.    As to Paragraph 9 of the Grounds of Appeal           insofar

 as the Learn ed Judge proceeded upon an assumption,            and to

 that extent and for so long as these proceedings rest on

 that basis,    whilst not being abandoned,       this ground       is
not p r e s e n t l y pursued



36..   The relevant authorities are substantially discussed

.in Mc L o u g h l i n -v- O'Brian-.   There are: no reasons       of the.

â policy, for. extending the categories or the circumstances

beyond those declared and found necessary to have

warranted     judgment for the Plaintiff in M c L o u g h l i n .



37.    To exte nd the category and to erode the requirements

of directness       and proximity and to permit recovery where

communic ation has been by television or by broadcasting

would be liable to give rise to a potentially

indeterminate       liability to an indeterminate class             for an

indeterminate period of time.                 To adjust the line

declared by the cases to exist to admit those hith erto

outside    it woul d not be just and reasonable and ought not

to be done without regard to the possible economic

 consequences     of such a decision.



 38.   As to the appeals by the unsuccessful Plaintiffs the

 above matter s     are repeated and relied on and it is

 contended that for the reasons that he gave the Learned

 Judge in dis m i s s i n g the claims of Alcock,        Coldicutt,

 Catherine Jones,       Kehoe,    O'Dell and Penk should not be

 disturbed.



 39.    To exte nd the categories to embrace the afores aid

 six Plaintiffs       if it is determined not to exclude

 communication by television would be an unwarra nted and

 unn ecessa ry expansion bearing in mind the observation of

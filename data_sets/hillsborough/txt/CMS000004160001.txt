TIMES ARTICLE: HILLSBOROUGH UNHEJEDED

1.     Mr Edey is a retired solicitor's managing clerk who has
had extensive correspondence and at least one meeting with Home
Office officials concerning safety at sports grounds following
the Hillsborough disaster.   His two main concerns are (i) that
the Home Secretary should have exercised his power under the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 to inspect major sports
grounds, and (ii) safety regulations should be issued.
2.    The Home Office line is that safety inspections are
matters for local authorities and that the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975 does not enable the Secretary of State to make
regulations which would add to the provisions of the Act.   It is
indeed precisly because of this absence of a power to oversee
safety certificates under the Act that we have introduced this in
the Football Spectators Act.
3.    The discretionary power under the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act for the Home Secretary to inspect sports grounds was
originally included because of his appellate functions (up to
1/1/1988) and to enable him to inspect sports grounds for the
purposes of designation. In practice, when Home Office officials
visit sports grounds they do so by consent and do not need to
exercise their power under the Act.

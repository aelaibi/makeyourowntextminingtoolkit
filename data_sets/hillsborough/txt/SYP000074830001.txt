            had a rr anged to meet               two other supporters at a pub about 7 - S

m il es     from the ground so we                   left S h e f f i e l d at about               10.40 am       (1040),

a r ri vi ng    at the       pub just as            it was      opening,           at about          11.00 am     (1100).

I d o n ’t know the           name of the            pub,     but      1 u n d er st an d that          i t ’s regularly

used by Liverpool             supporters when travelling                            to Sheffield.

W he n we first arrived,               there were             only a handful                  of people at the            pub,

but   several         s upporters a r r iv ed wi th in the                       next hour and by the time we

left at about 2.00              pm   (1400)          the    pub was             full with Liverpool

supporters.            We had spent most                of our time               playing       on the full         size

snooker        tab!                            om.

Wh i ls t    1 wa<                              m a n ag ed to buy a ticket                     for the m at ch for £6

from an u nknown youth.                    U nf o r t u n a t e l y                 was unable          to get a

ticket.

Wh en we       left the      pub at about 2.00                  pm     (1400),       we       considered we

had   plenty of time            to get        to H i l l s b o r o u g h         :i.n time for the game.                 We

from where we had to walk down a public                                     f oo tpath and some           steps w hich

brought        us out by a traffic                  island.           It only t&^k us about                   ten minutes

people w aiting           to go through the turnstiles.                              A lt ho ug h      I was    unable          to

see   clearly,         it a p pe a r e d     to me that          there was           only one turnstile

open because           of the directiofvx in w hich the                           crowd was          pushing.       We

j oined the         crowd    in an effort             to\et           to the turnstiles.                 C on s i d e r i n g

sHie time,         I was a ma ze d to see so m a n > \ p e o pie outside                             the ground who

had rackets,           yet   the m o vement t h r o u g h thfe turnstiles                            into the ground

was   so slow.          I have a t t e n d e d        numerous Liverpol                      matches    previously?

I have       never e x pe r ie n ce d such a mass                     of people still                trying    to get

through the turnstiles                 so      close       to the kick-off                   time.

As we w aited         in the       crush outside,          there was a Police Officer                  on

h or se ba ck    trying      to move       the   crowd towards         the    right but there was

nowhere       to go, and        I was      very s urprised        no-one was         seriously        injured

in the       crush for       the    turnstiles,,

I consider        that    the      basic    reason for the         crush outside            the ground was

that    there     d i d n ’t appear        to be enough t urnstiles             open.        A l t h o u g h a lot

of    people arri ve d        late,     between 2.45         (1445)     - 2.5 0      pm (1450),        this        is

probably because             they thought         the same as         I did,    that    if you had

tickets you          could get       in after       five   to ten minutes            queuing.

By the time          I was    getting       close    to the      turnstiles,         it was about 2. 5 5 p m

(1455)       and there was          still an enormous            crush behind me.             The mood

of the       crowd was       becoming a ngry and abusive                because       kick-off        was

immi nent.

Wh i ls t    I was waiting          I saw three       or four      supporters         on the     roof       of the

tur ns ti le     offices     but they did not make an effort                        to get down        into the

ground.         However,      I d i d n ’t pay much a t t e n t i o n        to what they were              doing

as    I was more       concerned with g a t i n g            in myself.

The    crowd behind seemed              to be g e 1 1i ng \^ ve n      bigger       rather    than smaller

P olice Officer weaNjig a flat                    cap who was         in front       of us near        to the

t ur ns t il e s and who was          being jostled and           w   I^sl caught     in the     crush as

m uch as we were          shouted something              like,    "F o 11 owNiie, I ’ll get you                 i n 18

to the       crowd    in general.

We then m o ve d towards             the    right and       round the        cbsj^ner to the double

gates.       Bv the time we           reached the gates            they were         ©saving opened and              I

was    one    of thsa first         through them.          W it h i n seconds        there was a massive

rush of       people     thorough the gates,             and there was         no    control     or

d i r e c ti on given by either             stewards       or Police Officers.               I took     little

notice however as to where                   the supporters           were    heading as        I was

c on centrating        on getting          to the toilets w h i c h were on my                left.         1

          d i d n ’t even notice the tunnel                  leading to the        terraces at this          point.

          W hi ls t    I was       in the    toilets,    I    heard a loud roar from the               crowd and I

          presume          that    this was when the          teams    came   onto   the    pitch.      When I

          came     out      of the toilets a few moments               later,      I. looked for      the    nearest

          e ntrance which was a c t u a l l y           leading up some           steps    to the seating are a

          of the W Stand.              I still    h a d n ’t noticed the          tunnel at this

          point,      but     I was more       intent on reaching a position from where                       I

          could see the game,                it having a l r ea dy started.

          I w a s n ’t taking much notice of the movement                         of people    before       I went

          into     the stand,         and    I am not aware        if the gates had been closed

          again.           There were       several   people      running ar ou nd but        nowhere       near    the

          volume w hich had been outside                    the ground.       I presumed they were,                like

          me,    rushing          to find a position          to see    the game.

          I. made my way upNthe               steps and       w a s n ’t a p p r o a c h e d by any stewards with

          regard to checking                   ticket.       I went along the         passage    to the       left

(/O   F   and w hen         I emerged       into the stand,        I was    posi ti on ed directly

          back     from the         left hand goal       post.

          I. was standing about 25 feet                  from the front           of the stand and had a

          good view of the             pitch.     After a couple of minutes,                 one of the

          Liverpool          players almost       scored and at about              the same    time,    I noticed

          some     supporters         climbing    over      the   perimeter       fence onto    the    pitch from

          the    pens       in the    centre    of the      terracing      d ir ec tl y behind the goal.             I

          could only see             perhaps    the   row of people         right    next    to the    fence at

          the front          from where       I was   standing and         I could not tell why the

          suppo rt er s were          going onto      the    pitch.     I presumed         there was    some

          fight in g        further    back,    out of my view,         and that      the supporters were

          s imply trying to get out of the way.

          I saw some Police O ff icers                initially       pushing      these    supporters       back

          towards          the fencing as they          climbed onto        the    pitch,    but then       it became

          a p pa r e n t    that the    supporters were           injured.        I then walked down about
                                                                                                         PAGE        5
                                                                                                         SI 909

five steps          towards     the front         of the stand,          from where       I could see

about     half      of the     terracing         below.

It was just a solid mass of                      people and as well             as    people    climbing    over

the     perimeter       fencing,         I could see s upporters               being    lifted out of the

crowd and passed forwards                   over    the heads of the others                   to the front.

S up po r t e r s at    the front         of the stand were             reaching       over    the edge and

pulling        people out of the            cxowd back          into the ground.              These did not

appear      to be      injured.                    N.

I then saw that the gate                   in the jpe^rimeter fence              had been opened,

although          I did not see who          opened       it.     People were          clamouring      to get

out through          it onto       the    pitch.

Upo n    realising         that there was a serious                   sit ua ti on with m any      people

injured,          I then    left    the stand with the                intention of trying          to find

          as      I thought     he may have gone            in that          entrance    onto the

terracing.

Just     prior      to my     leaving      the stand,       I saw about a hundred and fifty

P olice O ff icers          come    from the opposite             end of the ground and stand                   in

a   line across         the    pitch.       It a pp e a r e d to me that             they did not      realise

what was          happening and          probably thought             that    the fans spilling          onto

the     pitch were going            to move       towards       the N o t t i n g h a m Forest    supporters.

They were          still    in this       line when       I left       the stand.        I went    into    the

tunnel      leading        towards       the terracing          but    only got a few yards            before        I

saw several          people     coming      towards me,          helping       others    to walk.        I could

not     see anyone         lying    in the tunnel when                I went    in and none       of the

injured had beem brought                   out    prior to my entry.                 Some were    falling as

they tried to w al k N s a n d            I spent    the next          twenty minutes          or so

d i d n ’t a ct ua ll y go onto           the terracing.

Several        of the      people who       I helped and numerous                others who       left    the

terracing          via the tunnel were o bviously s eriously                          injured.     They
                                                                                               PAGE          6

t ended to have a purplish             pallor and d i ff ic ul ty       in breathing.          Once

they had been helped outside                they were      placed on the ground outside

the Ground,      having gone through the double gates                   via w hich    I had

o r i gi na ll y entered.        It was    obvious      to me that   eleven of them who were

laid by the wall        in the      lane outside        the gates were a ct ua ll y dead.               It

was   probably about        twenW     minutes      or so before      I saw the first

a mb ul an ce arrive    in Leppings\Ln.

A   line of twenty to thirty Polrce O ff ic er s                then formed a cordon ar ou nd

the bodies      in an effort        to shield them from          public view.        W hen more

a m b u la nc e and fire    crews arrived,         it     was gen er al ly    chaotic and I just

stood nearby,      unable        to take    in what       had happened.

I saw a couple      of P o l i c e m e n who were giving         every a s s is ta nc e   possible

but the others      standing        in a line      round the bodies          did nothing   until a

doctor    shouted to them to help him get a patient                     into the ambulance.

A few minutes      later        some other doctors a r r i v e d together with some

paramedics and they started                checking       the bodies.        They then started

trying    to   resuscitate        one of the men          but d i d n ’t appear to have    any

success.

I remained for about             five minutes      longer,    just watching,        by w hi ch time

it was about 4.20          pm    (1620)    and   I decided to      leave the ground and try

to find the      car.      I had no       idea where my friends         had gone and       I

thought    the best*; s ol ution was         to return to the        car.      I did not manage

to find the others          hdvtever and event ua ll y had to make my way home                    by

public transport.

In my opinion,      there were         insufficient        turnstiles     open and with

supporte rs arriving, late,           the    crowd built      up to such an extent             that

there were i n s u f f i c i e m S P o l i c e Officers to cope with the problem. On

the way to the ground, the mood of the s upporters was very good, with

singing and      chanting        but no aggression.          I did not see any supporters

w ith alcohol     or witness any fights.                The moo d only became more angry

                w hen the      crowd was unable      to get through the turnstiles              in time for

                the kick-off.

                It was     not    immediately apparent what was          happening      on the terracing

                a nd the Police       seemed to believe,        as   I did,   that supporters were

                climbing       over the fence onto      the     pitch either    to    cause,   or as a result

                o f , t rouble.

                Finally,       it a pp e a r e d to me that   once the extent        of the    problem was

                realised,        there were   insufficient      resources     of a medical      nature to

                co p e .

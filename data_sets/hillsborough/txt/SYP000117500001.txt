                 At    9 a.m.        on S a t u r d a y ,       15th April,            1989,          I paraded         for     d u t y at

                 Barnsley           DHG and       subsequently               travelled            to H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t b a l l

            ^    Forest,        arriving          at      the    ground        at    9 . 3 0 a.m.

                 i then a t te n d e d a             briefing          held        in t h e     main North             Stand       fay C h i e f

                 Superintendent                 Duckenfield.                T he    main       emphasis          of    this     briefing

                 seemed        to    be    that      on    no a c c o u n t        would       anyone        be a l l o w e d      into    the

J P              ground without                 a ticket.

                 After    a brief           meal       break      I then at t e n d ed                together        with      the     rest       of m y

                 serial        (14)       under      the    supervision              of    Police           Sergeant         1341     Crawford           on

                 the   Leppings            Lane      terrace          for    a further            briefing            held    by     Inspector

                 White.        This        briefing         was       concerned with                  the    searching          of    persons

                 entering           the    ground.          We w e r e       instrcted            to    g iv e    them a good             search.

                 I was    also        instructed            that       in the        event        of    the      emergency           evacuation

                 procedure           being       implemented            i.e.        the    message           "THE A T T E N D A N C E      OF      MR

                MEADOWS         IS U R G E N T L Y        REQUIRED          AT POLICE           C O N T R O L ’ was      passed        over        the

                 loudspeaker,              that      I was       to    go    to     the    tunnel           at   the L e p p i n g s      Lane

                 terrace       and assist              with      evacuation           of       th e    ground.          I am       unsure        ho w    I

                was    supposed            to   do     t hi s    and    indeed,           if    the     situation            of a n    evacuation

                 had arisen,              I think         that    it w o u l d       have       been        impossible          even      to get
into     th e    tunnel.

At a round           1.30 a.m.             together            with     th e     rest      of    serial           14    I took         up a

p o s i t i o n at        the     inside         of      the L e p p i n g s        Lane    turnstiles.                  By       this    time

tw o    turnstiles               were      already          open and           the    rest w e r e          opened           over      the

next     15 to 2 0           minutes.

Together         with        Police           Constable           2887      Grant       I took         responsibility                    for

turnstiles            'F*        and     ’G*.         We a r r a n g e d w i t h        the      turnstile              operators

that     if     they were               in d i f f i c u l t y       t he y w o u l d bang            on    a small window

situated         at       th e     rear        of    each       turnstile           in o r d e r      to a t t r a c t our

attention.

At     around        12    noon         the    first        Liverpool            fans      began arriving                    at    the

ground.          They were               few     in n u m b e r       and were          in g o o d       homour.              I could

see     that     they were               being        searched         outside          the      ground and              let       them

straight         through.                We    were       then       told      by    Inspector           White          to    search

everyone         even        if w e        could         see    that       they      had    been       searched              before.

By about         1.30        p.m.        the     flow      of     fans      was      increasing,             however,              it w as

still     only a steady                    flow and            most    were         searched.            A few          did       object       to

being     searched               bu t    agreed          after       the    situation            had     been          explained          to

them.         The     view         through           the     turnstiles             was still          c l ea r    and        it w a s     not

crowded         outside            the        ground.

At     about     2    p.m.        the      turnstile            operator            knocked       on     the w i n d o w          stating

that     a fan was               trying        to get          in w i t h o u t      a ticket.              He    came        through

th e    turnstile           and         was    then       ejected          through         gate       *C*    whilst           doing       this

we     were     surrounded               by    his       friends       who       abused         us,    claiming              he   had

g ot a    ticket.                This     happened about                   a dozen         times       in the          next       20

minutes.         I also           s aw    tw o      or    three       people         offer       money       to    th e       operators

w h i c h was        refused            and    the       fans    who       did      this    then went             a w ay .

At     about    2.30        p.m.         large       numbers          of    supporters            arrived          and        began      to

crowd around               th e    turnstiles.                  It    quickly         became          apparant          that        it w as

impossible            to    carry         on     searching            and    t h i s w as       abandoned              in f a v o u r      of
getting           people           into       th e   g r o u n d as     quickly           as    possible            and       ejecting

those        without           tickets.              Whilst        attempting             to e j e c t        one    man       through

gate      'C*,         th e    steward             refused       to    open     the       gate       because         he       feared         t ha t

supporters               would          rush       in.     He w a s     instructed              to o p e n         the    gate and

then      the m a n w a s               ejected without                significant              problems.

It w a s         apparent           that       large       numbers       of     people          coming         through          the

turnstiles               were       under          the    influence        of       alcohol          but      it w a s        impractical

to    eject         them       du e      to    their       huge       numbers.

By    about         S. 45      p.m.          it w a s    apparent        there        were          s om e    problems          outside

the    ground.                Many       people          coming       through        the       turnstiles            were       obviously

distressed.                   Some       collapsed,             others     were       holding             their      ribs       and were

in o b v i o u s         pain.

The    turnstiles                  particularly              *<^* , k e p t     jamming             under      the w e i g h t          of

people,           this        resulted             in the       person     at       the    front          being      crushed            on    the

turnstile              by     those          behind.         One      man was        cut       free       using      a knife            after

his    clothing               became          caught       trapping        him       in the          turnstile.

Officers,              myself           included,          were       being     jostled,             abused         and       threatened

by L i v e r p o o l          f a ns,        blaming       us    for    t he    crush          outside         the       ground and

demanding              that        we    do    something           about       it.        I d id        not    have       a    radio and

was    not        in s i g h t          of    a supervisory             officer.               As    far      as    I could         see

there        were        only       officers             from    serial        14 a n d        t ha t     section         of    the

ground who               were       all       receiving          similar        treatment               from       the    Liverpool

fan s .          We were           obviously             very    heavily        outnumbered and                     in m y      opinion

on    the        p o in t     of    coming           under      physical        attack.              I would         say       t ha t    it       is

one    of        the     most       intimidating                and    frightening              situations               that     I have

f a ce d .

A    number         of      fans        were       scaling       the    outer        walls          and      climbing          into      the

ground.             I was          unable          to do a n y t h i n g       to    stop       this.

After        a    time        a senior             officer       who    I do        not    know         but    I believe            to       be

an    Inspector,               c a me        and     instructed         that        gate       "C*      was    to    be       opened.
                                                                                                                                        PAGE           4
                                                                                                                                        R 111

The    gate       was     opened         and        this was              followed          by a m a d         rush.          I can o n l y

describe          what       h a p p e n e d as           like a          cattle          stampede.          Several            people         at

t he   front        fell         over    and were               trampled          upon       by    the     rest       of      the       crowd

who    ran     in.

After       the     main         body      of     the      crowd          had    passed          the    gate was           forced

shut.         I would            estimate            that       by    this       time       about       2,000        people          h ad     run

through.            The      gate        was      opened again                  and about          200 - 300             people          ran

in.        This     accounted              fo r      the m a j o r i t y         of       fans    but     people         kept        coming

through        the       turnstiles               fo r     several          minutes.              In a d d i t i o n ,        gate       "C"


was    left        partially             open        to a c t        as    an    extra       turnstile.

Shortly        after         3    p.m.        the     flow       of       fans       had    stopped.              I then        became

aware       of a        tannoy         message            to    the       effect.          * Liverpool             supporters               get

o ff   t he    pitch."              An     officer,             I can't          remember          who,        told      us     that        t h er e

was    a    pitch        invasion             and as a serial                    we w en t        to     the      pitch       v ia      the

South       Stand.

On     reaching          the      pitch         it    became          apparent             immediately             that       t h e r e w as

not a       pitch        invasion             but     t ha t     people          were       scaling         the      security            fence

in o r d e r       to    escape          overcrowding.

I made        my way          over       to     the       fencing          and       could       se e    t h at    people          were

being       crushed against                     the w a l l          and    security             fence      by     the     crowd         behind

them.         Other          officers           were       at    th e      gates          in the        fence      trying          to    pull

people        out       of    the      crowd,          but w e r e         having          difficulty,             due     to      the

numbers        involved             and       the      sheer wei g h t               of    people        behind       them.             The

effect        of    this         was     to     cause a          "log       jam*.at          the        gates.

At     this    stage          there        was       no    room a r o u n d           the    gates        in o r d e r        to     get      to

people        who were            trapped            and       give       assistance.               I stood          on a n

advertising              hoarding             adjacent           to       the    fence       and        shouted        in a        loud

voice       for     people          further            back      to m o v e          back,       this     w as     met     w i t h a hail

of a b u s e       from       elements            in the         crowd,          a    number        of    s m all      i t em s w h i c h          I

believe        to       be    co i n s ,      were        thrown          but    none       of    these        hit    me.

I then       began           to a s s i s t       people          over     the     fence      onto     the      pitch       however,

this       was    hampered             by    their        clothing          and      in one       case     flesh       being

caught       on t h e           spikes       at    the        t o p of     the     fence.         After      helping         3 or 4

people       ove r ,         th e    advertising               hoarding          on w h i c h     I w as     standing          gave

way and          I was          no    longer       able        to    do    thi s .

This       took       place          directly           behind       the    goal       and    just     to m y     r i gh t a n

attempt          was       being       made       to     t ea r     down    t he     fencing.          I joined            in t h i s

attempt          and       a gap was             made     in the          fencing        through which            several

people       were          able       to    escape.

I would          say       that       upon my           arrival       at    th e     pitch       I could        see    that       people

were       being       crushed             but    I could           not    see     anyone        dead.       I could          see

people       gradually                having       more        difficulty            breathing         and      eventually

passing          out.

After       some       time          when    the        more      badly      injured and            dead were          being

brought          out       of    pen 3       via        the    g a te,     I went        to a s s i s t    in    clearing           them

away       from       th e      gate       onto     the       pitch.

With       the    assistance                of a St.           John's       Ambulanceman,               I dragged           one m a n

to    the    pitch and                began       to     resuscitate             him.         After    a few moments                the

man    came       round          and       began        breathing          on    his     own.       I then       left       him.        I

cannot       describe                this    man.

I then       s aw P o l i c e          Sergeant           6 9 0 Hall        who      was      attempting         resuscitation

on a y o u t h .             I assisted            him        in a n a t t e m p t       to    resuscitate            the y o u t h .

The    youth                                      breathed           on    his     own     but    then     stopped          breathing

again.           We    continued             with        mouth       to m o u t h      resuscitation

                      I then          felt       his     mouth       go v e r y      stiff       and   I knew         he    was

d ea d .     I left             him and          s aw    another          officer        who     I do     not k n o w

attempting             to       resuscitate              a man.           I assisted            h i m a n d we    continued             for

several          minutes             without        response.              I was       then approached                by a m a n w ho

was    a doctor              who      asked       if     he     c o u l d h e lp.        He   looked       at the          man and

then       told       us     there         was    no     point       in c o n t i n u i n g .

On     looking       around         I could            see     that        most       casualties             were       being           seen

to,     with     help       from Liverpool                   fans      the      man was           placed       onto        a       p i ec e     of

advertising            hoarding             and    taken        to     the       gym    underneath             the       North

Stand.         On arrival              I was       told        by a C . I . D .         offi cer         to    stay with                 the

body.         I argued         against            thi s b e c a u s e           I wanted          to    go    back       to        see     if      I

could     offer        further          assistance.                   As    a    result       of       thi s m y        collar           number

w as    written        on     the      hand       of    the     body and              I went       b ac k     outside.

By     this    time        it a p p e a r e d      that        t he    dead       and       seriously           injured were

being     taken        care       of.        I then went               to w h e r e         a number          of    people              were

sitting        and     laying          at    the       edge     of     the       pitch and             checked          that        they

we re    not     in    immediate             need       of a s s i s t a n c e .

After     some        time       the    situation              h ad    calmed          down       somewhat          and        there

appeared         to    be     no m o r e       c a s u a 11 i e s .         I returned             to    the       gym and              sa w

that     Police        Constable             Fisher,           "D2*        Sub-Division,                had     been       deputed              to

deal     with       th e    body       wh i ch      I had       brought           in.

I was     then        concerned             in a s s i s t i n g       Pol ice C o n s t a b l e             Fisher        and          o t h er

officers         in d e a l i n g       with        the      bodies.

After     helping            in t h i s      task       I left         the       gym and          rejoined my              serial.

After     some        time       Police        Constable              *1276 L o n g         and    I were          asked           to    go     to

This     we    did     in     company          with       two       West        Bar    C.I.D.          officers.               However,

shortly after               our     ar r i val         it be came           apparent          that       we    were        not

required and               so we       returned           to    th e       ground.

Further        to     the     aforementioned                   in     relation          to    things          being        t h r o w n at

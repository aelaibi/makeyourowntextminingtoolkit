         Dear M r . Wells,

         Thank you very much for your letter of the 24th of May.  I had already
         enclosed with my letter of the 17th of May copies of the letters from
         Morecroft Dawson & Garnett, Mrs. Stringer, David Phillips and Partners and
         the Reverend D.H. Clarke.

         The only additional information I think you need relates to the letter from
         Morecroft Dawson & Garnett and I enclose copies of the correspondence dated
         the 2nd of August and 9th of August 1990 which mentions the photographs which
         they are interested in.

         I also notice on my file that I have a copy of MWL10/J33A which I think is
         the photograph that Mrs. Stringer is after. I enclose this copy in case it is
         of use to you.

         Thank you very much for agreeing that I can forward correspondence of this
         nature to you.  If you prefer that I should address somebody else in your
         organisation in order not to have to trouble you personally, please let me
         know who you wish me to correspond with on this subject.


         Yours sincerely,




         S.L.Popper,

        Thank you very much for your letter of 17 May and enclosures.

        I am in broad agreement that the South Yorkshire Police should
        be seen to be helping the healing process after Hillsborough
        by rising to reasonable requests for documentation.

        In this respect, we have already been supplying photographs to
        Mr Devonside, though were doing so a little unsure of his motives.
        Nonetheless, I think we'll be damned if we don't and possibly
        if we do.

        Please pass any such requests to us and we will deal with them.

        I am sorry to have taken a little while to answer your letter
        - I have been out on the road this week and the in-tray suffered
        as a consequence.

         The Chief Constable,
         South Yorkshire Police,
         Snig Hill,
         Sheffield.


         Dear Mr. Wells,

         Re: RELEASE OF STATEMENTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS NOT EXHIBITED AT THE INQUEST.

         I enclose four copies of letters (from Morecroft Dawson & Garnetts relating
         to Gary Philip Jones, Mrs. Stringer and David Philips & Partners relating to
         Paul Carlisle and the Reverend D.H. Clarke re the Hewitt brothers, Carl and
         Nick).  There are I believe other families who also want to have copies of
         photographs which were not exhibited and in some cases statements of people
         who were referred to by others but who themselves were not called as
         witnesses .

         Even if I had facilities for making colour copies of photographs,
         I do not think that I should get involved with the supply of these copies as
         they did not form part of the evidence at the inquest and similar comments
         apply to copy statements of witnesses who were not called.

         In principle, I can see no reason why people should not be able to obtain
         copies of photographs which were taken of their loved ones, subject of course
         to any copyright problems which might exist.  I take the same view with
         regard to the copy statements of persons not called to give evidence
         but who were referred to in other evidence unless there happens to be a very
         strong overriding reason why a particular statement should not be disclosed.

         I would be grateful if you could please confirm that I may pass the requests
         for these photographs and copy statements to you for appropriate action.
         Perhaps I should add that I think it would be counter-productive not to
         provide copies if at all possible.



         Yours sincerely,




         S .L .Popper,
         H.M.Coroner.

                                           We refer to previous correspondence that we have had with your office
                                           with regard to the inquest in the above named, and in particular to
                                           our letter to you of 16th May 1990 when we asked to be supplied with
                                           copies of two photographs and which reference had been made at the
                                           inquest. You indicated that these could not be made available until
                                           the conclusion of the inquest.

                                           In view of the fact that that stage has now been reached could we
                                           please now ask for copies of these photographs to be provided to us.

                Dr. S. Popper,
                The Coroner's Office,
                Hillsborough Inquest,
                City Hall,
                SHEFFIELD.


                Dear Dr. Popper,             ,
                           Re: Mr. & Mrs. M. Hewitt, parents of Car! & Nick Hewitt, deceased


               I have been working as a Cruse counsellor with the above for the past two years.
               Now that the official inquest is finally over, I had hoped that Mr. & Mrs.
               Hewitt s grief might lessen a little.    There is some sign of improvement, but
               I think   there are a number of factors which could help them.     I am writing
               to you to see if you can help in two matters.

               First,friends who   promised to notify themabout the time    of the summing-up
               failed to do so, and they missed your conclusion of the inquest.      I wonder
               if it would be possible for you to send me a copy of the summing-up, and if
               possible the decisions regarding the disciplinary proceedings relating to the
               five policemen.

               Secondly, the Hewitts and I took part in the very painful procedure with
               Inspector Mike Leighton when we examined photographs and identified the two
                oys just before their deaths.    Mr. Hewitt at the time expressed an interest
               in two of the photographs taken from the B.B.C. video footage.     He was unable
               to ask for them at the time, when it would have been possible; and when they
               became the possession of the court, he was informed by Inspector Mike Leighton
               that after the inquest was over it was very likelythat you would release the
               photographs for copies to be available to the survivors.   I am therefore asking
               on behalf of Mr. Hewitt a copy of the following photographs:

                     1.      From Map 1: 14.50.03.02
                     2.      From Map 2: 14.50.53.18

               In both requests I am acting according to the wishes of Mr. & Mrs. Hewitt
               expressed to me yesterday afternoon during our counselling session. I look
               forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

              Yours sincerely,

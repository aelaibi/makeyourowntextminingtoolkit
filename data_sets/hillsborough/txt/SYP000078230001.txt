began      slowly        to    head       towards          the    ground along              H a l i f a x Pd.             As    the

crowd      thinned,           my    serial         gathered         together           a n d we w a l k e d          towards          the

ground.




We    passed       several          groups         of y o u t h s    who    were        obviously              giving          some

other      serials        a    little         bit     of    trouble        but      nothing          serious.




A s we     neared        the       gates      to     the    ground        one     of    the P C ' s        near        the      r a d io

I entered          vke    ground          between          the S p i o n     Hop and         the N o r t h S t a n d             at     3.

serial      wa s    met       by a s s e n i o r      officer       and     told        to k e e p        control          of    the

area     infront         of    the S p i o n         K o p a nd we        spread        out a l o n g          the     front       of      the

Spion      Kop     over       to    the S o u t h          Stand,infront               of   the N o t t i n g h a m            fans     who

were     in a v e r y a n g r y m o od .




There      appeared           to    be    so m e     pho^ilem at          the     Leppings           Ln    en d      of    the     ground

with     fans      and    police          out      onto     theV^la^ing             field.           Some       of     the

Liverpool          fans m a n a g e d         to     run up to        the       Nottingham            end       of     the      ground

and    were      shouting          abuse        at    the N o t t i n g h a m       fans,      making           them       even more

unsettled.           'Several            of   the     Nottingham           f an s      tried     to       climb        o ve r    the

A   crowd      of L i v e r p o o l       fans       broke        through       theSyPolice          cordon which               had

formed approximately                      three       quarters           way    down       trn^ d i t c h a nd         run up to

the    Notts      en d a n d      commenced            taking        down       the    hoardings           to use as

stretchers.




I stopped a           lad w h o       was       walking           about    in a       dazed      state       he    ha d a s m a ll

hole     in his       forehead and               was        holding       h>*^left          arm which appeared                   to    be

broken.         I asked         him what             happened and              he    sf^ed       t h at    when        the w i r i n g

collapsed         one     of    the       spikes       had        gone    into       his    he£\£.        He wa s       looking

for    a young        lad,      who       had    been with           him.           I took     him    to     the       gymnasium

f or   treatment          and     only      then       d id       I realise          the    extent        of w h a t     h ad

h a p p e n e d as    there       were      bodies           laid    out       on    the    floor.




I returned           to m y     position             and     some F o r e i g n F orce           dog m e n        had also

taken     up    position          therS^.            Th e    Notts       fans       seemed      to   haveq u i e t e n e d       down

as a     few    of    the      dead and          injured where                 openly       being     carried           out     past

t hem,    and a       couple         had    been       l ai d      out    on the          pitch.




I r e m a i n e d at      my    original             position        until          the    supporters were asked                      to

make     their w ay         out      of    the       ground and           he




I then wVth           the      rest       of m y      serial        walked          back    to i-teaj-ifax R d w i t h           the

Occasionally             one    of    them would              say    something             abusive        towards        us.      It

was    not i c a b l e    that       some       of    the L i v e r p o o l         supporters       were         finishing           off

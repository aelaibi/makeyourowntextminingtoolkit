   Dear Mr. Whalley,

       Thank you for your letter of 23rd May.   I confirm that The
   Football Association wishes jointly with The Football League to
   submit written material in connection with the second stage of Lord
   Justice Taylor's Inquiry.

        We note the suggested timetable.   May we enquire whether Lord
  Justice Taylor intends to make any recommendations in a report to be
  issued after the conclusion of the first stage, and if so whether he
  will take into account written material submitted for the second
  stage.   If Lord Justice Taylor intends to issue a report after the
  first stage which contains no recommendations, then we would prefer
  to have more time for our written submissions, say, until the end of
  June.    If on the other hand, Lord Justice Taylor intends that his
  report on the first stage should contain some recommendations, then
  we would respectfully ask him to take account of the written
  submissions.   For example, we are preparing submissions on issues
  such as perimeter fencing, p re-match entertainment., increased
  seating, ticket touts as well we membership schemes and ID cards.
  IfTTord Justice Taylor is willing to take account of our written
  submissions in his first stage report, then we shall do our utmost
  to meet the proposed timetable, although we think that we may be a
  few days late.    You will appreciate that until recently, we have
  had to concentrate on dealing with the statements required for the
  first stage, but we are now well into preparations for the second
  stage.




                                                                            Contd/

     I confirm that The Football Association would be very pleased
to discuss with Lord Justice Taylor any points arising out of the
written submissions.

                          Yours sincerely,

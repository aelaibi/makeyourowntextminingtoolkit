Dear Alan



TAYLOR REPORT: IMPLICATIONS FOR RUGBY


Thank you for your letter of 17 April and draft circular about
the effects on rugby union.

I think the second sentence of paragraph 3 of your draft
circular should be omitted.  Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendations on all seated accommodation apply to all
designated sports grounds.  Paragraph 85 of the Final Report
specifically mentions rugby in this context.  To say that the
Report does not apply to any other sport would also undermine
attempts to improve conditions at such grounds and I do not
think it is strictly true (see paragraph 238 of the Report).

You might also take another look at paragraph 5 of your draft.
I think the second sentence is intended to refer only to
standing areas (if it refers to both standing and seating, the
qualification expressed in the first part of the sentence up
to "...complete," does not apply).  I have suggested a change
on the enclosed annotated copy of your draft to reflect this.

Our timetable for a revised guide is that we hope to produce
it is the summer.  We would clearly like to issue a new guide
by the 1990/91 season.  This has presentational advantage if
nothing else.  Realistically, I suspect it will take longer -
I hope no later than the autumn.

My view is that you should say in any circular that Taylor
recommendations apply now.  Indeed, I would go further and
express the hope that the safety recommendations have already
been put into force and reflected, as appropriate, in safety
certificates.  As you know we have already asked local
authorities south of the border to take action and to adopt
revised criteria which will be included in the revised guide.
On the question of revision of the guide we shall have a small
working party to scrutinize our revision.  You are welcome to
attend.  If you give me a call on your return about this I
shall explain what we have in mind.


                                        Yours sincerely

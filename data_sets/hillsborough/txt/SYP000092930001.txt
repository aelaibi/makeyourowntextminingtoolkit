               information contained in my S u p portersXQuestio nna ire „

               As previously stated myself and            $oj3k up our match viewing
                                                                  < & £ p e n a,
               position in what I now know to be pen number two at about £,£5 p

               (1525)-     In our first match viewing              position we were standing next to

               the dividing fence between pen number two and pen number three* we

               were standing      immediately behind a crush barrier situated roughly

               half way down the terracing,,

               Myself and                     intended remaining in this position to watch
                                                                          PAGE      2

the game as soon as we got to ’uh^s position and having looked into the
                                   V
adjacent pen in the Leppings Lane tXrraces pen number three it was

obvious to me that      pen number three w as\ y e yry overcrowded with
                                     f&r\ 3    -
supporters*                      ^                             ^
                                                           Pen            ^
From a time 1 would estimate to\have been about H„3U pm (1430)

myself and                 helped a laroe number of people who were

climbing out of pen number three overvtha dividing fence            into our pen

pen number two*    A number of these pe op lV were complaining about how

over crowded pen number three was?            it was obvious to me that there

were too many people in pen number t h r e e .

At the time the   players came out onto the pitch for their kick about

the number of people climbing over the dividing fence reduced^ and I

started to concentrate on the players on the pitch? and awaited the

kick off-

I watched the game kick off and although I was making the odd glance

into pen number three and I could hear people shouting "get us out of

h e r e 1' I was concent rat ing on the game and did not pay any particular

attention to the people in the ne xt\ pen7 number three*

  cannot be sure how long after the kicK^aff but shortly before the
                                               Off ^
game was stopped I saw a lot of supporters Climbing over the fence at

tt*e front of pen number three trying to get out onto the pitch.              The

next\>hing I remember      is the game being stopped and seeing the players

leaving the pit c h »

As soon as the game had been stopped X noticed that the people in the
    OfiX-                                                           .

out of the back a-T^-pen number three n

Myself and                               up into the West Stand from the back

of pen number two*      very shortl^^a-iVter the game had stopped and hel ped

other supporters to pull      people up into the Stand from the rear of pen

number three-
                                                                               PAGE       3
                                                                               S3 7 .19

 Myself and                        were positioned in the West Stand leaning over

 to pull people up out of pen number three                in the vicinity of that pen

 close to the dividing fence between pen three and two.

 At a time that I can only estimate to have been about ten minutes

 after the game had been stopped I was looking down from the West Stand

 into    pen number three.           I saw that an area had been cleared at the

 front right hand corner of pen number three as people pushed their

 way back from the front             perimeter fence,    in the area that was now

 clear below the f ront perimeter fence.                I could see a mound of bodies

 lying lifeless,          this mound of bodies was piled up against the small

 wall at the front of pen number three, it was only when I saw this

 pile of bodies that I realised something tragic had occurred.

 I couldn ’t describe any'^f the bodies in this pile they all seemed

 mangled together.              About f iveNsunutes after seeing this pile of bodies

 the terraces in pen number three Hs^d cleared of more people, it was
                                         O i T
 then that I noticed that a crush barriVf oh the right hand side of the

 pen as I looked down into it from the West Stand had collapsed.

 As 1' was looking down into pen three from the stand just to the left

 of the end of the section of barrier which had collapsed and about ten

 or twelve feet\behind the collapsed barrier further back up the

 terraces I saw t h e N ^ody of a man lying on the terraces.             This man was

 lying on his back, witnNqis head towards pen number four and his feet

 towards     pen number two,         I could see that the mans face was a blacky

 purple colour,         it was obvious to me that this man was dead.

 I would describe this man as a white male, aged early thirties,                he was

 a tall man about 6 feet tall, and was very heavily built and as far as

 I can recall he had a bit of a beer belly.                He had mousey coloured

 hair    cut short and I think he was receeding at the front.              X think he

 may have been wearing a denim jacket although I c an’t be certain.                  I

 c an ’t remember much more about this man.

         I also saw other bodies      lying about       in pen number three but I co ul dn ’t

         describe any of t h e m , I c a n 91 remember where these bodies were

         positioned*

         On that afternoon I was wearing a                                 sweater and a pair

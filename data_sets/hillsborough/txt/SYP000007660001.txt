X cannot           recall         any       such       instance           on that            day«          If    that       had o c c u r r e d        X

would        have       t o l d Mr H O U L D S W O R T H a n d               he w o u l d          have       inserted a           cassette.

It     is    normal        practice           to       1e a v e    all       the       cassettes              in t h e      recorders          as

on     these       machines            when       t h e en d      of    th e      cassette            is      reached       it     is

automati cally                rewound.              If         the     cassette              is     required          for a n y p u r p o s e     it

is     then available                  if    not       required           it      is    then         ready       to    record       the       next

match.

The     tragedy          at      the    ground           then        happened           and        from about            3pm     <1400)

onwards           the    whole         ground          was     in a s t a t e           of        cha o s .      There       were       people

allowed.           Throughout               the    afternoon              I was         mainly          in the         computer          r oo m

             During       the       incident          I was       trying        to    concentrate          on m e s s a g e s      being

On S at ur da y          15 A p r i l      1989      ( 1 5 0 4 8 9 ),     I was           on       duty       for       the S e m i - F i n a l

A5     I l o o k e d at           the       scene       I could          see    theycrowd              getting          larger         and many

at     th e      back       of    th e      c r o w d w e r e s u r g i n g / o r w a rd              pushing         violently

towards           the       turnstiles.                 From       that j / a i n t       I could also                see Pol i ce

being         pushed         to       one       side    out       o / the      way.          I saw        several        missiles            being

thrown           towards          the       P o l i c e.     /A    l a rg e    co nt i n g e n t       of      the    fans     we re

climbing              the w a l l s         over       yfe    top       of    the    turnstiles,                and     they were

landing           on       the    asbesto/roofs                    on    the     inside         of     the      ground and             jumping

as     they       landed.



On     the       South Stand                of     this      area,       I saw a mounted                    Policeman          b e in g

gushed           on    his       horse          down    towards          a    l a rge     double          door       which     lea d s       into

t he     rear         of    the       West       Stand.



D u r i ng all             t h i s , I could            hear       s e v e r a l / o f f i ce r s , i nc l u d i ng

Superintendent                    M A R S H A L L , requesting/further                          assistance              in t h a t      a r ea ,

for     the       double          doors          to    be    opene/f in o r d e r             to      let      fans     into      the

ground           to    save       a major             incid^m.          outside,          also        for      the    match       to    be

delayed           for       a further             fiftjjren m i n u t e s .             At    this        p o int     I noticed           that      a

large         door         situated             on \t/e S o u t h        Side       of L e p p i n g s         Ln was      o p e n , and

there         wa s     a surge             of    about       1,Q Q Q     fans       run      into      the      ground.           I could

tell        from       the       noises          on the       radios          from      the     officers             in t h a t    area       that

the     Liverpool                fans       were       very       boisterous            and     excited             and appeared             to    be

heavily           intoxicated                   with    dr i n k .




I then           turned          to    the       camera       that       was     inside         the       ground and           covered            the

^rea        of    the       West       Stand          and    it w a s        obvious         t h at    the      situation         was
                                                                                                                                          PAGE          5
                                                                                                                                          S670C

getting       out      of    hand and             people                wyre     being       pushed        up a g a i n s t         the

fencing       on    the      perimeter                of       tjye g r o u n d .




At    the    point      where          things          seemed             to     be    getting        out       of    hand       outside          the

turnstiles,            I tried             to    us e m y           personal / r a d i o           in o r d e r       to    contact

the    Leppings         Ln       end       of    the       ground/but                  each     time       I tried          to      use     the

radio       I was      blocking             others             already           using       the     radio,          so    I di d      not

try    further         to    use       it.



I then       tried      to       use       the     internal               teleanone            system        to      contact         Police

get    through.             At    this          point          Hr       LOOK     then      left      the     video         r oo m    in o r d e r

During                      the          incident,            I    was     trying          to c o n c e n t r a t e     on m e s s a g e s b e i n g

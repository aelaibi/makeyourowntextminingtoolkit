        a meal.     We    left there at yE.OOpm       (1400)        and travelled by minibus                      to

        the ground at Hillsborough.              We e x pe ri en ce d no difficulties                  travelling

        to the ground and the j o u r n e y       took   no    longer than twenty minutes.                             I

        saw fans    ert route   to£>he    game,    but   I did not see any                problems,         ie,

        drinking    excessively,       fighting    or d is or de rl y behaviour.

        The minibus dropped us'off          in Leppings Ln not far from the turnstiles.

        I could see about a thousa nd fans at the turnstiles                             to the West Stand

        and there were others milling around or heading                           towards       it.      I d i d n ’t

                   then went        to the small        turnstile area w hi ch was           for Entrance B.              There

                   was    no orderly queuing,            it was   tightly      packed,     but there was a steady

                   movement        forcing       us forwards    towards      the turnstiles.             I saw one

                   little success and on reaching                 the turnstile         I saw a foot Officer who

                   a s k ed to?check your           ticket,    which he did.

                   We got     through the          turnstile at about 2 . 3 0 pm (1430)            and were        then

                   standing        in the open are a behind the West Stand.                       I could see a few

                              and    I wor ke d our way through the             crowd and were met               by the

                   reaching        the    rear    1 became aware     of a gap through to the next                   large

               and       the entrance       to this    terracing       from the       rear of the West Stand.

               I wasn't          really aware what was          happening,       but    I couldn't          u nd er st an d

               wh y this area was            continuing      to fill and the area around me wasn't.

               There was also an eerie                low key atmo sp he re around us.                 It was about

               2.50pm       (1450) at       this    time and our sect io n was starting                 to fill a

               little more,          but    I looked to my       right and       it looked a b so l ut e ly          solid.

               At about 2 . 5 5 p m        (1455)    I noticed that          people were       starting        to climb

               over       the    railings    into our area.           I also    saw    people    being       lifted     into

               the stand above and others                starting       to cl/i mb over        the fencing at the

               was as       if a gate had been openejd.                This    stopped,    however,          after a few

               minutes and          I became aware       tha/t other Police Officers                  had    come to the

            (1600).

            At about 3 . 45prn (1545)          I went    to the    rear of the stand to see                if any

            of the others had          come down from the seating area.                      I c o u l d n ’t see

                     or any of the others         so    I went    back    inside    to               on the

            calling     them    ’m u r d e r e r s ’ and this made a great         impression on me.

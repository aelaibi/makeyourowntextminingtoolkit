     I am writing to you about the timetable for my scrutiny of evidence relating to the Hillsborough
     football stadium disaster.

     When the Home Secretary appointed me to carry out this task I said that I expected to be able
     to let him have my report by the end of this year. My work on the scrutiny is now well
     advanced. I have looked in great detail at all the points which have been put to me by the
     Family Support Group and others. Unless important new evidence is presented to me I
     believe that I shall be able to keep to the timetable which I outlined when I began and I would
     like if at all possible to do so. I think this would be in the best interests of all concerned.

     It would be a great help to me if any further evidence which parties would like to
     submit could be at this office by close on Friday 5 December. I am writing in similar
     terms to the Family Support Group, to the Chief Officer of the West Midlands police, and to
     others whom I have approached in the course of my scrutiny.

                 Since     I was about 9 years                  old    I have      been a s u pporter of L i v e r p o o l

                 Football             Club.

                 On S a tu rd ay         15th A pr il / 1 9 8 9    (150489),         together          w ith a friend

                           of                             C h e s terfield,          and his        teenage     son,

                 went     to S h ef fi el d t,a

                                                 w*a t c h the FA Cup semi-final                         between Liv e r p o o l

                 and N ot t i n g h a m Forr e s t w hich was               due to be           played at Hi 1 Isbo r o u g h .

                 We had not got tickets                   for     the game         but,       in the    past,   we have

C ati            tra v e l l e d to matches           of thi-         ,ype and always             been able      to get a

T7Cj6£^T         ticket      outside           the ground so,          on 15th Aj/r i 1 ( 150489) , we did the
T O U T
                 same,     expecting            to be able        to obtain a / t i c k e t         from a Tout        on the

           We    left C he st e f i e l d at about         12„43       prn <124-5) we a r r i v e d       in S h e f f i e l d

           at about        1.30 pm       (1330).       We had tra v e l l e d      in a van belonging               to

                         We    parked the        van   in a road        in a housing           estate off Merries

           Rd.      I did not see a n y           police      in that area.

           We were all          quite     familiar with the area and so we just w a l k e d                          up to

           the Leppingfs Ln end of the ground.                          We a r r i v e d at the ground at about

           2 .00    pm    Cn400)    or a bit before,             it took        that    long    because we hyad to

           Whe n we got to the ground,                  there was a big            crowd of       people      autside

           thegata.            I thought we w ou l d not get a ticket as most                          of the       people

           were asking where              they    could get tickets.               In fact,       quite a few

OvT        people asked us              if ,we had any.          I noticed a number              of m o u n t e d   police

           outside       the    groura     in that area,          they were        telling      everyone          to keep

           mo v in g and a 1s o/ saying           to   people,        "If you     have    not got a ticket,               go
L£fPthGr
           away.

           We    continued to try to find someone                       selling        tickets and,        eventually.

           at about 2.20           pm    (1420)    to 2.35       pm    (1435),            saw a bloke         sell .i.ng
CAT
TtC<_£_T   tickets       and did a deal with /um,                 paying £.50 for three £6 ground

TOjakT     tickets.

           We did not          look at     the    ticket      right awa y but           the three      of us s t a r t e d

           to walk       back towards          the Leppings           Ln end turnstiles.             B e f o r e /Qe got

           to the        blue gates       leading      to the turn s t i l e s we         looked at tfo'e ticket.

           We straight away              realised      that   they were          not    genuine     tic     jts

                                    1s lad who said,              "These are           photocopied

                then     looked    at the      ticket in detail           and    realiss/d that         they wer e            a

           different          colour     to the    real    ones       I had seen,

           We went       towards        the t u rns tiles and          I saw a policewoman.                I went        to

           her     to report       the fact about          the    ticket        I had but she did not               know

           what    they should look            like.      Then a male           officer    was     called on          as he

           came     up and asked         him   if he    could get        us     into   the ground.                   He
                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                         S557

said he      could not do that               but he d i r e c t e d us to a senior            police

officer      who    I believe        was an     Inspector.          He    told me    that we had been

ripped      off and at that           time he was          not able       to do a n y thing a bout            it.

I quite accept            that at     that     time,    with all         the    crowd about,       there was

very    little      he    could do for us.

We then met another male                   police     officer,      a Constable,          who,    when we

told him of our            problem,        sug g e s t e d that we go to the             other    end of

the fences         to some     blue       gate where we w o u l d         see another       officer and

he s ug ge s t e d we ask         to see the CID.            We    did this and,          by now,       it was

about     2.30     pm <1430).

At these       gates we saw a C ID officer who we m e t , i n a large                            room,    I

think was        the gym.         He took      full    details      off/us.        We a sked      if we

could,     by any        chance,     get     in to see      the    g/me.        That was all       we were

i nterested        in at    the    time,      getting      in to see       the game.        He a r r a n g e d

that and we were            put    in the Spion Kop ej/d.                 The three       of us had got

Liverpool        colours     on but we went            into the      end where       the N o t t i n g h a m

Fans    were.       We were       put with another           group of          people,    in L i verpool

colours,       right      in the     corner.

As we got to the            position,         the    players      were    just    going    off    the

pitch.       I was       not taking any notice             of what was           happening at       the

other     end of the        pitch as         some fights       had started         between the

N o t t i n g h a m and L iv er p o o l    fans aro u n d where we were             so    I was    just

co n cerned for my own safety.                      I noticed      that    the gate       in the    fence at

the    front     of the Kop,         near     the N o r t h Stand,        was    open.     I d i d n ’t see

how    it got opened,          but    then some of the Liverpool                   fans    round me got

out but,       then,     a pol i c e m a n    closed the gate.             Then,    for some       reason,

he opened        it a ga i n and me and my two friends                     got out.        We went       on the

pitch.       Just    before       I got      out of the Ko p        I realised s o mething              had

h a p p e n e d at the other         end of the ground,             as    I saw    people    being

carried and a mb u l a n c e s        getting       into   the ground and onto              the    pitch

                                                                                                                          S557

      betw e e n the North S t a n d and the Kop.

      The    three    of us spent, sometime                   on the      pitch anaf I saw a number                       of

      bodies       lying about,            w hi c h were      quite     o b v i o u s l y dead bodies,

      At this       time what         concerned me was that                  I did not           hear any
ovr
      a n n o un ce me nt s    on the       public address            syttfm telling             the -fans what            to
p*l
      do.     However,         eventually,             an a n n o u n c m a m t was made         that    the m a t c h had

      been a b an do ne d and the                three     of us got       out    of the         ground by a gate

      betw e e n    the North S t a n d and West Stand.

      I did not see any ground stewards                            outside       the ground that               I could

      have    spoken to about               the    tickets we had bought.

      At    no stage      during        the      time    I was     in S h e f f i e l d    did    I buy or have                a

      drink.       How    I a c tu al ly         got    in the ground was              by being         taken       in by the

      D et ec t i v e Police Officer.                   I did not have           to go through a tur n s t i l e

      so    I did not have            to    produce my ticket.                 I/have       still       got    it    in my

      possession,             I w ou l d    like to say that             I/was      very happy with                 the

             ce Q f ^ c e r -> who         let    us    into the      gjrciund, after we had been ripped

      off whe n buying            the      tickets.         All    I w a n t e d was       to get       into    the

      ground.        I am quite            happy wit h how          I was      dealt wit h by the               police at

      the ground,         they were           really nice about what                   happened.

      The    only thing          I can say about what                 h a p p e n e d at    the L e p p i n g s Ln end

      of the ground            is, after          most     of the     p e o p l e/ ha d    come out       of Pens          3 and

      have    snapped off.

      The    person who a c t ua ll y sold us the forged                          ticket was a white                  male?

      14/17 years,            5' &,   thin build,           short     blond/ginger           hair,       he had what

      a p p e a r e d to be a sparse m o u s t a c h e .              He was w e a r i n g        dirty jeans             wit h

      possibly a tracksuit                  top.        I think     I may      recognise          him a g a i n as         he

      had a Liverpool             accent.          He also        had two      other young kids,                9 / 1 0 yrs

      old wit h him,           but    I did not take m uch               notice        of them.

      The    ticket      I got was,           I think,        a p h o tocopy of a genuine                 ticket          for

HILLSBOROUGH


Your note of 27 January records Mr Howarth’s reactions to my submission of
22 January about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report.   I agree with most of
Mr Howarth’s comments about handling, but there is one point which I ought to
clarify.

2.     Mr Howarth refers to ‘the failure on the part of South Yorkshire Police to
disclose sections of the video tapes ‘and suggests that this should be deplored.
There is no evidence that South Yorkshire Police failed to disclose any video
material. There have been allegations that the West Midlands Police, who
investigated the disaster on behalf of the Taylor Inquiry and the Coroner,
deliberately omitted relevant material from the compilation tapes which they
prepared for the inquiry and the inquest. That is an allegation which, I understand
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considers to be completely unfounded; and there are
clear records that all the material from police video cameras was secured
immediately after the disaster and made available to the investigating team, and that
any of the material which the investigating team did not include on the compilation
tapes was available at the time for viewing by any legal representatives of the
parties to the inquiry or inquest. I do riot think that the issue of inadequate
disclosure by the South Yorkshire Police of video material arises.

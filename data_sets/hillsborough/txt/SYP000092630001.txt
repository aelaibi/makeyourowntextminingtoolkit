             On Saturday 15th April        1989 C150489)        I went to the semi      final at

             Hi 11 sboro'trgh, Sheffield,     between Liverpool and Nottingham,              I went
                                           W i n s
             together with Hr C A S E ,Barnes CASE and Jonathon SINGLETON.

             After parking up we got into the grouTr^kat a r o u W 2.15 pm (1415).                    we
                                                                         x     C^/VT"
             all went    into the Leppings Lane end of the V o u n d , H h r o u g h the tunnel

             and to the Pen to the right which I now know is Pen 3.                     Jonathon and

             James were at the very front standing against the pen gate, which is

             raised and has a step leading to it.                   I was immediately behind them on

             the step.

             As the crowd built           behind in the pen we swayed back and forward as

             is usual    in a crowd.

            f o r w a r d and I was   pushed up against the back df James and Johnathan,

             this time the crowd never went back and I was still                    pushed up the back
                                                                                                 PAGE     2

        of them.

        I saw one P o 1iceman standing by the g a t e , this was the only one I was
CMt
        aware of.      He was talking        into his radio.         It was at this time people

        were screaming and shouting for the gate to be opened.                         As everybody
AT"               _______________
        -at the front was being          crushed.

f&IQL   Just after the match had started the gate sprung open.                         Jonathon and

        James fell forward and fell onto the perimeter track,                        I just fell

        forward.  The Policeman shut the gate and both James and Johnathon
                      - —                        ------------------------------------------------------
        were put back into the pen again onto the step just in front of me.

        The Policeman was doing something with the lock on the gate,                           but 1

        couldn't see,       exactly what.

        People were still screaming and shouting?                   the Policeman was stood back

        off the gate, about 2 metres-^way on the edge of the pitch,                          looking

        around him and s h a k i n g      into his\^adio all the time.              About a minute

        after the gate was sfruX ^ i t          sprung o^en again and everybody piled out,

        me Johnathon and James, were first out, we went to the right

        We sat on the St Johns Ambulance bench for a short time.                          I run back

        to the gate and grabbed my coat from just inside, which I had left.

        People were still getting out onto the track,

        I went back to James and Johnathon after a short time a Policewoman

        told us to go to the outside pen which we did.

        I did not receive any injuries,

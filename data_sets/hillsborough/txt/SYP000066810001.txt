              I am a single man living at the above address with my girlfriend
                     aJ   .r o q y Q
                                                     I am a Liverpool FC support and have been all

              my life.             On Saturday 15th April,         1989 (150489)1 went to Hi llsborough

              football           g round together with                    to watch the FA cup semi --

              final match against Nottingham Forest.                          We both had £6 (six pound)

              Ljeppings Ln tickets which we bought from a                        friend.       We travelled to

              the ground in a hire car.                     We left for     the game at about       10.00 am

              (1000 h r s ).           We took the route through            the Snake Pass. We stopped               at

              some motorway services just for a bite to eat.



              We had some delays on the journey near Sheffield,                           I think due to road

              works.          We arrived in Sheffield at 2.30 pm (1430 hrs)                     to 2.3>-pm is_h

 (ip     I    (T435 h r s ) .          We parked up near to the ground by some garages opposite
                                                                               PAGE         2
                                                                               S 1107

a park.   We made our way straight to the ground and got to the

Leppings Ln entrance at about 2.45 pm (1445 hrs).                 The crowd was

chocka it had spilled out into Leppings Ln itself.                There was no kind

of order at all.



There were 2 - 3   Police on horseback,         t hey were trying to do

something,   telling   people where to move but there was nowhere to go.

          and me joined the crowd and tried to push our way forward

towards turnstile B.        We was    in this crush for about       10   minutes.

           was stood by the side of me.           It was hard to breath the crush

was so tight and it kept on getting tighter and tighter.                  People were

shouting and pushing trying to get          into the ground.        I saw peopie

climbing the turnstile wall and people being             pulled up by some police

trying to ease the crowd.        The push was getting tighter and tighter it

was   like panic stations.      Suddenly I heard shouting like "The gates

are open".



The crowd behind us surged forward pushing us t ig ht er, at this               point

           fell half to the floor,        people were standing on her legs.             I

bent down to pull her up and people were trying to tread over me,                     they

c ou ld n’t help it, the crush was just that bad, some             people helped me

up we then pushed our way to the side and stood back on a bridge.                     At

this stage more Police       had come and told us to move away, we            moved

away back to the car.                    L>as still   shook up.                had four

lumps and bruises.     At    that stage    I didn't feel too bad.        We   listened

to it all on the radio       in the car.     We started to make our way back

home at about 3.30 pm (1530 hrs) we decided it w a s n ’t worth hanging

about so we left for home.           We got back home at about 5.30 pm (1730

hrs ) .

            singing,   there was no problems at all.

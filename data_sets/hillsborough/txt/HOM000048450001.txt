Dear Mr Bone
Hillsborough Scrutiny
Further to your recent visit to Sheffield I understand from Superintendent Hepworth that
you have taken possession of the copy transcript,bound in volumes. As I think was
pointed out to you, that is our main transcript copy and I must ask you to regard it as on
loan. We will certainly require it back once the Judge has completed his scrutiny as I am
currently without a copy of the transcript at all.
Whilst writing, I note that my colleague Michael Burgess (Secretary of the Coroner’s
Society of England and Wales) has written to the Judge. I should like to make it plain that
I entirely endorse his comments and know that there would scarcely be a dissenting voice
amongst my 150 colleagues across the country.
If I can be of further assistance please telephone me.
Yours sincerely




C F Dorries
HM Coroner

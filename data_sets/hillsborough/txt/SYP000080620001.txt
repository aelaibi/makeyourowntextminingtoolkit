D i s c o u n t ’ S u p e r m a r k e t .,A A le            went      to      investigate                what       w as    happening

i ns i d e ,    intent           on    speaking             with      the M a n a g e r .




As     we    reached            the    s h /p,       the      M a n a g e r ’s n a me          I rec al l            as ____|, me t           us    at

h is    rule      that          fans     were           only    allowed            to       bu y    one      can or        b ot t l e .       I

explained              t h is     to a b o u t 2 0            supporters               whor e placed armfuls                     of     bottles

and     cans          of    beer        etc      and        just      bought           one     i t e m each. Th e            fans       moaned          a

little         but    they a c c e p t e d              what      was      said.



As     I entered            the       store        I noticed            that         the      majority             of    the    members            of

staff        were     in the           licensed             section           of     the      supermarket                which        ha d    been

partially            screened            by m o v e a b l e          screens           to     restrict             entrance           and     exit.

The     manager         informed              us     t ha t     he    ha d a l r e a d y           had       trouble         from       fans       and

we     suggested           that        he     shut        his     doors         to     prevent           a    recurrence.                 The

manager         initially              stood         at     the      d oo r     w i t h PC         1739 a n d           myself       a n d we

turned         supporters              away        by     only allowing                  regular             customers          to      ent er .

The     flow          of    rejected               f an s     increased and                  after about30 min ut es                         outside

the     shop          two       other         officers            took        o ve r     from       us a n d we            c o n t i n u e d p a trol.

I understand               t h at      soon after               we    left         the      manager           locked         the      doors        as

had     been      suggested.

We     walked       to       the    other         end     of L e p p i n g s           Ln and       stood watching                   the

Notts,        Forest          fans       arrive.             On e     memorable              incident          was      when a        number

of     obviously             drunken        fans        crossed           the      junction             with Catchbar                Ln    an d

the     main       road.           They     were        messing           around            on    the    junction          itself          when

one     of    the       group       fell,         he w a s       unable           to    get       his    hand      to    the     ground and

slid along              the     tarmac         road       surface          on          the       left    hand     s id e of      his

f ace.        When        he was         helped         to     his     feet,           he w a s     laughing            but     the       side      of

h is    f ac e     wa s      badly       graized          and       bleeding.                It w a s      not     long       after        this

that     PS C R O P L E Y          came     to     us a n d         said      t ha t        we    were     needed        at     the       other

end     of    our       beat,       with       the      Liverpool             supporters.                  As we a r r i v e d            at    the

Leppings           Ln     / Catchbar              Ln    traffic           lights            I saw       that     it w a s       extremely

b usy.        Large          groups       of      supporters              were         stood       ne ar    these        l ig ht s .           Many

were     asking           for      spare       tickets           and      s om e       were       walking        against         the       flow

of     supporters             trying        to     bu y      t ic k e t s .



I had words               with a middle                 aged        man    I had            s e e n at     the     other        end       of    the

ground.            I h ad       seen      him      buy a ticket                   from       a supporter             who      said        that

his     friend          was     unable         to a t te nd ^ the             match.              The    middle         aged man           paid

face     value          of    the    ticket            (seyen         p ou nds,         fifty       pence,         1 believe).                  I

saw     t hi s     man again             dealing          in     tickets           at       the    Liverpool            end     of    the

                   I beH^ved              him      t,d» be a tout.                     I went       to   hi m a n d       the     group             of

supporters              around       him.          I told           him    in          no    uncertain           t e r m s to    r e m o v e his

presence           from       the    corner            where        he was         stood and             what      I thought              he was

doing        was    diabolical.                   At    t ha t      time      a    large          bottle       exploded          in       the

centre        of    the       road       (a f t e r     being         thrown           from a       lar g e      group        of y o u t h s

stood        on    the       other       s id e    of     the       road).             I left       the m a n w i t h           instruction

that     he       should        leave.            Whilst         I was        clearing             the     glass        from     the       road

the     man       came       to me       attempting              to    explain              that    on t hi s        occasion             he wa s

only     swopping             the    ticket            with another.                    I did       not     believe           him     but       said

it w a s      time        for      him    to      l e av e     anyway.

stopped         traffic.             Many       local          residents             and    taxi       drivers         sho^d           their

him     (and       the     size      of    his       ho r s e ) .



I was       still        employed          with          traffic          directions             when       I s a w a bit             of a

skermish           with a        police         transit             driving          away       containing            PS C r o p l e y       plus

arrested           fan.



By    now      it w as      nearing            k ic k     off       time,       the    junction            had       been     cleared            of

the    f a ns      who     had    been         trying          to    buy       tickets.           They       presumeably were                     in

the     l a r ge    crowd        outside            the       Leppings          Ln    entrance.              The      number          of

supporters            arrivng         grew.          They were             all       travelling            across          the

crossroads,              straight          into L e p p i n g s            Ln    itself.              I would         sa y    that         all

these       persons         had      been       drinking.                 They        d i s p l a y e d all          the     associated

signs       normally         seen         of    persons             that       had    been       drinking            heavily.              They

were     shouting,           swearing,               chanting             their       allegience             to L i v e r p o o l .

There       was     however          an amount                of    urgency with                these      pe op l e.         Nothing

unusual,           the     normal         desire          for       people       not       to    be     late     for a n         ev en t .        I

could       not     even     try      to       estimate             the    number          of    these       folk,         all    I can          say

is    t h at    both       pavements            and       the w h o l e         of    the       ro a d wa s      filled          by    these

fans       were        all      off     Leppings            Ln       and     none       were crossing                  the     junction.

The      other         officers          and       I were         all        h u d d l e d a r o u n d PC              Flatmans        radio.

I overheard               someone           ask       for       the    g a te      to       be    opened.              I remember           it

must       have        been      urgent          because          of      the      t on e        of    the m a n s       voice.

I then          heard a          request           for      all       available              officers            to a t t e n d       the    ci n d e r

track        inside          the      ground.              Our    jo b       stopping             traffic         was        completed and

so a l o n g         with       the     officers            already            mentioned,                we     ran to       the     ground.

As    we    entered             I saw a          line       of       police        h o r s e s to         our     left.         A few        people

were       milling           around         but       not       ma ny.        Someone             banged         on     the    blue

concertina              type       gates         and       we    were        admitted.                L u c k i l y an       officer        who

knew       his       way around             the       ground          led     us       to    the        right      of    the     Leppings             Ln

s t a n d a n d we           queued along                  a very          narrow           passageway             for       a fe w    seconds.

We    then went              straight            onto       the       cinder           track           in front, of           the L e p p i n g s

                    It wa s       for       these         reasons          that       we     headed           through a                 growing           sea       of

As     we    slowed       from         running         to    negotiate          the       e xi t     from     the      pitch,       I

remember           seeing         the     hatred        on the          faces       of    the N o t t s .        Forest

supporters             who     were       in the        stand        directly            opposite          the L e p p i n g s      Ln

stand.            They were            shouting         and       goading       the L i v e r p o o l         f a ns    I was       with

and      ones      directly            in f r o n t     of    us.        They were             calling        them      scouse

bastards           and    making          similar           derogatory          remarks.              It wa s       then      that

whilst        we w e r e       being       held        up    from       leaving          the    pitch,        while       carrying

the m a n         on   the     hoarding          t ha t      we w e r e       spat       upon.        It was        too      much       for

t he     fans      helping          in f r o n t       of    us.        Two    or    three          reacted and           nearly

dropped           their      patient          o n to    the       fl oo r.      I virtually                s c r e a m e d at      them       to

ignore        what       was      happening            and    to     concentrate               on h e l p i n g     their         man.        We

left        the    pitch       to      find     further           confusion.              I could          not    see a n y o n e        co­

ordinating             what       we    should         do    or    saying       where          to    go.      I saw       the      back

doors        of a n a m b u l a n c e         open and without                  further             ado    I thrust          rny p a t i e n t

into        the    rear      of     the    vehicle.                I explained              quickly what               had    happened

to     the    crew.



The      fans      with      the       hoarding         we    ha d      used    returned             to    the    p i t c h a n d whej

I had        finished with                the    cr ew P C ’s G e e s o n            and Harratt              had      disappearled,

In a n a t t e m p t         to a s s i s t      with        the     reception            of    the       casualties           I '"-entered

t he     gym.          It w a s        o/n^y^^h^n^t'hat              the      scale       of    the       disaster        became

evident.               Two     or      three     bodies           were     in the         g y m ajnd a m a n w i t h              ginger

hair        (in    civilian            clothes)         came       to me       and       said/that          it was        imperative

t ha t      someone       s t a y at       the     door       directing             dead/persons              straight            o n and

injured           into    the       middle       of     the       gym.




I did        this      for     some       time     trying          to    cope       with       the    narrowness             of    the    gym

d oo r s .         A sergeant             took     over       f r o m me       and       I carried an             injured          man

into        the    middle         section        of     the       gym.         I was       able       to     render       first         aid
                                                                                                                         PAGE            a
                                                                                                                         SE4S8

and    reassurance             to    him a n d        eventually           three   other        men.




When    doctors          started          to a r r                   iedj.cal      supplies       I was       able       to act

as    assistant          when       introveno                        were     placed        in the a r m s         of

pat i e n t s .



I do    not       know    ho w      long     I worked         in the        gym    but    I saw       it fill       with

injured and          then          empty     of   them      after      their       initial       treatment.                  I also

saw    the    number          of    bodies        increase.            A similar          number       of    senior

officers          were    in the          g ym a p p a r e n t l y   talking.



At    1730    I l o o k e d at        m y w a t c h a n d as          I left       the    gym    I received             my    first

instruction          since          the    tragedy         began     to     go a n d     sit    in the       st an d .         I

walked       into    the       playing         area and walked               across       the    pitch       to    recover          my

helmet.            After       examining          a    lar ge     pile      (and    providing          fodder       for       the

hunting       p h ot o gr a p h e r s ) I recovered                  it.




I h av e     tried       to    rec a ll      this      event      chronologically               for    the m o s t       part       it

is.         The    only       section        I could        not      swear    to    is the       order       in w h i c h      the

fans    disappeared                from    view       on L e p p i n g s    Ln and       the m e s s a g e    to    open       the

gates.

                   Fu r t h e r    to my previous          statement         I can clarify things            in relat i o n to

                   the ma n         I tried to       revive     (Page 6 refers).

                   When     I first        saw this ma n he was              in the hands       of the fans        being passed

                   t h r o u g h the gate No 3 from tKe terrace                       onto    the   pitch.     The      fans

                   passed him to me and other officers                             and we    carried him onto the              pitch

                   somewhere          in front       of the goals.

                  We     laid him on the ground,                   I^endered          him.     I c a n ’t recall        the

                   i d e ntity of the other         o/f i c e f e s /. Once on the floor,                  I co m e n c e d heart

                  massage          he starte             uth to mouth.             I was aware      that POL PC H A R R A T J

                          tending anoth^f’ ma n on the                     pitch beside m e .

                  The     patient         I was w i t h was      not       responding and       I can remember           leaning

                  out and feeling              the    pulse    of POL PC H A R R E T T S       patient.       He too was d e a d .
                                                                                                      PAGE   2
                                                                                                      S2488A

The ma n        I was w i t h was white,           about 5 ’11 tall,         plump build       I remember

he was         heavy as we w e re carrying                him.

He was         clean shaven but he had a swar t h y                  complexion.

I remember            he had brown trousers w i t h a belt.                  I c a n ’t remember muc h

about what            he had on his top save that                  I tend to think        it was     1 i ght

colou r e d       probably a shirt          but    I do remember         it was      out straight at           the

bottom as a p p e a r e d to have tails                   like an evening shirt.            I can

recall         when    I arrived      home that          night    I saw the news,       I c a n ’t

recall w h i c h        channel     but     it was at the          beginning   of the      programme.

I saw myself wit h this man.                      I can recall        seeing   the     lower   half of his

body but          I distinctly        remember          the gap b e t w e e n his shirt and his

t rouse r s .

I was         giving    this ma n first aid for 4 or 5 minutes.                        I felt a pulse as

I thought at one stage and decided to g e ^ h i m ^ n t ^ . a                          boarding      and^J^ke

him for help together w i t h fans,                       POL PC        ISON and POL PC H A S K E T T .

We      ran across       the   pitch d i a g n a l l y towards        the exit       betweg-n the N o r t h

fftand and Spion Kop.

T here        I saw two a m b u l a n c e m e n that       had backed     in off P e n i s t o n e Rd.

We      placed him       in one and told the a m b u l a n c e ma n what               had happened.I

did not         see the a m b u l a n c e    drive off       Vo    I d o n ’t^Know    if this m a n went

to hospital.

I cannot          recall    the d e s c r i p t i o n       POL PC l/ARRETT other          than a white

male.

I then went            into the g y m n a s y d m and one of jobs there for a good five

m i n u t e s was      to d i r e c t V t h e / T a n s and officers who were          coming with dead

an d      injured to the         r e sjWctive      parts of the gym.           This meant me

shouting          "Dead straight          on and        injured to the middle."

                As a result          of this      I am now able          to     identify the       person who m       I gave

                giving       cardiac m a s s a g e    to BRADY.          I have also        v iewed a p h o t o g r a p h        ref

                although       in my original             statement      I stated he had B rown trousers                      on.

                I am now able            to say    it was         in fact Blue      jeans.

                           (061189).           Further          to my previous             statements            regarding my

                involvement             i n>C'he H i l l s b o r o u g h Disaster,                   I w ould    like to a d d the

                f ol l o w i n g . j / s t a t e d that         the body        I dealt with,             w hich        I now know to be

                Paul       B&flTOv, was        passed to me out of                   pen t h r e e , through gate                  three.               At

                the       time    I made       the s t atement          I b e l i e v e d this           to be so.          However

                since       this       time    I have       viewed videos and spoken with PC                               1789 F L A T M A N

               a nd now          realise       that     there      is a good           po s s i b i l i t y that Paul             B R A D Y was

                in fact          passed to me           from      pen two thro u g h gate                 two a lthough            l cannot

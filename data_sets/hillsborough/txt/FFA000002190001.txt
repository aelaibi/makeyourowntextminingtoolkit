    FROM:


                 F.A. CUP SEMI-FINAL - LIVERPOOL v. NOTTINGHAM FOREST
                              SATURDAY, 15TH APRIL, 1989

    I attended the above game and would make the following observations:

    1.     I arrived at the ground at 1.30 pm as opposed to 2.20 pm as I
           normally do on league games.  The journey to the stadium was one of
           the easiest I have ever undertaken.  It appeared to me that the
           majority of car parking had been well away from the ground and that
           those people occupying areas other than the Leppings Lane end had
           taken up their positions well in advance of the kick-off.

    2.     The atmosphere in the car park and the immediate surroundings at the
           Kop end seemed to be extremely friendly and there appeared to be a
           very high proportion of both young children and women in the crowd.

    3.   I took my seat by 2.40 pm. Obviously in the stand area the
          atmosphere was of what one would expect.  Unfortunately, immediately
          in front of our seats was another bank of seats,  in which several
          foul mouthed, drunken Nottingham Forest supporters tended to spoil
          the spectacle.

    4.   With regard to the Leppings Lane end and the subsequent disaster, my
          companion and I both noticed how extremely congested it was in the
          centre of the enclosure, although there were large spaces on the
          si d es .



%   I do not feel I can make any more factual statements about the occurence
    so I will leave it at that.

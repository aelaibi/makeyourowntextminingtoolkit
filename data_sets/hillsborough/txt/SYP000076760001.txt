M i d d l e w ood Rd,           I saw two Po I i cje Of f i ce r s s tanding               on the entrance              to

the     car    park           of a public       house.         They were c o n f r o n t e d by 3 or 4

youths,        a g a i n Liverpoo^^Tup[jjprters .                   The youths were              in p a s s e s s l o n of

point      that          they g e s t u r e d   to them        in such a way as to say,                  "Look what

w e ’re d o i n g ” .

They were            all       in a drun k e n     state.        T h e y were also         singing and swearing

so    loud that a n y b o d y            in the area           could have heard them.

1 felt        that        the O f f i c e r s   could not         react       to their      duty,     because just            a

few yards            behind them was              the    same    group        who were      seconds        earlier

outside            the    off-1i c e n c e , and        they too were           behaving      in a similar

i n s t r u c t e d my         party to slow        down and        let       the   drunken group           pass us and

carry on.                       so

                                                                                                                      ha n

It was also               evident       at this     point       that    one    genuine      supporter was
trying     to sell          2 tickets at          face    value.          A number       of   people         had

g a t h e r e d aro u n d    him,     and were       offering a lot more m o n e y for                       the

tickets.        He did not want any more                      than face           value and they started to

bid for      them.          He was     o b v i o u s l y getting      irate        by this,       because          he was

trying     to get        from      them.    J.    d o n ’t believe at this               time     he sold the

tickets,       and eventual l y f » e            walked       past   him.     ^                      fU O

Whe n    I left the S S t a n d              via the     same      entry      point,     next    to the Police

Control        Box,    I saw that            a lt h o u g h S e c tions    1 and 2      of the L e p p i n g s Ln

the same        stand were           very     compact.

J. can     recall      ma k i n g    some     comment       to     this    effect to      the steward          of     the

this     fact,      I felt      that        it was     unusual      that      supporters        who     had    climbed

over     the    t urnstiles          had to enter           the G r o u n d     in this manner.               Although

I    could     not see a reason,                I thought          there was a problem            outside which

that L i v erpool         s u p p o r t e r s to the        front and         rear were      behaving          badly.

The y were        standing          on seats,        singing       obsc e n e    songs,     swearing.           They

were     generally        behaving           very badly.           They were        u n d o u b t e d l y drunk.

It was also at this                  point      that    I looked f i t        the   crowds      below us        in Pens

3 a nd 4 of the           t e/r a c i n g ,

I could see           t h a y it was         v ery de nse and, the            s p afc ta.t o r s in the       right

My a t t e n t i o n was        then drawn          tJ5 a man who was           directly       to the       right,       of

other       h a n d ? he was      indicating          to the s u p p o r t e r s       to move     back.        At the

same     time?      he was also           s c r eaming    for them to get back.

The a tm osphere?             in my area of the seat area?                      started to get worse with

persons        shouting         out    to the       effect?     t h e r e ’s problems with the vast

numbers?        and saying            that     the Liverpool          supp o r t e r s    should have           been

It was       obvious       at    this     point      something was           d r a s t i c a l l y wrong    because

other       spect a t o r s     tried     to    climb the       front      fencing and         people were

The      se c o n d    person who       I f o c u s e d on (PaCient 2 on the m a p ) was a w h 11e

male,       also      heavy build,         and        the    only d e s c r i p t i o n      I can give         is that        he

had dark          hair and was          probably wear i n g               jeans.         His    position was           such

t h at    his     head was       facing       t he S p i o n Hop and             he was        in b etw e e n    the    18

w ith a jacket.               When    I saw this,                I made    comment          to my fiancee          that

someone       had been s ^ e d .

I spoke       to              /fo r    about     2/3 minutes, trying                  to     console    her, and      as

soon as       I had tj^ - n e d     to the      same man,          he           back     cnr^jT^^sack again,

cove r e d with         the jacket       completely,            cove rjmg       his    body and face, which

i n d i c a t e d t o ®e t h a t lie was         dead.

supporters.            In the     circu m s t a n c e s    I felt        the    photographer was            very

callous       in his actions,            whe n he a p p e a r e d        to be more           concerned w ith

t aking      pictures       rather     than a s s i s t i n g      the      injured.

Also    a small        confrontation          took     place       between a group of Liverpool

supporters          and a g roup of N o t t i n g h a m          s u pporters who were             seated     in the

t e r r a c e d area    of the S Stand.

P e o p l e were     still    climbing        over     onto      the     playing area and              they then

s t a r t e d to    rip away the a d v e r t i s i n g          boards       and using them as

stretchers,          conveying        them from the             L e p pings      Ln area       towards    the Spion

K o p / N S tand area.          The a r e a     in general            was   still      very tense

with    people       running a r o u n d      f r a n t i c a l l y and      in a state         of deep shock,

because       by this       time,     e v e r y b o d y was    beginning          to take       in their minds

t h e d e p t h o f t h i s t ra g e d y .

There was          still    a lot     of a c t i v i t y   in the area with a lot                  of    people

seriously          injured and        in fact      dead.

By this       time,     I was     starting       to feel         concerned         for       the safety of my

party,       and    I d e c i d e d to make      e n quiries          to get my family to a safe

place.        I left       the W S t a n d and gained access                    to the S Stand.

I liaised with an F.A.                 Official       and       then     returned tothe w S t a n d              to

collect my family.

On    reaching       the W Stand,          I climbed          the stairs          to see       three Liverpool

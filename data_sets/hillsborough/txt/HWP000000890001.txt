Dear Sirs
Re: HILLSBOBQUGH - ITV THURSDAY 5TH DECEMBER1996
First of all I would like to express my deepest sympathy to ALL
families bereaved by this tragedy.
I recollect quite clearly the scenes as they were unfolding on
TV the day it happened and was horrified whenI learned the
final total of un-necessary deaths - however,     Ineverfor one
minute thought that after obvious police mis-management that
the police would endeavour to 'cover-up' actual events of the
day.
Although the main culprit has retired on 'FULL PENSION', I
really believe he and indeed all of the police involvedin this
tragedy should be brought to justice.
My husband and I are both Liverpool supporters and could never
comprehend the pain and suffering you have all endured, if we
were in a similar situation with our children andfamily.   But
for all of you to have suffered the aftermath of this blatant
cover-up is totally un-acceptable.
We commend all of you for your constant fight for justice and
if there is anything we can do to help in any way, please write
back at your earliest convenience to the above address.
Yours sincerely




LIVERPOOL & HILLSBOROUGH SUPPORTER
                                                                                         5th Dec. 1996


                                      ;

Please find enclosed correspondence between myself and West Midlands Police.

At the time of the disaster I was living in      , Reading and sent the letter to the West
Midlands Police as soon as I could because I was so incensed by their incompetence.

I was visited by two police officers at my home and their level of questioning was such that I felt
that it would get the inquiry nowhere. The two officers also presented me with a plan of the
Leppings lane terrace that could only be described as deliberately misleading. I was then asked to
locate my movements on a grid diagram. I am an Architect and I should know how something as
important as this should be drawn in order that a clear picture of events be presented to an inquiry

On the diagram there were no indications of fences, barriers, walls or writing telling you which way
up the drawing should be, so it was only my personal skill of being able to identify the general area
that was of any use. The diagram was not, in my opinion to any scale. What I am suggesting is that
if I could not understand it, how could anybody else and therefore an inaccurate picture could ha've
been formulated. The police employ Architects to produce diagrams for this kind of eventuality but
the one I had to fill in was ‘childlike’.

How could a Pathologist describe the effects of a crush without an accurate pattern of the events ?.

I hope this information is of some use to you and I will be more than willing to act as an expert
witness if called upon to do so. If there is anything else you need for help (drawings, plans etc.),
please don’t hesitate to ask.

Good Luck.

Yours,

Dear Sir
HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - 15 APRIL 1989

I only feel it is right to record the details of the sequence of events fron
the way I saw them on the day.

Firstly, I must say that I have been a Liverpool supporter for many years and
have travelled to see them play in numerous forms and sizes of stadium, both
seated and standing, in this country and throughout Europe. I am 26 years of
age and since 1984 have left my native Merseyside to live and work in
Reading.
I travelled to Sheffield frcm my parents home in Widnes, Cheshire, with a
friend, leaving at approximately 12.40 pa, a later start than was anticipated,
due to a problem with the car and intending to travel into Sheffield by using
the A 57- snake pass route, therefore avoiding traffic on the troubled M62, Ml
route. However, we were to be held up for quite some time in both Stockport
and Glossop en route. In Sheffield, sane 2 miles away frcm the ground,
roadside Police Officers, having questioned us as to which team we were
supporting, directed us to park approximately % mile away frcm the ground in a
side street adjacent to a park. I closed the door of the car and checked my
watch - it was 2.55 pa.

Already, we could hear the cheers frcm inside the ground. We made our way
down a steep road, past an old school building and the crowd was gathering
into fairly large numbers and walking quite briskly towards the Leppings Lane
end of the ground. I was confronted, along with everybody else, by a line of
six Police horses, positioned nose to tail as a barrier adjacent to the open
iron gates before the terracing.

While waiting for the menacing task of passing between one horse's mouth and
another's backside, I checked the time - it as 3.02 pn and fans were scaling
the wall adjacent to the turnstiles and were left alone by the Police and
ground Officials.
                                    -   2 -




It was at this point, to nty utter amazement, that a large blue sliding folding
door to the left of the turnstiles slid open - this was also witnessed by irry
friend. A large number of people passed through the gate, including fans with
tickets who had left their queues for the turnstiles, obviously to get in more
quickly (just like the new till being opened at the Post Office).

Having passed through the ordeal of the horses, I, along with my friend, made
my way to the third turnstile frcm the left, everybody around me had tickets,
It was crowded but there was no crush. The Police located between the horses
and the turnstiles were silent. No indication was given as to the condition,
of the crowd inside the ground and frcm the mcment I reached the close
proximity of the ground, right up until the turnstile, I did not see a ground
Steward, nor did I receive any direction to a position on the terrace. I did
not hear anything over the P.A. system.

Once through the turnstile, not a single Police Officer, Steward or any other
ground Official offered advice as to the situation inside the ground or any
alternative direction for passageway onto the terraces. My friend and I had
to make our own choice. A natural route to follow was into the central tunnel
beneath the main stand at the Leppings Lane end.

More than half way into the tunnel, I suggested that we went into the left
hand entrance onto the terrace. Both entrances onto the terrace were crowded
and very tight with people. The game was still in play and crowd surges
forced my friend and myself apart. I was thrown quickly to my left and
managed to stay upright.

At this point I must say that crowd surges in the initial stages of a football
match are normal and soon after kick-off, normally, people find their own
 (limited) space and remain comfortable for the rest of the game.

The game had been stopped and Police Officers (3 no.) were gesturing with
their arms for the crowd to push back - their voices could not be heard and
none of the 3 Officers on the wall at the bottcm of the terrace or anybody
else on the pitch did not have a 'loud hailer' type, hand held loudspeaker.
Because of the noise of the crowd, I could not hear the announcements made on
the Public Address system.

My position at this point was 6 - 1 0 people deep, right of centre of the
terrace. The crowd surged forward again and I became held up against a
barrier. I held off another surge that frightened me because my hips were
pressed against the barrier and-^fe±ghte±y and I began to get ■ang^y.

I am a level headed, rational person and realised the situation was
dangerous, only at this point because of previous ground experience. The
Officers on the wall at the front of the terrace were still offering silent
gestures of "get back". I, along with countless others, replied with "we
can’t move". There was nowhere to move. Another surge meant I was pushed
further left and I was becoming anxious about getting out and also about the
whereabouts of my friend.
                                      -   3 -


                          r NO P-^'DSO (2.1SrPoWb Vfcfclc. WflCfc

At this stage, I, quite put of desperation, was shouting at a solitary
Officer, positioned abo\le and behind me in the stand above the terrace. My
desperate cries of "HeyiV ... Hey! Sort this out now!         Ccme on, sort it
out!..." were ignored, -jfew-rapid-^feges^feG-wace-xnade. The Officer did not do
anything. I will be able to identify this Officer if called upon to do so.

Fans around me at this time were becoming increasingly aware of the situation
and cries and calls of "Somebody is dead down there" were heard by a man in
his early twenties standing on a wall about 1.8 m high, adjacent to the
entrance to the terrace.

The Officer in the stands had now disappeared and fans, not Officials or
Police, were lifting people out frcm the terrace below up onto the stands
above. In desperation, I too tried to be lifted out but I was too far down
the terrace.

Still no indication as the scale of the problem. Due to the successful
operation made by fans of lifting people out to the stands, the intense
pressure on myself was relieved sufficiently to enable me to move of my own
free will back, towards the entrance frcm which I came and to find my friend.
Police Officers were stood at the end of the entrance/exit tunnel while fans
were shouting "Get out, there are people dead down there!!"

I found my friend and told him that we should get out. At this point, a tall
W.P.C., with blond hair and a short pony tail, rushed onto the terrace, just
under the end of the tunnel. It was then and only then for the first time I
received sound advice frcm a Police Officer. She called "Ccme on lads, get
out! Get out!" I will be able to identify this Officer if called upon to do
so.

We made our way back   along the tunnel to be warned away by Police Officers
hauling bodies along   the tunnel and out to lay them out in survival position
on the ground in the   space between the back of the stand and the turnstiles
fron which my friend   and I entered.

Between this tljone, now 3.15 pn, and the tljone the Emergency Services arrived,
fifteen minutes later, I witnessed P.C. 2322 standing around offering no
resusitation to any of the injured or any words of assurance or ccmfort to the
now extremely distressed and angry fans, seme of which had already seen their
dead relatives and friends.

A sudden stream of "water" came frcm behind seme of the steel cladding, high
above at the back of the stand. This cascaded onto a number of people, seme
of which were Police Officers, obviously unknown to the person relieving
themselves. It was fifteen minutes before the Emergency Services arrived.
While I was waiting behind the stand, for the first time, I heard a request
for Doctors inside the ground to ccme forward. I witnessed the Police as
being silent and evidently subdued. The Ambulancemen took hold of the
situation more positively.

 I left the ground because it was as much as I could take.

 Just for the record, I believe we left in good tijone because my friend had been
 to the previous year's semi-final. I did not drink any alcohol because I was
 driving. Everything in this statement is, to the best of my knowledge, true,
 and these events did happen as I saw them.
 The Police video made at the ground will reveal my position, time and sequence
 of events as recorded.
                                   -   4   -




En route to the ground fron the car, I did not see any football supporters
intoxicated, any scenes of tension or any Nottingham Forest supporters.

I am of sound body and mind and I am in good health. I hold no prejudice
against the Police Force and have found them both helpful and courteous in
previous difficult situations.

Yours faithfully

PO Box 88,
Minicipal Buildings,
Dale Street,
Liverpool L69 2DH.

6th December, 1996.

Dear Hillsborough Families and Survivors,

Like many people I am writing to you following the screening of the Hillsborough
docu-drama on 5th December. I feel a deep sense of grief, anger and outrage at what
occured in April 1989 - the manner in which it occured, and the shameful way in which
the survivors, and the victims' families and loved ones were treated afterwards.

I have spent many many hours watching football - mostly in the old days standing on
the terraces. I am sure like everyone who has ever attended a big match, I have
experienced a "surge" on the terraces, and a "crush" in the tunnel. It seems so
obvious now that a disaster like Hillsborough was just waiting to happen, and so I
must be one of the millions of fortunate ones because it didn't happen to me or anyone
I know and love.

What is it that happened in our country that made the police and the authorities view
spectators of our national sport as hooligans who needed to be caged. Where did the
switch happen so that what I used to call a "celebration" became an "pitch invasion".
How can they ever have thought of putting up fences with spikes on? How can they
have got it all so badly wrong?

You deserve our gratitude that it was you and yours who paid this terrible price and
possibly saved some of our lives along the way. But you also deserve justice and
compensation.

I do not know what routes remain open to you to pursue this justice. I only hope and
pray that you get it, and when you do that it affords you some peace in your lives.

Yours sincerely.
6th December 1996


I am writing to you having seen the TV programme about the Hillsborough Disaster
shown here in Scotland last night. It brought back vividly the horror of that
occasion, and I was distressed to learn that the authorities still not have done very
much to alleviate the pain and anguish for the relatives of those who were killed or
injured,

I have to assume that those relatives intend to continue in a quest for justice, and
that is why I am writing. I may be of some minor help because of an experience at
a football match in Nottingham’s City Ground in late 1983 when Celtic played
Forest there in a UEFA Cup tie. The circumstances bore an uncanny resemblance
to those at Hillsborough with the fortunate difference that there was no loss of life
and only slight injuries.

The match was all-ticket, and I joined the lineup at the turnstiles about an hour
before the kickoff. Because the turnstiles were in close proximity to a parking lot,
the queues were angled to the side (See diagram which accompanies this le tte r)...
there were police on duty, some on horseback and the crowd, which was
goodnatured, was under control... only a handful of turnstiles were in operation,
probably because it was an all-ticket game - and that caused some of the problems
... after 45 minutes in the queue I had advanced only about two yards, and many in
the crowd now swelling with later arrivals were becoming anxious ... a more senior
police official made the decision to open up an exit gate and siphon off the crowd,
and this was done in an orderly m anner... the crowd entered the City Ground
through this gate and no attempt was made to collect or check tickets.

At the time, I thought in general that this was a smart move on the part of the police
as it meant spectators would get into the ground in time for the match ... B u t... at the
top of the flight of stairs three or four policemen, vastly disinterested in the
proceedings, were lounging or leaning against barricades .. the Glasgow
supporters, unfamiliar with the layout of the ground, asked for directions ... the
police nodded or pointed to one entrance to the terracing. This part of the ground
was rapidly becoming overcrowded, dangerously so - and yet the police were
doing nothing to stop more and more hundreds from entering i t ... meanwhile, other
parts of the same terracing adjacent to this corner were comfortably filled and had
lots of room available ... unfortunately, there was no access to those parts from that
particular corner, nor was there any possibility of going back up the terracing ...
within a minute or so of the kickoff, the spectators were chanting “We are
overcrowded!” in unison, and went over the wall and onto the pitch until something
could be done ... there was no violence and , although the match was halted for
several minutes, the players were in no danger and stood chatting to “the invaders”
... the next day the newspapers, at least the tabloids, wrote about field invasions
and football hooligans.

I was there, and I can remember being part of that well-behaved crowd; I can
remember being moved several yards to right and left as the crowd swayed; I can
remember realising that for some seconds my feet were not touching the ground
and that there was nothing I could do about it. The TV programme brought back
some of those memories - and made me angry yet again.

I think that your legal advisers might consider the following points, which might
indicate a common policy practised to exercise crowd control:

1;- the actual number of turnstiles in operation at all-ticket matches;

2:-the habit of the police in opening exit gates to allow spectators to enter the
ground at the last minute;

3:- the lack of direction given by police or stewards to visiting spectators unfamiliar
with the ground.


I am an educated person, the owner of a large guest house here in Edinburgh, and
I write books about the history of Scottish football. I would like to be of some
assistance, and feel that, along with my co-author (who may still have his
uncollected ticket for that match in 1983), we might make reliable witnesses if
required. We would be willing to make a sworn affadavit if that would be of any
assistance. Feel free to contact me at this address.

Yours sincerely.

Dear Sir/ Madam,

after watching the recent drama-documentary on the Hillsborough disaster I
felt compelled to check some niggling concerns of my own.

I was caught up in the disaster and was one of the first to be directed by
the police through the open gates and the tunnel into the left pen
immediately behind the goal (pen 4 according to the police map). I enclose
testimony which I wrote down at 18:45 on the day of the disaster and
additional testimony written 3 days later. I sent this testimony to the West
Midlands Police.

On the 8th May, two police officers visited my home and recorded a formal
witness statement which I signed. Although the police officers were efficient
and amicable I did have to request that part of the recorded statement be
amended to make it clear that I did not just walk through the open gate and
into the tunnel but was directed to do so by police officers on duty. I had
made this clear verbally but the recorded version omitted the reference to
directions by the police. I am not accusing the officers of a deliberate
attempt at misrepresentation; they may unconsciously have balked at writing
down evidence that reflected badly on their colleagues.

My first niggling concern is that I have no evidence that my statement was
considered by the inquest or the Taylor inquiry. How can I check that my
statement was considered? Should I have received an acknowledgement? Can I
have copy of my statement?

I noted from the drama-documentary that some witnesses at the inquest were
unsophisticated people who may have been overawed by proceedings in court. I
was surprised not to be invited to give evidence to the Taylor inquiry. I
realise that very many statements were made and that I had no special right
to be heard. However, I did think that I would have made a good witness.

I am a professional scientist and manager in the chemical industry. I have
the highest academic qualifications. [BA (Oxford), 1st class honours,
D.Phil]. In court, no-one could have implied that I had drunk any alcohol
before the match or misbehaved in any way whatsoever. I would have told the
inquiry how a professional person, steeped in a culture of safety from the
chemical industry, became caught up in the chaos outside the Leppings Lane
end and followed police directions into a death trap. No barrister could have
cast the least doubt on my evidence. Indeeed, I have now won two out of two
cases which I have brought to court (the most recent, a personal injury claim
for my daughter); in both cases I was cross-examined by the defence barrister
for a while until each realised that they would do better not to try to
dispute my evidence.

Basically, I am a bit frustrated that I did not get a chance to do my bit for
the innocent fans who died and concerned that maybe my statement was not even
considered. I did write to the QC for the FSA out of outrage at allegations
made at the Taylor inquiry by a |              |who was reported to have said
that "most (fans) thronging the road after 2:30 pm were drunk". As one of
those fans, I know that she was wrong. Mr PW Jackson, solicitor for the FSA,
did reply that many fans had presented evidence to the contrary. I did not
point out to Mr Jackson my professional background or check that my statement
had been considered.

My other concern is that not all the lessons of Hillsborough have been
learned. I live near Middlesbrough. My two sons have not adopted my childhood
team, Liverpool, and instead they support the 'Boro. I take them to matches
and have purchased season tickets for the past 2 years. Please note my
comments in section 3 of my second statement dated 18 April, 1989.

" The question is not whether or not people are standing or sitting but
rather whether or not the infrastructure can cope with the full range of
stresses to which it is subjected......."

"There are other disasters waiting to happen where people are herded and
crushed together. The inquiry should warn of these ".

The new Riverside Stadium was opened at the start of last season. The stadium
was constructed on land owned by the Teesside Development Corporation, a
Quango set up by the Government which operates free of the normal planning
regulations under which local authorities operate. The stadium was
constructed on a site bounded on one side by the river Tees, on another by an
industrial site and on a third side by a railway line. At the end of each
match, 30,000 people attempt to leave the area along 2 roads and across a new
bridge. The crowd builds up to a dense surge and there are several
bottlenecks where the situation could lead to people, especially children,
being trampled underfoot. I have protested to the club but their line is that
the situation outside the ground is not their responsibility. The police have
taken more interest and since I have started to complain I have noticed more
officers on duty at troublespots. At the recent game against Newcastle
mounted police were sent in to control the surging crowd and the fans were
urged to hold back (as I had already decided to do with my 2 sons). I have
alerted the local branch of the FSA of my concerns and they forced the club
to answer my correspondence. I now intend to bring further pressure on those
in authority to ensure that the exit routes from the area of the Riverside
Stadium be brought up to the necessary standard.

Why, after the Taylor Report into the Hillsborough disaster, was a new
stadium allowed to open and operate for 1 and a half seasons without adequate
pedestrian access? Why does a Hillsborough survivor have to pester the
authorities to do something about it? I would be grateful for your advice.

P.O. Box 88
Municipal Buildings                        ------------------------
Dale Street                                  6th December 1996
Liverpool L69 2DH
Dear members of the working party,
Following the broadcast   of Jimmy McGovern's programme I feel
compelled to write with   my own experience of an F.A.Cup semi-final
at Hillsborough. I was    supporting Wolves against Spurs in 1981
and was standing in the   opposite end of the ground to the Leppings
Lane End.

It was quite obvious to me that the Spurs fans were packed into
the Leppings Lane End. Throughout the game Spurs fans were
climbing over the perimeter fence and watching the match from
behind the advertising boards. There was no attempt at a pitch
invasion and no feeling of menace in the crowd. It seemed a
simple reaction to an overcrowded section of the terracing.
I am wondering if any of the Spurs fans who were there on that
occasion have come forward with their experiences or if they could
be asked to do so. I am also wondering if fans of other clubs who
were allocated Leppings Lane for F.A. Cup semi-finals have had
similar experiences.
If the authorities involved in the planning of the Liverpool -
Forest match had been doing their job properly they should have
drawn on the experience of previous occasions. It appears that as
was all too commonplace at the time the police were solely
concerned with crowd control and totally disregarded crowd safety.
I speak as one of millions who said on that day "there but for the
grace of God go I". It was a terrible day that had been waiting
to happen because football fans had been systematically degraded
by the authorities. The status of fans at grounds was little
better than that of animals; to be herded,contained, forced into
pens and treated like mindless beasts.
I wish you every success in your campaign to bring justice to bear
on those responsible for the deaths of your loved ones. You speak
for every ordinary football fan in the country when you challenge
the authorities' view that it was the fans who were to blame.
It was the fans who bought tickets, paid for their own transport
and went to Hillsborough in the belief that they were going to
spend an afternoon watching a memorable game which should have
been organised and controlled to the highest standards. Those
people who were paid, and paid very well I've no doubt, to provide
the organisation and control clearly failed to do so. This
demonstrated more than incompetence but rather a criminal contempt
for the well-being and safety of ordinary football supporters.
Yours very sincerely
                >crro-0<

Dear Hillsborough Working Party,

I am compelled to write to you after watching 'Hillsborough' on Thursday 5 December. I
wish I knew what to say, except that I cannot conceive what families must have been
through and are still going through.

Some people remember where they were the day John Kennedy was assassinated and
others remember where they were when Nelson Mandela Was released. I will always
remember where I was that Saturday afternoon, when innocent people just went to a
football match.

My husband and I wish you well in your quest for justice, for a disaster that should never
have happened.

Yours faithfully

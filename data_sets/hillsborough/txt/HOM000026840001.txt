 Mr. Glen Kirton,

 LONDON   W2 3LW




 Dear Mr. Kirton,

       As requested, I now enclose copies of the applications made by
 Arsenal, Millwall and Preston Football Clubs for the Football Trust's
 Community Award Scheme.

       Millwall commissioned a book on their application for the Award
 written by Chris Lightbown. Unfortunately we do not have a copy of this.

        If you need any further information, please ring us.

                                          Yours sincerely,




                                          Margaret Milson.




 Could you please return the copies when you have finished/with them .       Thanks.

   Below are some guidelines on the sorts of things you might want to cover in support of your
   application. You may not be able to provide information in all these categories because you
   have concentrated on a particular area of community activity. That is perfectly
   understandable but you must complete Category No.6 in order to qualify for the further
   prize of £20,000. Provide as much information as you can on your initiatives and enclose any
   other literature you think *night strengthen your case. We are especially interested in how
   community activities are divided up between club staff and how much time is devoted to
   community ventures.

    When you have written as much as you want return in the envelope provided. No postage is
    required. Good Luck!




                              GUIDELINES ON ‘COMMUNITY’ ACTIVITIES

    (1) Facilities inside the ground (e.g. special facilities for young people, family groups,
    people with disabilities, the unemployed, senior citizens etc.)

   On behalf of the above organisation Inominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
   munity Award. Ido so for the reasons outlined below:


   I am delighted to be able to nominate Preston North Bid for a Football

   Trust Community Award, because as a group of women meeting on Church

   premises weekly, it would appear at first rather incongruous that we

   should support our local Football Team.            However, we have had a

  marvellous contact with Preston North End through the energies of

  a member of our Church, Mr. Mick Baxter.              Mick also happens to have

  a very close association with Preston North End, h a v in g played football

  for them for a number of years until illness intervened and he had to

  give up the playing side.           Now he works fo r Preston North Sad in a

  Publicity capacity and I have long admired the energy and enthusiasm

  which he gives so whole-heartedly to his job.                    It would be hard to

  find a finer, Christian gentleman than Mick Baxter.

  The Women's Guild at the United Reformed Church meets weekly for the

purposes of fellowship and has a varied programme of speakers and events.

One of these events this year was when Preston North End and Mick Baxter

took a group of us (twenty-six in all) for an outing to Bowness and

Windermere in the Lake District, where we enjoyed the lovely scenery,

the local places of interest and then afternoon tea before making our

way home again.    Many of our members are widows, many of them are

elderly and some have illnesses which make it difficult for them to

have outings of this kind, so this particular visit was a real treat

for them especially, and far the rest of us as well.     Mr. Baxter and

some of his helpers drove the mini-buses and were so kind and helpful-

they helped everyone on and off the buses with great courtesy and

cheerfulness and took great pains to ensure that we all saw as much

of the Lake District as possible in the space of six hours.      On

coming back to Leyland they saw every member safely back to their homes.

My ladies were thrilled to bits.      We hope to go again next Spring.

In a week's time, the Women's Guild have been invited to a Christmas

Party at Preston North End and we are all looking forward to this.

We will be picked up at the Church and then taken along to Preston North

End premises where we will be entertained with music, dancing, Bingo and

a buffet meal.    .This again is a real treat for our members, some of

whom lead a very restricted life by reason of age or infirmity.

Outings of this sort really do lighten up their lives and it is lovely

to see them enjoying it all so much.

I know that we are not the only people in the community who are helped

by Mick Baxter and others at Preston North End.      They do work with

the Mentally Handicapped and with children's organisations as well.

We feel highly honoured to be a part of the social activities of the

 football Club and we certainly take much more interest than we used

 to do in the fortunes of Preston North End.     We look forward to more

 links with the Club in the future.
 I am glad to be able to nominate Preston North End for the Award.

                       Position held.


                       On behalf of the above organisation Inominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
                       munity Award. Ido so for the reasons outlined below:


                            Michael Baxter, the Community Officer at Preston North End has
                      forged links with this hospital over the last number of years. He
                      himself has recovered from a serious illness, during the course of
                      which he underwent a bone marrow transplant. Because of that he has
                      been most useful in talking to some of the patients who are about to
                      undergo a similar procedure. He has also been in contact with a num­
                      ber of children on the Paediatric ward who are suffering from cancer
                      and many members of the North End team have been to visit these chil­
                      dren.

                           The team and their supporters club have contributed sums of money
                      to many departments within the hospital and in particular to Ward 26a,
                      where patients with leukaemia and other forms of blood disorders are
                      nursed.

                            Some of these patients tend to stay in the hospital for long per­
                      iods and the money has been used to provide facilities such as T.V.
                      sets and microwaves etcetera to make their stay as comfortable as poss­
                      ible.

                           Michael Baxter and other officers of the club are in constant
                      contact with the hospital and in general provide morale boosting visits
                      to many ill patients. We value their association with the hospital and
                      welcome their plans to continue this work.

                                         I would like to recommend Preston North End wholeheartedly for thispward.

CARE for Mentally Handicapped People is a national voluntary organisation
providing a purposeful and enjoyable lifestyle for mentally handicapped men
and women in small communities.              At present it cares for over two hundred
and sixty mentally handicapped people at Blackerton in Devon, Shangton in
Leicestershire, Walberton in Sussex, Ide Hill in Kent, Ironbridge in Shrop­
shire, Ponteland in Northumberland and Preston in Lancashire.                            An eighth
community is planned for the near future.


It's aim is to enable mentally handicapped people to live a useful and
interesting life leading to maturity and security particularly when those
who have cared for them in childhood are no longer able.                          It has no strong
dogma or philosophy as such but does firmly believe in the right of those
in it's care to have a voice in their destiny, an opportunity to share in
purposeful work and leisure pursuits and a chance to develop their potential
to the full.


Each comnunity is encouraged to develop it's own identity within the overall
philosophy of CARE and this is reflected in the variety of workshops and social
activities within each.


There is considerable involvement with the local community, both through social
activity and the sale of produce from workshops.


As an expanding national organisation, CARE is particularly concerned with
developments in relevant training for staff and actively pursues a policy of
staff development and promotion whenever potential and ability is displayed.

Stanley Grange


C.A.R.E. purchased Stanley Grange in 1976 previous to which it had been a

Police Training College and prior to that a private house.


Initially eleven mentally handicapped people came into residence in what is
known as Stanley Hall, since then, however, there has been further expansion
to include two new "cottages" for a further twenty-nine people.   Total numbers
to date are therefore forty residents.     It is anticipated that in time there
will be another small final period of expansion involving a cottage to cater
specifically for increasingly dependent people and/or those who may be retiring
from a more active life.   At the same time, to coincide with those people who
are developing life skills, Stanley Grange will be expecting to operate a more
independent unit within the local community by the winter of 1988.     Both these
developments are seen as a positive move to cater for the changing needs of some

of our residents.


As part of CARE's policy it is expected that people will go to work within our
own sheltered workshops.   These operate from Monday to Friday o n a 9 - 5 basis
and include general craft workshops, woodwork, a garden department, estate/
concrete products workshop, laundry, kitchen and maintenance work.     The work­
shops provide various types of saleable items which are sold either direct
through our shop, garden fete, craft fair or through CARE Sales and their

Christmas catalogue.

                         ______LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE GROUP


   On behalf of the above organisation Inominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
   munity Award. Ido so for the reasons outlined below:



          It is my view that Preston North End Football Club
    have done more in the field of community involvement
    than almost any other club in this country.    They have
    a very happy relationship with Preston Borough Council
    and have worked in partnership for the benefit of all
    Preston residents.    I know for a fact that over 60,000
    members of the local community made use of the Preston
    North End facilities over the last year.    They have
    become involved with so many organisations which cater
    for both the very young and the very old within the
    town.

         Taking my own family as an example:  my son,
    grandson and son-in-law have all played football on
    Preston North End's pitch during the last few months.

   Position held____________ASSISTANT MANAGER_____________________ _


   On behalf of the above organisation Inominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
   munity Award. Ido so for the reasons outlined below:


    During 1987 and 1988 I have worked with the community development staff
    at Deepdale, who throughout the two years have assisted me with various
    coaching and social events and activities.

    I strongly support the entire P.N.E. Team of Community Development Staff
    with this award application because of the caring and confident approach
    of all the staff when dealing with my user groups.

   The Leisure Centre needs to maintain a high profile within the community
   and liaison with the club has been an important asset to me, especially
   now that regular coaching and training sessions and courses have been
   established.

   My main contact at the club is with Mick Baxter, whose organisational
   ability is first class. However, a big favourite at the Leisure Centre is
   Ian Johnstone, who along with other staff train and coach 60 to 70 children
   every Saturday .Th.eir-dedication is an exalnple to all.othgg sessions have
   involved Peter Sayer and Neil Adams who organise Soccer Workshops and
   complete day sessions which are always over subscribed !

Children from the Centre are always welcome at Deepdale, even on match
days. The 'ever open door' of Nick Baxter is one of the reasons for the
success of the venture. He is always prepared to discuss all options for
the benefit of the whole community and very often will offer new and
exiting alternatives to boost the programme that I offer.

Future schemes on the drawing board include sporting festivals, an open
day at the Centre with 'taster' sessions, and playscheme events for the
younger children. All these activities fall under the broad umbrella of
community development, which is our common ground.

I ask that you give this nomination your utmost consideration as the award
will be well deserved for the way that the community development staff
at P.N.E. have provided for, and enabled young and old, waged and unwaged,
black and white etc. to feel part of a caring community. When the Deepdale
project is evaluated, the benefits to people like myself and my customers,
as well as the enhancement of the game of football will tell its own story.
Long may it continue !

   Position h e ld         :_____ ;---------------- 1---------------_--------------- —


   On behalf of the above organisation I nominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
   munity Award. I do so for the reasons outlined below:


     I would like to nominate the staff of Eeeston North End's Community
     Programme for their invaluable help in assisting with a charity
     project which had no direct connection with the d o b whatever*
     indeed, it had no links with either Preston or the North West.
     The former Northern Ireland footballer, Derek Doogan, is spearheading
     an Appeal to build a Sports Medicine Centre in memory of Duncan
     Edwards, one of the 'Busby Babes' who died so tragically in the
     Munich Air Disaster, 1958.         The Medicine Centre is to be built i a iuii
     Dudley, Vest Midlands (Duncan's home town) and is far the benefit
     of all who suffer sports-related injuries.
     In order to make the Appeal more widely-known a sponsored marathon
     was organized last Summer (1988) ffccm Dudley to Fort William in
     Scotland.   The significance of this itinerary lay in the fact that
     the project was undertaken in honour of a revered citizen of Dudley,
     Mr. Bert Bissell, a f r e e m a n of the borough and holder of a Peace
     Prize awarded by the Methodist Church worldwide.             (The enclosed
     newspaper cutting Xrom the 'Methodist Bee order' will provide the
     necessary background to this project.)
     Ah will be seen from the newspaper report the town of Areston was
     selected by the organizers to be one of the stages for the marathon
     runners' overnight stays.         Because of my association with the
     celebrated Mr. Bissell I was approached by Derek Doug an'a committee
     and asked to arrange a c c o m m o d a tio n and a suitable welcome for the
     athletes at the end of the first leg of the marathon. I felt I

 could not refuse*   However, this left me with several problems, not
 th* least of which was providing somewhere for thirty athletes and
 their back-up party to stay.   I must confess I hadn't a clue as to
 how to tackle these problems and initial abortive efforts left me
 feeling hugely despondent.
I must also admit to having only a fringe interest in soccer; but,
having read in the local press of the work being done by Mick Baxter
and the Preston Worth End Community Programme, I wondered if he might
have been able to help.      Consequently I contacted Ur. Barter to seek
advice and counsel.    Hot only were he        his colleagues prepared
to help but, had I wished, they would also have undertaken all
responsibility for H est o n ' s involvement in this project.   Nothing
was too much trouble and A?eston was able to provide the runners with
a memorable stay.
The Community Programme officers made the following arrangements for me:
1.   Located a suitable centre for overnight accommodation.
2.   Placed the Deepdale ground at the disposal of the runners so
     that they might complete a lap of honour at the end of the
     first stage of their marathon.
3«   Allowed Deepdale shower facilities to be available to the runners.
4 . E nsur ed that players of fceston North End, both past and present,
     were on hand to give the runners a warm welcome.
5* Alerted the local press to the project so that the event was
     known in Preston and beyond.
What is more, Hr. Baxter and his team were present to make sure that
all went smoothly.
I cannot write sufficiently highly of Ur. Baxter and his team of workers.
They are approachable, hospitable, genial and enthusiastic.   Their
commitment to, and involvement in, the community haa evoked a certain
influence for good which has created a willing response in various
spheres of local life. This I discovered when I was able to share in
planning a suitable welcome for the Midland runners.   Doors opened
smoothly because people wanted to help Mick Baxter and his colleagues.
I sensed it was their way of saying ‘Thank you' to Preston Horth End's
Community Office for all that it is achieving in Preston's life.
I make this nomination most ardently as one who hoa personally benefitted
from their help at first hand.

            Since the Community Scheme started at Preston North End over two
            years ago, Brownedge St. Mary's High School has built up an excellent
            relationship with Mick Baxter and the Community Staff and the Officials
            and Players of Preston North End.

            To say that the pupils of my school have benefitted from this involvement
            is an understatement.

            Several hundreds have already had coaching sessions by the staff,
            both at school and at the P.N.E. Stadium. This includes hockey
            and dance as well as football (also football for girls). For many,
            this was their first ever trip to a soccer ground and to be on
            the pitch was even more exciting. This work is backed up by visits
            to the school from first team players who have question and answer
            sessions with pupils - not only signing autographs. The icing
            on the cake is the opportunity for pupils to be guests of the club
            at a league game.

            These initial links have since been developed further. Mick Baxter
            was offered the use of our sports hall when not being used by the
            school.   The first major success was the P.N.E. "Cricket School"
            at which over 50 children from Brownedge and other local schools
            improved their skills over an 8 week course.

            Next was the game of "Short Tennis". Again using our sports hall
            but completely organised and staffed by the Community Department -
            this course has become an annual event.

            The involvement I have outlined so far is part of the on going
            programme with the club and is continually being improved. A key
            element is the involvement of large numbers of pupils of all ages
            and abilities. A few individuals, however, have had experiences
            they will never forget.

            A group of 6 thirteen-year-olds from the school were selected to
            represent the community scheme in a special way. They took part
            in a display of skills on the pitch at Wembley before the Simod
            Cup Final (in front of over 60,000 people). Their day out, which
            included free transport, lunch, tea and the kit, as well as the
            event itself, was every schoolboy's dream.

            More recently, a group of less privileged boys and girls had a
            Boxing Day treat they will never forget. A local businessman handed
            over the benefits of his match sponsorship to Mick Baxter and the
            Community Scheme. My pupils were part of a larger group who were
            given a superb day out at the P.N.E. v Bolton Boxing Day fixture.
            The pupils received a free scarf and programme on entry - best
            stand seats for the game - half time snack - after match buffet
with the players - free draw for autographed match ball (presented
by Tom Finney) autographs galore and a Christmas present when they
left ! (And Preston won !)

Other links with the club and Community Scheme have included carol
singing on the pitch before a match, soccer schools and 5-a-side/
7-a-side soccer competitions.

Mick Baxter, Ian Johnstone, Neil Adams and the rest of the staff
have done a magnificent job of promoting the positive image of
professional football. Their skilled and imaginative developments
have enabled hundreds of youngsters from my school to develop close
links with and actually feel part of "The Club". This has also
been beneficial to the club in that attendances have continued
to improve and hooliganism has been greatly reduced and more and
more youngsters can be seen wearing P.N.E. shirts - replacing
Manchester United, Liverpool etc.,

This has got to be the way forward for football and the P.N.E.
Community Scheme must surely be the model for other to follow.

   On behalf of the above organisation I nominate my local club for a Football Trust Com'
   munity Award. I do so for the reasons outlined below:

   In the Autumn of 1987, some 15 months after the inaugaration of the
    Football in the Community programme, we were commissioned by Leeds
    City Council to undertake an investigation into its operation.  Given
    the relationship which exists between the Council and Leeds United
    F.C. (ie the Council own the Elland Road Stadium and have representa­
    tives on the club board           )9
                              b'ur terms of reference were to evaluate
    the scheme and to make recommendations on the implementation of such
    at Leeds Utd.

   *lnter aliaj the investigation process necessitated a series of visits
    and structured itfMsrviews with.personnel from orgaaisations involved
    in the design, funding, administration and operation of the programme;
    extensive discussions with programme employees, principally super­
    visors, full and part-time activity organisers and part-time assistants
    at club level; senior management at club-level; and Manpower Services
    Commission staff.

    Our nomination of Preston North End results from this comparative
    evaluation of the successful Professional Footballers Association led
    "Football in the Community Programme".

  ToV ni-QPR.aRn^
 Our investigations concluded that the degree of success of the individual
 club schemes was determined by the presenoee or otherwise of a number of
 key ingredients. Briefly, these were related to the following:-

 1)    Role of the club level supervisor.   This is the central figure in
       the scheme with responsibility for the overall club level organisation
       including the management and motivation of activity organisers, liaison
       with the club, linking and relating the club to the community and
       identifying the perceived needs of the community.

 2)    Activity organisers.    These individuals undertake the club level
       activities and must, by necessity, be sensitive to the particular,
       often diverse and frequently changing needs and demands of the many
       client groups.

3)     Club level facilities.    Facilities at or near to the stadium
       constitute a major determinant of both the variety of activities which
       can be pursued and the number able to pursue each activity.

4)     Club officials.     Potentially, the attitude of club personnel
       influences not onl-y l&ieextent to which club facilities are made
       available but also the extent to which the club is supportive of the
       programme's aims u i philosophy.

In each of the above respects, Preston North End excelled.

1)    Mick Baxter (the club level supervisor), is a former player of
       considerable standing who began his career as an apprentice with the
       club before moving to higher division clubs. His footballing career
       ended prematurely and he has returned to the area where he has strong
       family and community links. He has used his experience, personality and
       status in the community to full advantage to stimulate local business,
       voluntary groups, the police and local authority to involve themselves
       with the programme's activities. The result has been a new community
       profile for the club.

2)    The ."-Activity Organisers and clerical staff have been successfully
       recruited from the ranks of the local long-term unemployed and trained,
       inspired and motivated to form a team capable of transmitting their
       natural enthusiasm into a wide variety of activities of significant
       benefit to the community. In addition, the individuals have been
       encouraged to take up Further Education and/or training which has
       assisted most to find full-time employment.

3)    The artificial surface.at Deepdale is advantageous in that it extends
       the range and variety of activities that can be performed at the
       stadium.. In addition, however, the activity organisers have made
       imaginative use of other parts of the stadium to provide a host of
       activities and entertainments for groups such as the physically handi­
      capped (televideo competitions) and senior citizens (afternoon bingo)
      who are unable to benefit from what is undoubtedly a key ingredient in
      the success of the scheme at Preston.



                                                  (Continued)
 A)     The club itself; in terms of its senior management, has actively
        encouraged the use of all the club's facilities and personnel and
        regularly has provided funds to supplement the resources of the scheme
         o   «   l             B “ y aCtlVities is the              enthusiastic
        co-operation of the playing staff,   a policy actively promoted by the
        team manager.  Indicative of their positive attitude to the programme
        and its underlying philosopy has been the club's determination to
       retain Baxter to continue his work at the club when otherwise he would
       have been promoted to a higher level post within the programme.     In
       recognition of the potential for greater community use of its facilities
       the club is seeking to develop property adjoining Deepdale to expand
       further the range of activities available.    That other parties, such as
       Preston Borough Council, are willing to contribute to the financing of
 5     such developments is testimony to the community approval and support of
       PNE's programme.



Without doubt, this positive, community related policy has done much to
revive the footballing fortunes of one of England's most famous professional
clubs.  Perhaps of greater consequence, however, is the esteem now accorded
the club by the non-footbailing sections of the community as a result of this
policy.  Deepdale is now seen as a community resource.

This nomination results from an independent evaluation of club-community
relationships.  It does not come from a client group.  We feel confident,
however, that client groups in abundance will support our nomination.

                         munity Award. Ido so for the reasons outlined below:


                          In my capacity as a teacher with specialist responsibilities to help
                          children with emotional and behavioural problems in mainstream school,
                          I have called upon the Community Development Programme at Preston North
                          End Football Club.
                          Mr. Michael Baxter has regularly provided programmes of work for a number
                          of my pupils which are aimed at fostering good and positive interpersonal
                          relationships.   This has assisted me considerably in getting the youngsters
                          to adjust their behaviour more appropriately in the context of adult/ peer
                          cooperation and has benefitted the pupils themselves.
                          Mr. Baxter has been unstinting in devoting time and effort in this
                          particular cause in addition to the many other community projects which
                          eminate from this source.
                          I have no hesitation in recommending Preston North End and Mr. Baxter
                          in particular as a most deserving case for this award.
                                                                   Yours sincerely,

M illw aH FC through Gary Stempel and his “Millwall & The C om m u nity” programme were recently hosts to a unique pro-
;     mkmg the Club with local schools in Lewisham when Millwall becam e the first football club lo be involved in London's
first Leisu re Industries Spring School.
For a whole week 40 youngsters from 14 Lewisham area schools mostly those on one year 6th form courses, got a behind
the scenes look at some of London's Leisure Industries including Millwall FC.

 At Millwall. each group of students had an imaginary football league team to manage both on and off the field involving
 transfers, selection of teams, injuries, sponsorship, ground improvements etc. and making major decisions that affect the
 financial side of a club.
 Present at the 2-day course were the Mayor of Lewisham. Millwall Club Secretary Sylvia Shaw and representatives from
 I.L.E .A . and the Sports C ou ncil.
 The organiser of the course Dr. Jill Key of I.L.E.A. sent the following message to Gary Stempel
Just a quick note to thank you and all at Millwall for the excellent two days we spent at the club. The enthusiasm and interest
created in the students must have been apparent, and as I wade through the evaluation it is obvious that Millwall and "The
ija m e s the Thing were the hits of the week.
W e were especially grateful for the way you and the rest of the staff worked with, and responded to the students The
warmth and friendliness shown was very much appreciated, and I think that you now have at least 40 fans with a very posi­
tive im age of Millwall Football Club, hopefully they will spread the word!

   M y two boys, who both love football . went every
   d a y as did se veral o f their friends a nd despite the
   terrible weather conditions they enjoved every m i­
   nute o f it.
   I s ta yed a n d w atched m ost days a nd was very im-      '
  p re s s e d with the organisation a nd the friendly a t­
  m osphere that was created. I didn't see any fighting
  o r hear any ba d language.
  I w ould like to thank y o u also on beh a lf o f m y sons
  for the T-shirts, certificates and the free tickets — a
  lo vely surprise!
  In these days where we see a n d hear so m a n y b ad

  Thank you once again for a m arvellous week.

 Dear Gary

 Just a very          short      note      to   thank       you   for   a most   enj oy a bl e   visit         to Milw all
 yes ter da y -

I know that all three of us found the visit interesting, and pa rti cul ar ly tc
see the breadth of the pro gra mm e which you have developed.      There is clearly
a fu ndamental dif fe re nc e between the pr ogramme you are running at Milwall,
and    that which we     find  in many other of the si m i l a r Football   and the
Co mmu ni ty programmes.    I think the emphasis which we di scu sse d last night on
In uad social develop men t    and putting sport within its rightful place        in
society is a m a j o r step forward, and one which I w o ul d like to amplify
e ’sev/here .

Man\' thanks once again, and please thank all yo ur col lea gue s                                    for         giving      up

 Dear Sir,



                                       School Liaison Visits.


          I would like to thank Millwall Football Club for allowing
members of the training staff to visit this school and work with children
on football skills.

          We would like to thank Gary who came specifically to run a
training session which was well received.   Ron Bell has been a regular
visitor to the school for a number of sessions and I am extremely grateful.

          Nothing but good has coire from these visits and Millwall are
to be congratulated for arranging such marvellous ambassadors for theclub
and football generally.

               Very best wishes for your success next season in Division 1.




                                                                       Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,

        We would like to redress the balance of some of the negative
criticism made in the press recently of Millwall F.C., by openly stating
our support of the Club's efforts to involve its local community in the
affairs of tr.e Club thrcugr. its liason officer Gary Stemple. Since sue:: a
post has been in existence local Primary and Secondary schools and Youtr.
organizations nave benefited enormously in the following ways :—

(ij          Coaching sessions (football, snort tennis, basketball) organized by
              the Club have taken place in schools, youth centres and t;ie local
              parks of Lewisham during tne evenings and holidays.  The latter events
              have been incredibly well attended and on offer to children o: all
              ages, races and sexes.

(ii)         School visits have been arranged to the Club both on match aays ana
              midweek giving children greater insight into the running of the Club
              and providing a focus for schoolwork.

(iii)        Many of the local schools are involved in a project associated with
              the F.A. Centenary using Millwall as its reference point.  This work
              is eventually to be displayed both locally and nationally.

IV           Millwall F.C. have provisionally agreed to the use of their pitcr.
              for local school's representative matches.

V            It would appear that the Millwall Fun Run was one of the best supporter
              events of its kind in London raising considerable money for local
              charities.

        We believe that the Club is trying to present a positive ira^e of
itself in the eyes of young children.   These initiatives have only taker,
place over the last two years at a club which in the past may have been guilty
of neglecting its younger members of the local community.    Of course whether
such measures in the short term will combat the excesses of hooliganism    endemic
in British football is highly debatable.   Certainly we would not wish to be
associated with the aggressive and violent image portrayed of some "Millwall"
fans.  However, in the long term perhaps this aspect of the Club's work will
greatly foster the sense of partnership between Millwall F.C. and its comniumtv
and engender t:;e spirit of "Sport for All".  We believe tr:at the Club is
certainly making steps in the right direction and t.:at Gary Stemples work
should receive the support it richly deserves.


                            Secretary Lewishsun       Yours sincerely,

  On behalf of the above organisation Inominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­

   MILLWALL FOOTBALL CLUB THROUGH ITS WORK HAS HELPED TO
   FOSTER A REAL AND VIBRANT COMMUNITY SPIRIT IN SOUTH­
   EAST LONDON.  OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS MILLWALL FOOTBALL
   CLUB HAS RUN FOOTBALL CLINICS FOR YOUTHS HERE AT THE
   CENTRE.  THESE EVENTS HAVE PROVED VERY POPULAR INDEED
   AND WERE WELL ATTENDED BY THE LOCAL YOUTHS.

  IN PARTICULAR IT WAS VERY REFRESHING TO SEE 'THE PLAYERS
  TAKE THE TIME AND TROUBLE TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN THESE
  CLINICS.  THIS ATTITUDE WAS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED BY
  MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.

  OVER THE COMING MONTHS COLOMBO STREET WILL BE WORKING
  WITH MILLWALL FOOTBALL CLUB IN PROVIDING VARIOUS ACTIVITIES
  FOR SENIOR CITIZENS.

                          THE FOOTBALL TRUST CCMMLJNITY AWARD SCHEME


                          Sfcuasr 'A' - Matchday Activities Continued


With respect to the unemployed, this is organised with the local authority through their
Vantage Card scheme with which we fully co-operate.   We also give every possible assistance
to other organisations which cane forward where there is financial hardship suffered.

For boys and girls aged between 6 and 16 we operate          school holiday and after school
coaching programmes organised in youth clubs and local parks in Lewisham and Southwark.
These courses are free and include signed certificates by players, 'T' shirts and regular
attendance by Millwall players. These courses are attended by upwards of 250 boys and girls
and up to 10 professional staff in a coaching capacity.        It is part of our Carrnunity
Officers' policy to take their activities to their clients and this involves using different
locations throughout the boroughs of Lewisham and Southwark on a regular basis.

It must be emphasised that these activities are participation events     for   the local carrnunity
and are no way conditioned or selected by the technical expertise of     the   participants.    (The
Football Club as a distinct and separate operation, not involving       the    Carrnunity Officers,
runs a series of Schools of Excellence        and coaching sessions     for     specially selected
youngsters whose ambition is to secure a future in League football).

Work Experience: The Scheme also provides schools and colleges with the opportunity to send
pupils on work experience     to the Club.    This involves working in the administration,
carmercial, ground and cannunity scheme at the Club.

School projects using Millwall as a base - included are '100 Years of Change' which looked
at the way not only football and its community has changed but also schemes to support
schools curriculam work such as mathematics, arts & crafts, languages.        This year the
schools are involved in a scheme to design a new stadium and carmunity facilities.       The
exhibition 100 Years of Change in the cannunity was on display at the Lewisham Town Hall and
subsequently at Wembley Stadium.

The Club also opens up its Executive Lounge during the Spring Term to cater for a Business
Studies course for 5th formers in schools.   This involves using a canputer based prograirme
to make management decisions on the running of a football club.

The Pensioners group meets once a week in the Club's Executive Lounge where the activities
include carpet bowls, bingo and other social games, in addition to day trips, Christmas
parties, etc. Canplimentary tickets are offered to Millwall's matches. This group is self­
administered having its own chairperson, secretary and is reponsible for the collection and
spending of its own funds.

During the sunnier the Community Officers participate and assist the Police with the Sports
Summer Fiesta which is spread over a two week period at different venues in Lewisham.

Both the Ccmnunity Officers and the Football Club itself have a very close working
relationship with the local police. This involves amongst other things participation by the
Ccmnunity Officers and the Football Club when required in any police initiatives including
drink/drive campaigns.   In addition the local police participate in the Club's annual Fun
Run to the extent of entering a competitive team.

Included in the Deptford Festival is a Sports Day which is run jointly by the Ccmnunity
Officers, the local church, the local police and other local organisations and includes
football, cricket, table tennis and tug of war competitions.

                   .DEPUTY HEADTEACHER.
   Position held.


   On behalf of the above organisation Inominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
   munity Award. Ido so for the reasons outlined below:

  Having a dual role of being a Teacher in a nearby primary school and as
  Secretary of the Lewisham Primary Schools Football Association, I am able
  to commend Millwall at two different levels.

       From my own school's point of view, Millwall F.C. have provided football
  coaching on a regular basis to both boys and girls.   They have been fully
  active in the school and local community and their positive attitude to the
  game has enabled the pupils (both skilful and unskilful) to develop their
  skills, talents and confidence in football, and play the game as true sportsmen.
  The Millwall staff have been reliable,friendly and co-operative and the children
  always look forward to any visits by them.

       The Millwall Fun Run has now become part of our School Calendar. Some
  sixty children, teachers, parents and friends took part in 1988 and raised
  considerable amounts for the Millwall Charities. It is a well organised and
  friendly event with an excellent atmosphere, and the children in particular
  look forward to running with their Millwall heroes. It was especially rewarding
  for many of them that the majority of players stayed afterwards to sign
  autographs. Many other schools from Lewisham also participated in this event.

      Millwall have also generously donated tickets to children and staff
 and have invited groups to the club room to meet the players and managers.
 They have also given autographed footballs to the School Play Centre in order to
 raise money for charity. Several of the schools parents have benefitted from
 the opening of the creche, and many pupils have benefitted from being members
 of the "Young Lions". This allowed children to meet the players, receive
 autographed birthday cards and have special away-match excursions.

         Lewisham Borough has nearly eighty Primary Schools but many of these schools
    for a variety of reasons do not have the opportunity to play and practise in school
    football.    Gary Stempel and Roy Bell have produced a well co-ordinated programme
    which has taken them into schools where there is a lack of opportunity or expertise
    for children to participate in footballing activities. They have organised Foot­
    ball Clinics at local parks during the half terms and as many as 300 children have
    turned up for the experience. Several schools also took part in a "History of
    Football" project with much information and help being provided by Millwall.

         I was greatly impressed by the clubs co-operation with Lewisham Council
    in organising "The Lewisham Football Festival" during April 1988. My Association
    were privileged to be part of the organisation of this special week. For the first
    time in 25 years, the final of the Primary Schools Invicta Cup was played at the
    Den with full use of all the players' facilities. This was preceded by the first
    ever Primary Schools Girls Cup Final and again all facilities and help were made
    available.   Later that week Lewisham Primary Schools played Woolwich Primary Schools
    in their Annual DistrictMatch. Gary Stempel found the time to give the Woolwich
    parents and children a conducted tour of the ground.

         I cannot praise Gary Stempel and his helpers enough for the way they have set
    about changing the. ■ image of the club.   They are a credit to our community and
    Borough and have become first class diplomats and ambassadors for the game of
    football. Their view and image of the game and its future is clear, concise
    and progressive and on behalf of myself and my association, I have no hesitation
    in recommending them for a Football Trust Community Award.

   Position held        SPORTS DEVELOPMENT OFFICER______________________


   On behalf of the above organisation I nominate my iocal club for a Football Trust Com­
   munity Award. I do so for the reasons outlined below:


   I have been involved with the Millwall Football Community
   scheme since it"* conception some 3-4 years ago.

  When Gary Stemple first took the post of Community Worker
  I think all of us at Southvark felt that he had taken a
  gamble in leaving vhat vas an established spotts team in
  West London to come to a short term project, hovever, Gary
  soon established the scheme vith links to schools, local
  youth clubs and organisations and initially 'opened doors'
  at Millvall Football Club.

  At demand g r e w it vas obvious that one worker vas not
  sufficient so another worker vas appointed, .Ronald Bell,
  who vas as enthulastic as Gary and soon vas appreciated
  by the local community.

   Southvark fund the scheme along vith Levisham and Millvall
   Football Club and ve obviously encourage vork within the
   borough.  I have listed belov the types of sessions that
   are reguarly held vithin Southvark:

            Over 50+ classes and trips
            Soccer Clinics  (during school holidays)
            Soccer schools  (1 night a veek for 6-7 veek period)
            School Sessions

  Patricia Finney, The Secretary, The Football Trust, 10 Melton Street, London NW1 2EJ.
  Tel: 01-388-4504.
       Special Needs sessions
       Talks
       Visit to the Club
       Tennis Clinics
       Cricket Clinics

The numbers that these sessions attract is astonishing,
at the girst football clinic ve promoted vhich vas held
at Southvark Park during an extremely cold February, over
150 boys and girls attended every single day for a veek
along vith a very large con.tin.geat of parents.

At every soccer school and clinic vhich I must stress are
free, and every youngster vho attended regulary are given
a Uillvall T-Shirt, tickets to a home game, these are
usually given out by the professional players or Directors
of the club vho regularly attend every school or clinic.

The community scheme have very strong links vith Millvall
Lionesses and actively encourage young girls and vomen to
participate in football vith girls only sessions tutored
by vomen coaches jriio achieved coaching qualifications
thorough courses vhich vere organised by the community
scheme.

The scheme organises a Fun Run once a year and fortunately
I vas able to attend this years run held on the 23rd
October 1988, veil over 1,000 people took part as veil as
the complete Millvall 1st Team.  It seemed as if every one
vfeje took,, p a>t fciim A h a ,
                               tgo yor-lcar ft.'Gaxy u n d .Ra an-ia, -- ----
children from the local schools vere encouraged to raise
sponsorship and I personally           sav tvo youngsters vho had
raised in access of £100-00 for various charities, the
day vas a complete success vith everyone including tvo
bull terriers enjoying themselves, meeting and talking to
the players.

The scheme caters for all sections of the community including
special needs both physically and mentally handicapped.
The community vork closely vith tvo spec&al schools in the
borough vith regular visits and helping to formulate teams
and arranging visits to the club.

¥ke scheme ha* made the club itself' accesible, the ground
#hlch to many people vas halloved only to be looked upon
by the privileged fev is nov an integral part of the
community vith activities going on and organised visits to
the club to see facilities and meet the players.

It is a credit to all concerned that the scheme has become
so successful.  The tvo vorkes are nov receiving mail
proportions (fan) but they still keep there feet firmly on
the ground and are steadily increasing the role of the
scheme.

    Name of Nominated Club            The Arsenal Football Club_________________


    Name of Nominator               Douglas James Leslie Mobsby

                                                        City of London Sports &

   Position held         Chairman


   On behalf of the above organisation I nominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
   munity Award. I do so for the reasons outlined below:


  1.      Mr Alan Sefton of the Club attends Council meetings and makes                                *
          contribution thereto.

  2.      The club runs the City of London Indoor Cricket Competition which
          is now in its third year of operation. The competition has grown
          from an entry of 42 teams to 88 teams and involves organising 38
          into competition, which competition is rounded off by celebrity
          presentation evening.

  3.      The club has taken responsibility for hosting and running the
          five a side football competition and has organised similar
          tournaments for other city institutions such as the city of London
          Police. Mr Sefton has also assisted with the organisation of other
          events on the day of City Sport i.e. the swimming gala.

  4.      The club has organised the City of London Indoor Hockey Competition
          which attracted an entry of fourteen teams. I am informed by
          the Club that when the indoor centre is back in use, it will
          expect a much larger entry following recent Olympic success.

       Position held.


      On behalf of the above organisation I nominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
      munity Award. I do so for the reasons outlined below:


Millwall has shown strong and positive support to young people in the Borough
of Lewisham, Southwark, Greenwich and further afield. The majority of young
people live in the inner-city and suffer f r o m severe deprivation. Some
indication of the p o v e r t y can be judged f r o m the very large n u m b e r s w h o are
entitled to free meals.

At nursery level the Millwall Community Scheme has provided signed footballs
which are raffled to raise money to buy equipment etc. They have taken nursery
children and their older brothers and sisters to the p a n t o m i m e and on other
outings.

The primary age children are provided with regular coaching in school; besides
football a w i d e range of other sports are undertaken. It is not only the
skills that are taught but a l s o a code of conduct. Equa l l y i m p o r t a n t is the
correct emphasis the Scheme's workers have placed on anti-racialism. One of
the hallmarks of the Scheme is that the workers demand and, because they have
earnt the respect of young people, receive, a high standard of behaviour.

The scheme, unlike any other in m y             experience, promotes a sound
platform for curriculum work and development. Much of the work undertaken is
in keeping with the new National Curriculum. Projects undertaken in the past
two years or currently, include:

a)       'Hundred years of Social History in celebration of M i l l w a l l and the
          Football League's Centenary.'

Students participating in these projects have to make regular visits to the
stadium, where they are always generously received. Schools not involved in
the above projects also make regular visits and currently the Scheme, teachers
and inspector, are developing curriculum worksheets.

The older pupils, besides the coaching sessions already m e n t i o n e d have
contribution made by the workers, players and other staff to various areas of
the curriculum. The work on anti-racism is particularly appreciated and the
i n p u t to t u t o r i a l p e r i o d s has c l e a r l y h e l p e d to r a i s e s t a n d a r d s of
achievement. As one deputy headteacher of a large comprehensive school said,
"The scheme has demonstrated and illustrated patterns of acceptable attitudes
w h i c h students readily accepted because of their respect for the Scheme's
staff and players. In three sessions they made more progress than the school
was able to in a term."

At Youth Club level again the Club, through its Community Scheme, has made a
significant contribution. Special mention should be made of the support the
Sche m e gave to the Basket-ball C l u b for m e d by a gro u p of youngsters f r o m a
minority ethnic group. The 'Football' schools, short tennis and other sports
have furthered the young peoples skill and helped them develop good habits in
using their leisure time.

 Some of these activities I have witnessed in my professional role and I have
 been inpressed not only with the level of instruction but also in the quality
 of the relationships. I recall an evening when the scheme organised a football
coaching course for p r i m a r y school girls in Deptford. At the end of one
session a gr o u p of mothers approached me and said they w a n t e d m e to thank
Millwall on their behalf, because with their husbands being unemployed, it was
not possible for them to provide treats for their daughters.

In thirty years of wide educational experience I cannot recall one institution
making such a significant impact for good in the lives of children and young
adults, both at a social and d e v e l o p m e n t level. M a n y young peop l e and their
families, some who may never have been to Millwall to watch a game, have real
cause to be grateful to the Club.

M i l l w a l l is a p o w e r for good in the c o m m u n i t y and richly d e s e r v e to be
congratulated - hence this statement.

                Name of Nominator           Sally Booth


                Body/Organisation Represented by Nominator     Sports Council

                 Greater London & South East Regions


                Position held       Regional O ffic e r


                On behalf of the above organisation I nominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
                munity Award. I do so for the reasons outlined below:
                The Sports Council Greater London & South East regions is one of the
                funding agencies of the 'Football in the Community' scheme based at the
                Millwall Football Club, using monies received as a result of the abolition
                of the Greater London Council;    It considers schemes such as these to be
                of vital importance not only in terms of general sports development, but
                also in the involvement of local people with the work of a professional
                club.

                The Sports Council Greater London & South East regions looks to the
                'Millwall Football in the Community' scheme to help it achieve the
                objectives set out in its Royal Charter, namely to increase participation
                in sport and recreation by all members of the community, in particular
                youth, women and girls, disabled, ethnic minorities and the 50+; to
                encourage the development of excellence; to improve public awareness of
                sporting opportunities and develop greater provision and access to sports
                facilities.    The Millwall scheme has certainly been successful in
                tackling each of these objectives and the impact the scheme has had on
                the local community has been considerable.

                The scheme has reached all aspects of the community young and old, male
                and female, and has extended beyond the realms of football, with
                opportunities  for participation in sither      sports such as tennis,
                basketball, archery and short mat bowls also being provided.   The work
                being performed at Millwall is first class and essential and both Gary
                Stemple and Ron Bell, the sports workers, are to be admired for their
                initiative, determination and enthusiasm for their work.


               If you want more information on the Football Trust Community Award Scheme contact
               Patricia Finney, The Secretary, The Football Trust, 10 Melton Street, London NW1 2EJ.

They can only be congratulated along with all the voluntary support they receive
from the Millwall staff.

The Sports Council Greater London & South East regions has regular contact with
the Millwall scheme on a one to one basis and as a member of the Management
Committee. The development of sport in the community is of paramount importance
for both health and social reasons and the scheme at Millwall is a fine example

   Position held______________ GOVERNOR AND TREASURER


   On behalf of the above organisation I nominate m y local club for a Football Trust C o m ­
   munity Award. I do so for the reasons outlined below:

  For many years Millwall Football Club have carried an undeserved, unfriendly
  reputation. A reputation unfairly set in peoples minds for many past years.
  It has survived as a football club for many years in a poor working-class
  area. It has always had to struggle with this reputation, deprivation and
  poverty.

   A few years ago it set out to try to change all this, without most importantly,
   changing its roots. First it joined with Lewisham Council to promote community
   spirit. It employed a very special young man to represent its cause with the
   local Clubs, Schools and Youth Schemes. Their work in this field has proven to
   be first class. Our school a small Church of England voluntary aided school,
   with few funds and little room for sports facilities and a lack of sports teachers,
   has been one of the schools to benefit most from Millwalls efforts. We have been
   very lucky to have Mr. Gary Steppel to visit our school on a regular bases,
   he has;
  1)     Taken classes.
  2)     Kindly befriended the children.
  3)     Given tickets, programmes, etc. to those children least able to afford them.
  i+)    Arranged games with other sbhb&ls and on many occasions refereed them.
  5)     Taken the children in the holidays and run a soccer school, for which the
         children received Tee shirts and the best care and attention.

   We have now come to regard the help of Millwall Football Club and its Staff,
   to be essential to our curriculum. They have stood by their debenture and have
   become the sporting backbone of our community. Coupled with their success on the
   field, Millwall are now viewed with admiration and kindness.                     For these reasons
   I nominate them for The Football Trust Community Award.

  O n behalf of the above organisation I nominate m y local club for a Football Trust C o m ­
  munity Award. I do so for the reasons outlined below:

 I and my Community Involvement officers have worked closely with the
 Millwall Community Workers for the last 3 years. We first linked up with
 Gary SEMPLE, to jointly run a Youth Sports Fiesta Day, for All Saints Church,
 New Cross, SE1^, as part of the                  Deptford Festival, in 1986. Ihis has continued
 each year since, and                 has become an established event on the                  Festivalcalender.


 In 1987 my Officers started running a Summer Sports Fiesta, for young
people during August, in Lewisham parks, both as a Crime Prevention and
Community Relations Scheme. Gary SEMPLE, and this year Son BROWN as well,
have been involved running the Football Competition during the three weeks
of the Scheme.            They have also assisted with equipment, certificates, badges,
and other memorabelia for the participants. We are most grateful for their
tremendous support, without which the Scheme would not have proved to be the
success that it has.

 Hy Officers also maintain a continual informal   liaison with Gary       Bon,
 to exchange information and ideas, and to plan for future joint Community
 initiatives.



 We recently entertained Simon LEYSHON, a trainee Priest, on attachment
 to Millwall. We expect this to be reciprocated in the near future, by
 our local probationary Police Officers paying visits to Millwall during
thjeir Community Involvement training, so that they can learn and benefit
from the good work that Gary and Bon are doing.


Hy Officers have also discussed the future link up with Millwall, on
running indoor cricket coaching.



It has been noticeable, the improvement in the relationships between
Millwall and the local Community since the conception of the Community
team, particularly among the non footballing public. This can only bode
well for the future, and shows what fine work Gary SEMPLE and Bon BROWN
are doing for Millwall Football Club in the Community.

  On behalf of the above organisation I nominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
  munity Award. I do so for the reasons outlined below:

  My/our contacts have been chiefly with Garry Stemple, and
  Ron:Bell, .through the years it has also been, through them,
 -with,many others in the club.
   Our work together is irregular but frequent. It has included
   a big sports fiesta run by Millwall, ourselves and the
   Met,Police, as part of the Deptford Festival and involving
   several Hundren children. We have, for our summer play
   schemes etc. been able to have players coming to give
   prizes. Millwall are part of a Sixth Form Community Studies
   course that I run, and at Christinas they are so supportive
   of activities for the Senior Citizens (on one occasion even
   to the point of providing help on Christmas Day itself.)
   It is a fairer picture to say that due to Gary and Ron’s
   work we find ourselves as cooperating in so many aspects
   of the Community - almost as if we were all part of one
   family. We went to them for help with a video we have been
   making - they came to us when they wanted a memorial service
   after the Bradford Fire Disaster. We took our band and
   choir to the Millwall Children’s Party for a stint of
   Carol singing.
   However, apart from these details there is a much more
   important aspect. Through Gary’s work, there is a closer
   and closer affinity between the club and the community. The

Community around Mlllwall has been knocked about by-
town planners and politicians, and there is simply
too much concrete to be natural. Children are not able
to achieve what they should, they hafrAlost the dignity
to which they are entitled.
Now, a sense of belonging to Millwall hasogiven them
a proper pride, and sense of achievement.
It has given more. It has given a sense of responsibility,
as people realise that their behaviour is being watched,
and that they have a duty not to let down the club to
which they feel they belong — not just support.
This achievement, which while hard to m easure, is very
apparent to me, and I have no doubt of Garry and Ron's
enormous contribution to this. Neither would I wish
to diminish the support of the whole club in all they
do. They are the front men for a total club exercise.
When the crowds shout "We are Millwall" they mean just that.
•WE ARE* and not just the eleven on the pitch.

   Position held                    .Deputy Head

   On behalf of the above organisation Inominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
   munity Award. Ido so for the reasons outlined below:


  1.         Any request made by us to Millwall Football Club is considered
             important enough to receive immediate attention.
             We have very much appreciated the frequent (free) use of their
             minibus which has benefitted numerous children.
             We also last year asked for some work-experience placements.
             These were two of the most successful placements with both the
             boy and girl receiving excellent support from staff at Millwall.
             This year one placement is under way already and two more are
             to follow soon.
  2.         Educational Activities
            The North Lewisham Sixth Form Consortium organised a week's exam
            level activity based on the theme leisure industries.   This
            included Millwall staff in practical and theoretical work.   The
            week was based at Millwall and our students reported the week as
            unequivocally successful.

Planned Events
We have been pleased to participate in local five-a-side
soccer tournament organised by Millwall Football Club.   The
young sports journalist and photographer of the year organised
by Millwall Football Club and our local paper was also very
successful.
Our contribution to Millwall Football Club's Old Folks'
Christmas Party was seen as part of an ongoing reciprocal
community effort.   Volunteers were not hard to find.



Nomination
It is possible that other clubs do more or have better facilities
but I doubt that the care, concern and organisation could be
bettered.   Both boys and girls, slower and brighter pupils,
athletically talented and those with poor co-ordination are equally
valued and encouraged.    For us this is more important than what
is offered and m y nomination is based primarily on the fact that
Millwall Football Club displays an attitude which is beneficial
to all the children and young adults in our school community
rather than a fortunate few.

   Position held          Headteacher


   On behalf of the above organisation I nominate my local club for aFootball Trust Com­
   munity Award. Ido so for the reasons outlined below:

   1.    For many years the Club has provided a football coach for the top
         junior children who have benefitted from an hour's training session
         each week throughout the year.

   2.    Close links with the Club have been formed with school     visitsto
         the ground and facilities to see the provision and learn the
         history and development of the game and club.

   3.   During school holidays children have been encouraged to be
        involved by undertaking small tasks in the club grounds under
        supervision.

   4.   The club has given complimentary tickets             for seated places at
        local matches for families to attend.

   The chief contact and coach from Millwall FC is Gary Stemple whose
   skill in fully committing the children in training and the social
   aspects of team work is to be commended.

   I have no hesitation in nominating Millwall Football Club for this
   award for their close links with this school and the community through
   the children's families and friends.   They have established the club
   very strongly as part of the community and are welcoming of community
   involvement.   Gary Stemple is an excellent ambassador in this
   development.

   Position held         Head Teacher_____________________________________________


   On behalf of the above organisation I nominate m y local club for a Football Trust C o m ­
   munity Award. I do so for the reasons outlined below;

   We are a small primary school in Deptford.                       At the moment we are not
   able to offer football on our curriculum, since we do not have a teacher
   responsible for P.E. and volunteers are har.d to come by.

   A year ago, Gary Stemple from Millwall Football Club, visited our school
   and invited us to join in a scheme they were running in Lewisham Schools


   Children very often display aggression which can partly be attributed
   to    their     social     environment.         The   weekly   football      sessions have           not
   only developed their physical skills but their self control and their
   willingness to take part.

   Gary    has     an     excellent     attitude    towards   the    children        and    has    worked
   very     hard    to     build      positive   relationships      with     them.       Millwall       has
   given our children an opportunity to get involved in an activity that

   otherwise would not have been available.

                      Coach (Archery)
   Position held____________________


   On behalf of the above organisation Inominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
   munity Award. Ido so for the reasons outlined below:

  Due to the lack of outdoor shooting facilities for Archery in the area
  the club has allowed it's ground to be used during the Summer.

  This facility is extremely important for many of the Archers since they
  do not possess transport to go to Archery Clubs which are many miles distant.

  Although we have only recently (end June) enjoyed the facilities, several
  newcomers to the sport have since joined regular archery clubs having
  sampled the sport— at-Millwall.           --- --

  Already interest has been shown by the Archers in the formation of an Archery
  Club located at "The Den" and the Millwall Football Club's management is
  looking favourably at the idea.

  Millwall have been very positive in their help in getting Archery going on
  their ground so much so that they have extended the shooting period by use
  of floodlights!

  Archers shoot outdoors roughly in line with B.S.T. (March to October).

  Mr.Hortop (Chief Executive/Secretary) for M.F.C. kindly offered to extend
  the period beyond 23rd October when we planned to close down for winter.
  Regretfully the weather is likely to be against us so we had to decline.

 Tel: 01-388-4504.
The facilities did enable some Juniors to get in some extra practice
prior to the London Youth Games with the result they improved their final
position by several places. Next year with the continued co-operation of
Millwall we expect to do even better.

I feel Millwall's positive attitude in the community has done much to improve
Football's and Millwall's in particular and I know my Archers (many
non-football supporters) have a very friendly attitude to Millwall and this
is reciprocated by all the Club's staff.

It is evident that the whole community has been uplifted by recentsuccesses
and speaking for the Archers we now look on Millwall as 'Our club'.

We wish Millwall every success - they deserve it.




                 Sincerely,




P.S. Apart from Mr.Hortop our main line of communication is with Gary
     Stempel who has dealt with the day to day problems (very few) and
     David White of Millwall Comnunity Sports Project. Without the aid
     of these gentlemen the Archery at Millwall would still be just an idea.
     I Cannot give any other names to the friendly faces at Millwall but
     they are all helpful.

On    the    same        day     that     I was      a s k e d to w r i t e      :his p i e c e     I found

through a diary                  freak that          I had      just e n o u g h     time     between

meetings           to visit         o ne of      the p r o j e c t s      soccer schools            at

Deptford           P ar k .




N o w in some            lights,        Deptford        P a r k w i t h its       rectangular            shape

mature       trees        and Victorian terraces                       could almost          be m i s t a k e n

for    one       of    the     Bloomsbury Squares or Regency Brighton.




Not    on    this       day    !    It w as      col d,     rain was         in the a ir ,         graffiti

from    the m o s t           rece nt acts        of c o m m u n i t y bas e d art           was    still

evident          on    the     b u r n t out     refreshment kiosk,                and,      oh yes

there       were       about       two hundred,           streetwise          Deptford kids              kicking

what    seemed          like       a hundred        footballs           in v a r i o u s    games    of

organised             or disorganised             soccer.              On closer e x a m i n a t i o n
                                                                                                           i

through          the m u r k , I     could       just     make     out     in the m i d d l e       distance

an    adult       figure        g e s t i c u l a t i n g w i d ly ,    trying     to q u e l l     scraps,

pass    on       tips,        cajole,      commiserate             and encourage             the    potential

stars       of        tomorrow.            "Is    that Gary S t e m p e l ? "               I asked       the

nearest          u r c h i n . " Y e h " came     the     staccato reply.                  'Vho are       you?"

"I'm    from          the C o u ncil"        I volunteered.                The reaction            to that

information             s u r p r i s e d me.       I n s t e a d o f th e n e g a t i v e     response

for w hich            I b r a c e d myself,         the i n f o r m a t i o n b r o u g h t    on a huge

grin and a surprising acknowledgement                                    that L e w i s h a m ' s

involvement             wit h Millwall,             Gary Stempel             ( "G al")     and Ron        Bell

("Ron"),                  the      two Sports        Development Workers,                   was     a thing

of approval             and approbation.
                                              -     2    -




The    fact    that       the   two h u n d r e d       or so p l a y e r s        at     the s o c c e r

clinic       were    clearly very           local,       and c o m p rised          both boys           and

girls       and b l a c k and white kids                in n e a r l y    equal         n u m b e r s (a n d

that    they were          c l e a r l y r e l i s h i n g the e n v i r o n m e n t       created

on that       rather miserable              October afternoon                 totally          illustrated       to me

what    the    scheme means.




Obviously          there    are    other tangibles               s u c h as    the daily contacts

with    schools,          the basketball,           archery,         bowls         and     tennis

sessions.           The    over    fifties        outings and            of c o u r s e      the c h a r i t y

events.




However       if    I am ever again asked                    to s u m u p     the       benefits        of

an enlightened             s o c c e r c l u b u s i n g its a s s e t s       to       t he b e n e f i t

of    its    local    community         I think my mind will                   always          go back

to t h a t    cold,       windy    autumnal early evening                     at    Deptford          Park

in    1988} and      the    quite amazing and warm reaction                              from a

Deptford       youngster          to t he m a n f r o m t he C o u n c i l .

   Position held.


   On behalf of the above organisation I nominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
   munity Award. Ido so for the reasons outlined below:

  laving read the Football Trust Community Award Schaae enthusistically
  noticad there ia such an award for a Football Club.

 iBefore Ur G.Stampla Introduced himself ta our Basketball Team, wa
  thought it would ba at this stag* our last year in tha Ustropolitan
  Mans Leagua, dua to tha lack of funds as during this time most af
  our members wars aithar unemployed or studants which mant wa had to
  wait for Moonshot Committaa to sit thair mootings inorder to gat
  anything) on account of tha lata approval wa had to sit out 1986.

  During tha ending of this aaaaon Gary Staapla got involved with our
  taam which to th9 playara was mora than a-dgaaa cooa txue.
                      •

  This Gentleman belivad in tha team stronger than they belived in
  theirselvea, as the Coach there was nothing the team could want and
  all promises were fulfilled.

  If Gary had the power to restart the league he would hare done so,
  Hn^ng the time we were unable to enter there was not a tournament
  inside or outside London known to Gary that he would let pass without
  entering us.

everything we do encouraging and helping players.

Gary w ould, give up his own time d u r in g the evenings and weekends
to support the team, showing IOO^Intrest at all tines uaking us
feel apart of the Football Club and winners having such support.

 help of Millwalls backing.)

The only the team can do to show our appreciation to Gary and
Millwall at present is to keep Winning.

As TheeFootball Trust Community Award Scheme Comnittee this domination
a loan without a doubt should WIN Millwall F.C the Award,.knowing what
we were before Gary caae along it is unbelivable to see the progress and
the difference this have made in such a short time by the help given.
                                                                     M*
I am sure we are not the only Community group that Millwall have*in
such a way to build Harmony amongst all races in the field of Sport and
Activities other than Football.


We personally feel if you don't decide to Award Millwall F«C this Award.

   Position held      Parish priest.

   On behalf of the above organisation Inominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
   munity Award. Ido so for the reasons outlined below:

   Hy/our contacts have been chiefly with Garry Stemple, and
   RonTBell, through the years it has also been, through them,
   with.many others in the club.
   Our work together is irregular but frequent. It has included
   a big sports fiesta run by Millwall, ourselves and the
   Met.Police, as part of the Deptford Festival and involving
   .several Hundren children. We have, for our summer play
   schemes etc. been able to have players coming to give
   prizes. Millwall are part of a Sixth Form Community Studies
   course that I run, and at Christmas they are so supportive
   of activities for the Senior Citizens (on one occasion even
   to the point of providing help on Christmas Day itself.)
   It is a fairer picture to say that due to Gary and Ron's
   work we find ourselves as cooperating in so many aspects
   of the Community — almost as if we were all part of one
   family. We went to them for help with a video we have been
   making - they came to us when they wanted a memorial service
   after the Bradford Fire Disaster. We took our band and
   choir to the Millwall Children's Party for a stint of
   Carol singing.
   However, apart from these details there is a much more
   important aspect. Through Gary's work, there is a closer
   and closer affinity between the club and the carranunity. The
  If you want more information on the Football Trust Community Award Scheme contact
Community around Mlllwall has been knocked about by
town planners and politicians, and there is simply
too much concrete to be natural. Children are not able
to achieve what they should, they ha|rAlost the dignity
to which they are entitled.
Now, a sense of belonging to Millwall hascgiven them
a proper pride, and sense of achievement.
It has given more. It has given a sense of responsibility,
as people realise that their behaviour is being watched,
and that they have a duty not to let down the club to
which they feel they belong - not just support.
This achievement, which while hard to m easure, is very
apparent to me, and I have no doubt of Garry and Ron's
enormous contribution to this. Neither would I wish
to diminish the support of the whole club in all they
do. They are the front men for a total club exercise.
When the crowds shout *We are Millwall* they mean just that,
•WE ARE" and not just the eleven on the pitch.

 In 1987 my Officers started running a Summer Sports Fiesta, for young
people during August, in Lewisham parks, both as a Crime Prevention and
 Community Relations Scheme. Gary SEMPLE, and this year Bon BROWN as well,
have been involved running the Football Competition during the three weeks
of the Scheme.          Biey have also assisted with equipment, certificates, badges,
and other memorabelia for the participants. We are most grateful for their
tremendous support, without which the Scheme would not have proved to be the
success that it has.

    Officers also maintain a continual informal liaison with Gary and Bon,
 to exchange information and ideas, and to plan for future joint Community
 initiatives.


 We recently entertained Simon LEYSHON, a trainee Priest, on attachment
 to Millwall. We expect this to be reciprocated in the near future, by
our local probationary Police Officers paying visits to Millwall during
t^eir Community Involvement training, so that they can learn and benefit
from the good work that Gary and Bon are doing.


Hy Officers have also discussed the future link up with Millwall, on
running indoor cricket coaching.


It has been noticeable, the improvement in the relationships between
Millwall and the local Community since the conception of the Community
team, particularly among the non footballing public. This can only bode
well for the future, and shows what fine work Gary SEMPLE and Iton BBOWN
are doing for Millwall Football Club in the Community.

          THE FOOTBALL TRUST
        COMMUNITY AWARD SCHEME


    N a m * o f NominatAri           The M i n w a l l Football & Athletic Company (1985) pic.

   Name of Nominator         Mr. J. A l l o t e y . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

   Body/Organisation Represented by Nominator             The Mulberry Adult Education Cen t r e ,

     London Borough of Lewisham Social Services._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

   Position held         Acting Manager.

   On behalf of the above organisation Inominate my local club for a Football Trust Com­
   munity Award. Ido so for the reasons outlined below:

  The Mulberry Education Centre is a Day Service for People with Learnina
  Difficulties (Mental Handicap).
  For the past 3 years we have been associated with the Millwall Football
  and Athletic Company. They have done a great deal of Fund Raising Events
  for the Centre and the money raised have gone to supporting some of our
  events that during these days of financial restraint we would not have
  been able to afford.

  The Millwall Football Company has been providing our clients with co n­
  cessionary tickets for football matches during mid-week and week-ends.
  .The;M11Jwall F o o t b a l l Company also arranges for Summer outings for the
  clients of the Mulberry Centre. This gives a well earned break for some
  of our parents.

 Almost every Christmas they put on a party for our clients which 1s well
 attended by the players and management.

 For these selfless and dedicated charitable reasons we the staff and clients
 of the Mulberry Centre for People with a Mental Handicap unreservedly and
 whole-heartedly recommend the Millwall Football and Athletic Company for
 the Football Trust Community Award.

                                                                                Joe Allotey

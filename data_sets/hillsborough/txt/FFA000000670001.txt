Dear Mr Croker,

SAFETY OP SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - PITCH PERIMETER FENCING

Last autumn the Council issued general safety certificates for the first six                    |
grounds in London designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975* The
certificates included those for the grounds at which the Arsenal, Queens Park
Rangers, Tottenham Hotspurs and West Ham play.   The Metropolitan Police had
strongly urged that the provision of perimeter fencing at these grounds should
be made a requirement in the certificates;   the Clubs concerned did not favour
at that time the introduction of such fencing.   While Members here felt that
in the light of the record of crowd conduct at these grounds perimeter fencing
should not be a requirement of the certificates, an assurance was given to the
Police that the question of perimeter fencing would be reviewed at the end of
the season or before should crowd behaviour demand it.

The Police have now renewed .their request for the installation of fencing and
have promised us details of incidents to support their case;    you will be aware
that Press reports last season indicated an increasing tendency for pitch invasions.
The Council would be grateful to have the views of the Football Association on the
general question of the provision of pitch perimeter fencing.    We understand that
fencing has been installed at more grounds in different parts of the country, in
some instances at your Association's request.

Officers here will be meeting the Police later this month and I would very much-
appreciate an early reply.
                                             Tours sincerely,

quickly      the     crowd        increased to vast                    proportions.



I found myself work i n g                   to the           right     of    the Leppings Lane                 turnstiles

as you        1 ook from the         roaSuddenIy                the      pen that       leads     to those

quite good humoured,                 but     s e e m i n g l y oblivious        to the o v e r - c r o w d i n g

that was occurring.                  At this       time     I was working w ith Police

C ons t a b l e s    1696 and      1300 from Merseyside,                   All 3 of us w o r k e d           for a

long time           to stop fans          pushing and jamming              up against          the     person      in

front of them.              It was a l r e a d y      causing      problems         at the front            of the

turnstiles and we knew a serious                          s i t uation was developing.                   1 shouted

continuously at             fans     to    ’stop    p u s h i n g 1' as did the other             officers.             We

w aved out arms            i n an ef f o rt to        convey our meani n g .               The    crowd s impiy

ignored us and kept                increasing         in/volume.           Things       eventually          became

so ov e r c r o w d e d    that my horse           " H u s s a r ’ who    is seventeen and a half

hands high and weighs well                      o v e r half a ton was             surr o u n d e d    by fans who

w e re w r a p p e d ar o u n d ,h i s who 1 e body 1 i ke s el l-opha n e o r cling~f i 1m . The.

horse        could n^jxlriove a leg or a muscle. • He began to lose                                   his    footing

as he was           lifted by the          crowd.



I. was       somehow      pushed to the          left and my           left     leg was      trap p e d against

a large        steel      upright     stanchion.            ''Hussar" who          is one of our            best

horses was           clearly    in a si t u a t i o n w hich he has                never     faced      before and

I knew the           horse was       far from happy.             If he was kicked,                reared or

even moved a leg              I was       ext r e m e l y worr i e d     that    the    safety        of the    crowd

would        be further       risked.



No b o d y    in the      crowd was        taking     the    slightest          notice     of our       pleas -

even those with             small     children.           I decided to           come out        of the      pens

and try to work             from the         rear of the        crowd to at            least     stop anyone

else from joining              the    rear      of the      'melee* ••        I tried this            tactic with

minimal        success.

         I could see that Pollce Const a b l e s                      1696 and     1300 had f o l lowed my

         example and we were joined by Police                           Constable? 2 316 Scott.              We    then

         shut    the blue wrou g h t           i                     t the Lappings Lane          end with the

         assis t a n c e    of a foot        officer.         These     gates     l&*d'"into the       turnstile

         pens.       This was a t t e m p t e d to all e v i a t e           crushing    on the     turnstiles

         w h i c h by now was getting                quite    nasty.         We m a n a g e d to hold the         gates

         ’m e l e e ’,     I would      think       that a r o u n d " 11/12 horses        lined up and formed a

         quite     effective? barrier^srfdeways                     onto the     crowd who were        still

         pouring along L e p p i n g s Lane              towards       the ground.

         could see the tactic working                      to some? reasonable           effect.       On my       right

         towards         the t urnstiles           the   crowd began to thin slightly at the

         turnstiles.           On my      left      looking     into Leppings Lane,            I saw that we

         had    contained a r o u n d s o                     latecomers.          They were      obvious 1y

         but we had them            contained.



         S u d d e n l y they started throwing .themselv.es under                        the horses        legs and

         bellies.          They were       forcing       themselves          between each horse w ith a

         and telling         them to stop            pushing.         HeV,repeated his m e ss ag e
continuously,           but he was         ignored by the          crowd.     They    pressed heavily

on our      .line of horses and broke                through and         ran to join the; rear of

the    p u s h i n g /shoving      crowd at the       turnstiles.



At this      time a supporter              reported       to me    that a w o m a n was        injured    at

the    turnstile        near      the g^te       by the Sweet       Shop.     (Gate ita.        I could       not

was no doubt          given to save          losjs of      life at     the t u r n s t ^ e s   and was        in

my    opinion -                                                                            N'v



Fans    rushed through the                gate    on my    left    (Gate f3j> in large         numbers.

This    passageway         leads      I think                N orth Stand.         The   opening       of the

gates had eased and                released the       problem almost           immediately.



Shor t l y a f t e r w a r d s    I dism o u n t e d and    ran    inside    the ground to Police

control.        On    climbing        the steps      1 noticed the West S t a n d terraces

were    crowded and          people w e j ^ ^ p T l l i ng onto        the    pitch behind the

goal.       Imagining        what     1 saw to be a pitch             invasion     1 went      back    to my

horse,      re-mounted and took a tea n j ^ H ^ S horses a r o u n d to Gate                       '0' .

dead and those           still      alive were       receiving attention.



E v e n t u a l l y when the       decision to a b a n d o n       the game was announced,               I

went    out of the         ground and        patrolled at the Leppings Lane                     end,

On the     day    in quest i o n my day's           duty began at 0700.                I. completed duty

at 2000      that    evening.



Before,      during and after            the m atch both          1 and all        my officers were

under    the     command     of Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t      D u c k e n f i e l d thro u g h Police

control.         Officers       working at either            end of the ground were                  the

re s p o n s i b i l i t y of the two S u p e r i n t e n d e n t s    in charge         Superintendent

Marshall       at L e p p i n g s Lane    end and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     C h a p m a n at Peru stone

R o a d end.



Superintendent           Murray at the Control               Point      had a full       b r e a k d o w n of

all   officers       deployed.         Their     exact      location,        collar    number and Force,



My general        perceptions        of the day were            that      large    numbers      of

L iverpool       fans      Trie late     to the ground.               Many w^re     intoxi c a t e d but

not   n e c e s s a r i l y drunk.     Too many were          in that        state ~ prohibiting

ac t i on by i ndi v i d u a 1: of f i ce r s .



The   crowd at the          turnstile       were     initially good humoured,                  but quickly

became a g gressive          as the t u rn s ti l es were             unable    to cope with          the

influx.        The   crowd would not            listen      to advice        given and had no

concern as        they    pushed      forwards,       for the s a f e t y / c o m f o r t     of the

people at the front              of the     ’p u s h * .



I could not u n d e r s t a n d at the            time     of the      crushing at the          turnstiles

why   people were         not    passing      through.        The      crowd hardly         seemed to

diminish at all.

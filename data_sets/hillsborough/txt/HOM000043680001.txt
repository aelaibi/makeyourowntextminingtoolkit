DRAFT LETTER TO RELATIVES FOR HOME SECRETARY’S SIGNATURE                                    ^       J


As you know, I continue to be deeply moved by the Hillsborough stadium disaster. I
am sure that concerns felt by those most closely affected and others that a number
of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved can only make the process of
dealing with your grief all the more difficult.


I have had the opportunity to consider fully the many representations which have
been made calling for a new public inquiry, and the matters raised by the Granada
television programme broadcast last December. I have decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no
matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. That is why I
have announced in the House today that there will be an independent scrutiny by
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal. I enclose for
your information a copy of my statement to the House, which includes Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith’s terms of reference. You will see that I have undertaken to make
public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives me.


It is my-oarnest hppelfiat the independent scrijto           Jly bring an end
uifcertkinty'6ver the events of thatJerrtBle afternoon.

Dear Mr Hassell

You wrote to Mr Moynihan on 25 April 1989 about
safety at sports grounds. Miss Bannister, in
her letter of 18 May 1989 mentioned that your
letter had been forwarded to me as the
Secretary to the Inquiry.

I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice
Taylor who has noted it.

    J                           Yours sincerely

Stationary and Printing


Expenditure on this sub-head is likely to fall almost exclusively
in the second and fourth quarters, with publication of the
interim and final reports respectively.


2.   The cost of publication of the interim report for Popplewell
in 1985 was approximately £30,000, and the figures of £50,000
here do not seem excessive.

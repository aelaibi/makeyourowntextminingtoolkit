                                   GENERAL INFORMATION

The Disasters Working Party has been in operation since February
of this year. Its brief is to consider what can be learned from
past disasters about the psychological and social effects on
individuals, families and communities.     It was set up at the
request of the Department of Health -which is grant aiding Cruse
to service it.

In particular, its               terms      of   reference        are    to    consider       the
following points:

     What steps should be taken to prepare for th^ provision of
social and psychological support in the aftermath of such
disasters;

     How best to achieve coordination                          among      agencies       in   the
arrangement of the necessary support;

     How the lessons learned from recent experiences might best
be disseminated;

        Setting up an information service.

The members of the working party include representatives from
social services, emergency services, voluntary organisations,
local authorities , and- psychiatric services The Departments of
Health and -the Home Office, through the newly formed Civil
Emergencies Secretariat, both have observers. The working party
has met four times, and has begun to work on the framework for
a consultation process, to be conducted in the autumn.

information or reports to be considered, or individuals or
organisations to be consulted.  These should be directed to the

    Dear

    Here is the first draft of the research framework I have been
    working on, ready for your editing. It consists of four parts:

    1. An overall chart, called "Major Components of                                       Disaster
    Planning and Response: A Psycho-Social Perspective"

    2. The back           up    document        for    this     chart,       called      "Research
    Framework".

   3. A Questionnaire, divided into a general section and topical
   sections, which follow the same order as the chart and the
   document. To use these questions to conduct interviews, I will
   need to reorganise them by Consultee group, as opposed to topic
   category.   Please try and answer them as they are, even though
   the order may be clumsy.   Please add any questions you feel are
   missing, and delete any which you feel are inappropriate or
   unnecessary.   Please use the backs of pages to answer if there
   isn't enough room, and write in note form, as briefly as
   possible. Under section 2 of the questionnaire, I relise I have
   left out a whole category of people - those directly involved
   through bereavement, injury and their families. I had originally
   included this group, but then I realised that all the questions
   were phrased in a way to be answered by "helpers" rather than
   "victims".   I will prepare another section for this group of
   people, but felt it was better to send out what I had now rather
   than wait until it was ready.

   4. Guidelines - I have not done any work on this section, except
   to separate out from the subgroup reports sections which had been
   presented in such a way as to provide information in the form of
   guidelines rather than issues for consultation. This is not new
   material - you have seen all this before.   You may want to look
   through it again, to see whether you agree that the material is
   in fact in guideline form; or you may want to put it aside for
   reconsidering after we have gone through the consultation
   process.

   I would like the following from you before the next working party
   meeting on September 14th:

   1. A completed questionnaire - please read all questions,                                      and



Chairman: Mr.AJ.Allen                                                      Secretary: Derek Nattall

mark as not applicable any which are not applicable to you. This
will help me sort through how to divide up the questionnaire into
a number of shorter sections for particular groups.        It was
agreed at our last meeting that I would do some work to begin to
analyse your responses before the next meeting. This means the
sooner you send these back to me, the more thorough that work can
be.   I would need your responses at the latest by Sept. 5 in
order to mail my analysis to you by Sept. 8, so that you can read
it before the next meeting.    Anyone who replies in August will
be particularly blessed. (I will be away the week of Aug.21-28,
and I will be attending the conference in Bradford Sept 12-13).

2. Editorial comments - please write directly on the document,
chart or questionnaire with suggestions of what should be there
if you do not like what is there.    It is easier to read if you
use a red pen or a pencil, and make a mark in the margin to
indicate something is to be inserted. If you insert extra pages,
please make sure they are numbered and marked clearly where they
are to be inserted.

3. Procedural comments - does this way of           organising the
questions help us to get to the next stagein the research?      Is
it useful, or is th^-re a better approach (which you can specify)?

My rough plan for how I would next proceed is as follows:

Aug:     Read articles
         Analyse questionnaires from Working Party
Sept.    Work with Campbell and Devore (asocial research
         company) to design questionnaire
         Do pilot series of consultation interviews around one
         particular disaster
Oct - March
         Do further series of consultations around six other
         disasters
         Spend one week of each month setting up interviews, one

          consulting   in   a   specific  area   (eg   database,
          communication, fund management) and one week recording
          information.
          In addition, send out questionnaires to disasters not
          interviewed   personally,   and  disasters   in other
          countries.
April    Do statistical analysis, with Campbell & Devore
May      Write initial draft of report.
June     Final version of report

I look forward to receiving your comments,


Yours,

    Dear

   Thank you for getting in touch with the Disasters Working Party.
   These documents represent a rough draft of pulling together the
   work of the Disasters Working Party so far. The meetings to date
   have focused on the process of the research - the limits of what
   we should cover - and have spent some time discussing topics such
   as the recent Hcgne Office paper on civil emergencies.     At the
   last meeting (June) we did discuss whether the working party
   should be involved in the evaluation process at Hillsborough, but
   decided the work would be better done by people with more
   thorough evaluation experience, who would be able to focus on
   Hillsborough.

   These papers are rough working papers, and represent my opinions.
   The last section, called guidelines, are parts of papers
   presented by some of the working party members which appear to
   be in the form of clear guidelines.      Again, the rest of the
   Working Party has not yet commented on whether they would agree
   to calling these "guidelines".

   If you do get involved in the Hillsborough evaluation, we would
   like to know the results of your work.


   With best wishes,




Chairman: M rA JA llen                                                      Secretary: Derek Nuttall

      MEETING WITH MR MICHAEL SHERSBY MP ON 6 SEPTEMBER


     You and Mr Le Vay were present when the Home Secretary
 met Mr Shersby. The meeting had been arranged at Mr Shersby's
 request in order to discuss a number of points of concern to
 him as the Parliamentary representative of the Police
 Federation.

 2.   Welcoming Mr Shersby, the Home Secretary recalled that he
 had recently had a useful meeting with Lord Bethell.   Now that
 Lord Bethell had accepted appointment as the Federation's
 representative in the Lords, he hoped that he and Mr Shersby
 would be co-ordinating their efforts on behalf of the
 Federation.   Mr Shersby confirmed that there would be close
 co-ordination between his activities and those of Lord
 Bethell: it was understood that Mr Shersby was the main
 Parliamentary representative of the Federation, and intended
 that Lord Bethell should look to Mr Shersby for guidance on
 the scope of his own activities. Of somewhat more concern to
 Mr Shersby was the recent proliferation in Parliamentary
 representation of the police, with separate representatives
 for the Transport police, the Port of London Authority police
 and the Superintendents' Association. The Police Federation
 did not want Mr Shersby to follow in Sir Eldon Griffiths'
 footsteps as the representative also of the Federation in
 Northern Ireland and Scotland. There would be great problems
 in co-ordinating the efforts of such a large number of
 Parliamentary representatives of police organisations. The
 Home Secretary shared Mr Shersby's concern, and expressed the
 view that it would be much better for one member to represent



                                              /the Federated
the Federated ranks throughout the United Kingdom: the
appointment of a separate representative for the Northern
Ireland Federation would be a particularly sensitive matter.

Future Structure of the Police Service

3. Mr Shersby said that some anxiety had been expressed to
him by the Federation about the future structure of the police
service. They understood that the Home Secretary might be
making a statement on this issue to one of the forthcoming
police conferences. The Home Secretary confirmed that he would
be making major speeches touching on police issues at the
Superintendents' Association conference and the ACPO
conference at Hutton Hall. He saw advantage in giving
Mr Eastwood and his colleagues a flavour of what he would have
to say at these conferences, and a meeting would be arranged
with them before the Superintendents' Association conference.
Mr Shersby would wish to know that the Home Secretary did not
intend in the present Parliament to bring forward a bill to
alter the police structure as set out in the 1964 Act, and in
particular he had no plans to create large regional police
forces, still less a national police service. He did not rule
out the possibility of individual boundary changes, although
the only case of this sort at present on the horizon was
Humberside, a possible consequence of the consideration being
given to the future of this county by the Local Government
Boundary Commission. Within the existing structure, however,
the Home Secretary was hoping to concentrate debate on the
questions of leadership, including the early identification
and development of those best equipped to rise to the top;
European developments, and the demands for improved co­
operation; the need for improved national co-operation against
serious crime and drugs trafficking; and the future of ACPO
itself, including the need to enhance its secretariat.

Hillsborough Disaster

4. Mr Shersby had heard the views of Federation spokesmen
from the South Yorkshire force. He had heard that morale in
South Yorkshire had taken a great knock as a result of Lord
Justice Taylor's interim report. Police on duty inside
Hillsborough on the day of the disaster had had no idea what
was happening, and believed that they were experiencing a
conventional pitch invasion. They felt they had been
shouldered with an unfair portion of the blame. The
Federation in South Yorkshire was also concerned at the
decision of the force solicitor to eliminate some material
from the police evidence to the Inquiry. The evidence in
question turned on emotional matters such as the alleged theft
of items which had fallen from the victims' pockets, and

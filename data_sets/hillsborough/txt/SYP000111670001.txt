                On Saturday              15 A p r i l    1989,        I came       on d u t y     at B a r n s l e y P o l i c e     Station

                at 8 . 0 0 a.m.            and       travelled        to W e s t       Bar    Police     Station,          Sheffield,,

                 parading          there        at    9.00    a.m.     that       day.




                My     initial       duties           were    on S e r i a l      16 u n d e r    the    supevision           of    Police

                These        duties        we    carried        out    u n t il    about       2.30     p.m.     Most      supporters          we

Ashort          time      l a t er      m a n y more       officei^came                 and J as sisted                    in f o r m i n g

a    cordon       across          the    halfway          line       being      positioned              toward            the     players

tunnel.                                                                                                    V



Many       of the       Liverpool             fans       who    came      onto       the     pitch'were               crying           or

hysterical.               A number            of     them also          s h o w e d all       the       symptoms             of    being

d ru n k ,    their       eyes       were       glazed,         their         speech was            slurred,              t h e y w er e

unsteady          on    their        feet       and their            breath      smelt        strongly               of    intoxicants.




The.overwhelming                   opinion           I got      from      the    supporters                I-spOke           to wa s         that

the     F.A.      was     to      blame       for     them      not     being        given        the      other          end     of    the

ground.



For     over      half       an    hour ,       f an s    roamed aroun d              the     pitch,            some       obviously

looking         for     trouble          as     they      roamed        about        in g r o u p s ,          running          from        one

Section         of     the     ptich       to      the    ot he r .



As     the    fans      started          to     disperse,            I attempted             to    find my            serial           as    I

had     become         detached          when        I was      instructed            to     stand         in t he         c o r do n.           I

eventually             joined        up w i t h S e r i a l          14 u n d e r     the     supervision                  of P o l i c e

Sergeant          1341       Crawford and                I escorted           fans      dawn        the L e p p i n g s L a n e              End

            Upwards        Penistone           Road,        Moat       of the        supporters         were     quiet and

            s u b d u e d as, t h e y w a l k e d        away      from      the     ground



             I eventually              re-joined Serial                16 o u t s i d e    the    main    entrance        to   the

            ground dn ^ehistone                     R o a d at a b o u t         6.00> p.fft.     From     there    we    returned

            to B a r n s l e y        where    we    were.stood             down     at 6 . 3 0    p.m.



            My    radio         had    been    taken       f r o m me       shortly       after     the    game    ha d   started, by

            Superintendent               Murray.




             I. m u s t    comment       that       at    the     t im e    of    the   incident        I heard      no

             instructions              over    the       ra dio    due      to    the   noise      from    the    crowd.       The

             radio        had    been working             well     up to         then and       r adio m e s s a g e s

             were     received          very    clearly           up   to    going      onto      the   track.

       Perhaps because they had no bosses to give, them instructions, the three

                                _______ pulled out a number of dead bodies and then started
           bringing out survivors, giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and heart massage
           where they could. PC          1-n particular, perhaps because of his recent first
           aid course which concentrated on precisely those techniques, was to the fore
           at this stage.. In addition to playing nursemaid to me, PC j       was circulating
           among the injured fans, comforting where he could and calming down some of the
           more exciteable ones.

           This continued for between 50 minutes to an hour until the last of the injured
           were carried off the park. During that time they also joined a police cordon
           aimed at preventing angry Liverpool fans charging towards the- Forest end of the
           ground.

        Afterwards they attended a debrief in the North Stand before eventually leaving
       pphe ground.

           Anyone who witnessed the actions of the three   officers - who stood out in
           their'distinctive yellow jackets -'would have   been immensely proud of them. I
           know I was and I know that feeling was shared   by a    lot   of very grateful officers
           of all ranks from the South Yorkshire force..

Dear Mr

Through statements made by other people it has came to my notice that you
attended the FA Cup semi-final, Liverpool v Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough
Football Ground on Saturday 15 April 1989.

It was my intention to obtain a statement from you regarding the tragic
events. However, after several attempts, my officers have failed to make
contact with you.

If you have any further information please do not hesitate to contact my
investigation team at Nechells Green Police Station. Alternatively you can
write to the Secretary of the Inquiry below:-

    Mr R M Whalley
    Secretary to the Inquiry
    50 Queens A n n e ’s Gate

Yours sincerely

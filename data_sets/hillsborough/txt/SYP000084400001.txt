At    11.00am that             date,    wit h my serial,             1 took          up this       point.     Thro u g h

the m o r n i n g , supporters               a r r i v e d and all        appeared          in jovial       mood,

looking       forwara to          the match.            There was         no a n i m o s i t y as far as            I could

detect       from the s u pporters                  and every t h i n g a p p e a r e d        to be a norma*             FA

was    going       to be well          attended         by good      natu r s d       football       supporters.           I

saw    nothing       to suggest          any        problems at          this    t i m e , except       the    odd fan

being    stopped by a Pol i c e Officer                       and told          to    leave any        cans    of    beer

behind.       I could see          some       fans      sitting      on walls ana              drinking       their

cans,    but       nothing       to suggest            problems      and      it was       only     the occasional

fan.    1 had not          cause       to speak         to anyone         except       to give       directions           or

a s s i s t a n c e as to where          the        various     entrances            were at       the grouna.

By 3 . 0 0 p m     the    crowds       coming        down P e n i s t o n e     Road       to the ground        had

subsided         to a mere        tri ckle of fans,                all    still       in good humour           and

causing       no    problems,          c e rtainly        no more        than    100       people and       they were

spread out as though                   they had arri v e d           late       in private          cars.

At    this    time,       because        there were           no          more       crowds,       our serial        w i t h PS

Pearson       began to           make our way             back to the           ground.

It was at          this    time,       approximately 3.03pm                   that we were           directed        by

radio    to assist w ith               crowd p r o b l e m s at          the L e p p i n g s    Lane    entrance          to

Laris e n t r a n c e , where         I could see a cordon of Pol i c/ O f f icers                            but     ver

few s up p orters.         We were       directed        to as s i s t here,            but at t his          t ime      I

could see         no    reason for       the    cordon,

A few m inutes           later,       it became       clear     that a serious               incident was

taking    place         inside    the    ground.       I saw several,             fans     being      e s c o r t e d by

Poli ce Officers           from the          ground    by the        turnstiles.

I could see            by their       faces    that    they were           in great        distress and             it

became    obvious         that     they were       not    being a r r e s t e d         but a s s i s t e d    by

Police.     At this        time       I heard    tine a n n o u n c e m e n t     that a serious              problem

had occur red inside              the    ground and that              several       people were            in/ured,

ambulances         had been       requested and           I was       d i r ected       by an    Inspe/tor,              who;Y:

I do not        know,     to go down          the service        road at          the    rear    of Jjhe south

stand to assist ambul a n c e s                to and from           the    ground.

1 went    down the service               road and wit h the                help of some          fans and           other

officers,        we m oved one          or two     parked vehicles                so that       the    service           road

was   clear.

I dia not        have a personal              radio    issued        to me and so           I went       to the

control     box at the side              of the       south stand and              informed them that                    the

service     road was           clear    for am b u l a n c e    and e m e r g e n c y      service       vehicles.               I

s u g geste d    that a m b u l a n c e s     snould     come    in from L a p p i n g s Lane and                   that

they should            leave    via P e n i s t o n e R oad and        thus       keeping       a smooth        flow.

and   loaded victims             from this       point,        but    for    the most         part     the

ambulances         came    from L e p pings       Lane.

I r e m ained at         this    location to ensure              the       free    passage       of e m g e r g e n c y

could and        helped        them    into waiting ambulances.



It w o u l d be about           5.3 0 p m when     I was       eventually          stood down          from this

duty and        I then     returned          to the main        stand for          d e briefing        at 6.00pm,                I

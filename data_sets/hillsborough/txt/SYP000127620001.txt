  FA CUP SEMI-FINAL - LIVERPOOL -v- NOTTINGHAM FOREST - SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989

  I personally attended the above match.  I parked my car in the official car park
  and went into the stand and up until just after 3.00 pm all the arrangements
  seemed to be perfectly in order.

  What I observed was what everyone else observed in the ground.  I do not think I
  am in a position to highlight any particular events from the position in which I
  was sitting.

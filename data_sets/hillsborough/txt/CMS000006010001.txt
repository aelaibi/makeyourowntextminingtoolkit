SUBJECT:   FA presentation on 26 November
PRIORITY:
ATTACHMENTS:

We are running out of time in drawing up this list of issues to raise at next
Tuesday's meeting. We need to send David Peters a list of issues by close of
play this Wednesday at the latest.
could vou first phone Charles Hughes office to find out who the FA and their
consultants are fielding and when we will know the topics to be covered. They
said they would let us know after last Friday.
Please look at the Blueprint again and list the key assumption on which we
want information including on the degree of commercial development, the split
between Taylor and non-Taylor work, what standards were used, how they
decided that 27 new stadia were needed and the assumed timetable, how th
reaional stadia Sere selected and the position on new national stadium - when
2 1 t h S going to take this issue to council, are there significant costing
differences between the Blueprint and the League's findings that are worth
raising.
Could I have a draft please by 3pm Wednesday.

Thanks.

Tony

   of    the     fence       and many           of    them were              scaling             the    fence         and     gaining

   entry       into      the      ground.            This       went       on     for a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 0 m i n u t e s                or

   so.      Some       of    the       fans     t hat      had    scaled             the     fence       were         standing            on the

   brickwork           above       turnstiles              9-16       and        some       of    these were               waving         red

   At    this      time      I was        pinned against                   the      wall         and    struggling               to   stand       up

   mounted         Police         Officers           who    appear           motionless and                     unable        to a s s i s t .

   During        this       time       a Police           message          was       announced            over        the      loudspeaker

   for     the     fans      to    stop        pushi ng         but    this was              ignored            by    the     fans.

   The     f ans     are     now       beginning           to    thin        out       a    little        and        the     crushing           and

   pushing         has      reduced        dramatically.                     I can          see a m o u n t e d            officer         near

   the     dividing          fence        telling          fans       to     get       off       the    fence         but     some        are

   ignoring          him and           still     climbing             over         i nto     the       ground.

31 March 2000 WITHIN PARAGRAPH 1,5 & 12 OF SCHEDULE 12A OF THE LOCAL
                       GOVERNMENT ACT 1972 AS AMENDED
Joint Report of Garretts the Clerk and Treasurer and the Chief Constable


FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

1.     Purpose of the Report

 To give consideration to an application from Roger Greenwood, a former
Superintendent with South Yorkshire Police, for financial assistance to meet
the costs of obtaining legal advice in dealing with questions put to him by Ms
Adlington in connection with the prosecution proceedings issued against
David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray arising from the Hillsborough Football
Stadium Disaster.


       2.     Recommendations

       Members are recommended to consider this report, the
       appendices and all other relevant material put to it and to
       consider the options set out below in relation to the
       application for financial assistance.



3.     The Application and Background Information

3.1.   Correspondence has been received from Vizard Oldham, solicitors for
       Mr Greenwood, ( see Appendix 1) seeking assistance on his behalf, to
       meet the costs of obtaining legal advice in dealing with questions put to
       him by on behalf of Ms Adlington. Ms Adlington wishes to interview Mr
       Greenwood with a view to taking a statement from him in connection
       with the prosecution proceedings issued against David Duckenfield
       and Bernard Murray. Ms Adlington’s letter of the 3 March 2000
       (included at Appendix Vindicates the principal areas on which the
       Crown wish to question Mr Greenwood. Mr Greenwood is concerned
       that, although he has not been charged, there is a possibility that a
       prosecution may be brought against him in the light of the responses
       he may give. It seems that a prosecution of Mr Greenwood is unlikely,
       but this possibility cannot be ruled out.

3.2    Mr Greenwood was on policing duty at the Football Association Cup
       semi-finals held in 1988 and 1989 at the Hillsborough Football
       Stadium. In 1989, he was in command inside the ground in the area
       between the perimeter fence and the turnstiles.



                                                                                 1
3.3   References to his role can be seen in Lord Justice Taylor’s Interim
      Report into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football ground on the
       15 April 1989, at paragraphs 47, 79, 80, 95, 222, 229, 245, 251, and
      281.

       Members have been provided with a copy of the interim report. A
       copy will also be available at the meeting and for ease of reference the
       paragraphs referred to are reproduced at Appendix 2.

3.4   On the 7 December 1990, the Authority approved a request from Mr
      Greenwood and 5 other police officers for financial assistance in
      relation to the inquest into the deaths which occurred in the
      Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. A copy of the resolution is attached at
      Appendix 3.

3.5   No disciplinary charges were recommended against Mr Greenwood in
      connection with the carrying out of his duties on the 15 April 1989.

3.6   The Chronology of events in the history of the Hillsborough Stadium
      Disaster from April 1989, is attached to this report at Appendix 4 by
      way of background information.

3.7.1 Following publication of the Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny report,
      and the announcement by Trevor Hicks, the Chairman of the
      Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG), that the HFSG were
      considering private prosecutions, Mr Greenwood’s solicitors applied on
      his behalf for financial assistance in July 1998. They were informed
      that the Authority would meet Mr Greenwood’s reasonable legal
      costs, in defending private prosecution proceedings that might be
      instituted by the HFSG.

3.7.2 In December 1999, prior to any call being made on the assistance
      offered, Ms Adlington wrote to the Authority challenging the provision
      of financial assistance to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray. In view of
      the challenges made, Mr Greenwood’s solicitors were informed that the
      offer of assistance would be considered afresh in the event of
      proceedings being issued against their client.

3.7.3 Following the Powers Judicial Review , Mr Greenwood’s solicitors
      made a further request on his behalf for an assurance that the
      Authority would indemnify him against costs in the event of
      prosecution. They also asked for an indication that the Authority would
      indemnify him in the event that he became involved in some other
      capacity, for example as a witness. Garretts on behalf of the Authority
      replied to the effect that the Authority would consider applications for
      financial assistance at the appropriate time.

      (Copy correspondence attached at Appendix 5).




                                                                              2
3:8   Mr Greenwood retired from South Yorkshire Police in 1993. He is now
      employed by Group Four. The letter of 9 March 2000 from his
      solicitors, Vizard Oldham, gives and outline of his financial
      circumstances.

4.    Police Authority Powers

4.1   The Divisional Court’s decision in R - v- DPP ex parte Duckenfield
      and Another T19991 (attached at Appendix 6) confirmed the Authority’s
      power to fund officers in criminal and judicial review proceedings. The
      reasoning leading to this conclusion would suggest that the Authority
      has power to provide financial assistance in order to obtain advice on
      threatened or possible criminal, judicial review (and other)
      proceedings. It would appear that the power is not conditional upon
      proceedings being in force. The power to provide assistance is
      available if it be conducive to “ the maintenance of an efficient and
      effective police force” - see pages 889 - 90 and 894d. Therefore, in an
      appropriate case, the Authority may fund costs of obtaining advice prior
      to proceedings, although the fact that no proceedings have been
      brought is a factor which should be taken into consideration.

5.    Matters for Consideration

5.1   In deciding whether to exercise its discretion to grant the financial
      assistance sought by Mr Greenwood, the Authority is subject to public
       law principles of decision making. Briefly, these are that it must
       (amongst other things):

      - act within whatever statutory powers conferred upon it by Act of
      Parliament;

      - act with procedural fairness (including by giving a hearing to directly
      interested parties);

      - take all relevant considerations into account;

      - ignore all irrelevant considerations;

      - not act irrationally;

      - not fetter its discretion; and

      - not unlawfully delegate the decision making function.

5.2   Failure to comply with any of these principles will expose the decision
      to challenge by way of judicial review. All relevant considerations
      should be taken into account and weighed against each other.

5.3   Relevant considerations to be taken into account include:



                                                                                  3
5.3.1 Whether the Authority is satisfied that Mr Greenwood acted in good
      faith on the day of the disaster;

5.3.2 Whether Mr Greenwood exercised his judgment reasonably, in the light
      of the circumstances he faced, and if not, whether other relevant
      factors outweigh this consideration;

5.3.3 Whether it is appropriate for Mr Greenwood to look to alternative
      sources of finance to pay his legal costs;

      It is understood that legal aid is not available and, even if it were, the
      likelihood is that Mr Greenwood’s means would be sufficient to meet
      the estimated legal costs involved. It is understood that Mr
      Greenwood’s solicitors researches have suggested that it would not be
      appropriate to ask the prosecutor to meet his reasonable legal costs
      which, incidentally, might be claimable in response to a civil matter.

      it is understood that Mr Greenwood has not approached the Police
      Superintendents Association, but it should be remembered that in
      R - v - Derbyshire Police Authority ex parte W ilson & Dalton (1989)
      the officers legal costs had been met by their Association and it was
      the Association which was seeking reimbursement.

      As there is no prosecution in force, there is no possibility of an award
      out of central funds.

      ( A copy of the Derbyshire case will be available at the meeting and
      copies can be obtained on request from the Clerk and Treasurer.
      Pages 43 - 45 which address the question of alternative funding are
      also attached at Appendix 7)

5.3.4 The seriousness of the likely charges and whether it is appropriate to
      provide funding before charges have been brought or even indicated,
      and before a verdict is reached on them. At the present time there is
      no immediate threat of prosecution to Mr Greenwood;

5.3.5 The Authority’s view of the merits of the possible charges;

5.3.6 The impact on the Authority’s resources of funding Mr Greenwood’s
      costs and the consequences on policing in South Yorkshire;

      Mr Greenwood's solicitors have estimated their costs, at £175 per hour
      to be £3,500 plus £612.50 VAT on the assumption o f:

      a.      5 hours preparation and pre-reading;

      b.      2 hours giving advice;

      c.     7 hours attending a meeting with the prosecutor, if such
             attendance is required; and


                                                                                 4
       d.     a further 6 hours spent reviewing draft statements.

      The solicitors’ may conclude that it is not necessary to attend the
      meeting or advise on the draft statement. As an alternative, the
      Authority could agree a fixed sum contribution towards the costs.
      Additional fees would no doubt be incurred if Mr Greenwood and his
      lawyers were required to travel to Liverpool, as suggested in HFSG’s
      letter of 20 March 2000, although it is noted that HFSG have offered to
      meet the rail costs (but not the lawyer’s travel time).

5.3.7 Mr Greenwood is not obliged to meet the prosecutor to discuss his
      evidence. However, if Mr Greenwood is subpoenaed, he will be
      required to attend trial;

5.3.8 The impact of a refusal to provide financial support on police morale
      and on the confidence of officers to exercise their judgment in difficult
      circumstances.

      The Chief Constable believes that on the day of the disaster Mr
      Greenwood, in performing his duties, acted in good faith. However,
      there is no suggestion presently that he will be the subject of
      prosecution proceedings. He has been approached by Ms Adlington
      to answer a number of questions on matters relevant to the
      prosecution proceedings involving David Duckenfield and Bernard
      Murray. Ms Adlington has approached a number of other officers.

      In view of the notice given of the areas which Ms Adlington wishes to
      question Mr Greenwood on, and the options available to him in
      responding, the Chief Constable does not support Mr Greenwood’s
      application for financial assistance. The Chief Constable does not
      consider that a decision to reject the application will impact upon the
      conduct of the force.

5.4   The factors which may assist the Authority in reaching a decision
      include:-

             Guidance in Home Office Circulars;

             The circumstances of the Hillsborough Stadium tragedy as
             recorded, inter alia, in:

             (a)    The interim report of Lord Justice Taylor into the
                    Hillsborough Stadium disaster;

             (b)    The Scrutiny of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith into the
                    Hillsborough Stadium disaster.

             The decisions of the DPP in 1990 that there was insufficient
             evidence upon which prosecution for manslaughter or any other


                                                                                  5
              criminal offence could be brought against any officer in the
              South Yorkshire Police or any other person.

              The decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions in 1997 that
              the material so far presented would not justify fresh
              investigations.

              The inquest findings of accidental death.

              The fact that no disciplinary charges were preferred against Mr
              Greenwood;

              The likely costs of the financial assistance;

             The financial resources of Mr Greenwood.

              Relevant representations put to the Authority by Mr Greenwood.

             The Chief Constable’s views.

5.5    Guidance on a number of these matters was given in the Divisional
       Court decision of R v Derbyshire Police Authority ex parte Wilson &
       Dalton (1989).

5.6    Home Office Circulars

      In Wilson and Dalton, the court considered the relevance of the Home
      Office circular then in effect in relation to the funding of police officers’
      costs, HOC 77/87. A copy of HOC 77/87 and the replacement circular
      HOC 4/1998 are attached at Appendix 8. The following principles
      emerged on the relevance of Home Office guidance:

5.6.1 Circulars do not have statutory force but are a good indication of the
      matters to be taken into account.

5.6.2 Lord Justice Gibson further commented

      “ that is not to say that in considering an application for reimbursement
      of costs by an officer, a Police Authority is necessarily limited to factors
      in the circular. ”

5.6.3 The Central principle in HOC 4/1998 is

      “ it is important that police officers should be able to carry out their
      duties in the confidence that their Police Authority will support them, if
      they act in good faith and exercise judgment reasonably."




                                                                                   6
5.7    Good faith and Reasonableness of Conduct

5.7.1 In drawing any conclusions as to good faith and reasonable exercise of
      judgment, the Authority must consider all relevant evidence including
      the findings of the various investigations and reports. It is also
      important that the Authority does not limit itself to consideration of good
      faith but also considers whether Mr Greenwood exercised his duties
      reasonably. If the Authority decided he acted unreasonably, however,
      it may still decide that other factors pointing to supporting the former
      officer outweigh the consideration (whilst it is difficult to envisage
      circumstances justifying supporting an officer who the Authority
      considers acted in bad faith).

5.7.2 In considering issues of good faith, and the reasonable exercise of
      judgment the following comment by Lord Justice Ralph Gibson in
       Wilson and Dalton is relevant:

       “ if, therefore, there was, on the part of the officer, negligence, ie failure
       to exercise such care as was reasonably to be required in the
       circumstances of an officer of his rank and experience, doing his job in
       the force, then in my view, the Police Authority is entitled to have
       regard to it if such negligence was connected to the subject matter of
       the legal proceedings, or to the causing of the legal proceedings to be
       taken, that it can fairly be regarded as a substantial cause of the
       incurring of the costs. I have no doubt that a Police Authority, if
       satisfied of good faith on the part of the officer, would normally act, and
       be pleased to act, on the central principle stated in the circular [ie good
       faith]; but the discretion is given to the Authority and it is impossible, in
       my view, to hold that, once good faith is established, a Police Authority
       must disregard clear evidence of negligence ora failure to “exercise
      judgment reasonably”. So to hold would mean that a Police Authority
       would be required to disregard substantial negligence, such that it
       could fairly be said that, although acquitted on bad faith, the officer had
       “brought the proceedings upon himself.”

5.7.3 The decision whether the evidence of such negligence in a particular
      case justifies withholding reimbursement, wholly or in part, is,
      therefore, entrusted to the Police Authority.


6.    Options for the Authority

6.1          Defer the application.

6.2   Grant the application subject to an assessment of the costs by the
      Authority’s solicitors and terms as to hourly rates, numbers of solicitors
      etc.

6.3   Award a proportion or a fixed amount of the costs.


                                                                                   7

     Dear Sirs

     We have been instructed by the South Yorkshire Police Authority to respond to your letter of 23
     April 1999.

     The Authority w ill, of course, consider your client's applications for financial assistance at the
     appropriate time. As no charges have been brought nor has your client been subpoened, it would
     be premature to deal with the applications.

    Should the position change, w e would invite you to notify the Authority,

          Dear Mr Greenwood

          R e g in a v. David Godfrey Duckenfield and Bernard Dean Murray

     . The Crown is considering whether to call senior officers «ho were connected with the
       Hillsborough disaster to give evidence ac the forthcoming trial o f the above named for
       manslaughter and misfeasance at the Leeds Crown Court beginning on 6* June.

         Previously, we had considered, in the exercise o f our public duties, that it would be
         inappropriate to call any such witnesses, but we have been pressed by the lawyers acting for
         the defence to reconsider. Mr William Clegg QC in particular has argued that we ought to
         call some o f those officers in the interests o f fairness.

         Accordingly we are looking at this again. We would request you to attend our ofSces here
         for interview, to answer rurTher questions, and if appropriate to sign a fresh witness
         statement. This is obviously the best place for such an interview, because we have all the
         papers here. We-shall pay reasonable travelling expenses.

             are approaching you at this stage because the judge rejected last week the application
         made by the defendants that the case should be dismissed on the ground o f abuse o f process.
         It might have been a waste o f time to have interviewed you. before.

          We wish ro serve all outstanding evidence on the defence by 15* March, as directed by the
         judge, Mr Justice Hooper. I should therefore be grateful if you could respond at your earliest
         convenience so that we can make an appointment.

         Would you please let me know whether, if you are called as a witness, you would require to
         be served with a witness summons.

         Yours sincerely

 Dear Sirs

 Re: Hillsborough: Roger Greenwood

 Thank you for your letter of 2nd of March 2000.

 As regards the three points which you raise, we reply as follows:

 1.         We are taking instructions to see whether there are any other sources of
           funding, but please proceed upon the basis that there are none. Are you
           suggesting that our Client's eligibility for funding from your Client wolf depend
           upon some form of means test?. Please clarify who, at the present time, your
           Clients- are funding in connection with this matter, and under what criteria that
           funding was agreed to.

2.         We enclose a copy of a letter from the Hillsborough Family Support Group of
           the 3rd of March 2000. We would have thought, with respect, that our Client’s
           need for legal advice is self evident.

3.         Our view is that it would be improper of us or our Client to ask for the
           payment of our Client's legal expenses by the Prosecution. Such a course of
           action could be criticised by the Trial Judge, and certainly could be raised by
           Defence Counsel in the presence of the jury.


                                                                          1>a:’-1s T<i: «M3 I « » w w j F ,« .* )» I *7 23 SV r t

 Dear Sir,

 R v. D uckenfield and Murray,

 Further to the letter o f yesterday, may I deal with other matters set out in your letter o f 29
 February.

 I am not in a position yet to say which, if any, officers from South Yorkshire will be called.
 You will note* that I indicated only that the Crown were “considering” whether to call senior
 officers.

 1 should perhaps explain that the case was committed for trial by a stipendiary magistrate in
 July 1999 on charges o f manslaughter and misfeasance. A submission o f no case to answer
 was rejected Until the committal, it was a private prosecution following information laid by
 me before the Magistrates Court in July 1998. N o w , o f course, as a trial on indictment, it is
 conducted in the name of the Crown.

 Various unsuccessful attempts have been made to quash the proceedings. An application was
 made by the defence in July 1998 to the Crown Prosecution Service to take over and
 discontinue the prosecution. It was rejected in December 1998. An application was made to
 the Divisional Court see k in g judicial review o f that decision. It failed in March 1999, except
 for a charge o f attempting to pervert the course o f justice, which the Divisional Court asked
 the CPS to reconsider.

 The magistrate rejected a submission that the prosecution was oppressive and an abuse o f
 process o f the court, as did Mr Justice Hooper at the Leeds Crown Court in February 2000.
 Count 4, which has been deleted from the indictment, was an allegation o f attempting to
 pervert the course o f justice in respect o f which the Attorney-General has issued a nolle
 prosequi.

 Count 5 refers to the alleged lies told by Mr Duckenfield to a number o f parties at the match
 that the crush had been caused by spectators breaking down the exit gates. That count has
 been added since committal, and we understand that there w ill be an application to quash it at

              Phone 0151 236 1919. Fax 0151 236 1936. E M ail info(3hfsg.orf
             1" Floor Central Buildings 41 I'forth John Street Liverpool L2 6RR
the outset o f the trial. However, even if it is quashed, the alleged lies w ill be relied on in
support o f the other charges.

The case is founded oa a number o f spectators present at the match, videos, documentary
material such as operational orders, and the oral and written evidence o f the defendants given
to the Taylor inquiry, and the oral evidence given by them to the Coroner.

The areas which we wish to question Mr Greenwood about are principally these;


        his knowledge, if any, o f crushing at previous semi-finals, particularly 1987 and 88;

        his knowledge as to why manpower levels were reduced from the 19S8 semi finals to
        the 19S9 semi-final;

        does he have any debriefing notes from previous semi finals;

        his knowledge o f relations between the South Yorkshire police and the football club,
        and their respective responsibilities for ensuring the safety o f spectators

        what practices existed for ca sin g o ff die tunnel under the west stand when the central
        pens were closed;

        his knowledge o f the “Freeman policy” referred to ia notes o f Chief Constable’s
        briefing at 4pm on I9tb April 1989 at which Mr Greenwood was present;

       the causes o f the disaster from his expert perspective;

       whether he made contemporaneous notes after the disaster;

       his knowledge, if any, o f a conspiracy by supporters to arrive late.

       when he made his first statement in writing about the disaster;

       whether, his statement was edited or vetted before it was finalised; if so, why and by
       whom;

       what he heard on 15thApril 1989 o f the allegation that supporters had broken down
       the gates;

       what Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray said about this allegation in internal South
       Yorkshire meetings after the disaster.

As w e indicated, w e wish to show Mr Greenwood various documents in the course o f an
interview, We are engaged upon wholly normal investigative activities, o f course, and do
hope that Mr Greenwood will be able to assist us. A s I said before, the defence have
positively asked us to call senior officers from the force, and we are now taking the
conventional course o f interviewing them about relevant matters and preparing the evidence
for trial.




                                                             HflVfiOS .u i 3 I

            Dear Sirs,

            Re: Hillsborough : Roger Greenwood

            We refer to our recent telephone conversation with Mr. Harlock, and we now are able to respond
            to the two specific points which you raised at the telephone.

            We have asked our client about his means. He assures us that he is not a man o f any great
            means, and describes himself as being o f "ordinary and average means" in keeping with what
            you might expect o f a retired police officer o f his grade.

            We have also looked further at the question o f the propriety o f requesting assistance witb legal
            costs from the prosecution. We have spoken to Counsel. We have also considered Regulation
            18 o f the Costs in Criminal Cases (General) Regulations 1986, set out at paragraph 6-75 o f
            Archbold 2000.

            Regulation 18 sets out clearly the expenses or allowances which a witness may be paid. Counsel
            agrees with our initial thought that it would be improper for a witness to have his legal costs paid
            by the prosecution.

            We understand that this matter will now go before the Police Authority on Friday, and we look
            forward to hearing from you with the outcome bearing in mind the urgency.

            Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

~Rt»: Hillsborough : Roger Greenwood

We write further to the above matter.

We assume that the Police Committee did not authorise the indemnity for our legal costs as
requested at their recent meeting, but you did inform us that if that were the situation it would
come up again before the Police Committee at its next meeting. Please confirm when that
meeting takes place and that indeed this matter will be on the agenda. A decision is clearly
urgent.

We enclose a copy o f our letter to Ann Adlington at HFSG.

 Your Ref: 2208/RJSF/JSS566-1


 Dear Mr Foster,

 The Crown v. Duckenfield and Murray

 Thank you for your letter o f I?"1March 2000. I am surprised to read that Mr Greenwood,
 whom you describe as your client, is not prepared to assist the Crown unless he has legal
 advice and representation. I had thought that you were providing him with that service.

 The criminal justicc system could not function if potential witnesses habitually asked to take
 legal advice when the Crown asked for th'cir assistance, and took the further 6tep o f asking
 others to provide money for such advice. I am sure that Mr Greenwood will have relied on
 many occasions in his police carccr on the willing co-opcralion o f members o f Ihc public in
 giving help and information without asking for someone else to pay for lawyers to advise
 them.

 I simply want to ask your client a few basic factual questions, I confirm that I would be
 prepared ro attend a meeting in London, However I feel that this would be impracticable,
 bccause I wish to question Mr Greenwood about documents, and w e have a voluminous
 collection o f papers here. If Mr Greenwood were to ask to see a particular document, or an
 answer he gave required me to rctcr to another docuincnL I would not be able to question
 him adequately in London. Counsel for the Crown regularly come here to work on the
 papers.




              Phone 0151 236 1919, Fax 01S1 236 1936. E Mail ivfo@hf9s.org
                                           ^+01512361936                    20/03 ‘00 11:04 0 :03
H F S G




     I am, however, prepared to pay for second class return rail feres for him and a lawyer from
     London, if such is essential, and. if necessary, an overnight .stay.

     At the inquest into the Hillsborough deaths, we understand that Mr Greenwood was one o f 6
     officers who were individually represented at. the expense o f the South Yorkshire Policc
     Authority. It is my understanding that there was a surplus o f funds at the end Of that inquest
     upon which Mr Greenwood may perhaps be able to call. The Authority is underwriting ihe
     entire costs o f the defencc on the grounds that to do so is neccssatry to maintain the morale o f
     the force. Irrespective o f the 1990-1 position, it may well provide the money that Mr
     Greenwood seeks, especially as the dcfcncc have actually asked us to call senior officers
     from the South Yorkshire force ut the trial so that they can cross-examine them as to
     important aspects o f the disaster.


     Failing that, I have reason to believe that the Superintendents Association may be willing to
     pay for, or at least subsidise, the costs o f Mr Greenwood’s representation. They undertook to
     pay for the costs; o f Mr Murray and M r Duckenfield in an application for judicial review Of
     the South Y orkshire Police Authority last year in March.

     I recognise that same witnesses find it distressing to recall and discuss the events o f the
     disaster. It may be that Mr Greenwood falls into that oatcgory. 1 can also tell you that 1 have
     made contact with iho Witness Support Service at the Crown Court at Leeds. They will be
     providing assistance and counselling to wititcsacs at the trial. Ir may be that they can also
     give general advice.

     Tf, however, Mr Greenwood cannot find anyone body to pay for his advice, and is unable to
     incur the costs himself, I should be grateful if he could nonetheless answer the questions I
     posed to him in my last letter o f 3"1March in writing, and as soon as possible.




    Yours sincerely,

        Dear Sirs,

        Re; Hillsborough : Roger Greenwood

        We refer to our recent correspondence, and more particularly to our telephone conversations with
        Mr. H&rlock. We understand that our client’s request for support in connection with his legal
        costs will be considered by the South Yorkshire Police Authority at its meeting bn 31 March.

        We reiterate our request from earlier correspondence that Mr. Greenwood should be entitled to
            ance from the Police Authority in connection with his legal costs.



        The situation so far as he is concerned is quite straight forward. He has retired, from the police
        service, and although he does have employment he describes himself as being a man of “average
        and normal means” for someone of his age who retired from the police service at his level.

        We are instructed that although the Superintendents Association were able to offer some
        fnancial assistance in the early stages, this was as a result of legal expenses insurance through
        the Association and the financial limit for that assistance has long sincc expired.

        We are also of course aware of the decision ofthe Divisional Court on 31“ March 1999 which
        made it clear that the Police Authority was entitled to offer financial support to former police
        officers in connection with legal expenses.

        We have kept you fully informed and indeed you have on youf file copies of the correspondence
        from Ann Adiington ofthe Hillsborough Family Support Group. We would ask the Authority to
        consider those letters, in particular those dated j March 2000 and 20'h March 2000

          In all the circumstance* it is clear tbat Mr. Greenwood should be entitled to legal representation
          and advice in connection with the questioning by the prosecution in this case, and this will
          involve not only the writer preparing himself by wading into the substantial documentation and
          viewing the videos, but thereafter advising Mr. Greenwood in connection with the proposed line
          of questioning, attending the interview with Mr. Greenwood, and thereafter advising him in
          connection with the statement so produced before Mr. Greenwood signs it. It might be that in
          due course further advice and work might be necessary on behalf of Mr. Greenwood, but at this
          stage support for his fees limited to the above only is requested.

          The prosecution have offered to pay the writer's expenses in connection with travelling to
          Liverpool. However ignoring this the overall time for the work required on Mr, Greenwood’s
          behalf, to include travelling, must be in the region of 25 hours. Our charging rate would be
          £175.00 per hour, plus VAT and properly incurred disbursements.

          It must be borne in mind that our client does not have any immunity from prosecution, and nor
          does he have even the protection in the case of a public prosecution with the discretion of the
          Crown Prosecution Scrvice, and ultimately the Director of Public Prosecutions or even the
          Attorney General. He would be entitled not to answer potentially incriminating questions, but
          clearly needs representation and advice upon what matters might or might not be potentially
          incriminating.

          We await to hear from you.


          Yours faithfully,

APPENDIX 2
Policing Arrangements
  47.      At the 1988 semi-final, policing had been under the control of Chief Superintendent Mole, then
Commander of F Division within whose area Hillsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 March 1989 when
the FA broached the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over command of F Division on 27 March to
Superintendent Duckenfield on the latter’s promotion to Chief Superintendent. Both were present at an initial
meeting on 22 March, but on 27 March Mr Mole bowed out and Mr Duckenfield took over. Under him were
Sector Commanders, all Superintendents with much experience of policing football matches at Hillsborough
and elsewhere. In particular, Superintendent Marshall was in charge of the area outside the Leppings Lane
entrance and the approaches to it. Superintendent Greenwood was in command inside the ground, but this
included the area between the turnstiles and the perimeter fence. They thereby swapped roles from the
previous year. Under Mr Duckenfield’s overall command were some 801 officers and men on duty at the
ground plus traffic officers and others from D Division to deal with the influx of supporters into the city centre.
In all, therefore, some 1,122 police were deployed for this match amounting to about 38 per cent of the total
South Yorkshire force. Included in the mounted section of 34 were officers from Liverpool and Nottingham to
assist respectively in marshalling their home supporters. The total at the ground was divided into serials
consisting usually of eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant and an Inspector. The serials were posted to duties
at various stations in and around the ground in three phases: before, during and after the match. All of this
was provided for in an Operational Order which followed closely the Order drawn up for the 1988 semi-final
and took into account the force’s “Standing Instructions for the Policing of Football Grounds”. The Order
described the duties of each serial at each phase. It was supplemented by oral briefings before and on the day of
the match.

Sheffield Wednesday’s Arrangements
  48. The Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and turnstile operators for duty on 15 April. The stewards
were briefed as to their duties on the morning of the match by police Inspectors and were allocated round the
ground. They wore yellow tabards. The Club’s control room, situated below the south stand, could
communicate by VHF radio with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with
screens in their control room showing all the turnstiles round the ground. A computerised counting system was
incorporated in the turnstiles. This flashed onto a screen in the Club control room the running total of
spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section. Thus, at the Leppings Lane end, there would be
separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (north stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and turnstiles A to G
(west terraces). When the total for any section was within 15 per cent of its permitted capacity a warning pulse
showed on the screen. For the west terracing that warning would occur when the numbers were within 15 per
cent of the total terrace capacity of 10,100. What the system could not do was monitor the distribution of fans
on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no warning therefore if one pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

Police Communications
  49. The nerve centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the south-west comer of the
ground between the south stand and pen 1 of the west terracing. The box is elevated and reached by a number
of steps. It has windows commanding views across the pitch and straight along the line of the west perimeter
fence. The box is very small and has seats for only three officers. Superintendent Murray was in control of it
and was advisor to Mr Duckenfield as he had been to Mr Mole the year before. Next to him sat Sergeant
Goddard who operated the radios. The third seat was for Police Constable Ryan who operated the telephone
and public address systems. At the back of the box stood Police Constable Bichard who was in control of the
police closed circuit television system operated by a row of consoles on a bench in front of him and behind the
three seated officers.

   50. There were five television screens showing views of five roving cameras fixed at high points on the
stands and directed both inside and outside the ground. There was also a master screen which flicked in
rotation from one camera view to another and which made a video recording. The cameras have a zoom
facility to close in on any point of interest. Specifically, there were good camera views of the west terracing, of
the Leppings Lane turnstiles and beyond them of Leppings Lane itself.

  51. The Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
ground and outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed under the police control box, to relay
music before the match, but it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through all
speakers or if appropriate to one area only.
                                               THE DISASTER

   71. The initial influx through gate C, augmented by entrants via the turnstiles, came through the tunnel
with great momentum. Fans spoke of being swept through, feet off the ground. The 1 in 6 gradient accelerated
their progress. Upon reaching the crowded pens, some wished to go back but were unable to do so. The new
arrivals found themselves pushed forward and the pressure became intense. At 2.54 pm, shortly after this
influx began, the teams came onto the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forward. Many were now
acutely uncomfortable and some were in distress. The mass seethed about but voluntary movement by any
individual was difficult; hands down could not be raised and some fans found it hard to breathe. Still the flow
continued through the tunnel causing further surges forward. There were shouts for help and for the gates to be
opened to the pitch. Police officers on the perimeter track did not immediately react. In the deafening noise
from chanting and shouting they did not at first recognise the problem. Realisation came at different moments
to different officers in different places.
   72. Gate 3 sprang open under the intense pressure from within. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
afterwards, it sprang again; officers tried to shut it. Those seeking to escape were urged and pushed back. Gate
4 was opened by a policeman who noticed the crushing. People began to spill out through it and were directed
to the wing pens where there was still ample room. Meanwhile, gate 4 was closed again and then re-opened. At
gate 3, a Constable, now alive to the crisis, followed strictly his written orders and radioed for permission to
open that gate. Receiving no reply, he took it upon himself to open it.
  73. Just before 3 pm, the match kicked off. At the same time, gate C, which had been closed at 2.57 pm,
was reopened and a steady trickle continued to enter through the tunnel.
   74. To escape the crush, fans began climbing the radial fences out of pens 3 and 4 into pens 2 and 5. Others
tried to get over the front perimeter fence but were at first turned back by police who feared a pitch invasion.
Near the front, fans, mostly youngsters, were weakened to the point of collapse and in some instances death but
they were held upright by pressure all round. Further back, most were so preoccupied with the pain of being
pressed against barriers and with breathing problems that they saw nothing of the game. But at the rear there
were many who, although cramped, were watching the football unaware of the distress at the front.
  75. At 3.04 pm, Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop end. There was a roar from the
Liverpool fans and at the same time a powerful surge forwards in pen 3. The several surges which occurred after
the influx from gate C carried the pressure down the pens towards the pitch. The force became such as to twist
and break two spans of a crush barrier towards the front of pen 3. The evidence does not establish with
certainty when this happened. Probably it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm. But I am sure it occurred after
the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen. When the barrier broke those whom it had
supported were projected towards the perimeter fence. Many fell and the involuntary rush of those behind
pressed them down. The crushing force was transmitted and dispersed so that all along the front of pen 3 fans
were pressed hard up against the low wall and the wire mesh of the fence above it.
  76. In pen 4 no barrier broke. Nevertheless those at the front were crushed against wall and fence. Further
back, two barriers were bowed and some individuals succumbed to the pressure around them.
   77. Surges on terraces are common. Usually, they go forward, then recede. Here, with the weight of
numbers, there was no receding. The pressure stayed and for those crushed breathless by it, standing or prone,
life was ebbing away. If no relief came in four minutes there would be irreversible brain damage; if longer,
death.
   78. In the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything amiss in pens 3 and 4 until the first
fans spilt out onto the perimeter track just before kick-off. Then, the officers in command assumed that there
was an attempted pitch invasion. They called up reserve serials waiting in the gymnasium and all available
officers elsewhere to go to the pitch. A request was made to HQ for dog handlers.
   79. Superintendent Greenwood, the Ground Commander, was by the players’ tunnel at the kick-off. He
noticed fans on the track and went to the west end behind the goal. As he approached, he did not think the pens
overcrowded until he was very close and saw those pressed against the fence. Even then, he thought the
situation “retrievable” if those higher up the pen relieved the pressure. He climbed on the wall below the fence
and signalled with both hands to those behind to move back. Other officers joined him. It was impossible.
Those fans who would have wished to comply were powerless to do so. Behind them, there were still many
unaware of the crisis, watching the game. The football continued to joyous shouting and singing round the rest
of the ground while those crushed and trapped slowly expired.

   80.   When Mr Greenwood’s signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to radio for the match to be
stopped. At first, his message was not received by control, so he signalled with his arms towards the control
box. Mr Duckenfield sent Mr Murray down from the box to have the match stopped via the linesman, the
agreed emergency drill. Before he could do so, Mr Greenwood ran over the pitch to the referee who stopped the
game. It was 5/2 minutes past 3.




                                                      14
own accord when they saw the casualties and the ambulance and realised the gravity of the situation. Many
fans also worked prodigiously in attempts to revive the dead and the dying, in some cases their own relatives
and friends. Artificial respiration, mouth to mouth respiration and cardiac massage were applied by the skilled
and the unskilled but usually in vain. Those capable of survival mostly came round of their own accord. The
rest were mostly doomed before they could be brought out and treated.
   90. There was an urgent need to get casualties off the pitch and to hospital. There were six stretchers in the
first aid room and three in the St John’s ambulance. They were quickly brought into use. Then the fans
improvised by tearing down the hoardings around the edge of the pitch and against the stands so that lengths of
board could be used as stretchers. Improvising in this way, parties of fans and police ran repeatedly the length
of the pitch bearing casualties to the north-east comer. A number were dead on arrival there.

In the Control Room
  91. Mr Duckenfield stayed in the control room. Chief Inspector McRobbie was there in civilian clothes as
an observer. Mr Duckenfield sent him down to the track to tell a policewoman at gate 1 to admit those
displaced from the centre pens. Mr Duckenfield did not realise there were injuries until he saw someone laid
on the pitch. Even then, he did not realise the nature of the problem or its scale.
   92. Mr Murray returned from his attempt to stop the match and Mr Duckenfield sent him down again to
clear the pitch and assess the situation. A message was broadcast requesting fans to clear the pitch. This was
because Mr Duckenfield could not from the control room see clearly what was happening for the milling and
increasing numbers.
   93. The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations), Mr Jackson, had attended the match in civilian clothes as
a guest of the Club. He came from his seat in the south stand to ask what had happened. Mr Duckenfield was
unable to say; he did not tell Mr Jackson that the exit gates had been opened on his authority. Mr Jackson went
down to the pitch to discover the situation.
   94. At 3.06 pm Mr Duckenfield, still primarily concerned about public order, caused a message to be sent
to Headquarters asking for Operation Support. That was a call for all available additional police resources to
come to the ground to strengthen the police presence.
   95. Mr Jackson was told by Mr Greenwood that there were casualties and returned immediately to control
to make sure emergency services were alerted. Meanwhile, Mr Murray had seen the plight of those behind the
fence. He radioed to control that a fleet of ambulances was required. He also asked for a Tannoy broadcast to
those in the pens to move back but there is no clear evidence that it was made.
  96. Only when Mr Duckenfield received the request for a fleet of ambulances did he realise the nature and
gravity of the situation. Then, supported by Mr Jackson, he caused messages to be sent converting Operation
Support into calls for the Major Disaster Plan.

No Information
  97. Apart from the message to clear the pitch and the belated call for medical assistance about 3.30 pm, no
information or advice was broadcast on the public address system. Mr Duckenfield feared that the crowd
might turn hostile or might all attempt to leave together thereby hampering the emergency services if they were
given information about what had happened. The result was that apart from those close enough at the west end
to see the terrible truth for themselves, the majority of the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially
Nottingham supporters in the Kop, still thought there had been a pitch invasion or other misbehaviour by
Liverpool fans. They continued singing and chanting incongruously. This infuriated some Liverpool fans who
were already distraught. A few began to run towards the Kop end. The police feared violence might result on
top of the existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large number of officers to form a line across the
width of the pitch at the Kop end and advance up to the halfway line sweeping any Liverpool fans back as they
moved. There the line stood as an insurance against disorder but doing nothing. Other officers were posted to
the perimeter track facing the north stand for the same purpose. To those distressed and distraught who
wanted urgent action, this large contingent of passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against the police
intensified.
Misinformation
 98. At about 3.15 pm, Mr Graham Kelly, Chief Executive of the FA, Mr Kirton also of the FA and Mr
Graham Mackrell, Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday, went to the control room for information. Mr
Duckenfield told them he thought there were fatalities and the game was likely to be abandoned. He also said a

                                                         16
 any part in the South Yorkshire Police plans. Had the latter been informed of the history contained in the
 dossier and summarised above it may well have influenced police strategy in Leppings Lane.

   220. There is presently a proposal that a national computer-based police football intelligence system should
 be set up to make the necessary information readily available.

 Police Intelligence on the Day
   221. The unfilled space in the Liverpool areas inside the ground, the figures for entry available from the
 Club’s computer and observations on the video screen should have enabled those in the control room to
 monitor the numbers arriving and still to arrive at Leppings Lane. Radio contact with mobile (Tango) patrols
 detailed to monitor licensed premises in the district could have indicated the numbers still to come. But at 2.30
 pm when Mr Murray told Mr Duckenfield they would “get them all in by 3 o’clock” he seems not to have
 appreciated that in addition to those visible at the turnstiles there were many more still to come. Certainly, Mr
 Marshall outside the turnstiles was not told and could not otherwise have known that there were still many
 Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.

 Mr Marshall and Mr Greenwood
   222. The division of command between these two officers did not help. Mr Marshall was in charge of the
 serials outside the perimeter gates in the Leppings Lane area and in the roads beyond. In practice he operated
 inside and just outside the turnstile area. Mr Greenwood’s area as Ground Commander extended from the
 pitch to the perimeter gates. He in fact stationed himself near the players’ tunnel. He was wholly unaware of the
 growing problems at the turnstiles and was in no position to exercise control over his officers who were under
 pressure there. No-one in the control room thought to tell him.

 Control Lost
   223. In the result, the large concentration of arrivals from 2.30 pm to 2.40 pm pressed unrestrained into
 the turnstile area through the perimeter gates which were fully open. When that area was full, later arrivals
 swelled the crowd out to the forecourt and even into the road. As already recounted, the foot officers at the
 turnstiles became trapped and endangered and retired through the turnstiles. The mounted officers could not
 operate amidst such a dense crowd in a confined space. They came out of the turnstile area. There were then
 the belated attempts to close the perimeter gates and prevent more fans joining the mass until it had a chance to
 diminish through the turnstiles; still later the attempt to put a cordon of horses across the entrance.

   224. Despite knowledge of the difficult layout, the very large number of fans to be got through so few
 turnstiles and the tendency of fans to arrive in the last half hour, no contingency plans were made to avoid a
 crush such as occurred. Even on the day, the need to close Leppings Lane to traffic before 2.30 pm and the
 other available intelligence already summarised, should have prompted those in command to take precautions
 against such a crush. If some of the perimeter gates had been closed and cordons of mounted and foot officers
 had been placed a little distance from those gates, the flow of fans into the turnstile area could have been
 controlled before that area became engulfed. It was the crush itself which produced the frustration and the
 panic and brought out the worst in those who had drunk too much. Earlier control of entry would have
 prevented the crush and maintained the good mood which had prevailed until 2.30 pm.

   225. It should moreover have been obvious by 2.40 pm, if not earlier, that a large part of the crowd could
 not be admitted until well after 3 pm. Had a decision to postpone kick-ofTbeen made and announced much of
 the frustration and with it the impetus crushing the crowd would have been reduced. A combination of
 controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off would probably have obviated the need to open the gates.

   Postponement of Kick-off
     226. At various stages in his evidence, Mr Duckenfield gave three accounts of why he thought it too late to
   postpone kick-off. Once it was that one of the teams had already come onto the pitch. Then it was that a group
   of photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the teams were coming out. Finally, he did not
   know why he thought the teams were coming out. They did not in fact come onto the pitch until 2.54 pm, two
   minutes after gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton had asked for a postponement of kick-off before
   gate C was opened. It should not, however, have needed a police Constable in the thick of the crowd (and there
   were others of like mind) to think of postponing the kick-off. The need should have been clear in the control
r; room.

   227. The truth was that Mr Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed with Mr Murray.
  Kick-off would not be postponed unless there were some major cause for delayed arrivals eg a jam on the

                                THE BLUNDER ON OPENING THE GATES

   229. The decision to order the opening of the gates was not accompanied or followed by any other order to
deal with the consequences. When gate C was opened, a steady stream of about 2,000 fans poured through it
over some five minutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground somewhere and unless they were diverted
their likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. No warning was issued from the control
room that the gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not alerted. Neither the Club control room
nor the Chief Steward at the Leppings Lane end was warned. Not even Mr Greenwood, the Ground
Commander, was informed. From 2.47 pm when Mr Marshall made his first request until 2.52 pm when Mr
Duckenfield acceded to it, there were five minutes in which orders could have been given as to how the influx
was to be absorbed. It was not done. In evidence, Mr Duckenfield began by saying that no officer made any
wrong decision but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. He said he did not consider where the people
would go when the gate opened. Even after it opened, when he could see the influx on the television screen, no
order was given to steer the fans to the wing pens. Mr Duckenfield said it did not cross his mind to detail
officers on the concourse to shut off the tunnel. Those officers could not have known from their position how
full pens 3 and 4 were. That was a matter for the control room to monitor from its own observations and using
intelligence from around the ground.

  230. Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 pm, the tunnel should have been closed off whether gate C was to
be opened or not. The exercise was a simple one and had been carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was
for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately, the
1988 closure seems to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time. It did not figure in the
debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 1989.

  231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where there was a view of the
pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If orders had been given to that effect
when gate C was opened, the fans could have been directed to the empty areas of the wings and this disaster
could still have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the first magnitude.

   232. Significantly, when permission was given to open gate A, Mr Duckenfield did order serials to go to that
part of the concourse to monitor the influx towards the north stand. He did this because he feared that if fans
went to the north stand without tickets, they would not get seats and, there being no perimeter fences at the
north side, they might invade the pitch. This illustrates again the preoccupation with avoiding pitch invasion
as against safety and the risks of overcrowding. Because those entering through gate C could not get onto the
pitch, it was not thought necessary to alert officers to monitor them. The possibility of overcrowding simply
was not considered.

                                  THE CRUSHING NOT RECOGNISED

Observation from Control Room ; '
   244. As the stream from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in the control room could be expected
to keep a close watch on pens 3 and 4. They had a direct view of them from an elevated position through their
window. Although they had no field-glasses, there was the zoom facility on the TV camera. The radio was by
then working again and although reception was difficult due to crowd noise and possibly excessive air traffic
on channel 25, attempts could have been made to alert officers on the perimeter track to watch for
overcrowding and report their observations. In the event, pens 3 and 4 became more and more crowded, surges
took place, fans were showing and signalling distress. None of this was seen or recognised in the control room.

Officers on the Track
   245. The 20 officers detailed to the perimeter track were distributed round the pitch so that some five
officers were at the west end. Their written instructions made no reference to the avoidance or detection of
overcrowding. The same applied to the officers in the west stand. Mr Greenwood admitted that his oral
briefings also contained no mention of monitoring the pens for overcrowding.

   246. The Operational Order for 1988 had instructed officers to forbid anyone “access to the track from the
terraces without the consent of a senior officer (except to receive medical attention)”. At the end of the 1988
semi-final, there was a minor pitch invasion. Accordingly, that prohibition was emphasised in the 1989
Operational Order by being put into capital letters. The combination of no instructions as to overcrowding and
a strong prohibition on opening the gates was likely to make police recognition of crushing slow and their
response reluctant. Small wonder that the growing pressure and congestion between 2.50 pm and 2.59 pm
went unheeded or certainly unremedied. Even when officers recognised there was a problem, the rule required
consent of a senior officer before a gate could be opened.

  247. “Senior officer” meant an officer of Inspector rank or higher. The Inspector in charge of the 20 officers
on the track was Mr Darling. He stationed himself by the players’ tunnel, the most central position for
supervising his men. In evidence he said:

  “I would only take action if I thought crowding had got to such a stage that the fans were in danger. I’d then
  inform ground control and I would expect someone deployed to the back of the stand.”

  That underlines the inhibition against opening perimeter gates. So did the evidence of one Constable who
said it had been so drummed into officers not to open the gates that when he saw distress in pen 4, he “debated”
with himself before opening the gate, thinking: “If I’m wrong, I’m going to get a right bollocking for this.”
Naturally, one would hope that common sense and humanity would make some officers cut through the rules
and open a gate if fans were clearly in distress.

  248. This is what happened, but not until officers recognised the distress and even then not immediately.
Hence, gates 3 and 4, having been opened, were shut again before they were finally opened and at first those
seeking to climb out over the fence were pushed back. This reaction of the police did not go on for as long as
some witnesses believed. They probably misinterpreted the hand movements from Mr Greenwood and others
aimed at persuading fans to move back and relieve the pressure as attempts to stop those climbing out at the
front.

  249. Nevertheless, there was a period during which the failure to recognise the problem and the inhibition
against tackling it caused vital time to be lost.

                                     THE RESPONSE OF THE POLICE

The Officers in Command
   250. Even when realisation of the problem came to officers on the track, it was some minutes before it
 reached the control room. When spectators first appeared on the track, the immediate assumption in the
control room was that a pitch invasion was threatened. This was unlikely at the beginning of a match. It
became still less likely when those on the track made no move towards the pitch. 'Mr Motson, the BBC
commentator, recognised and said, well before the match was stopped, that the trouble seemed to be
overcrowding and not misbehaviour. Still, the assumption to the contrary persisted in the control room. Until
 Mr Murray radioed for a fleet of ambulances, about 3.06 pm, Mr Duckenfield continued to treat the incident
as a threat to the pitch and to public order. The message calling up all available officers mentioned a pitch
invasion. Operation Support was initiated and dog handlers were requested.
   251. Until Chief Superintendent Nesbit arrived, there was no effective leadership either from control or on
the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts. No orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel and relieve
pressure. Some officers did this on their own initiative. Apart from the Tannoy request to clear the pitch, no
attempt was made to clear and mark off a casualty area where first-aid could be given without hindrance by
fans and photographers milling about between the bodies. There was no co-ordination of the early provision of
first-aid or of stretcher parties or of the rescue effort through gates 3 and 4. No request for help was broadcast to
doctors and nurses in the crowd until about 3.29 pm when it was too late. Probably, there was little that could
have been achieved in most cases however soon doctors had been summoned, but there were marginal cases s ~~\
where earlier attention might have made a difference.
   252. The plight of those behind the fencing and the existence of injuries were known to officers at the scene
from 3 pm. But the Major Disaster Plan was not started until 3.06 pm at earliest when the ambulance service
was called. No request for cutting gear or for the fire brigade was made until 3.13 p.m. Again, it is unlikely ti&t
these services could have saved lives if they had been called promptly, but it is possible.                      -
Police on the Pitch
   253. Despite the initial lack of leadership, many officers did all they humanly could to rescue and revive the
victims. Many supporters who gave evidence paid tribute to these efforts. It is also fair to say that the number
of officers who could at first be usefully involved at the two open gates was necessarily limited.
   254. Chief Superintendent Nesbit’s action in deploying a line of officers across the middle of the pitch has
already been mentioned. I can well understand the resentment it caused. However, the police assertion that a
rush by some fans towards the Kop end raised fears of conflict are well borne out by the video tape. In my
judgement, Chief Superintendent Nesbit was well justified in using some of the many officers called up
pursuant to Operation Support to prevent possible violence. To have had open fighting in a ground where
some 90 spectators already lay dead would have been an unthinkable and obscene development.
Fans on the Pitch
   255. Many fans who escaped onto the pitch alive were in a state of collapse or close to it. Most of those who
retained their strength strove magnificently to assist the victims. They helped pull them clear; they helped with
first-aid; they helped carry the improvised stretchers.                                                           51 /~
   256. There were fans, however, who were distraught, angry, drunk, or all three. Their conduct in abusing, ~
assaulting and spitting at the police was disgraceful, the more so since earlier police failures had little to do
with those officers now doing their best for the injured. In addition, there were abuse and assaults on
ambulance men and firemen in the course of their rescue work. This was probably because their similar
uniforms caused them to be mistaken for police. However, although the abuse was widespread, the number of
assaults and spittings was on the evidence comparatively small. In deploring them, one must recognise the
uniquely horrifying experience which those responsible had just suffered and were still suffering.
False Reports
   257. Before this Inquiry began, there were stories reported in the press, and said to have emanated from
police officers present at the match, of “mass drunkenness”. It was said that drunken fans urinated on the
police while they were pulling the dead and injured out, that others had even urinated on the bodies of the dead
and stolen their belongings. Not a single witness was called before the Inquiry to support any of those
allegations although every opportunity was afforded for any of the represented parties to have any witness
called whom they wished. As soon as the allegations I have mentioned were made in the press, Mr Peter
 Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, made a dignified statement dissociating himself from such grave
 and emotive calumnies. Those who made them, and those who disseminated them, would have done better to
 hold their pease.

                                                   POLICE

Choice of Ends by the Police •
   272. There was much bitterness amongst Liverpool supporters that they had to make do again for the
second year with the Leppings Lane end. But, cogent as their complaints were, they amounted to reasons for
choosing a different ground altogether. Given Hillsborough as the venue, I think the police were right to
allocate the sections of the ground as they did. The direction of arrival and the need for segregation made it
sensible and to reverse the 1988 arrangements would have made for confusion. As with choice of venue, I do
not consider choice of ends was causative of the disaster. Had it been reversed, the disaster could well have
occurred in a similar manner but to Nottingham supporters.
Police Planning
  273. The Operational Order for 1989 left much unsaid. Apart from the lack of any provision for late or
congested arrivals, or any provision for the avoidance of overcrowding on the terraces, there was a number of
other omissions. For example, there was no specific deployment of officers to man the perimeter gates. The
Order did not detail the duties of the mounted officers deployed at the Leppings Lane entrance, who included
Liverpool officers to assist in marshalling their own fans. The duties of Superintendents (especially Mr
Greenwood and Mr Marshall) were not defined so as to achieve clarity and efficiency. By an oversight, the
provision requiring mobile (Tango) patrols to assist the emergency services was omitted from the text.
   274. The 1988 Order was never substantially reviewed save to reduce the number of officers deployed in
shopping areas and to emphasise in capital letters the embargo on fans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
with the 1988 event led to complacency. That some thought the pens overfull in 1988 and that the tunnel was
closed off on that occasion did not figure in or influence the plan for 1989.
   275. Mr Duckenfield was promoted and put in charge of F Division only 21 days before this semi-final. The
pre-planning was already in progress under Mr Mole who had been in command both in 1987 and in 1988. It
might have been wiser to have left Mr Mole in charge of this operation. On the other hand, it is quite
understandable that Mr Duckenfield should have been expected to take command of events in his Division
from the date of his promotion. In view of his lack of experience at Hillsborough and of a semi-final match,
however, it was imperative that he be fully briefed and that he should also brief himself.
   276. He was not informed of the crushing incident in 1981 nor did he make inquiries which would have
revealed it. He did not know the arrangement as between Club and police for monitoring the Leppings Lane
terraces. He did not visit and tour the ground before approving the Operational Order. Although he attended a
match on 2 April, there was only a small crowd present and he left control of the game to the Superintendents.
Policing on the Day
  277. One of the regrettable features of the football scene as it has developed is the enormous expenditure of
money, time and effort in employing large numbers of police all over the country to guard against the sort of
disorder and misbehaviour which have become endemic. Police management of a game of football has become
a military operation. The problems faced and the responses received must be disheartening and may have
tended to harden police attitudes to supporters in general.
  278. It is fair to state that over many years the South Yorkshire Police have given excellent service to the
public. They have handled crowd problems sensitively and successfully at a large number of football games
including major matches, during strikes in the coal industry and the steel industry, and in other contexts.
Unfortunately, their policing on 15 April broke down in the ways already described and, although there were
other causes, the main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control.
   279. In all some 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I must report that for the most
part the quality of their evidence was in inverse proportion to their rank. There were many young Constables
who as witnesses were alert, intelligent and open. On the day, they and many others strove heroically in ghastly
circumstances aggravated by hostility to rescue and succour victims. They inspired confidence and hope.
  280. By contrast, with some notable exceptions, the senior officers in command were defensive and evasive
witnesses. Their feelings of grief and sorrow were obvious and genuine. No doubt those feelings were
intensified by the knowledge that such a disaster had occurred under their management. But, neither their
handling of problems on the day nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be
expected of their rank.

                                                      49
  281. Mr Duckenfield leant heavily on Mr Murray’s experience. Between them they misjudged the build-up
at the turnstiles and did little about it until they received Mr Marshall’s request to open the gate. They did not,
for example, check the turnstile figures available from Gub control or check with Tango units as to the
numbers still to come. They did not alert Mr Greenwood to the situation at the fringe of his area of command.-
They gave no instructions as to the management of the crowd at Leppings Lane. Inflexibly they declined to
postpone kick-off.                                                                                        •    . <»

  282. When Mr Marshall’s request came, Mr Duckenfield’s capacity to take decisions and give orders
seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the opening of the gates, he failed to give necessary
consequential orders or to exert any control when the disaster occurred. He misinterpreted the emergence of
fans from pens 3 and 4. When he was unsure of the problem, he sent others down to “assess the situation”
rather than descend to see for himself. He gave no information to the crowd.

   283. Most surprisingly, he gave Mr Kelly and others to think that there had been an inrush due to Liverpool
fans forcing open a gate. This was not only untruthful. It set off a widely reported allegation against the
supporters which caused grave offence and distress. It revived against football fans, and especially those from
Liverpool, accusations of hooliganism which caused reaction not only nationwide but from Europe too. I can
only assume that Mr Duckenfield’s lack of candour on this occasion was out of character. He said his reason for
not telling the truth was that if the crowd became aware of it there might be a very hostile reaction and this
might impede rescue work. He did not wish to divulge what had happened until he had spoken to a senior
officer. However, reluctance to tell Mr Kelly the truth did not require that he be told a falsehood. Moreover,
although Assistant Chief Constable Jackson was at hand, Mr Duckenfield did not disclose the truth to him
until much later.

  284. The likeliest explanation of Mr Duckenfield’s conduct is that he simply could not face the enormity of
the decision to open the gates and all that flowed therefrom. That would explain what he said to Mr Kelly, what
he did not say to Mr Jackson, his aversion to addressing the crowd and his failure to take effective control of the
disaster situation. He froze.

The Police Case at the Inquiry
  285. It is a matter of regret that at the hearing, and in their submissions, the South Yorkshire Police were not
prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in what occurred. Mr Duckenfield, under pressure of
cross-examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But, that apart, the police
case was to blame the fans for being late and drunk, and to blame the Club for failing to monitor the pens. It was
argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate C but was due to barrier 124a being
defective. Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been learnt. It would
have been more seemly and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.

RESOLVED - That the report be noted at this stage.
106   CHARGES FOR POLICE ON LOAN TO PRIVATE EMPLOYERS

A joint report of the Chief Constable and Clerk and Financial Officer referred
to the charges for special police services other than the policing of football
matches, which had last been increased for the South Yorkshire Police from 1
November 1989.

The Authority, on 3 April 1987, had agreed to continue the practice of adopting
the standard hourly rates of charge as set by the West Yorkshire Metropolitan
Police and applied throughout the No.2 (North East) Region. New rates of
charges, taking account of the September 1990 Police Pay Award had been
calculated by West Yorkshire and were being implemented from 1 November 1990.

RESOLVED - That, with effect from 1 January 1991, the revised hourly rate and
scale of charges for vehicles and horses be applied to users of special police
services except football clubs.
107     LIST OF OUTSTANDING AND/OR REQUESTED REPORTS

A joint report of the Clerk and Financial Officer and the Chief Constable was
submitted on outstanding and/or requested reports.

RESOLVED - That th e r e p o r t be n o ted .
 108     EXCLUSION OF PUBLIC AND PRESS

RESOLVED - That under Section 100(A)(4) of the Local Government Act 1972, the
public be excluded from the meeting for the following items of business on the
grounds that they involve the likely disclosure of exempt information as defined
in paragraphs 8 and 12 of Part 1 of Schedule 12A of the Act.
109    SCENES OF CRIME LABORATORY - DRYING CABINETS

RESOLVEDs-

1 That approval be given to a capital estimate of £12,000 for the provision of
large drying cabinets in the Scenes of Crime Laboratories.
 2 That approval be given to the invitation of competitive tenders from the
firms now named.
110    FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS *‘

Further to minute 90 of the meeting of the Authority on 16 November 1990 further
consideration was given to the previous decision not to provide financial
support for legal proceedings to the six officers who so applied in connection
with the Hillsborough Disaster.

The Authority considered a report of the Clerk and Financial Officer and a
report by the Chief Constable.

The Authority considered the most recent legal advice available to them as well
as judicial authority on the entitlement to reimbursement of such costs in the
light of Home Office Circular 77/87.

RESOLVED:-

1 That the applications for financial assistance in connection with legal
proceedings from the officers now named be approved in relation to the inquest
into the disaster.
 2 That the level of representation be agreed with the Clerk and Financial
Officer but generally is to extend to solicitor and Junior Counsel but not
Leading Counsel.
 3 That in relation to those officers of Superintendent rank who have insurance
policies covering costs of this nature, the Authority meet their legal costs
only once such insurance cover is exhausted, except that they each be allowed to
retain £10,000 from such insurance for legal representation in connection with


  anv disciplinary proceedings, such retained sum to be repaid to the Police
  Authority either in whole or in part if disciplinary proceedings are not taken
  or their individual representation amounts to less than £10,000.

               when it was realised that spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal
               had bean severely crushed. As a result, 96 people died and over 400 received
               hospital treatment.

                made public. He found that the immediate cause c f the gross ovar-crowding
                which had taken place, and thus of the disaster, had been the failure to cut off
                access to the central pens behind the goal (which were already over full)
                when gate C was opened. He found also a number of contributing factors
                including the Club's "confused and inadequate signs and ticketing", police
                planning, police operations on the day, "the presence of an unruly minority
                who had drunk too much" and interaction of parties responsible for safety
                issues. In respect of police operations on the day, Lord Justice Taylor in his
                Interim Report, said (at paragraph 278)


                "although there were other causes, the main reason for the disaster was the
                failure of police control''.

                manslaughter, by criminal negligence, to the Director of Public Prosecutions

                matter should be subject of a criminal investigation. Mr Dear, Chief Constable
                of West Midlands Police, was invited to undertake this investigation. He was
                also asked that if he discovered any matters against the Police (Discipline)
                Regulations, he should enquire into them on behalf of South Yorkshire Police.

        3.8    30 November 1989: Peter Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police,
               offered in conjunction with insurers to open negotiations with representatives
               of the bereaved to resolve all bona fide civil claims for compensation without
               having to await the outcome of legal hearings.

        3.9    15 December 19S9: Agreement reached with representatives of the bereaved
               for settlement of civil actions without a decision as to liability.

                  that there was insufficient evidence upon which a prosecution for

                  officer in the South Yorkshire Police, or any other person.

                  the discipline charge against Superintendent Murray, as it would be
                  inappropriate and urq’ust to pursue the charge against him alone, in the
                  absence of his superior officer. Sometime thereafter, Superintendent Murray

           3./.9 30 Tune 1997: The Home Secretary made an oral statement to the House of
                  Commons during the course of which he stated:

                                  "Madam Speaker, my Department, the office of the Attorney
                                  General and the Crown Prosecution Service have considered
                                  very carefully all the evidence which has beer, put forward in
                                  recent months.

                                  The Director of Public Prosecutions has taken the view that the
                                  material sc far presented to her would not justify fresh
                                  criminal investigations. The then Attorney General also took
                                  the view, again on the material presented to him, that any
                                  application to the High Court for a new inquest would not
                                  have any realistic prospect of succeeding.

                                  Nonetheless, I am acutely conscious that the families of those
                                  who died at Hillsborough and many others including Hon
                                  Members of this House are very concerned that unresolved
                                  issues remain. I am determined to go as far as I can to ensure
                                  that no matter of significance is overlooked and that we do not

                              examination of the evidence.

                              I can therefore tell the House today that the Attorney General,
                              the Director of Public Prosecutions and I have agreed that it is
                              in die public interest that there should be an independent
                              scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any new
                              evidence relating to the disaster which was not previously
                              available. We are appointing Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a
                              senior Lord Justice cf the Court of Appeal, for that purpose".

        3.30   18 February 199S: Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny Report was presented
               to the House of Commons. He concluded:

        3.30.1 None of the evidence he was asked to consider added anything significant to
               the evidence which was available to Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry or to the
               inquests;

        3.30.2 There was no basis upon which there should be a further judicial inquiry or a
               reopening of Lord Taylor's inquiry;

        3.30.3 There was no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court cr for the
               Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988; and

        3.30.4 There was no material which should be put before die Director of Public
               Prosecutions cr the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to
               reconsider the decisions they had already taken.

        3.30.5 18 February 1998: The Home Secretary announced in the House that he, the
               Attorney General and the DPP had very carefully considered Lord Justice
               Stuart-Smith's report, and said "we have no reason to doubt his conclusions".
               Following publications of the Scrutiny Report, Trevor Hicks, the Chairman of
               the HFSG announced that he was disappointed with the Scrutiny's
               conclusions and that the HFSG were considering private prosecutions.

        3.30 6 27 February 1998: The Authority resolved to authorise the Oerk and
               Treasurer to consider applications for financial assistance from serving and
               retired officers in respect of possible criminal proceedings arising from the
               Hillsborough Stadium disaster.

                             Dear Sir

                             Re: Hillsborough Disaster

                             We have been approached by Mr Roger Greenwood o f _____________________
                                                    who is a retired Chief Superintendent with South Yorkshire
                             Police who was on duty at Hillsborough on the date of the disaster.

                             In view of recent developments our client feels that he is in need of legal representation.
                             I understand from him that the Police Authority have agreed to indemnify him in
                             connection with his reasonable legal costs.

                             Please confirm that the Authority will be responsible for such reasonable costs.

                             I await to hear from you.

                            Yours sincerely

I write with reference to your letter dated 7 July 1998 addressed to Assistant Chief
Constable Ian Daines, in which you ask for confirmation that the Authority will meet your
client’s reasonable legal costs in connection with such legal representation that he may
require as a result of recent developments.

Members of the Authority were advised at a meeting held on 27 February last that there
was a prospect of the Hillsborough Family Support Group issuing private prosecution
proceedings against individuals involved in policing the Hillsborough Stadium on the day
of the Hillsborough Disaster. Recognising that the likelihood of such proceedings may
result in a number of requests for financial support towards the costs of legal
representation, and that such requests ought to be dealt with as expeditiously as possible,
the Authority resolved to authorise myself as Clerk and Treasurer to deal with any such
requests on their behalf in accordance with Home Office guidelines.

in pursuance of the authority delegated to me, I have considered your client’s request and
I wish to inform you that the Authority will meet such reasonable expenses as your client
may incur on legal costs in defending private prosecution proceedings instituted by the
Hillsborough Family Support Group.

Yours faithfully



W J Wilkinson
Clerk and Treasurer

Dear Sirs

Further to my letter of 23 July 1998, I have to inform you that following receipt of
representations and in the light of Counsel’s advice, the Authority’s decisions will be
subject to review. Given that prosecutions have not been issued against your client to
date, I would not envisage that this presents immediate problems. In the event of
proceedings being issued, your client’s application can be considered afresh.

Yours faithfully

      Dear Mr. Wilkinson,

      Re: Hillsborough : Financing of Defence Costs

      Further to your letter of 13th January 1999, I have of course read with interest the Law
      Report of the decision of the Divisional Court of the High Court on 31st March.

      In those circumstances I should be grateful if you would please give my client the
      comfort to know that in the event that he were to be prosecuted then the Police
      Authority would indemnify him for costs.

      He would also like to have some indication whether the Authority will also indemnify him
      in the event that he becomes involved in some other capacity, for example as a witness.

      I await to hear from you. Please note the slight change in my firm’s name.

          22-25, 31 MARCH 1999

          Police - Police authority - Powers o f police authority - Private prosecutions being
          brought against retired police officers fo r actions in course o f duty - DPP refusing to
          intervene in proceedings - Officers seeking judicial review o f DPP’s decision - Police
          authority refusing to fu n d judicial review proceedings and officers’ defences to private
      d   prosecutions - W hether police authority having power to fu n d legal representation o f
          police officers-Local Government Act 1972, s 111(1) -Police Act 1996, s 6(1).

        The applicants, two retired senior police officers in the South Yorkshire force, had
        been on duty during the 1989 Hillsborough disaster in which many persons lost
      e their lives. In 1998 a representative o f the victims’ families brought private
        prosecutions against them for manslaughter and wilful neglect o f duty, and the
        South Yorkshire Police Authority (the SYPA) agreed to fund their defences. The
        applicants subsequently asked the Director o f Public Prosecutions (the DPP) to
        exercise his statutory power to take over the conduct o f the proceedings with a
        view to discontinuing them. The DPP rejected that application, and the
      f applicants sought to challenge his decision through judicial review proceedings.
        They asked the SYPA to fund those proceedings, just as it had already agreed to
        fund their defences to the private prosecutions. However, after taking legal
        advice, the SYPA concluded that it had no power to provide them with financial
        assistance in respect o f either the judicial review proceedings or the private
        prosecutions. The applicants together with the Chief Constable challenged that
        decision in further judicial review proceedings, contending, inter alia, that police
        authorities could fund officers’ legal representation by using the ancillary power
        in s l l l ( l ) a o f the Local Government Act 1972 to support their general function
        under s 6 (l)b o f the Police Act 1996. The SYPA contended that s 111(1) o f the
        1972 Act could be used only to support the powers expressly conferred on police
      ^ authorities, and that s 6(1) o f the 1995 Act conferred no such powers.

        Held - A police authority was empowered by s 111(1) o f the 1972 Act to fund
        officers in criminal and judicial review proceedings. Such a conclusion flowed
        from a consideration o f the interlocking roles o f chief constable, Secretary o f State
      j and police authority under the 1996 Act, which established that the ancillary power
        provided by s 111(1) o f the 1972 Act was not restricted to support only those
        powers and duties expressly conferred on a police authority. Such powers and
        duties, though important, were themselves ancillary to the chief constable’s
        tactical role and the Secretary o f State’s strategic role, and s 111(1) allowed a police

                   LAWS LJ. These are linked applications for judicial review which require the
                   court to revisit the terrible disaster which took place at the Hillsborough football
                   ground at Sheffield on 15 April 1989. In what I will call the first case the applicants,
.            d    Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray, (to w hom I will refer as D and M), w ho are retired
    ^             police officers, seek leave to m o v e for judicial review o f the decision o f the
                   Director o f Public Prosecutions (the DPP) to refuse to take over and discontinue
                   private prosecutions which have been instituted against them by
                   Ann Adlington (AA) on behalf o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group (the
                   HFSG). The decision was communicated by letter o f 18 December 1998. On
-            e    15 March 1999 Latham J adjourned the leave application to 22 March 1999 and
                   directed that the parties should then be ready to proceed with the substantive
                   application if leave were granted. On 22 March this court granted leave and
                  proceeded at once to hear the inter partes application. In the second case the Chief
                   Constable o f the South Yorkshire Police (the CCSY) seeks to challenge a decision
:            f    o f the South Yorkshire Police Authority (the SYPA) made on 5 February 1999 to
                  the effect that it lacked the legal pow er to fund the defences o f D and M to the
                  private prosecutions brought by AA, or to fund their prospective judicial review
                  applications against the DPP. On 12 February 1999 Latham J granted leave to the
                  CCSY, joined AA as second respondent, abridged time and ordered expedition.
                  On 24 March 1999 this court (having reserved judgment in the first case the
1            9    previous day) granted leave to D and M to challenge the same decision and, again,
                  proceeded at once to hear the inter partes application. W e n ow deliver our
                  judgments in both cases.
                      I will first s6t out the facts material to the first case, which also form the
                  necessary background to the second. I will later describe the further facts which
j            /?   are specifically relevant to the second case.
                      The football match at Hillsborough on Saturday 15 April 1989 was the FA Cup
                  semi-final betw een Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC. In the events
                  which happened 96 people lost their lives. The divisional commander in charge
                  o f police operations at the match Was D, then holding the rank o f chief
             j    superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police Force. The second applicant, then
                  Supt Murray, held the position o f sub-divisional commander and was also on
                  duty at the match.
                      On 17 April 1989 Taylor LJ, as he then was, was appointed by the government
                  to conduct a public inquiry into the disaster. H e heard the oral testimony o f
                   174 witnesses betw een 15 May and 29 June 1989, and presented an interim report
                  on 4 August 1989 (The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster (Cm 765) (1989)). He found
                  that the immediate cause o f the gross overcrowding which had taken place, and

                                                                                                          s
      56. W hat the Director o f Public Prosecutions had to bear in mind, however,
      is the significantly different and greater degree o f culpability which is                  Sectic
      involved in manslaughter, or culpable misfeasance in public office, as against /
      the degree o f negligence which gives rise to liability, and compensation
      payments, under civil law. Any prosecution o f an individual police officer
      would have to establish his individual responsibility. It would not be enough
      simply to prove the composite failure o f the police operation. 57. The
      causes o f the disaster were many and complex. So far as these tw o officers
      [D and M] were concerned, the prosecution would have to prove to the high
      standard required for a criminal conviction that the failure to give the order

    to close off the tunnel when Gate C was opened amounted to the serious
    degree o f recklessness necessary to constitute manslaughter/ -
Paragraph 5 o f ch 7 ('Summary') stated:
      ‘. . . I have com e to the clear conclusion that there is no basis upon which
    there should be a further judicial inquiry or a re-opening o f Lord Taylor’s
    inquiry ... I do not consider that there is any material which should be placed
    before the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints
    Authority which might cause them to re-consider the decisions they have
    already taken.’
On the same day, 18 February 1998, the H om e Secretary announced in the H ouse
that he, the Attorney General and the DPP had very carefully considered
Stuart-Smith LJ’s report, and said: 'We have no reason to doubt his conclusions.’
   The HFSG was clearly not satisfied with this result. There was first an abortive
attempt on 26 June 1998 by AA to institute criminal proceedings against D and M
in the South Sefton Petty Sessional Division. That was given its quietus on
technical or jurisdictional grounds into which it is unnecessary to go. Then on
13 July 1998 AA laid informations against them before the Leeds Petty Sessional
Division, and summonses were accordingly issued by the stipendiary magistrate.
The charges accuse D and M o f the manslaughter o f tw o o f those w ho died at
Hillsborough, John Anderson and James Aspinall. They also allege against both
an offence o f 'wilful neglect to perform a public duty’; and in the case o f D, a
further offence o f attempting to pervert the course o f justice, said to consist in his
having lied about the circumstances in which gate C at the football ground
became open.
   Both D and M made representations to the DPP that he should exercise his
power under s 6(2) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 to take over the
conduct o f the proceedings initiated against them, and then discontinue the
proceedings under s 23(3) o f the 1985 Act. In order to appreciate the contrary
positions being taken and the issues in the case, it is convenient to set out the
relevant statutory provisions at this stage.
   Section 3(2) o f the 1985 Act provides, so far as relevant:
        'It shall be the duty o f the Director ... (a) to take over the conduct o f all
     criminal proceedings,-\other than specified proceedings, instituted on behalf
     o f a police force (whether by a member o f that force or by any other person);
     (b) to institute and have the conduct o f criminal proceedings in any case
     w here it appears to him that— (i) the importance or difficulty o f the case
    - makes it appropriate that proceedings should be instituted by him; or (ii) it is
     otherwise appropriate for proceedings to be instituted by him; (c) to take
   ' over the conduct o f all binding over proceedings instituted on behalf o f a
     police force ... (d) to take over the conduct o f a 11 proceedings begun by
     sum m ons issued under s 3 o f the Obscene Publications Act 1959 ...’

Section 6 provides:
       ‘(1) Subject to subsection (2) below, nothing in this Part shall preclude any
     person from instituting any criminal proceedings or conducting any criminal
     proceedings to which the Director’s duty to take over the conduct o f
     proceedings does not apply.
       (2)   Where criminal proceedings are instituted in circumstances in which
     the Director is not under a duty to take over their conduct, he may
     nevertheless do so at any stage/

   Representations had first been made to the DPP on behalf o f D and M in early
July 1998, after the commencement o f the proceedings in the South Sefton Petty
Sessional Division which proved abortive. In the course o f correspondence, the
HFSG again contended that it had discovered new evidence, which, it was said,
had not been before Lord Taylor, the DPP, the coroner, or Stuart-Smith LJ. At q
length, after AA’s .informations had been laid in the Leeds Petty Sessional
Division, die considered views o f the DPP as to the approach to be taken to a
request to take over and discontinue a private prosecution were set out in a letter
to the HFSG on 27 July 1998. The letter did not contain a decision, but it
explained the DPP's policy:

          ‘The policy where proceedings have been com m enced by a private
       prosecutor builds on that contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The
       right to bring a private prosecution is preserved by s 6(1) ... subject to the
       power under s 6(2). The CPS will take over a private prosecution where
       there is a particular need for it do so on behalf o f the public ... In the instant
       case where w e have been asked by the defendants to take over the &
       prosecution in order to discontinue it, w e would do so if one (or more) o f
       the following circumstances applies:
          • There is dearly no case to answer. A private prosecution com m enced in
       these circumstances would be unfounded, and would, therefore be an abuse
       o f the right to bring a prosecution.                                               ^
          • The public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those
      factors tending in favour.
          • The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests o f justice.
          The CPS would then regard itself as having to act in accordance with our
       policy. If none o f the above apply there would be no need for the CPS to j
       becom e involved and w e would not interfere with the private prosecution.
       Clearly there is a distinction betw een the “realistic prospect o f conviction"
       test in the Code [the Code for Crown Prosecutors issued by the DPP under                  Tl
       s 10 o f the 1985 Act (CPS Annual Report 1993-4)] and the “clearly no case to             w'
       answer” test mentioned above. Accordingly w e recognise that there will be                27
       som e cases which do not m eet the CPS Code tests where nevertheless w e                  fr
       will not intervene. It has been considered that to apply the Code tests to
QBD DC             R v DPP, ex p Duckenfield (Laws LJ)                           879

    private prosecutions would unfairly limit the right o f individuals to bring
    their own cases. Before this decision can properly be made the CPS must be
    assured that all relevant material has been considered ... Until there has been
    a detailed review o f the many papers in the case the Crown’s position cannot
    be determined ...’

   There followed very substantial representations from D and M and from the
HFSG. At length the DPP communicated his decision not to intervene, as I have
said, by letter o f 18 December 1998. The letter merely stated:

      ‘We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties
    and all the relevant circumstances o f the case. W e have concluded that we
    should not intervene to take over any o f the charges.’

The respective solicitors for D and M asked for reasons to be given. There
followed a letter o f 1 February 1999 (the reasons letter) from the CPS’ casework
director to M’s solicitor from which it is necessary to cite at som e length:

       ‘As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general
    principles applied by the Service w hen (inter alia) deciding whether to
    continue a prosecution it has taken over; or whether to institute proceedings,
    or whether to advise the police to do so. It is correct that the CPS decided
    in 1997 that the evidence available at that time was not sufficient, in its view,
    to provide a realistic prospect o f the conviction o f either your client or
    Mr Duckenfield for any offence. H owever, it does not follow that, when
    considering the evidence and the representations submitted by the private
    prosecutor, and by yourselves on behalf o f your client, the CPS should seek
    merely to identify whether there is now any new evidence sufficient
w   to provide a realistic prospect o f a conviction. The decision whether to
    intervene in a private prosecution with a view to terminating it calls for
    different considerations to be applied. It is quite possible for a private
    prosecution, to continue, notwithstanding that the CPS is not satisfied, on the
    basis o f its ow n assessment o f the strength o f the evidence, that the evidence
    would pass the evidential sufficiency test in the Code (that there should be a
    “realistic prospect o f a conviction”). In broad terms, the reason for this is that
    s 6(1) ... specifically preserved the right o f private individuals and
    prosecuting authorities and bodies other than the CPS to bring criminal
'   proceedings. This right is subject (among other limitations) to the limitation
    in s 6(2) that the CPS may nevertheless take over the proceedings with a
    view either to conducting or to terminating those proceedings. Private
    prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors when
    deciding whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the
     evidential sufficiency test in the Code w hen deciding whether there is a case
    to answer. The Service therefore recognises that it is not appropriate to
    intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That
    general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its
     Consultation Paper N o 149 Criminal Law: Consents to Prosecution [1997]
     (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).’

The letter then proceeds to set out the D PP’s policy in the same terms as those in
which it had earlier been described by the three ‘bullet-points’ in the letter o f
27 July 1998, save that it gives instances o f the ‘public interest factors’ test as
follows:
880                        All England Law Reports                   [1999] 2 All ER

             examples might be where the prosecution is malicious, or vexatious; or
      the offence is one for which the defendant should clearly have been                  a
      cautioned; or where, although the offence may be serious, the defendant is
      terminally ill ... In this case, I took the decision not to intervene ...
      I concluded in respect o f the charges o f manslaughter and wilful neglect to
      perform a public duty (which, for the avoidance o f doubt, were each
    ' considered against each individual separately) that I could not say that there       £
      is clearly no case to answer. It was not right, therefore, for the Service to take
      over the proceedings with a view to terminating them. I should add that,
      against that background and after specifically considering the appropriate
      course to take in these circumstances, I concluded further that it would not
      be right to intervene in respect o f the one remaining charge against
      Mr Duckenfield, o f attempting to pervert the course o f justice, albeit I had       c
      formed the view that there was clearly no case to answer on that charge
      alone. The charge o f attempting to pervert the course o f justice is a serious
      one, particularly when levelled against someone who was, at the relevant
      time, a serving, senior police officer. Nevertheless, in the context o f the case
      as a whole that charge is not the gravamen o f the criminality alleged against       ^
      Mr Duckenfield and I concluded that my approach to that charge should be
      led by my conclusions on the charges o f manslaughter and wilful neglect to
      perform a public duty. I also considered whether, nevertheless, there were
      overriding public interest factors that should lead to the Service intervening
      with a view to discontinuance, but I came to the conclusion that any public
      interest factors tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in       e
      favour; nor did I consider that the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the
      interests ofjustice
      The private prosecution o f D and M presently stands adjourned in the
 •magistrates’ court.      Committal proceedings were due to com m ence on
  19 April 1999. But w e understand that date has been vacated. There is a f
  directions hearing fixed for later in April. The matter was earlier before the
  magistrates' court on 21 December 1998, an occasion to which I should refer
  because Mr Jones QC for AA contends that the applications in the first case have
  not been made promptly, as RSC Ord 53 and the Supreme Court Act 1981 require
  (Mr Havers QC for the DPP likewise so contends but only in relation to the g
  assault which is directed to the legality o f the DPP's policy; he says, as is plainly
  the fact, that D and M had notice o f the policy by the letter o f 27 July 1998). On
. 21 Decem ber it is said by AA that Mr Harrison QC for D and M indicated his
  clients’ intention to seek leave to bring an application for judicial review against
  the DPP’s decision, whatever the reasons for it (the reasons had not, o f course, by
  then been supplied). Mr Jones contends that the application for judicial review
  could and should have been lodged then or very shortly thereafter. There is an
  issue as to the context in which Mr Harrison said w hat he said to the magistrate.
  It is clear from an affidavit sworn by M's solicitor Mr Manning that Mr Harrison
  took the view (as, if I may say so, one w ould expect) that he would have to
  consider the DPP's written reasons before finally advising as to a judicial review, j
  As at 21 December 1998 a reasons letter was expected before Christmas, and
  Mr Harrison so informed the magistrate. In the event the reasons were not
  delivered until 1 February 1999. These applications were lodged in the Crown
  Office on 1 and 5 March 1999.
      In m y judgm ent there is nothing in the delay point. It would have been
  irresponsible to seek judicial review leave before the DPP’s reasons were
  available. And the letter o f 27 July 1998 could not have been a proper trigger to
    QBD DC              R v DPP, ex p Duckenfield (Laws LJ)                           881

  seek leave; it contained no decision. It is true that a challenge only to the legality
a o f the policy need not strictly have awaited the DPP's reasons for applying it as
  he decided to do; but since D and M, very obviously, w ere at least as interested
  in the application o f the policy as in its legality, overall it was perfectly proper and
  reasonable to wait for the reasons letter before lodging any application for leave.

£   THE FIRST CASE: THE DECISION OF THE DPP
        I may n ow turn to the substantive arguments in the first case. The lead
    skeleton argument is that prepared on behalf o f M, w hich is adopted by D w ho
    adds further submissions to challenge the distinct decision o f the DPP not to take
    over and discontinue the charge against him o f attempting to pervert the course
    o f justice. To that I will come in due course.
c
    Section 3(2)(b) o f the Prosecution o f Ojfences Act 1985
      The applicants* first submission is that the DPP’s decision fails to pay any
    regard to his duty under s 3(2)(b), which I have set out. The submission is put
    thus:

^         ‘The applicant’s point is that the policy and decision process in this case
        have not recognised that the s 3(2)(b) duty is relevant to the exercise o f
        discretion whether to intervene under s 6(2) and apply s 23(3).’

    In the course o f his oral submissions, Mr Harrison expanded this argument. He
e   submitted that in deciding whether to take over and discontinue a private
    prosecution where the case is one o f ‘importance or difficulty’, the DPP should
    bear in mind that it is ordinarily his duty to institute and conduct such
    proceedings. Accordingly, as I understand it, the suggestion is that the DPP
    should in som e way entertain a heightened concern where such a private
    prosecution is launched, and his policy in relation to the potential discontinuance
f   o f such cases under s 23(3) o f the 1985 Act should reflect this; presumably
    (for otherwise I cannot see h ow the argument can assist Mr Harrison) by leaning
    more favourably towards discontinuance than in other classes o f case.
        In m y judgment this is a bad argument. Section 3(2)(b) speaks only o f the
    institution o f proceedings by the DPP; contrast s3(2)(a), (c), and (d), which
g   require him to take oyer proceedings. Plainly the DPP would not institute
    proceedings with a view to discontinuance. Moreover, as Mr Havers submitted,
    had i: been the legislature’s intention to require the DPP to treat ‘important or
    difficult’ cases in a different way from others for the purposes o f ss 6(2) and 23(3),
    it could have readily so provided and it is to be supposed w ould have done so. In
    my judgm ent the right o f private prosecution preserved by s 6(1) is in no way
    qualified by s3(2)(b), which has nothing to do with the discretion to take over
    such a prosecution under s 6(2) with a view to discontinuance under s 23(3). I
    consider that this conclusion is lent support by the decision o f the Divisional
    Court in R v Bow Street Stipendiary Magistrate, ex p South Coast Shipping Co Ltd
    [1993] 1 All ER 219 at 221-222, [1993] QB 645 at 650, in which Lloyd LJ said:

^         ‘It will be noticed that s 3(2)(a)... provide[s] for the Director to take over
        the conduct o f certain kinds o f proceedings. By contrast, s 3(2)(b) provides
        for the Director to institute certain other kinds o f proceedings where it
        appears to him to be appropriate, having regard to the importance and the
        difficulty o f the case. The difference in language is not, in m y view,
        accidental. It becom es o f crucial importance w hen one turns to s 6, which
        deals with private prosecutions ... The effect o fs 6(1) is to preclude a person

   Mr Harrison’s second submission was that the right to maintain a private                     princi

is som e suggestion o f ‘inertia, partiality or improper action’ by the public                  gener

improper inaction by the prosecuting authority’, and to a recent                               coui
recommendation o f the Law Commission, contained in para 5.26 o f its final                     com
report on Criminal Law: Consents to Prosecution (October 1998) (Law Com                         con:
Consultation Paper N o 149), to the effect that private prosecutions might be                   disc
made subject to a statutory provision requiring the consent o f the CPS.
   In m y judgment this argument is also misconceived. The obiter dicta in
Gouriet’s case are not reflected in the 1985 statute, which was o f course enacted                app
som e seven years after Gouriet’s case was decided. More particularly, it is simply               the
quixotic to suggest that the DPP should allow a private prosecution to go ahead
if there has been ‘inertia, partiality or improper action’ by the public                          The
prosecutor—namely himself—but not otherwise. Is he to be judge and jury on                           I
the question whether he has let the public down? Their Lordships’ dicta in                        o f-
Gouriet’s case do not, with respect, provide anything approaching a compulsory

  template o f a lawful policy to be adopted by the DPP for the execution o f his duty
a under ss 6(2) and 23(3) o f the 1985 Act.

   The Codefo r Crown Prosecutors
      The argument here, at least as originally put forward in M's skeleton
   argument, was that because o f his view (referred to in the reasons letter) that
b private prosecutors are not bound to apply the code when deciding whether to
   institute proceedings, the DPP has erroneously proceeded on the basis that the
   principles in the code are irrelevant to his discretion under ss 6(2) and 23(3). But
   the DPP has nowhere stated that he regards the code as systematically or
   generally irrelevant to his power to discontinue. Indeed, as I shall show, there are
   some aspects o f the code which are reflected in his approach to the question, how
c his policy should be applied in this case. In truth, however, it could not be right
   for the DPP to apply across the board the same tests, in particular the ‘reasonable
   prospect o f conviction' test referred to in the correspondence, in considering
   whether to take over and discontinue a private prosecution as the code enjoins
   crown prosecutors to follow in deciding whether to institute or proceed with a
fj prosecution themselves; the consequence would be that the DPP would stop a
   private prosecution merely on the ground that the case is not one which he
   would himself proceed with. But that, in my judgment, would amount to an
   emasculation o f s 6(1) and itselfbe an unlawful policy; and in fairness Mr Harrison
   made it clear that he did not submit so much. The very premise o f s 6(1) must be
   that some cases will go to trial which the DPP himself chooses not to prosecute.
e     As it seems to me the only points remaining in relation to the code concern the
   application o f the DPP’s policy to the facts o f this case, and I will deal with that
   shortly.

  The ‘clearly no case to answer’ test
f     The argument here is that such a test is impermissibly rigid. It is said that the
  policy excludes ‘any assessment o f evidential deficiencies’ and so amounts to an
  unlawful fetter o f the DPP’s discretion; and that it ‘also leads to a distorted
  evaluation of the public interest factors’. In my judgment the test involves no
  unlawful fetter o f discretion. It is plain from the formulation ‘there is clearly no
  case to answer' (my emphasis) that the DPP only intends to stop private
& prosecutions on this ground where no reasonable decision maker could conclude
  that there was sufficient evidence for the case to go forward. That seem s to me
  to be a perfectly proper approach. Such a prosecution could offer no legitimate
  benefit to anyone and would, potentially at least, be an abuse o f the process o f the
  court. The test rightly identifies a class o f case which should always be stopped;
h if the case is not within the class, then the decision whether to stop it will, o f
  course, depend on the other two tests which, in my judgment, amply
  contemplate an exercise o f discretion in which all material factors will be
  considered and whose application accordingly negates any unlawful fetter o f
  discretion.
j    As regards any ‘distorted evaluation’ o f the public interest test, it is clear that
  the three aspects o f the policy are individually self-standing. Their respective
  application in this case is another matter, to which as I have said I will come. But
  the applicants have a separate argument about the public interest test.

    The 'public interestfactors’ test
        Here it is submitted that the public interest necessarily involves consideration
    o f the likelihood o f conviction, so that the evidential test should not be hived off
884                        AH England Law Reports                   [1999] 2 All ER            QBD C


from that relating to the public interest. Mr Harrison also argues that the public           favouri
interest test as formulated: ‘the public interest factors tending against prosecution      a nothin
clearly outweigh those factors tending in favour’ gets it the wrong way round; the           forcefi:
test should be whether the public interest factors in favour o f the private                 furthei
prosecution outweigh those against.                                                          I agree
                                                                                             existec
   I see no reason why, quite aside from the evidential test o f no case to answer,
the DPP should not, within his policy as presently formulated, have in mind the b          b  any p v
likelihood or otherwise o f conviction when considering where the public interest             those :
lies. And I see no basis for the suggestion that the law should compel the DPP to             which
reverse the effect o f the public interest factors so as to favour discontinuance             prosec
unless in his judgment they clearly point in the other direction. The test as                  Wcdne
presently formulated seems to m e designed to allow proper scope for the                       [1947]
operation o f the right o f private prosecution. The private prosecutor is very 0          c there
likely to take a different- view as to where the public interest lies than does the            discor
DPP, and s 6(1), I think, implies that he is entitled to do so. The approach urged             deA f
by Mr Harrison w ould in effect require the private prosecutor to persuade the                 fac ..
DPP that his view o f the public interest is plainly right. I consider it strongly           ■ be cla
arguable that that w ould place an illegitimate constraint upon the right o f private d    d the Cl
prosecution; but it is enough to hold, as I would, that the present public interest             to 4 o
policy is perfectly consistent with the objects o f the statute and thus well within
the proper discretion o f the DPP.
   Mr Harrison directed similar criticisms to the third limb o f the policy, but in                 v
light o f what I have said about the public interest test they possess no separate
                                                                                                    F
force.                                                                                              v
   For all these reasons, the DPP’s policy overall is in my judgm ent a lawful one.                 b
The real question in the case is whether it has been lawfully applied. It is clear „                f
that (a) the DPP maintains his view that the ‘reasonable prospect o f conviction’                   r
test in the code would not be m et in this case, but that (b) the ‘no evidence’ test                c
is not m et either (save as regards the charge against D o f attempting to pervert f
the course o f justice, with which I deal separately below). In those circumstances,                r
                                                                                                    t
the application o f the public interest test was crucial. In this context it is
convenient to deal first with Mr Harrison’s submission that the reasons letter
shows that the DPP has given improper and perhaps decisive weight to the
‘no evidence’ test. He relies on the sentence which follows the conclusion that
that test is not satisfied: ‘It was not right, therefore, for the Service to take over
the proceedings with a view to terminating them ’, and submits that it suggests
the author o f the letter considered that that was the end o f the matter. H ow ever
after dealing with the particular issue concerning the charge against D o f
attempting to pervert the course o f justice, the letter continues: ‘I also considered
whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest factors that should h
lead to the Service intervening with a view to discontinuance’. I think the letter
could have been better expressed, so as to make it clear that the public interest
test is by no means secondary to the ‘no evidence’ test. H ow ever I am quite
satisfied that there was no intention to downgrade or sideline the balance o f
public interest factors. It is not really credible to suppose that the author o f the j
letter misunderstood or failed to apply the very policy which he had just clearly
set out.

The DPP’s judgment o f the public interest
  Mr Harrison submitted that in light o f everything that had gone before, and
not least Stuart-Smith LJ’s Scrutiny (Scrutiny o f Evidence Relating to the Hillsborough
Football Stadium Disaster (Cm 3878) (1998)), there were no public interest factors
    QBD DC              R v DPP, ex p Duckenfield (Laws LJ)                          885

   favouring continuation o f the prosecutions o f D and M. H e said that there is
 a nothing in the reasons letter to show that the DPP accepted the suggestion, urged
   forcefully and at length by the HFSG in the course o f their representations, that
   farther evidence had com e to light since the Scrutiny. W ith this latter proposition
   I agree. But the reasons letter clearly implies an acceptance that some factors
   existed which favoured the prosecutions. It stated: ‘I came to the conclusion that
fa any public interest factors tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh
   those in favour’. W hat were those in favour? If in truth there were no factors
   which a reasonable decision-maker could regard as going in favour o f the
   prosecutions, then the DPP’s decision would be vulnerable to a challenge on
   Wednesbury grounds (see Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp
   [1947] 2 All ER 680, [1948] 1 KB 223) (as indeed Mr Harrison claims it is) since
c there would be nothing in public interest terms to w eigh in the scales against
   discontinuance. W hen the case was opened there was no affidavit from the DPP
   dealing with the point, nor did Mr Havers’ skeleton argument articulate any such
   factors. So it was that, effectively at the court’s invitation so that the matter could
   be clarified, Mr N ew ell swore an affidavit for the DPP on 22 March 1999. H e is
d the CPS’ director o f casework and the author o f the reasons letter. Paragraphs 2
   to 4 o f Mr N ew ell’s affidavit are as follows:


           ‘2. As I n ow recall, the public interest factors tending against prosecution
        which I considered were as follows: (1) Previous reviews o f the case, in
e      particular those carried out by the DPP w hen considering the question
        whether criminal proceedings should be taken against Mr Duckenfield and
        Mr Murray and the more recent report o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. (2) The
        fact that the Applicants had been told on previous occasions that the DPP did
        not intend to prosecute. (3) The delay which had occurred betw een the
p      commission o f the alleged offences and the com m encem ent o f this
        prosecution and its likely effect on the Applicants, although I took the view
        that delay may be offset by the seriousness o f the alleged offences (as is
        reflected in paragraph 6.5(d) o f the Code ...). (4) The effect o f the delay on
        the evidence, for example in terms o f the potential impairment o f the
        recollections o f witnesses. (5) The assertion made on behalf o f Mr Murray
9      o f ill-health, although I noted that no medical evidence had been put forward
        in support ofith is assertion and that, as again reflected in the Code
        (at paragraph 6.5(e)), ill-health may be offset by the seriousness o f the
        offence. 3. As against these factors tending against prosecution, there was
        in my view one extremely important factor in favour o f prosecution, namely
h      the very serious nature o f the alleged offences, in particular, the alleged
        offences o f manslaughter. In my opinion, the allegation that tw o senior
        police officers were responsible for the deaths o f a number o f people as a
        result o f criminal negligence was a very grave allegation. 4. Paragraph 6.2
        o f the Code reflects the considerable weight attached by the CPS to the
j      seriousness o f the alleged offence w hen seeking to strike the right balance as
        to the factors for and against prosecution. (I refer also to the opening words
        o f paragraph 6.4.) Having carefully considered the factors tending against
        prosecution and this extremely important factor in favour o f it, I came to the
        firm conclusion that the factors tending against prosecution did not clearly
        outweigh what I considered to be the very strong public interest in favour o f
        prosecution.’

  One o f Mr Harrison's complaints, advanced before this affidavit was sworn,                        Th<
was that the policy should have taken account o f para 10.1 o f the code, which                 a tragic
includes this:                                                                                    thoro
                                                                                                  DPP
        ‘Normally, if the Crown Prosecution Service tells a suspect or defendant ,                usurp
      that there will not be a prosecution ... that is the end o f the matter ... But                Ini
      occasionally there are special reasons why the Crown Prosecution Service ^
      will re-start the prosecution, particularly if the case is serious.’                      b    PoUc-

                                                                                                  Tiiefi
This is one o f the points relating to the code which, as it seem s to me, bear on the
application o f the policy rather than the policy itself; and para 2(2) o f Mr N ew ell’s            Mi
affidavit shows that regard was had to assurances or statements made to D and M                   to pc
that, for his part, the DPP would not prosecute. Clearly it was right to do so,             c     coun
within the public interest balance. But I think there is a qualitative difference               c the r
betw een the situation where the DPP him self goes back upon a previous
assurance not to prosecute and one where the DPP does not change his mind but,                       ^
a private prosecutor chooses to instigate proceedings.
    In reply, having by then seen Mr N ew ell’s affidavit, Mr Harrison made further         ^
submissions. While accepting that there could be a case in which a single factor                dj
favouring prosecution might not be outweighed by a multiplicity o f factors going
the other way, he submitted that if the raft o f public interest considerations
favouring discontinuance in this case was held not to be enough to outweigh the
single factor o f the allegations’ gravity, it was difficult or impossible to imagine
what set o f considerations might do so; and the court should conclude that the             e        Pan
DPP had fettered his discretion by treating the seriousness o f the allegations as
overriding everything else, so that he had not in truth carried out a proper
balancing exercise at all.                                                              r
    I w ould reject this argument. There is no reason to suppose that the factors
'against prosecution were not properly weighed and considered, and certainly no             ^
basis for the supposition that, once faced with a private prosecution for
something as serious as manslaughter, the DPP would inevitably decide to allow
it to proceed.
    Mr Harrison submitted next that Mr N ew ell’s affidavit showed that the DPP
had transposed from the code the ‘seriousness o f the charge’ factor as a
consideration favouring the prosecution without also taking account o f his ow n            &
view that the code test o f ‘realistic prospect o f conviction’ was not met. I agree
that the DPP’s view o f the prospects o f conviction is a proper matter for him to
consider, within the public interest test contained in the policy, w hen deciding
whether to discontinue; but, as it seems to me, para 2(1) o f Mr N ew ell’s affidavit
shows that in this case he has done so.                                                     h
    Then Mr Harrison suggested that para 3 o f the affidavit demonstrated that the
DPP’s view o f the gravity o f the allegation was informed simply by the fact that
there was a manslaughter charge. He had not properly considered the real degree
o f culpability inherent in the facts alleged; and the gravity o f the offence o f
manslaughter can vary very widely. There is nothing in this. Mr N ewell made it             j
perfectly clear that he had regard to the species o f manslaughter in question                           th
('criminal negligence’) and it cannot sensibly be doubted that he was well aware                         ca
and took account o f the circumstances in which the alleged offences are said to                         M
have been committed.                                                                                     tc
    Lastly on this part o f the case, Mr Harrison submitted that the refusal to                          th
discontinue was simply perverse, given the ‘enormous w eight’ o f the public                             ‘a
interest considerations going the other way.                                                              r

   The DPP might, in my judgment, lawfully have decided to discontinue. The
tragic events at Hillsborough have been the subject o f repeated, detailed,
thorough inquiries. Nearly ten years have passed. But the judgm ent was for the
DPP to make. If w e acceded to Mr Harrison’s submission, w e would I think
usurp the role o f the primary decision-maker.
   In my judgment the decision not to discontinue is no more unlawful than is the
policy which the DPP applied.

The first applicant: attempting to pervert the course o f justice
   Mr Harrison discretely submits that the decision to let the charge o f attempting
to pervert the course o f justice go ahead was unlawful, because it runs flat
counter to the ‘no case to answer’ test in his ow n policy. It will be recalled that
the reasons letter said:
      ‘I concluded further that it would not be right to intervene in respect o f the
    one remaining charge against Mr Duckenfield, o f attempting to pervert the
    course o f justice, albeit I had formed the view that there was clearly no case
    to answer on that charge alone ... in the context o f the case as a w hole that
    charge is not the gravamen o f the criminality alleged against Mr Duckenfield
    and I concluded that m y approach to that charge should be led by my
    conclusions on the charges o f manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a
    public duty.’
Paragraphs 5 and 6 o f Mr N ew ell’s affidavit state:
      ‘5. I was fully aware o f the seriousness o f the additional charge. I also
    tentatively concluded that partial intervention ... was in law open to the CPS
    and I proceeded on that assumption. However, the existing policy did not
    cover the situation which arose in this case, namely where the conclusion
    was reached that there was clearly a case to answer in relation to som e o f the
    charges but not in relation to others. (I can say that with som e confidence,
    since I had overall responsibility for formulating the policy.) ... I concluded
    that it was in fact inappropriate to intervene only to take over (with a view
    to discontinuing) this additional charge. 6. First, partial intervention was
    not, in m y view, either appropriate or desirable. It seem ed to m e that the
    DPP should either intervene so as to take over the proceedings in their
    entirety or not at all. To have intervened partially would still have left the
    criminal proceedings in place in relation to the other charges which included
    the even m ore serious charge o f manslaughter. Secondly, I took into
    account the fact that Mr Duckenfield would not be left w ithout any remedy
    in relation to this additional charge. On the contrary, he would be entitled
    to invite the Magistrates’ Court to dismiss it on the basis that there was no
    case to answer. Thirdly, the charge arose out o f essentially the same events
    as the events which gave rise to the other charges and thus those events
    would be scrutinised in any event.’
   I o f course accept that Mr N ewell did not subjectively believe— or intend— that
the policy covered this situation. But the policy has to be read objectively; there
can be no doubt that it gave rise to a legitimate expectation on the part o f D and
M that it would be applied according to its terms. The first question, then, is as
to the true meaning o f the policy on a fair reading o f the letter o f 27 July 1998 and
the reasons letter. It is true that the letters use the singular: ‘the prosecution’ and
‘a private prosecution'. But it is elementary that in criminal cases each count
constitutes a separate indictment; it is as if there are separate trials relating to
                                                                  [1999] 2 All ER                    QBD

can fairly be read as indicating that the DPP would necessarily either take over or      '           wi .
discontinue a private prosecution in its entirety. In my view the articulation o f                   groui
the ‘no case to answer’ test would be taken by any informed reader, facing a
multiple private prosecution, to imply that the DPP w ould consider whether in fo                ^ I ra'
his view there was clearly no case to answer on each charge.                                      ^ ^
   The DPP concluded that there was clearly no such case in relation to this                          ^
charge against D, and yet decided to allow it to proceed. It follows, in my                       SYP/
judgment, that there is a breach o f D ’s legitimate expectation that the policy                  unla'
would be applied. The pragmatic factors spoken to by Mr Newell in para 6 can                 c
make no difference. Nor, o f course, can the vigorous assertion by the HFSG that c
there is in fact a case to answer. What matters for present purposes is the DPP’s
conclusion on that issue.                                                            '           Dl-~-
   For these reasons I would quash the DPP’s decision only so far as it relates to              -n ^
this charge against D. I make it clear that I say nothing as to what might follow              8 wrot
as regards any further decision concerning that charge to be made by the DPP.       d        <^*^the-v
   Otherwise, for the reasons I have given I would dismiss the application in the                advic
first case.

THE SECOND CASE: THE DECISION OF THE SYPA                                                                LqC£

second case. These must*be read into the narrative o f events which I have already                    rea^
given in relation to the first case; it seems to m e clearer and more convenient to                      ,.

   fl'he history shows that at earlier stages the SYPA had been prepared to provide
financial support for D and M (and other officers) to be legally represented in f                •
matters arising from the Hillsborough disaster. On 7 December 1990 they
resolved to fund the representation o f six police officers, including D and M, at                           ^
the inquest. They had earlier resolved not to do so; the decision o f 7 December
was taken after considering ‘the most recent legal advice available’. Then on
1 August 1997 the SYPA resolved to set aside £500,000 for financial assistance for               g
police officers in connection with Stuart-Smith LJ’s Scrutiny (Scrutiny ofE\idence
Relating to the Hillsborough Football Stadium Disaster (Cm 3878) (1998)). In both                         ^
instances they had considered a report from the chief constable (or a joint report                     l“in
o f the chief constable and the clerk and treasurer). The latter decision was said to                  th01
be taken ‘in accordance with the principles set out in H om e Office                                 ^ sea

    On 27 February 1998, following publication o f the Scrutiny, and considering
that ‘there were indications that private prosecutions could be brought against                          ^ '
three officers’, the SYPA resolved in principle to authorise consideration being                     .
given to applications by officers for financial assistance. On 5 March 1998 D ’s j                   J
application for such assistance was approved by the SYPA, and M’s was approved
on 29 June 1998. It will be recalled that three days earlier, on 26 June, AA had first                   °
sought to institute criminal proceedings against D and M in the South Sefton
Petty Sessional Division. On 20 November 1998 M applied for further financial                                 ^
assistance in relation to the judicial review which was then seen to be in prospect                            ^
should the DPP decide to allow the private prosecutions to continue; and the                                 ^
HFSG had made it clear that were the DPP to take over the prosecutions and

  discontinue, they would seek a judicial review. On 21 Decem ber 1998 counsel
a for D and M indicated to the stipendiary magistrate their intention to seek a
  judicial review o f the DPP’s decision; I have already referred to this in dealing
  with Mr Jones’ misconceived argument that the first case should be dismissed on
  grounds o f delay. The following day, 22 Decem ber 1998, in a letter o f over six
  pages, AA made written representations on leading counsel’s advice to urge the
^ SYPA that the decision to fund the defences o f D and M was ‘unlawful, irrational,
  ultra vires and procedurally improper on various grounds’. On 23 Decem ber 1998
  D applied for further financial assistance in relation to the prospective judicial
  review proceedings. On 5 January 1999 AA wrote a further lengthy letter to the
  SYPA repeating and expanding her assertions that the funding decisions were
  unlawful.
c     Then on 5 February 1999 the SYPA passed the resolutions under challenge,
  ‘that, on balance, the Authority has no legal power to provide financial assistance’
  to D and M in respect either o f the private prosecution or a judicial review o f the
  DPP’s decision. On 10 February 1999 the CCSY’s application for judicial review
  in these proceedings was lodged, and on the same day solicitors for the SYPA
  wrote to the Crown Office to consent to the grant o f leave and seek expedition.
  They stated: ‘SYPA passed these resolutions with great reluctance on the basis o f
  advice received.from ourselves and C o u n se l...’
     The legality or otherwise o f the decisions under challenge ultimately turns on
  the construction and application o f s 6(1) o f the Police Act 1996 and s 111(1) o f the
  Local Government Act 1972. I shall have to look at other statutory provisions,
e but it is convenient to set these out at once. The sidenote to s 6 o f the 1996 Act
  reads: ‘General functions o f police authorities’, and sub-s (1) provides: ‘Every
  police authority established under section 3 shall secure the maintenance o f an
  efficient and effective police force for its area.’ Section 111(1) o f the 1972 Act, in
  its present form, provides:

^          ‘Without prejudice to any powers exercisable apart from this section but
        subject to the following provisions o f this Act, a local authority shall have
        power to do any thing (whether or not involving expenditure, borrowing or
        lending o f m oney or the acquisition or disposal o f any property or rights)
        which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge
g       o f their functions.’

      Section 111(1) applies to police authorities (but in light o f m y conclusions it is
  unnecessary to go into the legislative history relating to that). N ow , it m ight be
  thought—indeed this is the applicants’ case—that by s 6(1) o f the 1996 Act,
  securing ‘the maintenance o f an efficient and effective police force' is plainly
h made the function o f a police authority, and that accordingly it is no less plain that
  s 111(1) o f the 1972 Act empowers the police authority to do such things as fund
  the legal representation o f police officers in proceedings if the authority
  reasonably concludes that to do so is conducive to that function’s discharge. That
  has been the settled view o f the Association o f C hief Police Officers, the Police
j Superintendents Association, and (until 1998) the H om e Office. The decision to
  provide such finance, in com m on with any decision taken under s 111(1), would
  o f course be subject to well-known public law constraints enshrined in the
  Wednesbury and Padfield principles (see Padfield v Minister o f Agriculture Fisheries
  and Food [1968] 1 All ER 694, [1968] AC 997). There is before the court an affidavit
  o f Mr Daines, assistant chief constable o f South Yorkshire, in which he describes
  what he regards as the 'absolutely vital’ requirement ‘that officers should know
  that if they act in good faith in performing their duties their Police Authority will
890                        All England Law Reports                   11999] 2 All ER                  QBD I

support them in the event that they face litigation’. If, as a matter o f vires, s 111(1)             The
allows a police authority to incur expenditure in furtherance o f the general                    a betwe<
function seemingly conferred by s 6(1), then in my judgm ent the use o f s 111(1)                  author
to finance police officers’ legal expenses in litigation, including private
prosecutions brought against them and the bringing o f judicial review
                                                                                                              ar
proceedings, cannot in principle be ruled unlawful on Wednesbury or Padfield
grounds. The circumstances in which such funding might be provided in any                   fo
                                                                                                              th
particular case is another matter. The policy has, in the past, been to the effect
                                                                                                              se
that the authority must be satisfied that the officer has acted in good faith in the
discharge o f his duty; and I can see that, at least w here a private prosecution is                  (Sectic
involved, there may be issues for the authority to consider which would involve                       the pc
their taking a view o f the merits in advance o f any trial. But in these proceedings                 also ss
w e are not concerned with any question whether, w hen, or to what extent, the              c
SYPA might provide financial assistance to D or M. W e are only to decide
whether the power exists to do so at all.
   In fact the argument o f the CCSY was put two ways by Mr Baker QC. It was
first said that s 6(1) o f itself, without the aid o f s 111(1), enabled the funding                      Sectio
decision. Alternatively, it was enabled by s 111(1) read with s 6(1).                       (j
   Upon this issue Miss Baxendale QC for the SYPA submits that the apparently
obvious relation betw een s 6(1) and s 111(1) is in fact no relation at all. The                              fi
essence o f her argument may be expressed very shortly, as follows.                                           b
   (a) Section 6(1) confers no powers o f any kind. All the powers possessed by                           The 3
police authorities are conferred elsewhere in the 1996 Act and by the local                               Sectic
government legislation. Section 6(1) does no more than to provide the purpose
for which the authority’s powers are to be exercised; it states the Act’s ‘policy and       ^
objects’, in the language o f Padfield’s case, as they apply to police authorities. If                         ti
this is right, it would contradict Mr Baker’s first argument, that s 6(1) alone is                             a
enough to em power the SYPA to fund D and M.                                                                   e
   (b) Section 111(1) cannot be read as enabling the authority to do anything               f     ^ Sectic
which is not ancillary to a power which is elsewhere conferred upon it. If this is
right, then taken with (a) it contradicts Mr Baker’s second argument which relies
o n s 111(1).                                                                                              w *
   There is no doubt that express powers are conferred on police authorities by a
                                                                                                          As re
raft o f statutory provisions. Miss Baxendale says that such provisions support
                                                                                                  g       o f th(
proposition (a) which I have set out, by application o f the canon o f statutory
construction expressed by the Latin maxim ‘expressio unius est exclusio alrerius’.                         Secti<
Thus, she submits, where Parliament has seen fit to confer a range o f specific
powers on police authorities, the intention must have been thereby to set the
                                                                                                                   (
limits on what such an authority may do and it cannot be supposed that s 6(1)
                                                                                                                   (
provides an undefined and open-ended pow er to do anything else w hich the
authority may choose, merely on the ground that in som e way it may be said to                             Secti
support the general aim o f ‘the maintenance o f an efficient and effective police
force’. The high-water mark o f this submission is found in s 88(4) o f the 1996 Act
which confers an express power to fund police officers’ costs in certain
circumstances which do not include the defence o f private (or any) criminal                j         J    The
prosecutions or participation in proceedings for judicial review.                                          folio
   I shall have to look in a little more detail at s 88(4). I have concluded, however,
that the correctness or otherwise o f proposition (a) is not in the end at the centre o f
the case. The reason is that, in the particular statutory context, proposition (b) is in
my judgment wrong; so that the SYPA is enabled by s 111(1) (subject to Wednesbury
and Padfield principles) to finance D and M in the criminal and judicial review
proceedings even if s 6(1) confers no powers as such.

    The scheme o f the 1996 Act involves the distribution o f responsibilities
a betw een three bodies: the chief constable, the Secretary o f State, and the police
  authority. The chief constable’s role is principally given by s 10:
               ‘(1) A police force maintained under section 2 shall be under the direction
             and control o f the chief constable appointed under section 11.
               (2)            In discharging his functions, every chief constable shall have regard to
b            the local policing plan issued by the police authority for his area under
             section 8.’
         (Section 11 provides for the appointment and removal o f the chief constable, by
         the police authority with the approval o f the Secretary o f State.) I should notice
         also ss 22(1) and 44(4). Section 22(1) provides:
c
               ‘Every chief constable shall, as soon as possible after the end o f each
             financial year, submit to the police authority a general report on the policing
             during that year o f the area for which his force is maintained.’

         Section 44 (4) provides:
^              ‘Every chief constable shall, as soon as possible after the end o f each
             financial year, submit to the Secretary o f State the like report as is required
             by section 22(1) to be submitted to the police authority.’
         The role o f the Secretary o f State is principally given by ss 36 and 37(1).
e        Section 36(1) provides:
                ‘The Secretary o f State shall exercise his powers under the provisions o f
              this Act referred to in subsection (2) in such manner and to such extent as
              appears to him to be best calculated to promote the efficiency and
     j       effectiveness o f the police.’
^ Section 37(1) provides:
              ‘The Secretary' o f State may by order determine objectives for thepolicing o f the
              areas o f all police authorities established tinder section 3.’
         As regards the Secretary o f State’s position, I should notice also these provisions
g        o f the 1996 Act.

         Section 38(1):
                 ‘Where an objective has been determined under section 37, the Secretary
              o f State may direct police authorities to establish levels o f performance
/j           ("performance targets”) to be aimed at in seeking to achieve the objective.’

         Section 39(1):
                ‘The Secretary' o f State may issue codes o f practice relating to the discharge
              by police authorities established under section 3 o f any o f their functions.’

J The role o f the police authority is given first by the subsections o f s 6 which
  follow sub-s (1):
                ‘(2) In discharging its functions, every police authority established under
              section 3 shall; have regard to— (a) any objectives determined by the
              Secretary o f State under section 37, (b) any objectives determined by
              the authority under section 7, (c) any performance targets established by the
              authority, whether in compliance with a direction under section 38 or
892                        All England Law Reports                  [1999] 2 All ER

      otherwise, and (d) any local policing plan issued by the authority under
      section 8.                                                                    3
        (3) In discharging any function to which a code o f practice issued under
      section 39 relates, a police authority established under section 3 shall have
      regard to the code.
        (4) A police authority shall comply with any direction given to it by the
      Secretary o f State under section 38 or 4 0 /                                 b

These provisions, o f course, confer duties rather than powers. In relation to the
police authority I should next notice ss 7 to 9. Those sections provide:

         '7.— (1) Every police authority established under section 3 shall, before
      the beginning o f each financial year, determine objectives for the policing o f    C
      the authority’s area during that year.
         (2) Objectives determined under this section may relate to matters to
      which objectives determined under section 37 also relate, or to other
      matters, but in any event shall be so framed as to be consistent with the
      objectives determined under that section.
         (3) Before determining objectives under this section, a police authority
      shall— (a) consult the chief constable for the area, and (b) consider any views
      obtained by the authority in accordance with arrangements made under
      section 96.
         8.— (1) Ever}'police authority established under section 3 shall, before the     e
      beginning o f each financial year, issue a plan setting out the proposed
      arrangements for the policing o f the authority’s area during the year (“the
      local policing plan”).
         (2) The local policing plan shall include a statement o f the authority’s
      priorities for the year, o f the financial resources expected to be available and
      o f the proposed allocation o f those resources, and shall give particulars         f
      o f—(a) any objectives determined by the Secretary o f State under section 37,
      (b) any objectives determined by the authority under section 7, and (c) any
      performance targets established by the authority, whether in compliance
      with a direction under section 38 or otherwise.
         (3) A draft o f the local policing plan shall be prepared by the chief           g
      constable for the area and submitted by him to the police authority for it to
      consider.
         (4) Before issuing a local policing plan which differs from the draft
      submitted by the chief constable under subsection (3), a police authority shall
      consult the chief constable.                                                        h
         (5) A police authority shall arrange for every local policing plan issued by
      it under this section to be published in such manner as appears to it to be
      appropriate, and shall send a copy o f the plan to the Secretary o f State.
         9.— (l) As soon as possible after the end o f each financial year every police
      authority established under section 3 shall issue a report relating to the          y
      policing o f the authority’s area for the year.
         (2) A report issued by a police authority under this section for any year

    Section 14 is important:
          '(1) Each police authority established under section 3 shall keep a fund to
        be known as the police fund.
          (2) Subject to any regulations under the Police Pensions Act 1976, all
        receipts o f the police authority shall be paid into the police fund and all
        expenditure o f the authority shall be paid out o f that fund.
^         (3) Accounts shall be kept by each police authority o f payments made into
        or out o f the police fund.'
    Then s 43(1):
           'A police authority shall, w henever so required by the Secretary o f State,
c       submit to the Secretary o f State a report on such matters connected with the
         discharge o f the authority’s functions, or otherwise with the policing o f its
         area, as may be specified in the requirement.’
    Section 92, so far as material, provides:
           ‘(1) The council o f a county, district, county borough or London borough
         may make grants to any police authority established under section 3 w hose
         police area falls wholly or partly within the county, district, county borough
         or borough ...
           (3) Grants under this section may be made unconditionally or, with the
         agreement o f the chief officer o f police for the police area concerned, subject
e       to conditions.’
    Section 96 provides:
          ‘(1) Arrangements shall be made for each police area for
        obtaining— (a) the views o f people in that area about matters concerning the
        policing o f the area, and (b) their co-operation with the police in preventing
        crime in that area.
          (2) Except as provided by subsections (3) to (6), arrangements for each
        police area shall be made by the police authority after consulting the chief
        constable as to the arrangements that would be appropriate.’
     Looking at the whole picture displayed by these provisions, it is clear that the
  chief constable is in charge o f day-to-day policing (s 10(1)); the police authority
  has a role in relation to policy, or strategy (ss 7, 8 and other provisions); but this
  is subject to the overall direction o f the Secretary o f State (ss 37, 38, 39 and other
  provisions, taken with s 6(2) to (4)). The police authority holds the purse (s 14).
  Those provisions, specifically concerned with the police authority’s role, confer
h duties rather than powers, though in som e cases there is clearly a discretion as to
  h ow the duty is to be performed (as for example under s 37). Other powers
  (including those contained in s 111(1)) are conferred on the police authority by
  the local government legislation, to the extent that measures there contained
  were applied to police authorities by s 146A(1) o f the 1972 Act. The powers so
j conferred are listed in a helpful note provided by Miss Baxendale. I do not
  propose to set them out. They include (apart from s 111(1)) such matters as the
  disposition and treatment o f staff and the acquisition and disposal o f land.
     The critical point which in my judgm ent emerges from a consideration o f the
  interlocking roles o f chief constable, Secretary o f State and police authority, is
  that it cannot have been within the contemplation o f Parliament in enacting the
  scheme, and in embracing within it s 111(1), that the police authority should only
  be empowered to incur expenditure in support o f those duties, and ancillary

     satisfied that the officer has acted in this way, the authority should provide
     or fund legal advice and/or representation.'

    On 17 February 1998 H om e Office circular 4/1998 was published. Unlike its
predecessor, it sits on the fence as regards the power o f a police authority to fund
defences to private prosecutions. It has no persuasive effect one w ay or the other
upon the issues in these proceedings. The earlier circular, though obviously not
a source o f law, may possibly possess som e force as regards the purposes to be
fulfilled by s 6(l)'s predecessor, in s 4(1) o f the 1964 Act: see Bristol DC v Clark
[1975] 3 All ER 976, [1975] 1 WLR 1443 per Scarman LJ, referred to in E xp W ibon.
But there are great dangers in treating government pronouncements, how ever
helpful, as an aid to statutory construction. I would prefer to base my conclusion,
that s 111(1) in principle empowers the SYPA to support D and M ’s defence (and
their participation in the judicial review against the DPP), upon those
considerations touching the correct construction o f the material statutory
provisions which I have already set out.
    If Cresswell and Latham JJ agree with this conclusion, it is enough to dispose
o f the case in the applicants’ favour. H ow ever w e heard much argument on the
question whether s 6 ( l) conferred on the police authority any power, in any
circumstances, to take action not otherwise expressly authorised. This engages
Miss Baxendale's proposition (a) as I have described it, and her reliance on the
‘expressio unius est exclusio alterius’ doctrine. It only has relevance if I am w rong
to hold, as I have done, that s 111(1) in principle enables the SYPA to fund D and
M even if s 6(1) does not itself em pow er the authority to do anything. In this
context I will deal only (and that shortly) with s 88(4) o f the 1996 Act, which as I
have said is the high-water mark o f this part o f Miss Baxendale's argument.
    Section 88 contains a comprehensive scheme as to liability on the part o f the
police for torts. By sub-s (1) the chief officer o f police for a police area is liable in
respect o f torts committed by constables under his direction and control in the
performance or purported performance o f their functions. W ithout this
provision there w ould be no such liability because police officers are not servants
but office holders. Subsection (2) provides in part:

       ‘There shall be paid out o f the police fund— (a) any damages or costs
     awarded against the chief officer o f police in any proceedings brought against
     him by virtue o f this section and any costs incurred by him in any such
     proceedings so far as not recovered by him in the proceedings ...’

Subsection (4) provides:

       ‘A police authority may, in such cases and to such extent as appear to it to
     be appropriate, pay out o f the police fund— (a) any damages or costs
     awarded against a person to w hom this subsection applies in proceedings for
     a tort committed by that person, (b) any costs incurred and not recovered by
     such a person in such proceedings, and (c) any sum required in connection
     w ith the settlement o f a claim that has or might have given rise to such
     proceedings.'

In m y judgment this provision offers no support for Miss Baxendale's reliance on
the ‘exclusio alterius’ rule. Section 88 is self-standing. It has no implications for
the general reach o f the police authority's functions. And once s 88(4) was to
allow the police authority to cover damages awarded against an officer in a tort
action, it is no surprise that it covers costs as well. If it did not, there might well
896                       All England Law Reports                  [1999] 2 All ER                HL

be an argument—based on the ‘exclusio alterius' rule— that costs were
deliberately excluded.                                                                       a
   In all these circumstances I do not think it necessary to go into the legislative
history o f s 6(1) o f the 1996 Act, or to canvass the arguments which were                        HOUSl
addressed to us as to the construction or effect o f its predecessor, s 4(1) o f the               LORD
1964 Act. In the end there are two possibilities: s 6(1) empowers the police                       OFCR-
authority to do things, or it does not. I have so far proceeded on the assumption        ^   b     26, 27 C
asserted by Miss Baxendale that it does not; but given that assumption,
nevertheless for reasons I have sought to explain, the SYPA possesses in principle

   In fact I think the better view is that s 6(1) enables the police authority to do
                                                                                                   bound
things which reasonably support the function which s 6(1) confers. Such a power
is by no means open-ended. It would not allow the authority to invade the                c   c
                                                                                                    In 19',

f   he had indeed referred                to the matter           in his press              release of

    which the text              has been set out          above.            He has said in               his

    affidavit that it was not                "a factor foremost in his                         mind when

    agreeing to the recommendation                      of the Panel".                  An applicant,

    whose    application            has    been        refused,       may     be        forgiven         for

    thinking that           a    factor so        referred        to in       a        press release,

    intended        as    justification           to     the    public            of     the     Panel's

    decision, must           have     played a         part     in that           decision.                It

    played, however, no part in the decisions of                              the other members

    according to their              affidavits.            When the matter                was raised,

    Mr. Million,          the Deputy        Head of Legal             Services, pointed                  out

    that there was a distinction between the                               complaintants and the

    other individuals             who were        personally at risk.                      As        to the

    effect of this           point on       the validity of                 the decision of the

    Panel, had it been otherwise sustainable,                              I will return to                     that

    when the        other       matters     of     alleged        misdirection             have        been

    considered.


           The next matter           was the        reference to            the fact that                the

    costs of Mr. Wilson and                Mr. Dalton had been met by                      the Police

    Federation.             It is not       in issue that             this factor was                taken

    into account          by the     Panel generally.                       It     appeared in the

    report     of     the       Panel's      decision:               see    page        47:            "Any

    reimbursement of costs                would in effect             be a reimbursement                  to

    the Police Federation of its costs".                             Mr. Underhill submitted

    that this       was wholly        irrelevant:              the     fact       that these            two

    officers had been supported by the Federation did not affect in

    any relevant         way the      merits of          their        applications, and,                  if

    their applications             were good, so           that they          were entitled               to

    reimbursement in whole or in part, they should be allowed.                                            It

                                          - 43 -
 is, of course, a        commonplace of the exercise of                    discretion as

 to costs in our courts              that, in general, no attention                    is paid

 to the fact that a plaintiff or defendant is entitled, in right

i: of his membership         of a     trade union, to           legal representation.

' His right to an order for             costs depends, in the ordinary case,

 upon the merits        of his        claim thereto.                 The fact that         his

 union supports him is as              irrelevant as the fact, if                 it should

 be the case, that he borrowed the money for                         his costs from his

 parents on terms        that he        would not be           expected to        repay it.

 Mr. Newman argued that that principle has no application in tfcA
                                                                                          - -


 context of the statutory             power of the Police Authority                    and of

 the guidance        given     in     the     Circular;          and     that     a    Police

 Authority is entitled to              refuse to reimburse the costs                   on the

 ground that     the officer           is not     personally           liable for        those

 costs.       For my     part, I        have no     doubt that Mr.              Underhill's

 primary submission is              correct ana that,          having regard to            the

 terms of the Circular, the                 mere fact that an officer                 has been

 provided     with     legal        representation        by     the      Federation            is

 irrelevant     to      the     question        whether         an     application         for

 reimbursement should be             granted.        It is           clear that in        sotk_

 cases the question whether reimbursement should                          be granted can

 only effectively be           decided by the        Police Authority when                 the

 result of the proceedings is known.                      Prior application by the

 officer t-o the       Police Authority           is not in          every case made            a

 condition of reimbursement.                    It seems clear           to me that        the

Home Office, in giving the guidance, and                        the local authority's

 association and the           police staff        associations, with whom                 the

 terms of the Circular were agreed, as is recited in paragraph 1

 of it, contemplated that,              in some cases, the             Federation might


                                     - 44 -
agree to provide representation in the first place and that the

individual officer would be free to seek reimbursement when the

result is known.        That conclusion does not             mean that a Police

Authority could in no case whatever have regard to                      whether the

Federation had provided the legal representation                   or whether it

had been paid for by        the officer personally.              An application

might be    very finely balanced,             having regard      to the     various

factors requiring to be weighed.                 If, in    a particular case, a

Police Authority was minded to take into account, in support of

a plea based     upon severe financial             hardship, that an        officer

was personally     liable        for    the     costs, I    consider      that     the

Authority would be       entitled to          have such regard      to it as        it

would think    proper      in     the circumstances.             In this     case,

however, it is clear on the evidence that                   the Panel, viewed as

a whole, did take       into account the fact that              reimbursement in

respect of these applications would "in fact be a reimbursement

to the Police Federation of its                costs".      It was, accordingly,

in my judgment thus        taking into account             an irrelevant matter.

One last point should be mentioned.                 A Police Authority is not

bound to make reimbursement according to the scale                      and cost of

representation incurred by an officer, or by                   the Federation on

his behalf, in     a case where            the Police Authority         judges that

reimbursement is proper.               A      Police Authority may decide           to

authorise reimbursement to             the extent        that was, in     its view,

having obtained proper           advice and       information, reasonable           in

the circumstances.


     The final point was           that added by amendment,             namely that

it was a misdirection           on the part of the         Panel to have regard

to the     fact that the        application for          reimbursement by        these

      Dear Chief Officer/Clerk.

      This circular:

      • provides updated guidance to police authorities on financial assistance to police
        officers in legal proceedings.

      • distinguishes between officers involved in civil proceedings, criminal
        proceedings and other types of legal proceedings.

      • replaces HO Circular 77/1987.
Introduction

1.     It is important that police officers should be able to carry out their duties in
the confidence that their police authority will support them, if they act in good faith
and exercise their judgement reasonably. The following guidance, which has been
prepared in consultation with ACPO, the Superintendents Association, the Police
Federation and the Association of Police Authorities, should be read against this
principle.

Civil Proceedings

2.      Tinder section 88 (11 of the Police Act .1996 which re-enacts section 48(1) of
the Police Act 1964 chief officers are liable lor torts committed by officers under
their direction and control. Section 88(2) provides that any damages or costs
awarded against the chief officer and any costs they incur themselves (which are not
recovered) should be met from police authority funds.

3.     Alternatively, a court may award damages against individual police officers.
Section 88(4) of the Police Act 1996 empowers a police authority “to such an extent
as appears to it to be appropriate” to pay any damages or costs awarded against
officers (this includes both officers of other forces serving in the police area under
mutual aid arrangements and special constables), any costs incurred by the officers
themselves and any sum paid in connection with the settlement of a claim. It is for
police authorities to decide when to make assistance available, taking account of the
circumstances of a particular case.

4.      Police authorities are reminded that the discretionary powers in sections
88(4") and (5 \p f the Act, enabling them to provide financial assistance to officers
involved in legal proceedings, apply to civil proceedings onlv. Sections 88(4) and
88(5) may also apply to police officers who were members at the time of the action
which gave rise to the claim but who are no longer members.

Criminal Proceedings

5.     Section 88(4) does not apply to criminal proceedings, but police authorities
may wish to consult their legal advisers' as to whether they have any other power to
provide such assistance (\Vhether in respect of private prosecutions or prosecutions
brought by the CPS). In this context, they may wish to note that section 111(1) of
the Local Government Act 1972 enables police authorities to do anything “which is
calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their
functions1’. The provision applies to provincial authorities (but not the Metropolitan
or City of London police) by virtue of Section 146A of the 1972 Act (as inserted
by Schedule 14 to the Local Government Act 1985 and amended by Schedule 4 of
the Police and Magistrates’ Courts Act 1994). It could be argued that to allow
payment to be made to officers (either former or serving) involved in criminal
proceedings would in some way facilitate or be conducive to a police authority’s
broad functions. For example, failure to provide financial assistance could
adversely affect the morale o f the force if officers had to meet their own costs after
an acquittal.

6.      It is for individual police authorities to decide in the particular circumstances
of a case, and on the basis o f legal advice, whether to make financial assistance
available to officers in criminal proceedings.      —

Other tvpes of legal proceedings

7.      5!"->ilsrlv there, is no exDrp,c<: sfatmory authority for providing financial
assistance m procccuings brougnt against poucc officers m tribunals otner than me
luui is. It is for police authorities outside London (bearing in mind the
recommendations o f chief officers) to decide whether to make financial assistance
available to officers (either former or serving) involved in Public Inquiries and
Tribunals. Police authorities will therefore need to consider whether section 111(1)
of the Local Government Act 1972 provides sufficient scope to enable financial
assistance to be given in any particular case. In this respect tribunals may include
certain industrial tribunals where it is clear that officers have acted in good faith in
pursuance o f their duties and the interest o f the force as a whole is involved. It is to
be expected that, where appropriate, the service’s grievance procedure
arrangements should be exhausted before there is recourse to legal proceedings.
These arrangements are set out in Home Office Circular 16/93, issued 10 March
1993.         “                   ;

8.      There are specific provisions in the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Sex
Discrimination Act 1975 for compensation, costs and expenses awarded against the
chief officer of police and any sum required for settlement, if approved by the
police authority, to be paid fr.om the police fund.

9.      There is no express statutory authority for providing financial assistance to
an officer wishing to initiate court proceedings. The considerations set out in
paragraphs 5 to 7 above apply to such cases.

  Dear Sir


 HOKE OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 77/87

 FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


  There is statutory authority in section 4 8 of the Police Act 19 64 for
  pa.yr.ents to be cade fron the police fund to neet expenditure ^.incurred
  by police officers in defending proceedings in tort. Also, acting in
  pursuance of its general statutory duty to naintain &n~~afd'6ouate~ and
  ef?lrlent~ police" force fo'r~ its area, the police authority has
  discretion to neet expenditure inctlrrecT by officers in all kinds of
  legal proceedings vhere the officers have acted in good faith in
   'ursuance of their duties, "or the interests of the force as a vhole
   ’
   .re involved.    The purpose of this circular is to give guidance to
 ,police authorities to help thea in considering requests on behalf of
-"'officers for financial assistance.    This guidance has been discussed
  and agreed with the local authority and vith the police staff
  associations.

 2.    The central principle vhich should guide consideration of
 individual cases is that, vhere a police authority considers that an
 officer has acted in good faith in pursuance of his duties or that
 the interests of a force, as a vhole are involved, the officer should
 have the support of the police authority to ensure that he has the
 services of a lawyer and that he should not be out of pocket.      The
 following paragraphs provide general guidance to the different
 classes of proceedings.   Payments aade to officers in accordance vith
 this guidance will be eligible for police grant.



                                                                                 1
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

Prosecution bv the Crown Prosecution Service

 3.   An officer who is the subject of a public prosecution for an
 alleged offence committed vhile carrying out his duties as a police
 officer is in the same position as any other defendant and must be
 expected to bear the costs of his defence.   If he is acquitted, he
 should,   like  any   other defendant,    look to the court for
 reimbursement cf his expenses.   If the costs are not paid, or not
 paid in full from central funds, the police authority are in a
 position to decide, on the full facts, whether or not to make a
 payment to the officer or to the Police Federation if they have
 provided the funding.    There nay be cases where it is proper to
"provide legal advice and/or legal representation even where -the
 officer is found guilty.   This nay arise for example in test cases
where the officer has been carrying out a practice hitherto
approved of but is found guilty as a result of that practice being
 found unlawful by the court in the light of the circumstances of
that particular case.


Private P r o s e c u t i o n s ,

4. A police officer should be able to carry out his duties in the
confidence that, if he acts in good faith and exercises his
judgement reasonably, his police authority will support him.
in a case where a member of the public brings a prosecution against
an officer, the authority is satisfied that the officer has actec
in this way, the Authority should provide or fund legal advice
and/cr representation.
5.   Where a court decides that- a prosecution brought against ar.
officer was not brought in good faith, it may order the prosecutor
to pay the whole or any part of the costs incurred by the defence;
again, if the officer is acquitted on indictment, his costs may be
met from central funds.   In either of these cases, the question of
the police authority providing financial support to the officer may
not 'arise.  However, where the costs of an acquitted officer are
not awarded by the court or awarded only in part, the police
authority should consider whether to reimburse any_ costs not
covered, taking into account the reasons, if any, given by the
court for failing to award all costs claimed.


CIVIL PROCEEDINGS
Civil Actions           Acainst     the   Chief   Officer   for   Wrongful   Acts   of
Constables.
6.   Under section 48(1) of the Police Act 1964, the chief officer
of a force is liable in respect of torts committed b y c o n s t a b l e s
under his direction and control (which includes special c o n s t a b l e s
and officers of other forces serving in the police area under
mutual   aid  arrangements)    in the performance    or p u r p o r t e d
performance of their functions. Under section 48(2) any damages
                                                                                     2
costs avarded against the chief officer in such proceedings, ar.y
costs he incurs himself, and any. sun paid in connection with the
settlement of .a claim, provided the settlement is approved by the
police authority, nust be paid out of the police fund. ^ In such
cases, therefore, the police authority's discretion extends only to
whether or not to approve a proposed settlenent of the claim.


Civil Actions Acainst Individual Police Officers

7.    Alternatively, the plaintiff nay be avarded danages against an
individual police officer, though he cannot recover the damages
twice over against the chief officer as veil. Section 48(4) of the
Police Act 1964 specifically enpovers a police authority "to such
extent as they think fit" to pay out _of the police fund any danages
or costs avarded against an officer, any costs he incurs himself,
and any sums paid in connection vith the settlement of a claim.
This    provision   applies to actions against officers of the
authority's ovn force, officers of another force serving the police
area under mutual aid arrangements, and special constables for the
police area.    In considering whether to.give financial assistance
the authority vill wish to consider in particular yhether the
officer concerned acted in good faith and- exercised his judgement
reasonably.   Where the court finds for the officer, he may seek his
costs from the plaintiff; should the costs not be ^ avarcea or
ava.rded only in part, the police authority should consider vhether
to reimburse any costs not covered, taking * into account the
reasons, if any, given by the court for failing to avard all costs
claimed.
£.   Joint actions naming both the chief officer and an individual
nolice officer nay be brought in scne cases.   In such cases it is
important that any discussion of the merits and quantum of the
nrcncsed settlenent should involve all the parties named in the
claim together vith advisers even if they are represented by
different advisers.


Civil Actions Under the Data Protection Act 1984

9.    Under sections 22 and 23 of the Data Protection Act 1SS4 an
individual vho suffers damage as a result of the inaccuracy, loss
or unauthorised disclosure of personal data is entitled to
condensation from the data user. In the absence of any case lav on
'these provisions,   it is unclear vhether the acts covered by
sections 22 and 23 amount to. torts, to vhich the guidance in
naragranhs 6 and 7 above applies. If not, section 48 of the Police
Act 1964 does not apply.      However, the position is broadly the
same.     Under section 38 (3) (a) of the 1984 -.Act constables are
treated as servants of the chief officer for the purposes of the
Act.    A chief constable is therefore liable for the acts of his
officers falling vithin sections 22 and 23 in the cane vay as he is
liable for their torts under section 48(1).    The position of non­
police officers is less clear but it is possible that in some cases
the chief constable night be regarded as having liability for their
acts.   It follovs that it vould be proper for the police authority
to aeet all costs, including any award of coapensatipn, arising
frca this liability.  It should be noted that the liability of the
"data user" under the Act is not vicarious but his personal
liability. Therefore his own care in having instituted a sys'tea of
obtaining, checking and recording data which would reasonably .guard
against error and loss under section 23(3) of the Act should aeet
his responsibility under section 22(3) and he should not be held
liable if one of his officers disregards the systea established.

10.   Khere coapensation is sought froa an individual officer, the
police authority will wish, in considering vhether to aeet the
costs vhich vould otherwise fall on the officer, to take account of
the saae aatters as in exercising their pover under section 48(4)
of the Police Act 1964 (see paragraph 7).        Police authorities
should apply the sane broad principles and in particular, Beet the
costs of any coapensation avarded against a chief constable vhere a
non-police officer is at fault and the chief constable is found to
have liability for the actions perforaed.


Police Officers Bringing Civil Actions for Defamation

11.   There aay be occasions vhen financial, assistance is sought
froa a police authority to enable an officer to bring or consider
bringing a civil action for defaaation.          An authority has
discretion to give such assistance but it vill be eligible fcr
police crant only if the following criteria are all aet:-

     (a)   the defaaation is serious?

     (b)   it relates to the actions of an officer acting or
     said to be acting in the discharge of his duty;

     (c)   it has attracted public attention;

     (c)    to bring the action is considered to be in the
     interests, of the force or of the police service as a
     vhole; and
     (e)   the action stands a reasonable chance of success.

Criterion (d) is central.       If only the reputation of the individual
officer is in question, he is in the saae position as any other
citizen and aust be expected to seek his ovn raaedy.              But an
allegation against a particular officer say veil reflect on the
reputation of the vhole force or be an exaaple of vider allegations
against the force or a significant section of it.          In such cases
the p o l i c e authority,- provided the other criteria are satisfied,
aay reasonably be expected to help to defend the reputation of the
force.




                                                                       4
INQUESTS, PUBLIC ENQUIRIES AND TRIBUNAL

Lecal Representation for Chief Officers

12.  Any interested arty may be legally represented at an inquest
but at his own expense since expenses are payable only to witnesses
and jurors.   An interested party will normally be entitled to be
legally represented at a public enquiry or other public tribunal.
Where the interest of the force is affected, it will be appropriate
for the police authority to provide at its expense for the chief
officer to be legally represented on behalf of the force.


L-ecal Representation for Individual Officers
13.  Separate representation for individual officers whose interest
is involved nay be necessary. For exanple, there will be occasions
when (a) the chief officer's legal representative cannot reasonably
be expected to represent the separate interests of such officers
and (b) the police authority considers that such interests should
be represented.   In such cases the authority should give financial
assistance to the officers.        In considering   (b) above, the
authority will wish in particular to assess vhether the officers
are at risk of being held to blame for actions in connection vith
the death to which the inquest relates and vhether any such finding
nicht give rise to legal proceedings for the costs of vhich the
police authority would be liable under section 48(1) of the Police
Act IS64 or for vhich financial assistance night be appropriate
vithin the terns of this circular.


APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
14.   A t. officer wishing to seek financial assistance fron his
police authority should have the opportunity in advance of as veil
as on the conclusion of the proceedings to subnit to the chief
officer an application for financial assistance. The chief officer
should put this, together vith his ovn reconnendation to the police
authority foir decision. • The officer should normally be given the
opportunity by the police authority to sake representations to the;.,
if he wishes to do so.
15.   If it decider to give financial assistance, the authority
should inforn the officer concerned that, if the infornation or.
which they based their decision to grant the assistance is -shown in
subsequent legal proceedings to be inaccurate or incomplete, the
authority vill noraally expect to recover the money unless it is
satisfied that no c u l p a b l e nisrepresentation vas involved and that
to recover the noney vould involve the applicant in substantial
hardship.   On the other hand, if an authority refuses financial
assistance and then discovers in the light of subsequent even s
that such assistance vould have been warranted, then financial
assistance should be granted in order to meet the r e a s o n a b l e cos.s
incurred by the officer in seeking legal advice or assistance.
  Assistance from Police Federation Funds

  16. Under Regulation 19 of the Police Federation Regulations 1S6S,
  as amended, Federation funds nay' be used to defray legal charges
  incurred by a Eerier in connection vith criminal proceedings
  brought against him for an offence under the road traffic
  enactments (other than offences involving driving vhen impaired by
  drink or drugs or taking a vehicle vithout authority), or for
  offences of causing the death or injury of any person, or for ar.v
  assault, or in connection vith his action for libel or slander. An
  officer seeking financial assistance in circumstances covered by
  Regulation 19 should seek such assistance from the police authority
  in the first instance.   If the police authority does not consider
  the request to fall vithin the terms of this circular, the
  Federation may then consider the application vithin the terms of
  Regulation 19.   If the officer receives legal assistance from the
  Federation the terms of Home Office Circular No 2 6/19 67 vill
  continue to apply.

               I am a single man and I live at the above address with my family.
                                                      /
               On Saturday 15th April          1989 3/went to watch the semi-final              between

              Liverpool and Nottingham F/orest a t Hillsborough                     in Sheffield,

               I am a life long supporter of Liverpool            F.C.

               I got a £6.00 ticket for the match from a person I know called



               He is a steward for                             based in both Liverpool and

              Birkenhead.       The ticket was for the Leppings                lane end for B stand.

               On the day of the ^rfatch I travelled in a car with 4 other                     people?



                                                                                                KJ »1

        ■     on the way to th6T~‘Tft»tc-h^                we stopped at a garage              in Stockport

to use the toilet.

On the way we were delayed at                island at the end of the motorway for

about    10-15 minutes.   We w^re also delayed at the end of the motorway

coming into Sheffield J ?or 10-15 minutes.            Both times the delays

appeared to be due to the volume of traffic.

We arrived in Sheffield at about 2pm and parked up near to a school                   in

Parkside Road, Sheffield.              x

Before we got to the g r o u n / y saw several        hundred fans sitting near a

gateway store in E skda ^ ^ ^ o a d .       This happened over a period of time

and I saw the fan^ j^er<e buying and dr inking cans and bott 1 es of b e e r .

The gateway store was in a small shopping precinct.

On the way to the ground we d i d n ’t receive any kind of direction or

escort by police officers and on the way I d i d n ’t see any kind of

trouble such as fighting or drunkeness.              I got to the entrance to the

ground at about 2.30pm,       When Iy<fot to the turnstiles there were no
                ------                 S                                      "
orderly queues but just      loadjr of people.        Outside the turnstiles there

were 3 mounted policemen £mt they didn't give any directions or any

other sort of help that j l     saw.

I d i d n ’t see any stewards at the turnstiles.

I didn't have any difficulty in finding the turnstiles as I have been

to the ground before,      I went to the semi-final at Hillsborough           last

year.

I had great difficulty to get through the turnstiles as 1 was being

squashed against the turnstiles by everyone else trying to get through,

When 1 got through the tuorist i 1es I saw a gate open on my right hand

side and a crowd oft peooie were coming through.             Although they were

coming   in quite quickly they were not running and although there were

a fair amount of people coming through they were not disorderly the

way they were coming through.              When I saw the gate open it would have

been about 2.40pm.

                                                                                                            SI 447

      Before    I got through the turnstiles               I saw 1 or 2 people                     climbing on to

      the wall to the left of the turnstiles but I could not see if they

      dropped over the side into the ground.                   When I went through the

      turnstiles    I handed my ticket _y

      Once   inside the g r o u n d ^1 djra not see any signs directing me where to
                                           ■- ■■■■ ■"               ...................

      go but I saw the tunnel       in front o f ,me and everyone was going that

      way so I went through the tunnel.                  I was on my own at this stage as I

      had got split up with            at the turnstiles.                                 I had a free passage

      along the tunnel and 1 can't remember seeing any police or stewards

      anywhere near the tunnel.

      I didn't see any sort of incidents of dissorder or anyone drinking

      alcohol    in the ground.

      When   I got to the end of the tunnel               1 went to the right of the fence

      and into pen number 3 and I took upmy match viewing                                     position     at about
g y   2.45pm and I was about 2 thirds down pen 3 and up against the                                        fence

      between pens 3 and 4 (Grid                        & 6 H ).

      at about 3pm I saw a b§r"rier lifted                  and thrown at the fence in front

      of the pitch.     It>at     the fence and I think                         it bounced back          into the

      crowd.    This happened about 6-7 yards away from me but I did not see

      the barrier actually break.

      When I first took up my match viewing                  position I w a s n ’t standing with

      anyone    I knew and at that time, I was not subjected to any crowd crush.

      I saw some fans who were on the fence and when the crowd shouted at

      them to get off they couldn't.          I also saw a lad near to me who had

      his leg caught    in the fence.     He was screaming and although I couldn't

      see his leg I got the impression it was                      impaled.                 This was because of

      the position he was    in on top of the actual                            fencing.         His arms and his

      body were across    peoples heads and he was screaming                                   in agony.

      He was                                              white         lad wearing              loose clothing.

      About 2.55pm to 3.10pm I was       involved in a crowd crush.                                 There did not
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                S I 447

seem to be a surge of people but just a cont>ffuous crush.

While    I was in the crowd crush I was mjpfed forward and to the right

(Grid Ref 7 G ) ,   I saw a man about gypersons away from me to my right.

His nose was bleeding and he was shouting.              He was a white man about

EOish with short hair                                                     I didn't

see hirn again and I heard a man just on my right hand side screaming

"I'm standing on somebody."             The crowd then moved back to make a

little gap to try and get the person up but within seconds the gap was

filled again.                /
                            /
Just after this I felt what/I think was someone's arm underneath my
                                    e

feet.     I was so close to tjAe man who shouted that           I could have been
                             /
                                f
standing on the same person he was shouting about.                I couldn't avoid

standing on    the person tiiere was        no where el^e to go.

By this time we were shoiting to            get the / e nces down at the front and

for    the crowd to push ba:k.

I saw loads of fans getting over the ^ e n c e at the f r o n t .        They were

then leaning over the fence to help/other fans out.                There were also a

few pol i ce of f i cers do ing this bu.t not m a n y .

Also from the time I had got intis the pens            people from the stand above

were    pulling fans out of the p/ns and this          continued to go on.       I saw

a policeman who told the fans/in the stands to carry on getting the

fans out of the pens.

I had been moved in the crakd over to my right and slightly back

towards the    tunnel   (Grid Ref 3E,       3 F , 4E, 4 F ) when I saw that   fans were

pulling the    front fence drijwn with their bare hands half           way along

pen 4 (Grid Ref 8M & SIM).          \When we saw this we all     realised and

shouted to pull the fences down at the front of us.

About    10 minutes after this most of the people had got out through

holes in the fence and back through the tunnel.               I was just standing

about.    I was looking for my brother but I don't            really know why I was

                    just standing about.             During this time there were                   loads of bodies

                    everywhere and I saw a man spread eagled lying face-down.                                 I turned
                                             _   _   _   _   :
                                                             _   _   .s'
                    him over because           I might be able to p e l p him.
                                          I thought                            His eyes
                                                               /                 ----------
                    were wide open and glazed and his face w a 1 ue and purple

                                                                 I realised he/was dead.           I felt his neck but

                    I couldn't feel any pulse , I rememb^r that he was still warm and his

L            ,      skin felt dead thick.                The man hjffl black short hai r and a black

                    moustache.     He was a white m;                         in his late 2 Q ’s and was well    built.

             r~°l   The man was lying about ha^f way down the pen and slightly to the                                     left
          (
                    (Grid Ref 3 F ).     I remember that                      I saw another    lad nearby who was

                    probably kneel i ng o vjfr           somebody.              I said to him "Do you know first
         K
    0.              aid?"     He said "Yeah" and just                        carried on kneeling there looking at
    A/V
    4/              the body.    This other body would have been slightly to the front and

                    right of the body I turned over                           (Grid Ref 6E).

                    I seem to remember that either the man I turned over or the body that

                    the man was leaning over had a brown leather jacket on.                                The body that

                    the man was leaning over was a white man but t h a t ’s all                           I can say

                    about him.     I think that if I saw a photograph of the man 1 turned

                    over I would recognise him.

                    A few minutes      later I could see a hole                       in the fence at the bottom left

                    hand side of pen 3 and as I went down to get out of the pen through

                    the fence I could see that there was a piy^e of b od ie s which were                              piled

                    up just a few inches be 1ow the wall a ^ A h e                        bottom of the f e n c e .   I

                    thought there were perhaps 40 to 50/podies there and just as I was

                    getting out a fan asked me to hel^p and there were 3 or 4 of them

                    trying to pull a body out of the pile but the feet of the body was

                    caught.     I tried to help them,                       but we   c ou l d n ’t get his feet out so I

                    just went through the hole                           in the fence onto the pitch.

                    I remember that     in amongst the mound of people was a young lad about

                    •15 to 16 years.     His face was purple and blue and he was facing back
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                S1447

towards the tunnel.       I realised he was       dead and   I can only

remember that he was      a   white   lad. This   lad   was half way down the

mound of bodies and was about half way along the fence             leading to the

pitch (Grid Ref 8 E ) .

I left the ground about 3.45pm to go to phone home and then went back

into the ground.    I finally left the ground at about 4.10pm of my own

accord but after   I had heard £ loudspeaker announcements.              The     1st one

said not to leave the ground in a hurry so as to assist the medical

services and the 2nd one said to keep your ticket stubs or tickets.

I remember that when the crush was happening and I saw the fans

getting over the fence at the front,         that there was a young lad being

passed overhead towards the front who         looked like he had fainted.

Earlier on when I mentioned that the fans were drinking near a gateway

store,   I said that I didn't    receive any police direction.           But     I

remember now that there was a mounted policeman who moved us all on

from near the shop.

After the match had       been stopped I saw a line of police officers

standing across thepitch.       They were just standing there doing

nothing while some police officers and Liverpool             fans were doing their

best to help the   injured.     These police officers fhould have been
                                                       /
                                                     /
helping as they are       all trained in first aid. /

I also saw 2__St Johns ^Ambulance men .jump oveiy the f ence to he 1 p the

injured.    I think this was the bravest thi^g          I have ever s e e n .        _

Before   I goT FnTXhr ough the turnstiles         I /saw people who had fainted in

the crush outside being carried overhe/d and I think that the                   police

officer who opened the gate outside ja id          right as there would have been

people hurt outside    in the   crush.     It was bad enough when we were

trying to get through but must have been worse            later.    He either did

the right thing opening the gate or there should have been more                      police

outside organising the crowd.

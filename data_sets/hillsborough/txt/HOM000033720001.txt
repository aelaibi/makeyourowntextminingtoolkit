 HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY

 Issue

 We have received further correspondence from relatives of the Hillsborough victims,
 referring both to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s recent off-the-cuff comments in
 Liverpool, and to what they perceive to be the limitations of the Judge’s terms of
 reference (enclosed behind).

 Timing

 2.      Routine.

 Recommendation

 3.      That you reply to the correspondence along the lines of the attached drafts.

Consideration

4.    My submission of 22 October (attached) covered the background and reaction
to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s comments. He remains committed to the scrutiny, and
has not indicated that he finds his terms of reference to be restrictive.

Handling/presentation

5.     Hillsborough disaster relatives have in the past received S of S replies. There
are no additional handling considerations.

Terms of reference




To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available;


       (a) to the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


       (b) to the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Attorney
          Generalfor the purpose o f discharging their respective
         statutory responsibilities; or


      (c) to the Chief Officer o f South Yorkshire Police in relation to
         police disciplinary matters;


and in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously
available is o f such significance as to justify establishment by the
Secretary o f State for the Home Department o f afurther public
inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their attention any
evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action
which should be taken in the public interest
Mr and Mrs J P Joynes




Thank you for your letter of 21 October about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny
into the Hillsborough disaster.


The terms of reference which I have given Lord Justice Stuart-Smith for the Scrutiny
will allow him to establish conclusively whether any material evidence was
overlooked in the consideration of the causes of the disaster or the consideration of
criminal or other proceedings. The Judge will also be able to recommend any other
action which should be taken in the public interest. His terms of reference are,
therefore, very wide indeed and I am confident that they will allow him to carry out a
full scrutiny of the evidence which has been submitted by the families and others.


The Judge spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of those who died and
listening to their concerns. He has said that he found these meetings fruitful and
constructive, and that they will help him to write his report.


I am satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will provide a thorough report in which
the families and the public can have confidence.

Thank you for your letter of 27 October about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s reported
comment during his recent visit to Liverpool.


I am sorry that you were upset by the Judge’s comment to Mr Phil Hammond. The
Judge has said on the record that he deeply regrets this remark, which he made off-
the-cuff and without any intention to offend or for it to be taken seriously. He has
made clear that the behaviour of the fans is not the subject of the Scrutiny.

I am sure you will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on
the detailed issues you raise in your letter, many of which fall within the remit of the
Scrutiny. As I have indicated before, I will make public the advice given by Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith in his report, and will take whatever action is needed in the event
that he suggests material evidence about the disaster has been overlooked.


As you know, the Judge spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of those

HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY

Issue

We have received the attached letters from relatives of the Hillsborough victims and
Dr Ed Walker, who treated the victims of the disaster, calling for you to appoint a new
person to head the Hillsborough Scrutiny in place of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. This
follows the publicity surrounding the Judge’s off-the-cuff comments at his meeting
with the families. Although the correspondence is marked for reply by officials, it
would seem more appropriate for a reply to be sent from your office. Hillsborough
disaster relatives have in the past received S of S replies.

Timing

2.      Routine.

Recommendation

3.    Draft letters, expressing confidence in the integrity of Lord Justice Stuart
Smith’s scrutiny, are attached for your signature [or for Private Secretary signature as
appropriate].

Consideration

4.     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s flippant remark to Mr Phil Hammond, a member
of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, about late arriving Liverpool fans
received widespread publicity. The incident occurred as he welcomed relatives of the
victims of the Hillsborough disaster to a specially organised event in Liverpool at
which he was to meet the relatives and listen to their representations.

5.      The Judge issued an immediate apology for his comments and the offence
caused and the meetings went ahead as planned. Inevitably, some of the relatives
consider that the Judge has compromised his position and would like a new person
appointed to head the scrutiny.

6.     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was appointed at the end of June this year to
conduct the Hillsborough Scrutiny. As well the event in Liverpool, he has received
written and oral submissions from the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG)


f:\oppu\complnts\advice\mp-0353.doc
and other interested parties. He has also visited Hillsborough to see the site of the
disaster. Despite his unfortunate, off-the-cuff comments to Mr Hammond, the Judge
is very committed to the scrutiny and the draft replies to these letters express our
satisfaction with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s ability to conduct a thorough scrutiny.

Presentation/handling

7.     There are no additional handling considerations at this time.

Dear Home Secretary.
                                     Re   Hillsborough Scrutiny.

It is with great sadness we write to you regarding the Hillsborough Scrutiny, after two


•
meetings with Lord Justice Stuart -Smith , firstly with other families then a 30minute
nr
private  meeting after which we were convinced that the terms of reference are far to
narrow to give any semblance of a way forward to the rightful justice we deserve.

New Evidence The missing video tape of events prior to 3-00 pm showing the build-up
of over crowding in pens 3 & 4.
Having visited the control box during the inquest it was plain to see with the naked eye
the build -up to over crowding in the central pens and the lack of supporters in the side
pens. Surely any intelligent person would ask himself why this was happening and realise
that too many people were coming through the tunnel and not being directed to the side
pens. I mention inteligence for its something I was led to beleive all Police Officers had,
let alone Superintendents who controlled the box or was there a lack of assistance from
the established officers to the "NEW BOY" .Duckinfield due to the removal of "their"
Commander Chief Superintendent Brian Mole who was relieved of his command due to
disciplinary measures taken by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Peter Wright due
to an embarrassing prank that whent terribly wrong ( details of which I enclose in this
letter.
Police Disciplinary enquiry was conducted by the Chief Constable of South Cumbria and
was conveniently side stepped by Duckinfield and Murray, the evidence gathered by the
afore mentioned should be made available to Lord Justice Stuart -Smith in full.
The 3 -15 pm Cut-off time by the Coroner was a complete cover-up so as not to allow
questions to be asked regarding the emergency services when it is known that many of
the fans who died were still alive after that time and with proper medical treatment and
care would still be alive today.
All theseoinanswered questions need to be answered UNDER OATH in a court of law.We
look tc/yoi/Jp be forthcoming in ordering a new enquiry.

     Rt. Hon. E O’Hara

Dear Mr Straw,
                                                                 Re c e iv e d          ;

                       The Hillsborough Disaster, April 1989
                           Scrutiny of “New Evidence”

We are writing to express our extreme dismay in relation to the remark made by Lord
Justice Smith on Monday, 6 October, along with other issues we believe require
comment. As you may be aware the remark was made to Mr Hammond who lost his
14 year old son at Hillsborough. Far from being “late" for our meeting with Lord
Justice Smith, quote, “like Liverpool fans arriving at Hillsborough” we, along with the
other families awaited his arrival at the venue for the initial meeting; whilst he played
court to the media circus. We would like to say, never has any member of the
Establishment generated such intense disgust, but we have found this sort of
ignorant/arrogant behaviour commonplace.

We have personally expressed our opinions as to the remark to Lord Justice Smith.
He did apologise, but may we add, many of the families felt that the proceedings had
already been undermined.

We attended a second personal meeting on Tuesday, 7 October, in relation to the
circumstances surrounding the loss of our son James. The conclusion we came to
following the meeting, was that Lord Justice Smith is far from “open minded”. Our
initial optimism that a new Government would bring a fresh “open” approach to the
issues is waning rapidly.

We have been advised that if the outcome of the “scrutiny” is unfavourable our legal
options are limited. This is because six of the families received a Judicial review.
Why should the remaining families be penalised? We would welcome clarification,
we believe this is grossly unfair given that generalisations as to the specific
circumstances surrounding the loss of our loved ones cannot be made.

We have studied the statement you made to the House of Commons on Monday, 30
June, 1997, and we request clarification of a number of points relating to your
statement and other matters.
(i)     If, as you state, Lord Taylor cited the main reason for the disaster was the
          failure of police control, how could the DPP find that there was insufficient
          evidence for a prosecution(s)?

(ii)    Is it not true that Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and indirectly, the Football
         Association owed a Common Law Duty of Care to the spectators on that fateful
         day, to ensure their health and safety whilst on the premises? If so are there
         not grounds for a civil prosecution for negligence?

(iii)   Could you explain why the Coroner’s rules, whilst prohibiting the framing of an
        inquest verdict in such a way as to appear to determine any question of
        criminal liability; can be used as a means of restricting the terms of reference,
        “3.15 pm cut off”, of subsequent investigations, e.g. the scrutiny. It is a fact
        that some of our loved ones were alive post 3.15 pm, yet events after this time
        cannot be investigated. We request that you intervene even at this late stage
        and amend the terms of reference to include evidence after 3.15 pm.

(iv) Could you explain why the blood alcohol concentration of the deceased,
     including children was determined and used in the inquest? Yet the blood
     alcohol levels of those who where responsible for their safety were not
     assessed? Could you determine on our behalf why Dr Popper chose to include
     this data as evidence and yet discount so much other information?

(v)     Could you explain why the HSE were never involved in the investigations into
        the disaster as you know they carry a Royal Warrant and are quite capable o f
        investigating organisations, e.g. Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

(vi)    Could you provide a copy of the DPP’s conclusions as to why no person should
        be subject to criminal proceedings? This disaster was not an “Act of God”, our
        loved ones were killed due to human failings at every level.

(vii) Could you explain why investigations into possible criminal proceedings
      against the Police are conducted by the Police? This undermines public
      confidence, and requires review. We require an organisation similar to the FBI.
      I hope you will consider such a possibility in future legislation to improve our
      democratic process.

(viii) The Police Complaints Authority found that both the Chief Superintendent in
       charge on the day, and Superintendent should face disciplinary charges for
       neglect of duty. Why can retirement due to ill health be used as an escape
       route. The Police disciplinary rules must be changed. Does not a vicarious
       liability remain with the South Yorkshire Police? Please clarify.

(ix)    Forgive us, but we do not understand how the Attorney General and the DPP
        can say that the new evidence does not justify fresh criminal investigations, if
        the independent scrutiny by Lord Justice Smith finds in our favour, their “view”
        is wrong. It appears almost like a verdict being reached before there is a trial,
        please explain, as we are beginning to see the scrutiny as a sham, a tactic, a
        device, of which we have many examples over the past 8 years.
 (X)   Wacld*y° U-i?)IiPlain*u[iere the “evidence not Previously available” came from?
          as it wilfully withheld/filtered out or “conveniently" lost? Provided the
       circumstances surrounding this evidence can be established, is not withholding
       evidence a criminal offence?                                           i«»iwiamg

We believe only a comprehensive unfettered review/inquiry of all of the evidence and
        ®u™ u" ding the tra9ec|y both before, during and after will satisfy our desire
for the truth. Irrespective of the outcome of the “Scrutiny” our resolve will remain
events on           Ti     goal. ° Ur Nves were irrevocab|y changed as a result of the
nriof onH 1           « y’ we       e seen families tom apart, lost lovedones through
grief and stress, suffered all manner of slander/libel at the hands of the media and
E eS2!0naJ Pe?.ple‘ To you this is one of manv issues- to all of the families the fight
for truth and justice has become the focus of our lives.

Thank you in advance for taking the trouble to answer our questions.

Yours expectantly,




Mr & Mrs Aspinall

The Home Secretary /
Rt. Hon. Jack Straw

c.c. Rt. Hon. T Blair
     Rt. Hon. M Eagle

Dear Mr Straw,

                        The Hillsborough Disaster April 1989
                            Scrutiny of “New Evidence”

We are writing to express our serious concern in relation to the remark made by Lord
Justice Smith on Monday, 6 October, 1997, along with other matters. The remark
was made in full view of the media, the context of the remark and the person to
whom it was made generated intense distress. Mr Hammond lost his 14 year old son
at Hillsborough, we cannot find anything “humorous" in the circumstances that
surrounded the loss of our loved ones.

To infer, however flippantly, that one of the factors in the disaster was the late arrival
of Liverpool fans, gives credence to one of the many myths created following the
tragedy. Late arrival at public events by large numbers of people has always been a
common occurrence. To my knowledge this factor is always considered in the
planning of policing of major public events, so effective crowd control can be
ensured. At the semi final of 1988, same teams, same venue, same terracing
allocation; the crowd was filtered through police lines at least 100 yards from the
turnstiles. In 1989 the police singularly failed in their common law duty of care to the
public arriving at the venue.

We have already expressed our revulsion to the Lord Justice at his remarks and he
has apologised. Unfortunately, the tone of the proceedings were marred as a result.
This is not the first and probably not the last time we have suffered as a result of
unprofessionalism from so called professional people.

We attended a second pre-arranged private meeting on Tuesday, 7 October. Any
residual confidence which we had in Lord Justice Smith was eroded still further by
comments made during our discussions. The conclusion we came to following the
meeting was that Justice Smith does not appear to have an open mind in relation to
the issues which surround the disaster; even though he denied this.

With reference to the letter we received from you relating to the Scrutiny, you stated
that no matter of significance would be overlooked”. The terms of reference for the
Scrutiny are extremely limited, could you explain this apparent contradiction?
 We consider the suppression of evidence at the original inquests to be of paramount
 e S n ^ V       acc° rdin9.t0 the terms of reference this cannot be classified as “new
 evidence . To our utter dismay 3.15 pm will again be used as a legal device fo™
 evading a thorough and open assessment of the events.

             hke t0 ? ke this 0PP0rtun'ty to raise some further points and request that
 the following questions must be answered;-


 * ta S # d ta S 5 ? ,he Ma’0r ACClden‘ a"d Emergency Plan" Put in,° o r a tio n

 *   Why were only 14 of the 96 victims of the tragedy taken to hospital?

 *                ' *he l? raT dlC* sta,ioned o ^ id e the ground allowed access to
     attend to the casualties?

 Again Lord Justice Smith operating within the "shackles" of his terms of reference
 ^    h     S       S     ^              Y° U “ ,he H0me Secre,arV have the power to




                 ,th! t LaW a"0Wed criminals the right to rewrite their statements to put
them in a better light, our prisons would be empty.

^ i ^ ’ and. W|N continue, to conduct our campaign constructively, but as
highlighted earlier, we are becoming more pessimistic as to the outcome of the
scrutiny given its inherent handicap. After eight years of inquests/additional reviews
country ^       ^       er naive in respect of the vagaries of the legal process of this


The fact that the Government appointed Lord Justice Smith, brings us to the belief
that you must have some knowledge of his apparent “pre-disposition” to the issues.
We have as a result, to consider the Government’s “pre-disposition” and what
they/you are prepared to consider a reasonable outcome.

We will shortly reach a decision as a family on the way the Scrutiny is proceeding
and if possible we would welcome a response to the matters raised to aid our
decision.

May we add that irrespective of the outcome of the “Scrutiny” our resolve to see truth
and justice triumph will remain unabated. We owe no less and much more to the
memory of all the victims of the disaster, not withstanding the personal loss of our
son and his girlfriend. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

Yours respectfully,

            HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND 150489

            With reference to incidents                  related to the above football          ground on

            Saturday 15 April            1989      ( 150489)    I submit the following       report.

            At 2.05 pm (1405)             pm on Saturday 15 April            1989 (150489)    I was

            covering D2 61 duties on mobile                     p at ro l.

            At this t i m e , I attended a report of a transit van depositing                          litter

            on Jacobs Drive, Sheffield.

            The       call originated from             Jacobs Drive, ,the i nformant being a

                             On a t t e n da nc e , I saw that a large amount of paint had been
[JofooM
            thrown across a              grassed area (well-kept)            bordering the property at C

       j    jaco
            Jacobs Juriv e.         Approximately twenty empty beer               cans were    littered

                        this a r e a .    There was also a small amount of furniture at the

                       location.

                 e residents of several              prope rt i es had obtai ned the transit v a n ’s

                egistered number as,                           A Police National Computer        check
                                                                       MY-
  cfa?      revealed that the keeper was a                                         of

                                 Liver p o o l .

  /         Unf &.rtunate ly none of the residents appeared to have witnessed the
   o / I!s" actual
             I )         deposition of the litter.
                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                          R74

         However,         when they approached the vehicle to show their obvious

         disapproval,         the o c cupants showed their bare backs i des to them

         through the vehicle glass.            It then drove off onto Shi regreen L n .          It

         was    clear that these      people were .intoxicated and from the Police

         National Computer         c h e c k , I be 1 i eve that they were Liverpool   fans.

         I therefore         circulated the vehicle,    asking match control      to be made

         aware at Hi 1 lsborough,       with the intention of having the driver breath

         tested.

         It was also my intention to have a report              compiled and forwarded to
 #       the Merseyside P o l ice, with a view to interview regarding              the litter

         offence,         should the vehicle not be found.

         However since the incident at the ground and lack of direct                   evidence,

         I have not continued it further.

         I ask that this         information be forwarded to Detective Superintendent

         M c K A Y , at    ’F ’ Divisional Headquarters,    for his attention.

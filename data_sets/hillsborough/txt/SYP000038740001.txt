HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


        Part IV
            PART IV



Liverpool football club is one of the premier

sides in the English Football League, with a

large following of supporters attending both home

and away games.       Whilst the majority of these

supporters originate from the area in and around

Liverpool, the club’s support is so widespread

that people regularly travel to matches from as

far afield as Cornwall and the north of

Scotland.     In fact, for the average supporter of

Liverpool, football is a way of life, almost a

"religion."



The extent to which supporters’ behaviour was or

was not a factor in the Hillsborough disaster has

been the subject of contentious debate.       This is

an attempt to catalogue the supporters’ behaviour

as perceived by themselves and others excluding

the police, and to place it into proper

perspective.     In trying to reach this perspective

some account must be taken of the witnesses

possible bias and experience in relation to

football supporters’ behaviour in general.



Police evidence in relation to supporters

behaviour is not dealt with at this time.
The evidence deals firstly with National
        I

Intelligence and secondly supporters travelling

to Sheffield by road and rail.   It moves on to

describe their behaviour in shops and other

premises immediately outside the ground and

further away, including the use of licensed

premises and the effects of alcohol both visual

and otherwise.   Following on from this is

described the late arrival of supporters, the

effect of non ticket holders and a "conspiracy

theory" put forward by South Yorkshire Police to

try to show that supporters acting either as a

body, or as a number of separate groups intended

to force an entry to the ground by sheer weight

of numbers.



The evidence then deals with the forcing of the

outer perimeter gate(s); the supporters account

of events including the crushing at the

turnstiles and the barrier breaking in pen 3.

Also included is the evidence of other

independent sources including photographers,

journalists, BBC camera crews and match

officials.    The final evidence refers to

complaints against the Police.



Before going into detail with the evidence it

should be mentioned that many of the supporters
                      statements contain grid references ie, H6-G3.

                      These come from a grid which was contained within

                      the supporters questionnaires (not included in

Doc.No(s) 178         this file).    Consequently a specimen grid is

Doc.Page(s) 866       included for reference purposes.



                      NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE



                      Because of their numbers and behaviour in the

                      past, Liverpool supporters were well documented

                      by the police prior to the Hillsborough

                      disaster.



St.Pages 1145-1151    Police Sergeant George CHARLESWORTH was the

                      officer collating the pre-match intelligence

                      liaising with both Merseyside Police and

                      Nottinghamshire Constabulary.    He presented this

Doc.No(s) 179         information in report form at the pre-match
Doc.Page(s) 867-872
Doc.No(s) 180-182     briefing.     Several other reports dealing with
Doc.Page(s) 873-909
                      their behaviour at other football grounds

                      including the tendency to arrive late and with

                      substantial numbers of ticketless fans are

                      included.



Doc.No(s) 183         A separate report by Police Constable

Doc.Page(s) 910-922   West Midlands Police, deals with information ____

                                                          which provides a

                      detailed account of the use of forged tickets and

                      the activities of ticket touts.     The behaviour of
                      supporters is also described.    It is emphasised

                      this information is not concerned with the events

                      of 15 April 1989.



St.Pages 1152-1154    A statement by Police Sergeant

                      of the Metropolitan Police, with experience of

                      supporters both as a Police Officer and a fan is

                      also produced.   He describes a ploy used by

                      supporters of some of the major teams including

                      Liverpool for numbers without tickets to gain

                      entry to the ground.



Doc.No(s) 184         Also included is a report by Chief Inspector J

Doc.Page(s) 923-928   MILLER of the Metropolitan Police (Operations)

                      who attended the F.A. Cup Final on 20 May 1989.

                      Chief Inspector MILLER describes the behaviour of

                      fans in the lead up to that game and again,

                      crushing at the turnstiles, ticketless fans and

                      disorderly behaviour influenced by alcohol

                      feature.



                      TRAVELLING TO MATCH



                      Before going into detail it is appropriate to

                      mention that in the period after Hillsborough had

                      been selected as the venue for this F.A. Cup

Doc.No(s) 185         semi-final, an undated letter was widely

Doc.Page(s) 929       circulated by Walter JACKSON Assistant Chief




                                                                          87
Constable (Operations), South Yorkshire Police,

detailing recommended routes to Sheffield,

parking arrangements, search procedures and

opening times for the ground.



This letter asked supporters to arrive between

1030 and 1400 hours to ensure they were in the

ground for ’kick off’ at 1500 hours and indicated

that fans without tickets should not travel.



The Liverpool Football Club’s programme for the

home game preceeding the cup semi final on 8

April 1989 reiterated this theme and this was

supported by broadcasts and publications in the

local and national media.



That explained, this part of the report will deal

with supporters travelling to the stadium by

road, including coaches, vans and cars and by

train.    These items are dealt with individually

under those sub headings.



COACHES



As far as can be ascertained some 102 coaches

containing Liverpool supporters travelled to

Sheffield on 15 April 1989.     The majority of
                     these were accompanied by a Steward and either

                     they or the driver were advised prior to their

                     departure regarding South Yorkshire Police

                     arrangements.



St.Pages 1155-1161                                         of Barnes

                     Travel, Liverpool             organised 26 coaches

                     to the match.   He relates the additional

                     precautions taken by the Merseyside Police to

                     reinforce existing arrangements and he deals with

                     the firm’s attitude towards the carriage of

                     football supporters.



                     A selection of questionnaires from coach owners

                     and drivers are included.



                     The main coach parking facilities for Liverpool

                     supporters were in Halifax Road and Claywheels

                     Lane, Sheffield.



                     MINI BUSES/VANS AND CARS



                     This is one of the most difficult areas to

                     effectively describe and evaluate despite the

                     amount of information available.   Clearly the

                     greater number of supporters travelled to the

                     ground in this manner and although traffic volume

                     was heavy on all approach routes, traffic delays




                                                                          89
                      were not a significant factor in the late arrival

                      of fans.



St.Pages 1208-1211                                            and he

                      travelled to Hillsborough on the M67.   He

                      describes the volume of traffic and witnessed

                      several incidents of fans’ behaviour and the

                      taking of alcohol.



St.Pages 1212-1214                         is a

                                                        He describes

                      the traffic situation on the M62 and the fans

                      behaviour in relation to the consumption of

                      alcohol.



                      Other statements describing Liverpool supporters

                      behaviour and the procuring and consumption of

                      alcohol en route to the game are included.



                      Parking for this type of vehicle was also in the

                      Halifax Road and in adjoining side roads.



                      RAIL TRAVEL



Doc.No(s) 187-188     A report and several appendices from the British

Doc.Page(s) 932-962   Transport Police confirms two British Rail

                      Stations were used for the transport of

                      supporters, the Midland and Wadsley Bridge.      The
former was used for both Liverpool and Nottingham

Forest supporters and the latter for Liverpool

supporters only.    One special train and 3 service

trains from Liverpool conveyed a total of 825

supporters (430 to Wadsley Bridge), with service

trains from other areas bringing this to a total

of 1,337.



A total of 1,932 Nottingham Forest fans travelled

by a combination of special and service trains to

attend the match.



Train arrivals in Sheffield City Centre and at

either station are dealt with within this report

as is the behaviour of supporters.    British

Transport Police conclude that on the ’dry’

trains on which they travelled, the supporters

behaviour was happy and good natured.    Very few

supporters showed signs of intoxication.



LOCAL SHOPS AND BUSINESSES



Inevitably the large number of supporters

converging on Hillsborough for the cup semi final

must have had an influence on the local populace

in that area.   This part of the report deals with

the affect apparent at the Leppings Lane end of

the ground where Liverpool supporters were
                     intended to enter.



                     The fact that some of the gates into the ground

                     were not in fact opened until 1130 hours even

                     though the letter from South Yorkshire Police and

                     the Liverpool Football Club programme indicated

                     they would be opened at 1100 hours, may have some

                     bearing on the effects that were noted in local

                     shops and businesses.



St.Pages 1237-1240

                                            bo the Leppings Lane

                     entrance.   He explains the build up of fans

                     starting at 0920 hours and going on until 1500

                     hours.   He describes many of the fans as taking

                     alcohol drink and noted there was a large number

                     without tickets.     He also mentions the late

                     arrival of fans.

                     the disaster she worked from 0630 to 1430 hours

                     and witnessed the build up and behaviour of fans

                     some of whom she saw drinking alcoholic beverage

                                        as early as 0845 hours.




St.Pages 1244-1245   Olive MAYHEW                               the Esso

                     Service Station.     She explains that during the
afternoon of the her shift she collected seven

dustbin liners full of cans, bottles and other

containers for alcoholic drinks from off the

forecourt.



Lynne STEPHENSON works at Jenny’s Sandwich Shop,

128 Penistone Road, a short distance from the

Stadium.     She discusses the build up of

supporters using the premises from about 1345

hours, many in possession of cans of beer,

obviously under the influence of drink (though

not drunk) and concludes they were rowdy and

swearing, but not violent.



Other statements in the file follow the same

general picture of drinking, boisterous and rowdy

behaviour including urinating in public and

private places.



LICENCED PREMISES



As part of the Police arrangements for the semi

final many of the public houses within a mile

radius of the stadium were closed for the sale of

alcohol.     Those premises that did open generally

instigated some sort of control on the door but

obviously the further away from the ground the

supporters were the easier it was for them to
obtain access to public houses for drink.



Clearly this sort of control was more difficult

for supermarkets and off licences and most of

them did open and indeed they sold a considerable

amount of drink, both alcoholic and otherwise.

That said, it is not possible to show the

quantities of alcohol consumed by any one

individual, or any particular group of

individuals and all this report can highlight is

the amount probably taken by Liverpool supporters

overall.



PUBLIC HOUSES



Jack MOUNTAIN is the licensee of the Cock Inn,

Oughtibridge, which is about 2.6 miles from the

stadium.     He describes how he had a steady

build-up of fans reaching a peak at 1330 hours,

when some 250 people were present.    Shortly after

this the numbers decreased probably due to the

distance yet to be travelled.    His takings were

quadrupled for the day.



Rita GOLDSWORTHY is the landlady of the Silver

Fox Public House, in Stocksbridge, 2.4 miles from

the stadium.    She tells of 150 fans in her

premises until 1345 hours and compliments their

behaviour.
St.Pages 1295-1298   Keith Norman OLLERENSHAW is the Manager of the

                     Owl Public House, Neepsend, Sheffield.     He

                     explains how he actually sold out of beer by 1515

                     hours on the day, having some 500 customers

                     inside the premises and a further 200 outside.

                     These premises feature in much of the publicity

                     appearing in the media after the disaster.



                     SUPERMARKETS



St.Pages 1325-1329                                            Gateway

                     Supermarket in Berries Road which is a licensed

                     retail outlet.   She explains supporters were in

                     the store from 1100 hours to purchase alcohol and

                     that this continued up until 1500 hours.        As a

                     result the daily takings were up £500 on normal.

                     She reported an incident of theft appertaining to

                     drink.



                     OFF LICENCES



St.Pages 1330-1334                              Threshers Off Licence

                     in Hammerton Road.   She describes selling alcohol

                     from 1100 hours to 1415 hours with her takings up

                     by some £500.    She also reported an isolated

                     incident concerning the attempted theft of some

                     drink.




                                                                            95
A number of other statements and questionnaires

from this type of licensed premises are included,

the above witnesses being only a representative

sample.    The theme of their evidence is that

whilst considerable increases in the sale of

alcohol were reported on the day, supporters’

behaviour in licensed premises was generally

good, although there were some isolated incidents

of bad behaviour and these are described.



LOCAL RESIDENTS



People living near to any football stadium are

well accustomed to the disruption that occurs in

their neighbourhood when there is a match taking

place.     In those areas where major stadiums are

located they are usually aware of the difference

between an ordinary match and a Cup Semi-Final

where the number of supporters is greater.

Taking this a stage further, by reason of this

experience they are able to identify those teams

whose supporters are likely to cause greater

trouble.    As a result some teams’ supporters earn

a reputation.     From this point of view local

residents are in a somewhat unique position in

being able to compare and balance behaviour by

different supporters, not only from week to week

at ordinary matches, but from year to year with
1

                       the more important games.



                       The following section of this report seeks to put

                       the local residents’ views of the Liverpool

                       supporters’ behaviour during the morning and

                       early afternoon of the 15 April 1989,

                       particularly prior to kick off.    In some cases,

                       comparison is made with the semi final in 1988.

                       the stadium.   She describes the parking of

                       vehicles from 1015 hours until 1100 hours when

                       her road was full and her surprise at the amount

                       of alcohol being carried by the .occupants of

                       these vehicles.    She observes excess drinking

                       whilst making a journey across town.

                       dog for a walk in the area of the stadium.       He

                       describes fans purchasing tickets from ticket

                       touts and instances of supporters consuming

                       alcohol.

Berries Road.   She describes her journey from

1350 hours when she left her home to catch a bus

and the subsequent bus journey.    She mentions the

drinking in the streets by fans and their

presence in the public houses.    Ber main point is

that because of the distance they still had to

travel to the ground they would inevitably be

late in arriving for the start of the match.



Emma Louise LEE (15 years), is a student and has

lived

           from the stadium entrance in Leppings

Lane, for about three years.     She describes the

behaviour of Liverpool fans both in the street

drinking and at the turnstiles pushing and

shoving.   She comments that she has never

previously seen such behaviour by fans.



The consensus of the evidence from local

residents seems to be that the Liverpool

supporters were generally badly behaved and that

alcohol influenced this behaviour.     Those

residents able to compare the 1988 Semi-Final

with the 1989 conclude that the fans behaviour

was much worse and that many fans arrived late.
                      There are a large number of other statements from

                      persons living in the vicinity of the Sheffield

                      Wednesday Football Club Stadium which describe

                      LATE ABBTVAL   b y supporters at entrance in


                      LEPPINGS LANE



                      Late arrival at the ground by supporters has

                      already been mentioned by local residents.     The

                      two main reasons put forward for late arrival of

                      fans are traffic delays locally or en-route, and

                      fans remaining outside the ground, either in

                      licensed premises or elsewhere, until the last

                      minute and then all later converging on the

                      ground.



                      The fact that there were some traffic delays has

                      already been discussed.

                      actually reached Leppings Lane at 1455 hours.        He

                      blames traffic delays for his late arrival.




                                                                                99

                      mini bus and arrived at the stadium at 1445

                      hours.     He encountered a 20 minute delay caused

                      by the Police searching the mini bus for

                      alcohol.     This caused him to arrive late.

                      arriving in Sheffield at 1215 hours.      He then

                      visited a public house and did not arrive at the

                      ground until 1440 hours.

                      travelled with several flat mates in a hired car

                      to Sheffield to watch the game.      On arrival at

                      between 1230 and 1300 hours they went to the

                      Shakespear Public House for a drink and

                      refreshment, leaving at 1400 hours to walk to the

                      ground.



Doc.No(s) 109         Video evidence indicates that there was a sudden

Doc.Page(s) 740-741   build-up of supporters at the Leppings Lane

                      turnstiles between 1420 and 1430 hours and that

                      this build-up continued until the opening of gate

                      ’C ’ at 1452 hours.




                                                                             100
                          TICKETLESS FANS



                          It is not possible to quantify the number of

                          ticketless fans that were in Leppings Lane or to

                          effectively evaluate their overall effect on

                          congestion and crushing at the turnstiles.

                          Evidence from supporters is provided that

                          suggests many travelled without tickets in the

                          hope of purchasing them in the ground.   In

                          addition when the statements of police officers

                          are assessed in a later part of this file there

                          is considerable evidence of supporters without

                          tickets.   It has not been possible to quantify

                          the number evidentially but an estimate of 2,000

                          would not be unrealistic.



                          If one accepts the computerised turnstile count

                          the West Stand terraces) and subtract that from

                          the 24,256 tickets sold it leaves a total of

                          3,264 in Leppings Lane still waiting to enter the

                          ground.    Add a possible 2,000 non ticket holders

                          to this figure and there is a potential crowd of

                          5,246 which coincidently is the estimate given by

                          some of the police and supporters present.

                      ticket tout.    He later swapped them with another

                      ticket tout for tickets for the Leppings Lane end

                      paying an extra £15 in the transaction.

                      £20.   However, he tendered them at the Leppings

                      Lane end and was admitted.

                      ticket and no intention of purchasing one, but

                      waited and entered by the ’double click method’.

                      This entails following immediately behind a

                      ticket holder and going through with him on the

                      same turn of the turnstile.

                      Supporter.     He attempted to purchase a ticket

                      from a ticket tout but they required too much

                      money.   He entered with others, through a

                      turnstile, by paying the operator £30.           He claims

                      he saw numerous other people throwing money at

                      the operator as they went over the turnstile.

                      the amount required by ticket touts in Leppings

                      Lane and he entered the ground with other people

                      through Gate ’C ’ on its opening.



                      There are a large number of statements referring

                      to ’ticket touts’ and fans seeking what they

                      refer to as ’spares.’     ’Spares’ means any

                      available and unused tickets for the match.

                      Statements included are intended only to be a

                      representative sample.



                      SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE - CONSPIRACY THEORY



                      As the title suggests, this concerns a theory put

                      forward by the South Yorkshire Police, based on

                      conversations overheard at different public

                      houses indicating that Liverpool supporters

                      without tickets would en-masse descend on the

                      turnstiles in Leppings Lane and create such

                      pressure that the police would be forced to allow

                      them access.



St. Pages 1664-1670   Garrv TAYLOR is retired.     He explains that he was

                      in the Sicey Public House in the lunch period

                      prior to the match.     He overheard three

                      Liverpudlian males discussing the fact that they




                                                                               103
                       did not have tickets but would cause trouble

                       outside Leppings Lane and enter once a gate had

                       been opened.



St. Pages 1671-1673.   Julie Dawn SHELLEY is an office worker     She tells

                       how she overheard a group of Liverpool supporters

                       talking whilst she was at her auntie’s Public

                       House, The Matilda in Sheffield City Centre.

                       They implied that although they did not have

                       tickets they would still be able to get in to the

                       match as they had on previous occasions.



                       One other witness statement is included.     This

                       represents the total evidence presented.



                       THE FORCING OF THE WROUGHT IRON OUTER PERIMETER

                       GATES



                       The gates referred to are those across the mouth

                       of the entrance to the turnstiles off Leppings

                       Lane.   These were closed at about 1448 hours by a

                       combination of foot beat and mounted officers.

                       The purpose of the police closing off the

                       entrance gates to the turnstiles was to try and

                       take pressure off the supporters being crushed

                       and injured in the courtyard between.




                                                                              104
                      At 1453 hours these gates were opened.    There

                      were two explanations for this opening.    One by

                      the police indicates that the gate nearest the

                      River Don was forced by the sheer weight of the

                      crowd pushing forward.    The other is from the

                      supporters who say that the police opened the

                      gates and allowed them through.    Whatever is the

                      truth of the matter, the metal bolt on the bottom

                      of the gate and the tarmac nearby, where it

                      dragged are both damaged.    This damage was

St.Pages 1678-1679    photographed by                           a civilian

                      photographer employed by South Yorkshire Police.

                               and a Liverpool Supporter.    He was in

                      the courtyard area with the perimeter gates

                      behind him.   He explains how the gates were

                      closed by the police to ease the congestion in

                      front of the turnstiles, and how, after only

                      minutes, the volume of people pushing forced them

                      open.



St.Pages 1687-1696                              is a              and a

                      Liverpool Supporter.     He also describes being in

                      the courtyard area and seeing a combination of

                      police officers and stewards close the perimeter

                      gates.   He says within two minutes the gates were

                      forced by the pressure from the crowd in Leppings
Lane.   He comments that with so few police

officers it was foolish to try and hold such a

large crowd.



There are several other statements which all

reiterate the similar experience in relation to

the forcing of these perimeter gates.



SUPPORTERS ACCOUNTS



The next part of this report is probably the

largest in terms of the number of statements

included.     It puts the supporters’ points of view

in relation to events, the crushing in Leppings

Lane and at the turnstiles and the entry through

gate ’C ’.    The circumstances are described in the

tunnel under the West Stand, in pen 3, including

the barrier breaking, pen 4, the other pens and

the stands.     It concludes with evidence of the

identified surges in pens 3 and 4.



For ease of reference evidence will be dealt with

under these headings although it must be

appreciated that some witnesses give evidence in

relation to more than one subject and it is

sometimes impossible to separate them.     For this

reason it is not proposed to deal with evidence

by each witness individually, except in relation

to   the collapse of the crush barrier in pen 3.

                     The crushing in Leppings Lane has already been

                     dealt with by some of the previous witnesses

                     referred to in this report.   In addition, the

                     following supporters also refer to the

                     difficulties.

                     A large number of witnesses describe how they

                     were virtually carried with the flow of other

                     supporters through the gate into the tunnel and
                     down into the pens 3 and 4 without any

                     opportunity to decide for themselves where they

                     wished to go.     Others, however, had no difficulty

                     in the tunnel.     Statements dealing with both

                     aspects are included.

                     TUNNEL - WEST STAND



                     The flow of supporters through gate ’C ’ and into

                     the tunnel undoubtedly caused the tunnel to

                     become congested part way back from the

                     terraces.   This no doubt led to supporters then

                     pushing forward to obtain a viewing position.

                     PEN 3 - CRUSHING



                     A total of 81 supporters who died in the disaster

                     had been in Pen 3.   A further 4 may also have

                     died but this is unconfirmed.     This high number

                     of deaths is probably related to the collapse of

                     the barrier number 124A in the front row.        The

                     following part of this report will therefore

                     separate into supporters dealing with the

                     situation in the pen generally.     It will be

                     followed by the evidence of barrier breaking.

                     The latter, because of its likely importance will

                     be dealt with in more detail.

St.Pages 1965-1971   Gary James GAINS is a storekeeper and a Liverpool

                     supporter.   He was against the barrier 124A in

                     pen 3 when it collapsed and his right foot became

                     entangled with the vertical supports, with the

                     bodies of others falling on top of him.




                                                                            10 9
St.Pages 1972-1975   Terence Mathew MOORE is unemployed and a

                     Liverpool supporter.   He was standing in front of

                     the barrier 124A when it collapsed and he

                     describes how everyone ’tilted’ forward.    He then



                     became trapped for some 15-30 minutes and his

                     friend Paul HEWITTSON, who had been standing

                     nearby, died.



                     PEW 4



                     To date seven of the 95 deaths have been

                     confirmed in pen 4.    An additional one may have

                     occurred but is unconfirmed. The reason for the

                     considerable difference in fatalities between

                     pens 3 and 4 explained by the fact that a barrier

                     did not collapse in this pen.     However, the

                     crushing was no doubt equally as great as is

                     perhaps indicated by the bending of some of the

                     horizontal crush barrier bars.



                     Two of the deceased and where they received fatal

                     injuries cannot be located in either pens 3 or 4

                     at this stage in our enquiries.

OTHER SUPPORTERS



Many of the supporters referred to so far were

either in pens 3 or 4.



This section deals with Liverpool supporters in

other areas of the ground including pens 1, 2 and

6; the West Stand seated area; and the North and

South Stands.



SURGES



At many football matches that take place today

surges occur on the terraces both up and down and

from side to side.   On the day of the disaster a

number of surges occurred.   These surges coupled

with the effects of people trying to come out of

the tunnel and onto the terraces probably is

related to the large scale crushing injuries and

fatalities that occurred.



The remaining statements in the supporters’

section relate to those surges which correspond

either to Alan HANSON’s name being announced over

the public address system or when Peter BEARDSLEY

struck the Nottingham Forest goal cross bar with

the ball.   (NB: HANSON and BEARDSLEY are

Liverpool Football Club players).   These two
                      events are significant

Doc.No(s) 128         that by timing them using video material it is

Doc.Paee(s) 774-775   possible to time the surges to 1450 and 1504

                      hours respectively.   It is not proposed to list

                      statements.



                      PHOTOGRAPHERS AND JOURNALISTS



                      Photographers and journalists usually have

                      privileged viewing positions.   They are

                      invariably professional people with considerable

                      experience and knowledge of major sporting

                      events, not least of all football matches.



St. Pages 2145-2147                         a freelance photographer

                      took up his viewing position at the Leppings Lane

                      end in front of Pen 3 at 1500 hours.     Almost

                      immediately he sensed a crowd problem.     He

                      anticipated a pitch invasion.   However, he

                      quickly realised the problem and attempted to

                      bring this to the attention of a senior Police

                      Officer who he says either did not hear him or

                      ignored him.



St. Pages 2148-2151   Stephen ELLIS is a freelance operative, but also

                      acts for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club as

                      official photographer.   His match viewing

                      position was also at the Leppings Lane end in




                                                                          112
                       front of pens 4 and 5 and near to PC

                       ILLINGWORTH.   He describes how he heard the

                       screams for help from two girls and then saw the

                       crushing at the front of the fence.       He states

                       the Police reaction to this and praises the

                       actions of PC ILLINGWORTH and his colleagues.

St. Pages 2165-2172    Jeffrey Richard POWELL is the Chief Sports Writer

                       for the Daily Mail and viewed the match from the

                       official press box situated in the South Stand.

                       He states that he could see the overcrowding

                       prior to kick off and he questions why the Police

                       Control Box failed to identify the problem.       He

                       then catalogues a number of his criticisms

                       against the Police, Club and Emergency Services.

                        viewed the match from the Official Press Box and

                       witnessed the overcrowding in the central pens in

                        contrast to the outer pens.     He watched as the

                        disaster unfolded and makes several references to

                        the lack of any official announcement and feels

                        this was a grave mistake.

                      exclusively for the BBC TV (Leeds).     He filmed

                      the supporters forming outside Leppings Lane.       He

                      later wondered at their dispersal, not being

                      aware that Gate C had been opened.

                      excellent views of Leppings Lane.     He comments on

                      the failure to recognise the problems by the

                      police and on their lack of direction.     He also

                      joins his colleagues in criticising the lack of

                      tannoy announcements.

                      camera men are included.
                      MATCH OFFICIALS



                      In addition to the players there were many

                      football officials.    These range from the ball

                      boys to the referee and linesman.    Club officials

                      were also present.



St. Pages 2271-2274   Raymond Sidney LEWIS was the referee for the

                      match.    He describes a normal pre-match build

                      up.   He confirms that no approach was made to him

                      at any time to delay the kick-of.    He says, had

                      such an approach been made by a senior police

                      officer, he would not have hesitated in delaying

                      the start of the match.



St. Pages 2275-2279   Kenneth Mathieson DALGLISH is the Liverpool

                      Football Club manager.    He was present at the

                      match.    He was asked by the police to address the

                      public over the tannoy but found no one expecting

                      him on his arrival at the Police Control Box.

                      Having resolved this he then found the equipment

                      faulty.    He later made his announcement using the

                      disc jockey’s public address system situated near

                      to the Police Control Box.



St. Pages 2280-2284   Brian Howard CLOUGH is the Nottingham Forest

                      Football manager.     He comments on being asked to

                      address the crowd by a Police Sergeant and on
finding no loud hailer available, remarks on the

futility of the request.   He was later invited to

make an announcement on the public address system

but following a discussion with a unidentified

Senior Police Officer declined.   He points out

that that Senior Police Officer was under extreme

pressure.



Evidence from the other officials is also

included.



COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE POLICE



The last part of this report deals with

complaints against the police under the Police

and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.   A total of 17

complaints against South Yorkshire Police

officers have been received from supporters or

relatives arising out of the events at

Hillsborough on the 15 April 1989.    These are in

the main being supervised by Captain Noel TAYLOR

of the Police Complaints Authority.    The

complaints involve 11 officers in ranks ranging

from Police Constable to Assistant Chief

Constable.    Statements from the complainants are

included.    Full files in respect of these

complaints are currently being prepared for the

Director of Public Prosecutions and advice will

be sought.

                      COMMENT



                      By far the greatest number of statements taken

                      during this investigation fall into what we call

                      the supporter category.   This section of the

                      report has recorded the supporters view of

                      events.   The views of non supporters have also

                      been dealt with in this section.



                      Because of the large number of statements it is

                      not considered practicable or desirable to

                      include them all in this file.     Indeed, many of

                      these statements relate to the situation in pens

                      3 and 4 and were primarily obtained for the

                      purposes of the coronal inquiry.     They refer to

                      identification of the deceased and identify the

                      crushing, death and injuries.



                      In respect of the consumption of alcohol, which

                      is a theme throughout, the evidence of the

Doc.No(s) 191         analysis carried out by Dr Alexander Robert
Doc.Page(s) 991-997
St.Pages 2433-2456    Walker FORREST. Consultant Chemical Pathologist

                      at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, on

                      blood samples obtained from 94 of the deceased at

                      postmortem is relevant.   This revealed that of

                      the males 51 had no more than 10 milligrams per

                      cent in their blood, which is negligible.

                      Fifteen had over 80 milligrams per cent and six




                                                                           117
were over 120 milligrams per cent.     (NB A

specimen of blood was not taken from a male who

received hospital treatment but who subsequently

died).   No traces of alcohol was found in any of

the females who died.    A total of 21 persons

(22.32) who died had consumed above the legal

limit to drive a motor vehicle.



CONCLUSION



The day of the match was a warm sunny day, with a

temperature of 12 degrees celsius (53.6

fahrenheit).    Many of the supporters attending

the match enjoyed a traditional pre-match

alcoholic drink either at, or en-route to

Sheffield.     In some cases the alcohol caused

supporters to behave in a rowdy, boisterous or

disorderly manner around the ground.     The

evidence confirms this.     However, it can be

argued that this is common behaviour for football

supporters attending a match of this importance

in the football calendar.

OCCUPATION:    POL DS952    FIELD INTELLIGENCE OFFICER


Who states:- This statement consisting of 000 pages, each signed
by me, is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I make
it knowing that if it is tendered in evidence I shall be liable to
prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I know
to be false or do not believe to be true.


DATED: 150689                                                             (SIGNED)




          I am a Detective Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police and perform

          duties as the Field Intelligence Officer for 'F' Division, working

          from the new Divisional Headquarters at Ecclesfield.     Prior to the 24

          April 1989 (240489) I worked in the above capacity from Hammerton Road

          Police Station.

          Part of my responsibilities involve dealing with Football Intelligence

          at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.      This involves liaising with

          Football Intelligence and Liaison Officers from other Forces, to

          obtain information in respect of teams visiting the Hillsborough

          Ground for either a First Division or Cup match.

          I also liaise with Officers who act as 'spotters' from these Forces in

          both 'covert' and 'overt' operations.   After analysing and evaluating

          all the information prior to a game I prepare a briefing report for

          the Ground Commander, and a briefing display board with photographs of

          football hooligans, those subjected to Exclusion Orders and any other

          items of interest.

          In addition to the above I was responsible for preparation of the



                                                                                       1 1 45

Intelligence Reports for the FA Cup semi finals played at Hillsborough

during the 1986/1987(000086/000087) season, Leeds United v Coventry

and the 1987/1988(000087/000088) season, Liverpool v Nottingham

Forest, and did in fact take an active part on both match days in the

briefing of all Officers working the matches prior to each game being

played. On Wednesday 22 March 1989 (220389) I attended a pre-match

briefing organised by Chief Superintendent MOLE, when it was known

that one of this years FA Cup semi finals between Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest was to be played at Hillsborough on Saturday 15

April 1989 (150489). I was directed at the briefing to contact both

Nottingham and Merseyside Police Forces with a view to sending

spotters to the game.    I informed the briefing that I would do this.

At the conclusion of the briefing, I contacted Inspector BRIGGS in

charge of the Support Unit of the Nottingamshire Constabulary who

readily accepted the invitation to send 'spotters' to the game.

I later confirmed the invitation by letter to Chief Superintendent

ALFORD, on behalf of my Chief Superintendent.

I then contacted Inspector CLOW, the Football Liaison Officer for

Merseyside Police at Low Lane Police Station, with the invitation to

send 'spotters' to the semi final.    The reply was "No thank you, we

don't send anyone to away games."

At the time I spoke to Inspector CLOW I asked him to forward to me

copies of current Exclusion Orders for Liverpool fans.    I was told

that this would be done as soon as possible.    The Exclusion Orders

arrived on Thursday 13 April 1989 (130489).

This year I travelled to Nottingham on Tuesday 11 April (110489) and

was met by Inspector BRIGGS, who is the Inspector in charge of the

Support Unit, Sergeant BRAZINER and the two Police Constables who were

to attend the Semi Final at Hillsborough, as spotters, together with
CHARLESWORTH            GEORGE


other Officers frcm the Unit.    Intelligence was supplied to me,

together with photographs of proposed 'targets' frcm the hooligan

element of the Forest supporters.   I left with enough material to

fill the 'Forest' briefing board and also for my briefing report on

the day of the match.

Detective Sergeant John TROUGHTQN at the tferseyside CRO, supplied me

with photographs of recent pick-pockets and travelling thieves, and

together with photographs frcm previous prisoners at Hillsborough, the

Exclusion Orders and previous knowledge and ringing round to

Intelligence Liaison Officers where Liverpool had played, I was able

to put together an Intelligence Report on Liverpool.

In the week prior to the semi final, personal visits or contact was

made with licensees and managers of licensed premises and off-

licences (including supermarkets) and they were advised accordingly.

These premises visited/contacted in FI and F2 by myself and in

Deepcar, Stocksbridge and Oughtibridge by Police Sergeant HILL.

A copy of the Public House check list of premises near to the ground

was completed and submitted to Inspector SEWELL.

All accepted the advice given to them, with the exception of the Royal

Hotel, Penistone Road, Hillsborough, and the Cock Inn at Oughtibridge.

I am unable to say if there was any trouble at Oughtibridge on the day

of the match but there was at the Royal and it was closed down by the

Police.

On the day of the game I paraded at 7.00 am (0700) and cenmenced

Intelligence Patrol with Police Constable 744 HIRST (per Inspector

SEWELL) checking on any sites where there were any possible missiles

(stones, rocks, etc) that could be reached by supporters travelling to

the ground and the early arrival of any supporters.

With the exception of one pile of tarmac pieces near to the Parkside

Section Office and a new site near to the AFG Car Sales, Penistone

Road, the roads leading to Hillsborough were clear and the only early

supporters arriving were from Liverpool and near to a cafe in the

Middlewood area.   Reported this information back to Inspector SEWELL

and action was taken to remove the material frcm Parkside and the car

sales of AFG informed of the possible danger of damage to motor

vehicles on open display.

This was followed by the match briefing in which I took an active part

and briefed Officers on duty in respect of the intelligence I had, and

drawing their attention to the two briefing boards which were on

display for them to view after the briefing in the North Stand.

(The two briefing boards remain intact as instructed and are available

to the Investigating Officers).

Together with Police Constable HIRST, I resumed Intelligence Patrol in

the Hillsborough, Middlewood, Oughtibridge, Fox Hill, Southey, Herries

and Penistone Road areas re early arrival of fans.

Liverpool fans were sighted parking up on Middlewood Road near to the

Middlewood Tavern and also on the Tavern car park.   The fans were also

walking in the general direction of these licensed premises.   This was

before the commencement of licensing hours and the information was

passed to ground control, Police Sergeant GODDARD.

On arrival in the Fox Hill area a few minutes later Liverpool fans

were queuing up outside the Fox public house (Liverpool fans drank

this pub dry prior to the semi final last year and the licensee had

advertised that he had got extra in this year). This information was

passed to ground control, Police Sergeant GODDARD.

 ffovement of both sets of fans in the vicinity of the ground and on all

 approach roads to the ground was monitored and traffic was moving

 freely.

footpaths outside the Royal and Rose Inn.

fran the mobile kitchen and returned to Hanmerton Road Police Station

frcm where we ware to work Prisoner Process for prisoners from the

game (Nottingham Forest fans).

Our route back to Hammerton Road took us past the Royal (about twelve

deep outside drinking) there were also crowds on the footpath drinking

outside the Rose and New Barrack.

After meal returned to the ground using the same route as to travel in

prior to meal.    By this time both the Barrack and Royal were closed

but fans were drinking on both sides of the road outside of the Rose.

Crowds were moving towards the ground but traffic was still moving

freely.

By this time it was approaching kick-off time and on arrival at the

ground some of the players were having a pre-match kick about on the

pitch.

DATED: 240589                                                             (SIGNED)



           I am a Police Sergeant serving in the Metropolitan Police.     I have

        been an ardent football fan for most of my life and regularly attend

           football matches both off duty and on duty when posted.     I have been

        on duty at Cup Final matches at Wembley involving such teams as

        Liverpool, Manchester united, Arsenal, Notts Forest, West Ham etc.

        On numerous occasions whilst on duty I have been engaged policing

           supporters at turnstile entrances.

        For several years I have been aware of a method used by some football

           supporters to gain entry to the stadiums without tickets.    This method

           is used mainly by supporters of more successful teams and its use

        results in the build up of supporters outside turnstiles as was seen

        at Hillsborough.

        A large mass of supporters would approach a block of turnstiles.

        Single supporters would then approach a turnstile and would either

        offer the t o m off stub of an already used ticket or would offer no

           ticket at all.    This can occur as regularly as every minute or so.      I

           have seen it done by single supporters virtually in a single stream.

           The turnstile operator, correctly refuses the supporter admission,




                                                                                         1 1 5 ?.
                                                                          2


normally the supporter then argues with the operator.    This results in

other supporters being unable to enter through that turnstile and this

leads to the approach to the turnstile becoming congested.

The original supporter who has tried to gain admission unlawfully then

claims quite correctly, that he cannot retreat because of the force of

the crowd behind him.     The turnstile operator generally has to allow

the supporter admission otherwise the turnstile becomes useless.     Many

supporters can gain admission by this method even at turnstiles where

police are posted.    It is difficult for officers to remove these

supporters as it is difficult, once the crowd has become congested to

even get to them.    Obviously as well police can be reluctant to go

right into the thick of the crowd to remove the supporter.    Many more

supporters can obviously enter by this method at turnstiles which

aren't policed.

This method is used successfully by supporters of particular teams and

explains why so many fans travel to such matches without tickets.

It's success is based on the inability to remove such a supporter from

the turnstile entrance.

There is a great need to keep a sterile area between the bulk of the

supporters and the turnstile entrance or for the turnstiles to be

redesigned providing an exit route for a person at the entrance to a

turnstile who has not got a ticket, or who is not allowed into the

ground for any other reason.

           I am Mr                        d I live at the above address.

        have been employed by Barnes Travel,                         Liverpool,

                              for 10 years,



        BARNES TRAVEL have been arranging Football coaches for about 8 years.

        We advertise in I/scal papers and have agents who work for us so that

        members of the public who wish to travel to a particular football

        match can book tickets with us to do so.

        We then make all of the necessary arrangements and sub contract out to

        numerous coach firms who supply the coaches and drivers at our

        request. We fax through to all of the coach companies instructions

        and for the Hillsborough match that was confirmation of booking and a

        map indicating the location of our main pick up point in Priory Road,

        Anfield, Liverpool. (Exhibit No        )(Ref No   .).

        All of the standard coaches were instructed to be there by 10.05 hours

        (1005)on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) and the executive coaches by

        10.20 hours (1020).

        The departure times on the fans tickets were 10.45 hours (1045) for
the standard coaches and 11.00 hours (1100) for the executive coaches.

At the departure point in Priory Road each coach was met by a steward

who was to travel on that coach to the ground and return with the

coach at the end of the day.

Each steward had a copy of the South Yorkshire Police instructions

which they were to give personally to each driver.

Each fan is given 2 tickets one to hand in for the outward journey and

one for the return journey.      They are different colours, white is

outwards and yellow return for standard coaches and blue outwards and

green return for the executive coaches.

Each set of tickets is given a consecutive number but we cannot tie up

a particular ticket with a particular person as we do not keep records

of who receives which number ticket.      Each ticket has the wording 'No

alcohol permitted on coaches' printed in clear lettering at the bottom

(copy attached exhibit no              ref no     ?).

Our stewards are instructed to check everyone for alcohol but we are

in a difficult situation as technically we cannot search people

but we do in fact search bags.

On this occasion however something which has never happened before

occurred in that at about 10.30 hours (1030) 3 police minibuses pulled

up and the officers searched the coaches.       The situation was that

officers boarded each coach and warned everyone that alcohol was

forbidden but that they would leave the coach for 2 minutes and in

that time all alcohol must be placed in the centre isle.      They did

warn everyone that they would then be searching everyone and that

anyone found in possession of alcohol would be arrested.

They removed a good quantity of alcohol from the 26 coaches and when

they then searched the fans and coaches there was one lad arrested for

possessing alcohol.
I approve of the Police search and I would be happy if it was

conducted in that manner before we leave for every match as the Police

have far better powers to search people than we have.

That day we had 26 coaches booked and one spare for emergencies which

was just as well because one coach from K-LINE MOTORS, The Travel

Shop, Iockwood Rd, Huddesfield, HDl 3QB failed to turn up owing to

mechanical defects.

The full list of coaches ordered and supplied by us is as follows:-

1.   K-Line Coaches                     1 Executive coach which failed

     K-Line Travel Ltd                   to turn up due to brake

That is a total of 26 coaches that attended plus one that did not.

We had a total of 647 who bought tickets on executive coaches and 656

people who bought tickets on standard coaches.   I cannot say exactly

how many people actually travelled to and from the match without

collecting all of the tickets from the stewards and drivers and

physically counting them.

We do not keep records of names and addresses of people who book

tickets for football match coaches.

Everything went very smoothly at Priory Road and all of the coaches,

except for the one which had brake trouble and never arrived, arrived

by the correct time, filled up and departed on time.

I left on the very last coach which belonged to Bullocks Coaches which

departed at 11.15 hours (1115).

I have completed a fan questionnaire which covers my attendance at

the ground.

I have already supplied the Police at Sheffield with a full list of

our stewards who travelled on our coaches to the match.

The list I have is as follows:-

There are 3 more whose details I have not yet got.

This list was forwarded to WDC                 at Sheffield Fax number



There were a couple of standard coaches without stewards but they had

two drivers, one of whcm acted as a steward for us.

We also had 5 stewards who did not leave Liverpool they were present

at Priory Road only to assist with the loadingof the coaches.

I want to add that I was surprised when the South Yorkshire Police

sent us the instructions for the coach drivers for the Hillsborough

match on 15 April 1989 (150489) because we usually are met on the A61

near to junction 36 and escorted by Police motorcyclists in convoy to

Halifax Road where the coaches are parked up.     The fans are usually

escorted from the coach park to the match.

On this occasion the instructions were for us to make our own way

along the A61 from junction 36 Ml to Halifax Road where there was no

organisation of the fans or escort provided.

Also we are usually required to be at the rendezvous point by 1.30

(1330) to 2.00 (1400) but on the 15th (150489) we were advised to

arrive at Sheffield between 10.30am (1030) and2.00pm (1400).

I can produce copies of the relevant instructions.     Sheffield

DATED: 160589                                                             (SIGNED)



           I am                      a                 aged 48 years, and I live at

                                   Cheshire.

        On Saturday, 15th April 1989 (150489) I was out with my wife in

        having been shopping.        This was frcm about 9.50am (0950) until

           approximately 1.10pm (1310).

        At approximately 12.20pm (1220) I entered the Hyde junction of the M67

        driving my own vehicle, a blue Sierra Estate, travelling towards

           Sheffield.   Within a few minutes of entering the motorway traffic in

           all three lanes of the motorway began slowing and after a few minutes

        more had ground to a complete halt.        Initially I assumed that this was

           the result of an accident or something similar, however I realsied

           that most vehicles contained football supporters.     That was self-

           evident because of scarves in red and white colours and printing on

           some of the scarves showing them to be Liverpool Football Club

           supporters. They were travelling in a mixture of private cars,

           mini buses and coaches.

           Normally the journey from joining the motorway at this aforementioned

           junction and reaching home takes about five to six minutes, however,
                                                                          2


on this occasion it took approximately 50 minutes. Most of the time

was spent on the motorway section up to the Hattersley roundabout

junction, about 40 minutes in fact.

During this period of time traffic was proceeding on the motorway at a

crawl or was completely stationary.   Having realised that the

majority of traffic was in fact football supporters, I further

realised that it was the day of the Football Association semi-final

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs at Hillsborough

in Sheffield.

The ages of the supporters I saw ranged from 15 years to 50 years in

the main being in the 20 to 30 age group.   Obviously, with the speed

traffic was progressing, I tended to be surrounded by the same

vehicles for most of the time I spent on the motorway section.

I would say that I noticed approximately five full sized coaches

containing Liverpool supporters, each of which were full.     I am not

able to say to which coach companies they belonged.     I could not

see very clearly into the coaches but I am able to say that on all of

the coaches I did see seme people drinking alcohol from cans.    The

behaviour of the people on the coaches generally seemed boisterous but

good humoured.

I can also say that I saw about fifteen to twenty transit-type/sized

mini-buses or coaches whilst on the motorway section.     I could not say

which were vans as opposed mini-coaches, ie what proportion.     Out of

the mini-coaches I did see seme of the drivers and a vast number of

passengers were drinking beer or lager from cans.     Their behaviour was

also, generally, good-humoured and boisterous.

I remember commenting to my wife that at the rate they were drinking I

would not be surprised if there was seme sort of trouble or disorder.

Of the small transit-type vans I saw around me on that motorway
___________________________                                               3


section I would say that a vast number of them were over loaded or

filled to capacity.   These vans did not seen to be the seating-type

vans but mainly the metal-sided transit goods type vans.     It was

evident that they were hire-type vans with various like company logos

painted on their* sides.   I saw the driver of some of these vans

drinking frcm cans of beer or lager as they were driving along.

I saw a large number of private cars on the motorway carrying five to

six Liverpool supporters, and at least one passenger in each vehicle

was drinking or holding cans of beer or lager, as were quite a few of

the drivers of these vehicles.     There were seme cars in which all of

the occupants were drinking cans of alcohol.

I assumed that a few of these supporters had consumed considerable

amounts of fluid, as I saw between six and twelve cars stopped or

stopping at the side of the motorway and their occupants getting out

to urinate behind bushes, etc at the roadside.

I saw at various times whilst on the motorway, about five to six cars,

involved in the traffic, where people got out of the cars, went to the

boots of their vehicles and took out more cans of beer or lager,

and then returned to their cars.

Eventually we turned off the motorway at the Hattersley roundabout on

the A624 or A628 (Woodhead Road). As we entered the roundabout I

saw on the inner verge of the roundabout, about three to four hundred

discarded beer and lager cans.     By the following morning these had

been cleared by the local council, Tameside Metropolitan Borough

Council (part of Greater Manchester Metropolitan Council area).

Due to the road layout the only logical route for supporter's traffic

to take to the Ground at Sheffield is via that roundabout.     I would

assume that most if not all of those discarded cans had been deposited

or thrown there by those supporters I had been stuck on the motorway
        with.     Normally, this roundabout I had mentioned, is well-maintained

        and relatively litter free.     I see that roundabout on every working

        day and so I am quite aware of this point.

           I era a married man living at the above address with my wife.

           I am a                                                  On Saturday 15 April

           1969 150489 I had been into Cheshire on business and was returning

           hone.     I joined the M62 at junction 12, my intention being to leave at

           junction 13.     It is a short cut for me to my home.    As I joined the

           motorway I could see that the whole of the three lanes of the motorway

           wae full with traffic travelling at about 5 miles an hour or slower.

           I joined this traffic at about 10.30am 1030.     I saw that a good number

           of people in the cars and vans were Liverpool PC fans.        I know this

           frcm the insignia they were wearing.     I saw three lads jump out of a

           car in the centre lane, run back a few car lengths, move to the

           central reservation and urinate.     This seemed to trigger off others

           whc did the same.

           The traffic was, by this time, stopping and starting.        Therefore, we

           had people running between cars up and down the motorway chasing their

           cars around.     I saw many fans drinking from beer and lager cans,

           drivers too, and they were throwing the empties onto the hard shoulder

           and central reservation.     Many of these cans were Stones Bitter, I




                                                                                          1212
knew these cans as I work in the             trade.   These fans were

also shouting out of their windows, swearing and making coarse

continents to women in cars in the traffic jam.

I was in this slow moving traffic for 15-20 mins and the behaviour I

have described continued for the whole time.      I left the motorway at

junction 13 and went heme.   I live on a main route from Stockport to

Sheffield.   I was aware that a fair proportion of the traffic past my

house was Liverpool fans. I could hear them from my office which is

an adapted bedroom at the front of my house.

I was in my office from 11am 1100 until 12.15pm 1215 and was

constantly aware of the noise from the street.      I saw marry Liverpool

fans stop in their cars and the occupants go into the off licence

which is only                           from my house.

The traffic was moving very slowly so I had these fans running up and

down the street carrying armfuls of canned beer and lager.

I witnessed one man urinating into the garden of my near neighbour at

No

This general sort of behaviour continued until 12.15 1215 when I went

out of my office.   I left the house at 1.35pm 1335 and I was surprised

to see Liverpool fans still passing my house in cars and vans and I

renronber commenting to myself that these people wouldn't make the kick

off.   I wrote a letter making the above contents to the Chief

Constable of Sheffield Police.     I wrote the letter and posted it off

during the first week of the inquiry opening in Sheffield.

                                     XI                 SHEFFIELD.

       At 1.00 pm (1300) Saturday 15th April 1989, (150489) I vent together

       with my neighbour who is also a business associate

           to view seme potential business premises in

           SHEFFIELD. My route to these pranises via private motor vehicle took

       me down, Fox Hill Road, SHEFFIELD, my attention was drawn to a public

           house in Fox Hill Road known as the FOX, the reason being these vere

           approximately 100 (one hundred) Liverpool Football Supporters sitting

           and standing outside the front of the pub they were consuming

           alcoholic drinks in the main pints of beer; at this time they seemed

       veil ordered and vere not causing trouble, I also noticed on the

           opposite side of the road I noticed either a police Sherpa or transit

           van I did not see any police officers.    I carried on my journey and

           viewed the premises, I returned via the same road later at about

           1.30 pm (1330) the situation at the pub was the same, veil ordered

           with the police van parked opposite.     I again drove down the same road

           at 2.30 pm (1430) by this time the same numbers vere outside the



                                                                                       1215

        premises still drinking alcohol I gained the impression that there was

        no way that these fans would reach Hillsborough Football ground by

        kick off time, due to the walking distance from the pub to the ground.

        I did not then see any other incidents involving Football Supporters

        that day.

           States:

           I reside at the above address and am presently employed as a store's

           controller for                                            Sheffield.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I was to work until 2.pm (1400)

           in view of the football match at HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM I delayed my

           return home journey as I knew the route heme would be heavily

           congested with both vehicles and pedestrians making their way to the

           stadium. At approximately 2.30pm (1430) I started my journey home from

           the Sportsman pub Damall, about 3 miles from the Hillsborough

           ground. I drove along NEEPSEND LANE at about 2.45pm (1445) and the

           traffic had slowed right down, almost virtually to a halt movement of

           traffic was very slow.   There was a constant stream of

           pedestrians on either side of the lane, about three deep in

           places making their way towards the ground, this being one of the

           major roads out of Sheffield city centre leading to the ground

           NEEPSEND LANE is of about 3/4 of a mile long, in total I

           would estimate about a thousand spectators walking on the pavement

           towards the ground, about half of these were drinking frcm cans.




                                                                                    1217

        In NEEPSEND LANE there are four public houses, the "Owl," the "

        Victoria Hotel," the "Gardeners Rest" and the "Crown" at the

        entrances to all these pubs vrere a group of youths, about twenty in

        total at each all stood with pints and drinking from them.   They

        didn't appear troublesome but it was apparent that all those were

        football supporters from their scarfs, shirts etc, I could not say

       what particular team they were in support of.

       On foot it would take a minimum of twenty minutes to travel to the

        HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM from NEEPSEND LANE, I had originally delayed my

        journey so to avoid the crowds and I was very surprised to see the

       masses of spectators at 2.45 pm (1445) so far away from the ground

        and still drinking in NEEPSEND LANE.   In my opinion these spectators

        or supporters could not be in the football ground before to 3.00pm

        (1500) schedule kick off.

       My journey home from work usually takes twenty minutes and I have

       never been delayed on my journey heme when other matches have been

       played.    I have lived in Walkely 4 years and have never seen this

       amount of people, so far frcm the football ground 15 minutes prior to

       a kick off, obviously football supporters.

           My name is Mr Duncan STURROCK and I live at the above address with my

           family.   I am employed as a bus driver by the South Yorkshire

           Transport Limited based at Herries Road, Hillsborough, Sheffield.      I

           have done so for the past eleven years.   My driver number is 3045.

           On Saturday 15th april 1989 (150489) I was due to work the 9am

           (0900) to 5pm (1700) shift. I was due to be on the number 81,

           82, 83 and 13 bus routes throughout the day.    These routes take me

           along Middlewood Road and Langsett Road, which are close to Leppings

           Lane and the Hillsborough Football Club. I was prepared, as in the

           past, to take fans who were not on the special coaches to the ground.

           I left home at about 8.10am (0810). As I am so close to the bus depot

           I walk to work.

           As I was walking along Middlewood Road and neared the football

           training ground, I saw a minibus and a hire van parked, one was a

           blue Transit and one was a white Mercedes van.    I could see

           approximately a dozen people in or around each van.    Frcm their dress

           of red and white scarfs with Liverpool markings on and from their

           accents, I judged them to be Liverpool supporters.    I would say their



                                                                                      1219

ages varied from late teens to early twenties.

I could see as I passed them that although it was still only 8.20am

(0820), they were drinking beer or lager from cans. I cannot recall

the names on the cans but it was not ones found around here.     In the

white van I saw stacked along the length of one side of the van beer

trays, the type you buy from the shop, 24 in each one, covered in

plastic.    I would estimate there to be four or five hundred cans in

all.

I did not see any cans of beer stacked in the blue minibus but most

of the lads in and around it were drinking from a can.    From the way

they were parked I did not get the impression they were together as

a group.

As I passed the white van a lad said to me, "Have you got any tickets

for match mate."    Because of his Liverpool accent I had to ask him to

repeat the question, which he did.

I said, "No sorry mate", and carried on to work.    Their general

behaviour at this time was good.     They were just standing about

talking.

When I reached the junction of Leppings Lane and Halifax Road, I saw a

blue Renault van on the garage forecourt.     Again I saw about a dozen

or so Liverpool supporters standing around drinking from cans of beer/

lager.     I reached work at 8.25am (0825).

At about 10.20am (1020) the same day, the 15th (150489), I was sitting

in my bus cab, which is one man operated, in the City Centre, when

two young lads in their late teens early 20's boarded the bus.       One

of them said something to the effect of, "Have you got any tickets or

do you know somebody who can get us one." From the accent I knew

they were from Liverpool, but they wore no colours.

I said, "No" and they got off the bus.


                                                                               1220
STURROCK                DUNCAN


That day I was asked three or four times by Liverpool supporters if

I had or knew where they could get spare tickets.      If you work what

we call the 'football special' buses you, as the driver, are given

a ticket or pass to enter the ground.     I don't know if these

supporters knew this when they approached me.

At about 1.30pm (1330), I made a run from the City Centre going to

Wisewood.   This runs through the Hillsborough area.   As I was

driving up Langsett Road, I passed three or four pubs, one of them is

called 'The Wellington'. However, I noticed that at all the pubs,

people, football supporters, but I couldn't tell which ones, were

standing around the outside of the pub and sitting on nearby garden

walls.   They were drinking beer/lager from glasses or bottles.       I

would say about 20 or 30 people outside each pub.

At about 2.10pm (1410), on my return run into town, as I neared 'The

Wellington' pub again I saw about three or four Police Officers

spread between the door of the Pub and one of our Football Special

buses parked outside.     They looked to be watching the supporters

as they left the pub until they boarded the bus.     I noticed this

incident because I have worked football specials in the past and

you pick up from the station and drop at the ground.     You do not

stop at pubs or make special pick-ups.

I then went to the south side of the city and didn't see or have

any more involvement with fans until my run back through the

Hillsborough area at 3.40pm (1540).     When I was close to the ground I

saw that large groups of very subdued and crying fans were walking

back into the city away from the ground.

On my return run and as I neared and passed the Hillsborough

ground, I started to pick up mainly Liverpool fans, but some

Nottingham,   to take them back into town.    They also were quiet

       and upset.     I did not see any drink but I could smell drink on them.

       On my last run through the Hillsborough area I saw complete chaos.

       Police, ambulances, cars and thousands of people in the road.     Seme

       were drinking beer/lager from cans but I saw no trouble.

       On my return to the depot at about 6pm (1800), we were requested by

       the Police to provided a bus to run people between the hospitals that

       the injured had gone to.

       On my arrival at the Northern General Hospital, at about 6.10pm(1810),

       I made myself known to the Police Inspector Bennett.     In a corridor

       near to the cafeteria in the hospital and during the next two hours, I

       witnessed two scuffles, between young lads who I believed to be

        football supporters, but which ones I couldn't say. As I was parked

       outside the hospital, I saw supporters still with cans of beer and

       still drinking. I saw nothing throughout the day that I would say was

       a criminal offence.

           I reside at the above address with ray husband and two children.

        At about 1.25pm (1325) on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I left ny

           home with ray husband and two children with the intention of collecting

           a babysitter at Middlewood Hospital, Sheffield, and then continuing on

           to                Sheffield.

           We left home in our vehicle and travelled along               towards

           Oughtbridge Village.

           As we turned left into           [ notice a mini bus, I don't know what

           colour it was, parked on the left hand side of the road.    The mini

           bus contained young men in their late teens, early twenties, three or

           four of whcm were standing outside the bus next to it.     Two policemen

           were, it appeared, searching the vehicle. I cannot say whether the

           men were wearing football colours but I formed the opinion that they

           were Liverpool supporters on their way to the FA Cup semi final at

           Hillsborough Football ground.    I formed the opinion that the

           policemen were searching the vehicle for alcohol, although I didn't

           see any at all.

           We continued along the road and went past the Middlewood Tavern which




                                                                                      1223

is in Middlewood Road North. I noticed that there were a lot of

football supporters both outside the pub and on the opposite side of

the road.     The fans were wearing red and white scarves and I formed

the opinion that they were Liverpool supporters.      Although I can't

recall anybody with glasses, I'm sure there were.      They didn't appear

to be any problem they were just milling round.      We continued on into

the grounds of Middlewood Hospital, Middlewood Road, and collected our

babysitter called 'Kate'.     We left the hospital about 1.50pm (1350).

We then went through the hospital grounds to Worrall Road. There

were no signs of any supporters until we reached 'The Sportsman'

public house, which is on the right hand side.

My attention was drawn to a lot of supporters outside the pub around

the same number that were at Middlewood Tavern.      I again saw that they

were Liverpool supporters.     They were drinking alcohol and were

considerably more rowdy than the previous group.      They were chanting

and cheering and generally noisy.       The supporters were spilling out

into the road and vehicles were having difficulty passing the pub due

to the people in the road.     What we were seeing became a talking

point.      I had not previously witnessed such a volume of supporters at

the pubs.      I was surprised that people were there drinking given that

there was an hour to go to the game.

When we reached the junction of Worrall Road and Wads ley Lane we came

to the pub called the 'Horse and Jockey', which is situated at the

junction.      There was a very large number of supporters at the pub

outside and a lot of them were sitting in the road.       Seme were lying

in the road, propped up on their elbows.       They were so far across the

road that it was necessary to travel on the incorrect side of the road

to avoid a collision.      I felt that the atmosphere was unsettling. I

felt that if the supporters were challenged at all they would not be
GUNSTONE               SUSAN MARGARET                                      3


very happy and would retaliate.

We turned left into Wads ley Lane and I saw that there were supporters

walking both towards the ground and away from the ground.     They were

not obstructive at all.     We arrived at our friends house



I got out of the car and went into the house with the children and

Kate.   When I came out of the house after about five minutes as I

walked towards the car I had to wait to let the supporters cross my

path.      I felt very uneasy about passing them some were drinking from

cans of beer.     When I tried to approach the car none stepped aside

and allowed me to get in.

From the house towards Middlewood Road we encountered a large number

of fans walking along the pavements and in the road.

When we reached Middlewood Road we travelled straight ahead into

Parkside Road.     At the junction I noticed that there was now a police

presence at the junction.     There were certainly more than two, but

I've no idea how many there were.     The number of officers appeared to

be the normal amount for the football matches at Hillsborough.

At the end of Parkside Road we turned left into Penistone Road.     We

were confronted again by a large number of supporters, this time they

were Nottingham Forest supporters. On the junction there was a small

hot dog stand selling food.

I noticed that the Nottingham Forest supporters were totally

different.             and I discussed the difference in behaviour in

view of our occupations.      It was families of supporters rather than

the younger element.      They walked orderly along the pavement and when

the traffic lights changed at the junction they actually stopped to

allow the vehicles to pass.      Something which the Liverpool supporters

would not have done. Generally there was a more mature attitude and in
       GUNSTONE               SUSAN MARGARET                                      4


       the way they were conducting thanselves.     We turned left into

       Penistone Road and then right into Herries Road South, which continues

       into Herries Road.

        In Herries Road there is a pub called the 'Five Arches'.     I noticed

       that there were a few supporters on the car park who were Nottingham

       Forest supporters.     They were just quietly drinking and were no

       problem at all.

        In conclusion I would only emphasise the marked contrast in the two

       sets of supporters.      I felt intimidated by the Liverpool supporters,

       who obviously had been drinking alcohol, and had no regard for others

       as I had experienced in Wadsley Lane.

       The Nottingham Forest supporters were just an orderly group of

        supporters on their way to a football game.

           I live at the above address with my wife and two children.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I travelled with my wife to

           Manchester Airport to collect




           We arrived at the Airport at about 8.30 am (0830).    Without any

           traffic problems.    The Aircraft should have landed at 10.30 am (1030)

           but it was delayed and landed at 11.30 am (1130).

           We set off to travel back to Wakefield by car at about 12 midday

           (1200).   We travelled along the M56 and the M63 to Stockport.      About a

           mile from the end of the Motorway all the traffic had cane to a stop.

           I realised that the volume of traffic was due to the football match at

           Sheffield.   tfost of the cars had football supporters in.   It took us

           sometime to ccroe to the end of the motorway.   The traffic then was

           very slow.   We travelled to Mottram and just before the village there

           is a traffic island.     There were people jumping out of cars and buses

           and were urinating at the side of the road, then because the traffic

           was so slow they could run and catch up the vehicle that they had come



                                                                                         1227
       off and get back on.

       I noticed that the traffic island was covered in beer cans.

       The traffic then continued very slowly along the A628 until we got to

       the Flouch Inn.   We turned off then to go towards Barnsley.    It would

       be about 2 pm (1400) when we left the heavy traffic. The supporters

       then would still have another 12 miles to travel in heavy traffic to

       Sheffield.

       We eventually arrived home about 2.30 pm (1430) without any more

       traffic problems.

       I was disgusted by the conduct of the football fans, the fact that

       they had been drinking and were urinating at the side of the road, in

       full view of other road users.      Also on seeing the bottles and cans

       all thrown over the traffic island.      It would have been just as easy

       for them to have kept the litter on the coaches and not thrown it

       around the countryside.

       I think, that the length of the journey that the fans made which was

       made longer by the amount of traffic would have made the fans quite

       agitated when they arrived at Sheffield.      The journey we had made had

       taken twice as long as it would normally have taken.



                                                                          SIGNED

           I reside at the above address with my husband and two children.

           On the 15th April 1989 (150489) a Saturday my husband and I travelled

           to Manchester Airport to collect



           We arrived at the Airport at about 8.30 am (0830) without any traffic

           problems. The aircraft should have landed at 10.30 am (1030) but

           eventually landed at about 11.30 am (1130).

           We set off in the car to return to Wakefield at about 12 midday.

           (1200).    We did not travel on the M62 motorway but over the Snake

           Pass.     As soon as we left the Airport the traffic was very heavy.

           Cars were passing our car by the hard shoulder and we were in a queue

           of traffic all the way towards Sheffield.     We did not realise at this

           stage that the traffic was connected with the football match at

           Sheffield, we thought it was normal heavy traffic.

           When we left the Airport at first we did travel on the M62 motorway

           for a short distance and then on the A57 through Glossop and over the

           Snake Pass.     Before reaching Glossop we arrived at a very large

           traffic roundabout which was completely littered in bottles and cans,
                                                                          2


I had never seen anything like it before even the kids remarked on the

amount of bottles and cans lying around.

We were in a traffic jam all the way and after leaving this traffic

island heading for Glossop people were getting off coaches and

urinating at the side of the road, in full view of all the people in

the cars.    At this time we had realised that the traffic jams had been

caused by fans from Liverpool travelling to a football match at

Steffield.

On looking at the coaches they appeared to be over loaded fans were

walking up and down the aisles and getting on and off the coaches

urinating and walking or running along the road before getting back

onto the coaches again.

We were in a queue of traffic all over the Snake Pass towards

Sheffield, it was a very slow journey.     We eventually left the heavy

traffic at the Flouch Inn where we turned off towards Barnsley and

Wakefield.    At the Flouch Inn I saw a lot of Police Officers who were

controlling the heavy traffic.    I did not see any of the Police

Officers board any of the coaches.

By the time we left the traffic jam at the Flouch Inn it was about 2

pm (1400).    After this we made our way home without any further

 problems arriving at about 2.30 pn (1430).

 I was disgusted by the conduct of the football fans, the fact that

 they had been drinking heavily, and were urinating at the side of the

 road in full view of other road users.    Also on seeing the bottles and

 cans thrown all over the traffic island upset me, it would have been

 easy for them to have kept the litter on the coaches and not thrown it

 around the countryside.

 Because of the traffic jams and the conduct of the fans I was getting

 agitated and I can imagine that the fans were getting upset and
       agitated because of being late for the match or even missing it.

       I realise now that some of the roads I mentioned are not correct, I

       did not take too much notice of the roads   as my husband was driving I

       was more interested in the behaviour of the fans in the cars and

       coaches.

           I am Mrs                               aged 43 years, and I live at

                                 Cheshire.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I intended to travel by train

           from Crewe to Sheffield via Stockport to visit my eldest daughter

                         who is a

           I left Crewe at 10.45am (1045) along with ny

                                         and arrived at Stockport at about 11.

           05am (1105). I waited at Stockport Railway Station and eventually

           boarded the train for Sheffield at about 11.35am (1135). The train was

           one of the new 'Sprinter' type trains with two carriages.   We boarded

           it in the middle of the second carriage and made our way to seats in

           that carriage.   I was sat with my son opposite me and my daughter was

           sat in seats backing onto mine.

           On entering the train I could see that the carriage was full, with all

           seats occupied and approximately a dozen people standing.   The

           majority of people in the carriage were football supporters and it

           became apparant to me that they were in fact Liverpool F.C.

           supporters.   Several were wearing the red and white hats, scarves and



                                                                                    1232
                                                                         2


sweat-shirts, seme of which showed the Liverpool logo and sponsers

name.   It was also clear to me, once I had taken my seat, from

conversations of people around me that even the people not wearing

scarves or hats etc. were also Liverpool supporters.   Generally, their

behaviour was not bad at this stage, being quite excited and cheerful.

The language however, was quite bad with much swearing going on.

I would say that there were between 60 and 80 people in the carriage

out of which possibly only twenty were not supporters, most of the

supporters being in the 20-30 year age group.

My attention was drawn to one lad, a white youth of 18-19 years, about

6ft (6') slim with very short cut hair and wearing a Liverpool hat and

scarf, who was very apparently the worse the wear for alcohol.     He was

not standing far from me, about half a carriage-length (25ft) (25')

and I could hear that his speech was slurred and he was staggering.

At no stage did I see any supporters committing any acts of vandalism.

I did notice that most of the supporters, in fact, all of those in my

field of vision were drinking beer and lager from tins.   I could see

clearly the people at the far tables in front of me and the rest of

the carriage was easily visible to me.

To my right there were two tables with four supporters seated at each.

Both tables were covered with empty beer cans, the one closest to me

being slightly worse, the empty cans were stacked three high.     The

other table was covered but by a single layer.   All persons seated at

these tables were frequently getting fresh cans from 'Peter Dominic'

plastic carrier bags under their tables, and this was happening

regularly for the duration of the journey, about 40 minutes.

Of the other tables I could see their occupants were also drinking

from cans, but I cannot say to what degree they were drinking these.

I was surprised to learn that there was also alcohol being sold on the
                                                                         3


train.   My attention was drawn to this by a tannoy announcement to the

effect that refreshments and alcohol were available but persons

requiring such would have to make their way to the far end of the

train, because it was too congested to allow free passage of the

refreshment trolley.   One supporter, a youth of about 18-20 went and

obtained a can of beer from the refreshment trolley and returned to

our carriage.

I can recall overhearing a conversation which m s started by a man

behind me who I did not see.   I cannot be absolutely sure in what

context the coversation was.   I overheard him say something to the

effect "These tickets are great.     Shall we do the same for London.

Well, we're going tickets or not."     I assumed he was talking to a

couple of supporters to my right because they appeared to answer him

and were examining what I assumed to be their match tickets.

It was clear to me that these fans were travelling to a match at the

Hillsborough ground in Sheffield because I heard conversations

mentioning this.   I actually overheard the man behind me say, "We'll

go to the pub before the match."

Of the two I saw examining their tickets I can describe them as

follows (i) white male, 6ft 2ins (6'2") tall, of broad build (15-16

stone) with light brown cropped hair, clean shaven, wearing a white T-

shirt and jeans, (ii) a white male, 5ft lOins (5'10) well built, vith

dk brown to black straight well-styled hair of about collar length,

clean shaven, wearing smart jeans, and a casual shirt under a dark

blue satin-type material track-suit top, possibly bearing the logo L.F.

C. The man behind me did discuss with another man behind me that he

was due to appear at court for an offence committed at Millwall.

Possibly he was supposed to appear quite soon after that day, either

that week or the next.   Unfortunately I did not see his face, though,
                                                                           4


so I cannot describe him.

At the conclusion of the journey at Sheffield Station, at about

12.19pm (1219), I got off the train with iry children and was met on

the platform by my eldest daughter.

The Station was very busy with large numbers of supporters

disembarking from trains and making their way to the   station exit,

some very hurriedly.

Outside this exit I saw uniformed officers on foot directing the

supporters to buses parked outside the railway station, and outside

the station itself I saw a number of mounted police officers.     I took

no more real notice of the supporters and did not go anywhere near the

ground itself.

When I returned to the Sheffield Railway Station I saw large numbers

of police officers both inside and outside the station.    This would

have been near to 4pm (1600).    When I made the return trip, I actually

boarded the 4.13pm (1613) train from Sheffield to Stockport.

There were a few supporters on that return train but I saw no

drunkeness or disorder at all.

I found it frightening experience travelling with those supporters en

route to Sheffield, although there was no trouble as such.

I was very surprised by the amount of alcohol consumed by and carried

by those supporters and in irty opinion they should not have been

allowed to have it with them when en route to the match.

DATED: 260489                                                              SIGNED)



           I am                       and I live at the above address.

           At approximately 0920 (0920) hrs on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489)

           I went to work at number                                      Sheffield

           which is a site which I own and run a business

           This site is approximately                       from the

                       Sheffield Wednesday football ground.

           Even as early as 0920 hrs when I arrived at work I could see that

           there were numbers of Liverpool football fans going to and frcm the

           ground.

           At about 1100 hrs more fans seemed to be arriving and appeared to be

           arriving in numbers and were even sitting on my               vail,

           however these fans were quite orderly and did not appear drunk.

           A short while later I was approached by fans asking if I had any

           tickets for sale.   This carried on until about 1425 hrs and there

           must have been about 20 people who asked.

           One particular group of five youths who I know came frcm Port Talbot,

            as they had come to last years semi final, spoke to me and asked for

            tickets but I had none.   When I asked them why they had come all this




                                                                                     1 23 7
way without tickets they just said that they would get some from

somewhere and even if they couldn't it was a day out for them.

From then on I could see a continuous passing of fans heading towards

the ground.

At approximately 1450 hrs I stood in the door of                 and

could see a continuous crowd of people which completely filled the

road                  to the ground, but I can't honestly say whether

they were being escorted by police, because there were too many of

them.   I must admit I have never seen so many people arriving so late

to a football match before.

I continued to watch the crowd and could see that 2 people had to

pass horizontally across the heads of the crowd frcm the main gate

area towards the river wall.

At this time I also saw what I would estimate to be about 200/300

people climb over the outer wall of the ground and into it, without

going through the turnstiles.

At this point I saw a police officer and informed him of what I had

seen he then went to an officer on a motor cycle who I believe made

radio contact with the police at the main gate.    I continued to watch

and saw a police officer standing on the top of the grounds outer

wall.   He was waving his arms at the crowd below as if to calm them

down and stop them climbing the wall.

I then returned into the              to answer the telephone.   It was

at this point I was told by either



officer on the wall had been pushed off the wall by the crowd.

 I then came out of the              and could see the crowd had not

diminished and there appeared to be even more people arriving.

Even the local residents were saying that they were never going to
get all the people into the ground.

At this point I saw 2 police officers standing on top of the outer

wall, however at this time they were pulling people up out of the

crowd and into the ground and helping people who were obviously being

crushed by the sheer numbers of the crowd.

A short time later I saw 6 police officers who had been standing on

the street comer suddenly run off towards the ground.        One of the

officers told me that they were needed urgently at the ground as

there had been an emergency.

A few minutes later I saw numerous police vans and squads of police

officers go past towards the ground.    Just prior to this one youth

who had come from the ground sat on irty             ■mil.   I went up to

him and could see that he was crying.      At this time he wouldn't

speak to me.   2 other youths then came over to me and said that the

police had turned them away as there was no way that they could get

into the ground.   I then spoke to the youth who had been crying and

he told me that he had got through the turnstiles but had come back

out because he had seen people being killed in the crowd.       He then

didnt say anything and just walked off along the road.       By this time

a lot of people were coming out of the ground and I became aware from

what they were saying that a lot of people were dead.        One man asked

if he could use irty phone to call home and said that he had had to

literally fight his way out of ground.

Dozens and dozens of people then came to me and asked if they could

use irty phone and they all said the same.

I just want to add that from approximately 1300 hrs onwards dozens

of fans, some of which admitted to having been in Sheffield since

1100 hrs and had been drinking in the Fox pub, Fox Hill Road,

Sheffield were urinating up the fence of irty premises and I was
       informed by seme local residents that seme of the fans had urinated up

       their houses. In comparison to last years semi final I would say that

       although there were as many fans they appeared to have arrived earlier.

       I dont think there were as many police officers at the main gate.

       There were also far less ticket touts near to the ground.   The fans

       also appeared to be queuing far more orderly last year.

           I am a single woman living at the above address.

           I am a                        cashier working at the ESSO Garage c/o

           LAW BROTHERS TOURS LTD, LEPPINGS LANE, SHEFFIELD as I have been for

           eight months.   The garage is situated on the main road to Sheffield

           Wednesday Football Ground and I have witnessed a number of times the

           crowds going to and from matches.

           On the day of Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I was working a 6.30

           am (0630) to 2.30 pn (1430) shift.   I did not notice anything out of

           the ordinary until about 8.45 am (0845) when a light blue transit van

           containing about ten men pulled up, obtained petrol and then pulled

           over on the ground adjacent to the forecourt.   I believe they were

           from Liverpool because the accents when they got the petrol were of

           that nature. Some of than got out the van and stood around, I could

           see that a number had cans, beer cans, and had a four pack in their

           hands.   I thought how unusual it was to see people drinking so early.

           About 9.00 am (0900).   I saw about three police officers go over to

           the van, which I am sure had a rental sign on the side.

           The men had been jumping on one another and were obviously quite
boisterous.    I had seen three men standing openly urinating.    I could

not say they were drunk but they had definately been having drinks

for a while.

The policemen went over and took a number of cans away and appeared

to then search the van.    The van was then moved off.   The people from

the van were all white men, aged in their twenties. I could not

describe any of the men any further.

I noticed a few fans during the morning but it was not until after

10am (1000) that the crowds really started to arrive.     It was very

different to a normal match in the earliness they arrived.       I did not

know the nature of the match that day.    The supporters sat on the

wall adjacent to the petrol station drinking from beer cans and beer

bottles although I would not say they were particularly drunk or

violent, they were just in a good mood.     I cannot remember what

colours they wore nor who they supported.

By the time 2.30pm (1430) came the road was packed with fans.       They

were not particularly violent but their numbers were so great that

the number of them made me worried so a friend who was at the garage,

                                       escorted me to the bus.    I saw

nothing more of note.

           I am a married woman and live at the above address with my husband.

           I am a part time petrol pump cashier working at the ESSO Garage c/o

           Law Brothers Tours Ltd, Leppings lane, Sheffield.

           As a Cashier I have occasion to work on Wednesday evenings and of a

           Saturday and Sunday.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 I was working as normal at the Petrol

           Station and I was working at the time of the Football disaster at

           Sheffield Wednesdays Football Ground.

           All I can add to the days events was that on the day, there was a

           large volume of Football Supporters coining to the game and they had

           consumed a large amount of alcohol.     I presume this because they were

           dropping empty cans, bottles and containers on the forecourt and I

           had the job of collecting the empty containers.     I collected seven

           dustbin liners full of cans, bottles and containers and further

           shopping bag full later in the afternoon.

           The supporters weren't disorderly but they left the street littered

           with hundreds of empty canisters.

          States:-

          I live at the above, and work full time at Jenny's Sandwich Shop at

          128 Penistone Road North, Sheffield. The shop is same 600 yards from

          the Hillsborough Football Ground.

          On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I started work in the shop at

          7.00am (0700) in the morning, as I expected to work in the shop till

          after 6.00pn (1800), as it was the day of the F. A. Cup Semi-Final

          being played at Hillsborough. We did not do a lot of trade in the shop

          at first and in fact we seemed to be standing around. Then at about

          1.45pn (1345), the number of customers seemed to increase. They were

          almost all Liverpool fans, and although I would not describe them as

          being drunk, a large number of them had had a drink, they also had

          cans of beer in their possession. They were rowdy and swearing, but

          not violent.

          The rush at the shop continued right up to 3.00pn, when we eventually

          closed the doors. I was asked many, many times by the fans who visited

          the shop, if I could tell them where they could get tickets from. It

          was obvious a large number had travelled to the match without tickets.



                                                                                   1246

       I was also working in the shop on the same day in 1988, when the F. A.

       Cup Semi-Final was held at Hillsborough between the same two teams. I

       obviously can't remember in detail what happened last year, but in

       general the difference between the tvro years was that last time the

       fans seemed to arrive a lot earlier. We had customers from quite early

       on in a steady stream and in 1988 the main crest of supporters had

       ceased by the latest 2.30pm (1430).

DATED: 280489                                                            (SIGNED)



           I am the manager of the                       which is situated at

           Middlewood Road, Hillsbrough, Sheffield.

           On the morning of the F.A. Cup semi final between Liverpool and

           Nottingham Forest football clubs, which was Saturday 15th April 1989

           (150489), I was at work in the shop.

           At about 1200 hrs that day I noticed that there appeared to be more

           football fans in the street than there would have been for a normal

           league game.

           I noticed that the majority of the fans outside the shop were

           Liverpool fans and that they were drinking from beer cans.    I knew

           they were from Liverpool as I recognised there accents and the

           scarves and hats had Liverpool written on them.

           On one particular occasion I noticed one Liverpool fan who had a

           banner draped over his shoulders who was standing outside the

                                     shop, which is directly oposite my shop.   I

           could see that he was drinking from cans and carrying a four pack of

           beer in his other hand.    I could see that the group of youths he was

           with were also drinking from beer cans.    On one occasion I saw one of
the group run up to the youth wearing the banner and try and pull it

off him, when he failed the youth with the banner turned around and

threw the can he had been drinking from at him, but missed.

The youth with the banner then walked off down the road.    About 1/2

an hour later I saw the same youth return outside my shop.    I cant

say whether he had any beer with him at this stage, but I did see

that he was walking up to people in the street and punching them in

the stomach, but I cant say whether he knew them or not.

A short while later I saw the same youth collapse in the middle of

two cars in the gutter.     I got the impression this was caused by the

fact he was drunk.

A short time before this youth collapsed, I did see him walk up to

another youth and push him, and a scuffle started between them but

they were separated by other youths before any real damage could be

caused.   That was the last time I saw this youth causing any trouble.

Later on I did notice about 15 youths on different occasions

urinating up shop premises in Middlewood Road, however none of them

did it up my shop window.

At about 3.10pm (1510) I closed my shop and stood at the door open

looking       towards Hillsborough Park.    I could see that there were

still hundreds of fans still heading towards the ground.

I then walked                                   Jito Catchbarr Road,

from there I could see that there were still thousands of people

still outside the ground and I could that a lot of youths were

climbing over the football grounds fence trying to get into the ground.

A short time later I saw that the crowd was walking away from the

ground.

I could see that there was a policeman walking towards the ground so

I asked him, what was wrong, but he said 'I think theyre rioting but
        Im not sure.'

       At this point I saw a youth walking away from the ground.   I could

        see that he was crying he said 'You always get some mad bastards dont

       you.' He then walked towards the telephone kiosk.

       Another youth who was also crying was walking away from the ground

        and he asked me if I knew if the game was cancelled.   I told him that

        all I knew was that people were hurt and he said 'I was at Heysel and

        its much worse than that.'

        By this time I could see a lot more of the crowd were walking away

        from the ground and I could see that the majority of them appeared to

        be in a daze and were crying.

           I am employed as a                   at

           Middlewood Road, Hillsborough which is situated in a row of shops

           about           irom the Lappings Road Entrance to Sheffield

           Wednesdays Football Ground.

           I began work at about 9.00 am (0900) on Saturday 15th April 1989

           (150489) inside the shop.     I have duties which involve taking payment

           for goods and the counter in the shop is near to a large display

           window which gives a clear view outside and across into

           At about 10.30 am (1030) I noticed that there were small numbers of

           Football Fans arriving outside, and walking past.     None of these were

           drinking and they were all well behaved.

           At about 1.30 pn (1330) I left the shop to go to a local Supermarket

           to buy some food for my dinner.     Whilst out of the shop I had to walk

           past the Off Licence and could see that the shop was full of Football

            fans who were buying four packs of Beer and Bottles of Wine.

           By this time there were a lot more fans walking about and everyone I



                                                                                      1251
saw was drinking from either a bottle or cans of Beer or Wine.      They

were stood outside the                     p. few doors from ray shop, and

the                            shop which is directly opposite ray shop.

Many were leaning on cars which were parked outside the shops and

placing there cans and bottles on the roof of some cars.      I could

tell that these fans were from Liverpool as they were wearing scarves

displaying Red and White colours and Liverpool Football Insignia.

Many were also shouting at and to each other and I could hear they had

Liverpool Accents.    All of these fans were about ray age or just a

little older.    I noticed that there were no children or older adults

about as they appeared to have already gone to the ground.

I was away from the shop for more than half an hour during which time

I also visited                  which is in Middlewood Road but nearer

the ground.     I know the staff in this       ery well and when I went

in they had sold out of                                  I left            at

about 2.15 pn (1415) and I saw that a large amount of fans had

congregated in and around the fast food shops in Middlewood Road.        I

could also see a large amount of fans which I would estimate at about

1000 in number walking from the direction of Hillsborough town centre

towards the ground.

A large majority of these were staggering about and appeared very

merry, when some got to where I was I could smell Alcohol on their

Breath.   I went back to the shop and behind the counter.     This was at

about 2.40 pn (1440) I stood at the window looking out and across to

the                            Shop which was still full of Football

Fans. There were also large numbers stood on the pavement outside

 numbering about 300 to 400.    The majority were carrying cans of Beer

 and drinking from cans and Bottles.

 Whilst looking out of the window one fan I would say was about 18 or
19 yrs old wearing a Liverpool shirt knocked on the window.    I looked

towards him at which time he stuck Two fingers up at me in an obscene

gesture, then walked off away from the ground.

I looked back across the Road and could see three people urinating

against the               window, about five up against the wall at the

back of the               ind a large number against the wall at the

rear of the

I had seen the majority of these drinking prior to urinating against

the walls.    I had moved to the front door of the shop by this time

together with the          of the shop                 nd was looking

up and down the Road.

It was about 2.55 pn (1455) by now and I would have expected most fans

to be inside the ground but there were still large numbers outside

the shops along Middlewood Road still Drinking from Beer Cans.

I saw one youth, who had a Union Jack Flag draped around his

shoulders with 'England' written on it, who was obviously Drunk as he

was staggering about, gesticulating with his hands in a way that

suggested he wanted a fight, he was doing this to other fans around

him although several who appeared to be friends tried to drag him

away.   He then walked off towards a group of Policemen and was still

acting in the same manner, and shouting but I couldn't hear what he

was saying. I then watched him cross over the Road and fall over.

He took some time to get up but walked off.

At about 3.00 pn (1500) everyone of the fans that were still in

Middlewood Road ran off towards the ground.    These were about 300 in

number and Middlewood Road was very quiet.

I then went back into the shop to listen to the radio which was on.

Not long after 3.00 pn (1500) I heard a news report that there was

trouble at the Ground so           decided we would close the shop.
       We locked the shop and went outside I could see fans walking back

        away from the ground one approached us and said "Where's the nearest

        Phone" and "has the game stopped"

        I said "Whats going on"

        He said "Its just like the Hysel Stadium there"

        I said "I thought there was just sane* trouble in the ground"

        He said "No Theres people crushed and dying in there"

       We continued talking for a short time after which he walked off and

       we travelled hone

           I am a married man living at the above address with my wife and

           family.    I have lived at the address for five years and the house is

           situated

                          to Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.   Having lived at

           the house I have witnessed numerous days of football games, with

           the comings and goings of crowds including cup semi-finals.

                                                                               good

           view of the Leppings Lane entrance.About

           towards the ground

           called                             The owner is a friend of mine and I

           frequently go down and assist him, especially on football days.

           On the day of Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I was at heme.       I

           knew that was the day of a cup semi-final match between Nottingham

           Forest and Liverpool.

           I went to work as normal and worked an 8.30 am (0830) to 1 pm (1300)

           shift at a                in Stocksbridge.   I noticed nothing of

           interest when leaving the house.

           I set off at the end of my shift and returned home along the




                                                                                      1255
Manchester Road towards Sheffield.    I noticed an increase in volume in

traffic and as I neared the ground a number of fans could be seen

wandering towards the ground.

Except for the sheer volume, I would not say anything was out of the

ordinary until I reached the area of the Sheffield Wednesday Football

Training Ground on Middlewood Road.    There I saw a large number, I

would estimate hundreds, of fans who were drinking from beer cans and

bottles.    The fans were wearing red and white colours and I assume

they were Liverpool fans only on the grounds of the location I was

in.   The fans were not just drinking frcm a couple of cans, the area

was literally engulfed in cans.

I got hone and must have gone back out to the                     up the

road at about 2 pm (1400).     I suppose I go to                       for

two reasons, one to help protect the premises from rowdy football fans

and also to watch the fans who I find can be quite amusing in their

antics.

With me was                  and another gent who I don't know.   We

stood watching the crowd who, again, I would say, contained a far

greater volume than normal.

As we were stood watching the crowd, I was surprised by the number of

people there were in view of the close proximity to starting time of

the game.

At around 2.55 pm (1455), I was stood                     looking down

towards the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground.     There was still, at

this late stage, thousands of fans crowding around the entrance gates

area of the ground.    I saw a number of what I assumed to be

supporters climbing up a wall at the entrance to the ground.      They

 stopped on the wall and then disappeared as though they were climbing

over and into the ground.     I did not see a lot but there was a steady
                                                                          3


trickle of supporters climbing and being assisted by others in

climbing up the wall and over the top.    This wall, as I looked at the

ground, adjoins the turnstiles to the shop adjacent to the ground and

it is only my assumption that the persons would have been able to

gain unauthorised entry*     I could not describe any of the fans

climbing the wall but it was my view that I saw a policeman actually

assisting the people and even saw a man who I, again, think was a

police officer, actually standing on a fence midway up and adjoining

the wall, assisting fans.

I kept watching for a while and remember thinking to myself what

chaos it was. I did not really pay much further attention but I

remember the next time I looked would have been after 3 pm (1500) and

the crowds were reduced.

There then followed a number of emergency vehicles racing to the

 ground and officers in the neighbouring roads were all running to the

 ground.    I sensed something was wrong and, about ten to fifteen

 minutes later, fans started to drift out of the ground and came

 away.     They were crying and obviously upset.   Some were swearing

 towards police officers and were quite clearly blaming the police for

 the matter that had occurred.

 By this time I was aware of what had happened and I returned to my

 house and some fans came in to use the phone.      About ten came in,

 most of whom were well behaved.     I remember one who was clearly

 drunk.     He smelt of beer, his speech was slurred and his manner of

  speech suggested the same.    None of the other people using the phone

  gave any suggestion of people they were with being missing or deceased.

  I would be prepared to attend an enquiry.

           I am a married man and live at the above address with my wife.

           I am unemployed but assist at                              Leppings Lane

           with

           Saturday 15th April, 1989 (150489) was one such day that I went to

                                                                           Df the

           premises.

                                premises is situated on the junction of

           and                      Hillsborough and               looks out onto

                               with a view

           to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

           Saturday 15th April, 1989 (150489) was the day of a Football F.A. Cup

           Send - final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.      An exact same

           football fixture was played twelve months before and I was also

           working at                             on that day.

           At about 9.30 am (0930 hrs) on Saturday 15th April, 1989 (150489) I

           started work.       My job entails

           whilst I am engaged in this task I have access to leppings Lane and

           the people walking past.



                                                                                       1259
At about 10.30 am (1030 hrs) I noticed football fans walking along

Leppings Ln towards the entrance to the ground, they were wearing

either scarfs in Red and White or carrying Banners with the Liverpool

Football crest and name on them which identified them as supporting

Liverpool football club.   At this time I could see four Police

Officers at the junction of Leppings Lane and Fielding Road, and four

Officers at the junction of Leppings Lane and Bicherton Road, and

Leppings Lane at Shenstone Road also several other Officers outside

shop premises in Leppings Lane.   I also saw a number of Officers on

horseback but I cannot say how many.   The Officers manning junctions

are normally at these posts to stop football fans going through the

side roads to other parts of the ground.

At about 1pm (1300 hrs) the amount of fans walking past had become a

steady flow although they were still walking on the pavement.

Several fans used the toilet facilities of our premises which again

is normal and the owner                allows them to do so, but

during the course of the early part of the afternoon a number of

fans, I cannot say exactly how many, used the fence

               to urinate against instead of waiting for the toilet.

A number of these spoke to me and I recognized their accent as being

from the Liverpool area, I could also tell that they had been

drinking alcohol.

At about 2.30 pm (1430 hrs) and again at 2.45 pm (1445 hrs) there was

a great rush of fans along Leppings Lane towards the ground.      On these

occasions I commented on the fact there were large amounts of people

arriving, to                  I also looked towards the ground and

could see that there was just a mass of people covering the pavement

and road, stretching from the ground, back to the junction of

Shenstone Road, and there were still more people arriving all the
time.

These fans were just one large mass and there were no queues

whatsoever.   Whilst a lot of fans were passing I overheard

conversations between them which indicated that they did not have

tickets and I was also asked several times if I knew where any

tickets could be purchased.   Looking towards the ground I could only

see a few Police Officers on Horseback, above the crowd.

At about 2 . 3 0 pn (1430 hrs) whilst looking towards the ground I could

see a large number of fans climbing up a steel barrier gate and onto

the wall, above the turnstiles and then dropping into the ground.     A

short time later I saw a Police Officer stood on this wall who

appeared to be trying to stop further fans frcm climbing into the

ground without showing their tickets.   This was only for a few minutes.

The next time I looked towards the ground I could see two Police

Officers on the wall who this time appeared to be trying to help

people up the Barrier and into the ground.

After this I went into                     with                and also a

person I only know as            We just debated about what time we

were going to leave for the day when shortly after 3.00 pn (1500 hrs)

we overheard people outside shouting abuse and ccmnenting that the

game had been abandoned.

We all came outside and I saw lots of fans walking away frcm the

 ground many of which were crying and appeared distressed and in shock.

 There was one young man sat on the wall

 who had his head in his hands who          tnd I spoke to.   He was very

 shaken and said "It'd be worse than Heysel in there"     He didn't say

 anymore and we tried to comfort him as best we could but after a

 short time he walked off.

 A lot of other people came to__________ and used the telephones but



                                                                            1261
       I did not have any further direct dealings with anyone.

       In contrast to this event last year's game appeared to be more

       orderly, the supporters appeared to arrive earlier, queues were

        formed to gain access to the ground and Police seemed to have more

       control over the situation.    I also believe that there were fewer

       people arriving without tickets and those that did, arrived earlier.




                                                                        SIGNED

           I am a                and I work at

           Hillsborough, Sheffield.    I have worked at this place for five

           years.                                                        My heme

           address is                            near

           On Saturday 15th April, 1989 (150489) I arrived at work at about a

           quarter past nine (0915).   At about eleven o'clock (1100) I

           became aware that football supporters were gathering in the area.

           There were about three or four hundred supporters walking up and down

           the road.    The majority were drinking frcm beer cans.

           Frcm their accent and dress it appeared that most of the people were

           Liverpool Supporters.

           As the morning progressed the flow of people grew steadily heavier.

           At about mid-day (1200) the crowd was becoming noisier and more

           rowdy, I saw several supporters urinate on the             of

           premises.    This continued until about half past twelve (1230)

           At this time I left the          in my motor car and turned

           stopped at the traffic lights at the junction of Catch Bar Lane and

           Leppings Lane.
I saw a white male standing on the footpath, at the junction.       He was

about forty to fifty years old.     He was about five feet eight inches

tall with an average build.    He was wearing a red and white cap and

scarf and a Liverpool team shirt.    He was holding a wine bottle in

his left hand.     He was unsteady on his feet and frcm his general

demeanor he appeared to me to be very drunk.

I returned to the          about an hour later and continued working.

At about quarter to three (1445) I went and stood in the

              overlooks the Leppings Lane entrance to Hillsbrough

Stadium.     The entrance is only about fifty metres away



     . This position gives a good clear view of the entrance.       Only

the far right hand side is slightly obstructed by trees.

The area directly in front of the turnstiles was packed with people

and stretched back as far as the road.     The crowd was swaying

backwards and forwards.    More and more people were walking down

Leppings Lane and joining the crowd.

There were two mounted Police Officers in the middle of the crowd and

they appeared unable to move because of the pressure of the crowd.

There were three more mounted Police Officers lined up on the edge of

the crowd.

I watched for about five minutes and in my opinion a potentially

dangerous situation was developing as the crowd grew larger.

I saw supporters climbing over the wall and entering the ground.

Some supporters were standing on top of the wall helping others

climb over.

At about ten to three (1450) I saw the right hand exit gates open

and the crowd began running into the ground in large numbers.       This

continued for a few minutes as I watched.     I then went inside.
        I would like to add that through out the morning Liverpool supporters

       were continually walking around the                        urinating,

        drinking beer and generally causing a nuisance.      This continued up

        until about half past two (1430).       They gradually moved off as

        three o'clock (1500) approached.

                                   Hillsborough, Sheffield.   My hone address is




                    you have a clear view of Sheffield Wednesday Football,

           Stadium, the away fans entrance and enclosures, the view is only

           partially obstructed by wire fencing and slight undergrowth, this

           area is ccstrnonly known as Leppings Lane entrance and is

           approximately 50 meters (50m) distance away.

           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489 J

                                It was a bright sunny day, at approximately 10.30




                                                                                    1266
am (1030) I first noticed a group of young white males numbering 8-10

standing on Catch Bar Lane on the small frontage wall on the front of

              I could see that they were drinking out of beer cans

and bottles, they were not wearing any football team colours but I

noticed that they spoke with Liverpool accents.   I was aware of the

fact that the semi final was to take place later that afternoon and

assumed that these people would be Liverpool football fans.

Gradually by midday (1200) I could see that there was a steady flow of

people, all of whan I would assume to be football fans walking down

Catch Bar Lane towards the ground, many of whan were eating and

drinking as they walked along.

I would say that at approximately 1 to 2 pm (1300) (1400) in the

afternoon the number of people walking along the pavements had grown

and was a steady stream very similar to what you would get in a busy

shopping street.

By now we were getting youths walking onto                 I saw one

urinating alongside one of                    others walking down the

side entrance between ourselves and the              next door and

urinating on the wall.

A could see a large number of people still drinking out of beer cans

and bottles, the pavement and the front            had a mass of empty

cans, bottles, and chip papers.

At this time I would say that the majority of the people who were

standing around outside               and on the road were boisterous

and in high spirits.

The police presence at this time (between 1.30 pm and 2.30 pm) (1330

and 1430) I could see on Middlewood Road three police officers just

standing and watching the fans, outside the              next door I

could see three police officers and possibly a police wctnan who
appeared from time to time, they were standing with their arms crossed

across their chest, chatting amongst themselves making no attempt to

move any of the fans who were sat on the wall and standing around

drinking within their view, they did not involve themselves in any way

with the crowd.At one stage, approximately 1.30 pm (1330), I walked

over to the three police officers and asked them if they could move

the fans along from the front of the premises as it was becoming

impossible for me to carry on

                                                                  In my

opinion it was developing into what could have been a dangerous

situation, I was concerned

To my request for police assistance the police officers did not move

any of the fans, they appeared uninterested in what was going on

around them.    One officer said to me 'They're not causing any trouble

why bother'.    At that I walked away in total disgust.   I don't know

this officer or what his collar number was, in fact I would not be

able to give the numbers of any of the officers.

Throughout the afternoon I kept going to the                          and

looking to see what was happening at Leppings Lane entrance.

At approximately 2.25 pm (1425) I had gone to the         and I could see

a normal flow of people going into the ground via the leppings Lane

entrance, there was no panic.    People appeared to entering the ground

in a orderly fashion and I could not see anything unusual or any

sign of any disturbance.

The fans appeared to be entering the ground through normal

entrances.     I would say the turnstiles, the two large blue gates

were closed.

As you look at the Leppings Lane entrance from the__       of

          you can see a large painted sign 'Hillsborough'. At



                                                                            1268
approximatey 2.40 pm (1440) to the right of that sign I could see a

sole police officer standing on the high wall, possibly the roof of

the turnstile, he appeared to be pointing at fans and directing fans

who were climbing onto the side wall and over the metal fence.

I saw several people climbing over this wall.     At this time I was

concerned for the         on         and together with                 the

      off the             and into the      and            I kept going to

the      and looking over at the stadium entrance.       At about 2.45 p.

m. (1445) I could see what I would estimate to be 2,000 to 3,000 people

still waiting to go into the ground.

The crowd appeared a large mass of people, they had filled the road,

pavements.      At this time I could not see many police officers.     I

could see 3 to 4 police officers on horses, they appeared pinned

down they were not moving around, they appeared stationary.       I would

say in my opinion that the horses were not having any effect in

moving the crowd or breaking it up.

At this time I could not see any Stewards or ground officials outside

the ground.

I next looked over at the ground at approximately 2.50 pm (1450).          I

saw one of the two large metal gates, the one on the right as I looked

at it, it was open, people were going through in a mass.

I returned to the front of                to                         and

returned to the         and at about 2.55 pm (1455) I saw two police

officers on either side shut the gates, at this time a vast majority

of the people outside had gone inside the ground.

I did not notice anything else and returned to the front of the

premises to try and clear away all the empty beer cans and bottles.

At about 3.15 pm (1515) a white male who I never seen before together

with his son came into the           and asked to use the telephone.
        I would describe this man as male, white, middle aged, I cannot

        remember what he was wearing and he did not give his name.

        I returned to the       and saw a line of ambulances and fire engines.

        Throughout the afternoon we had a steady flow of Liverpool supporters

       who were using oar telephones.     I had a general conversation with a

        few of them, they appeared in shock, they all wanted to phone their

        relatives.    I did not get their names or addresses.   At 3.40 pm (1540)

        I left leaving the premises in           charge.

        I would like to emphasise that from about 12.30 pm (1230) the front of

                      *ere a scene to which I would describe as a beer garden

        and that the police were totally uninterested the whole situation.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I opened my shop as normal for

           business.   It was at about 9.30am (0930) that the Liverpool fans

           began to arrive in the Middlewood Road area for the semi final match

           against Nottingham Forest.

           The fans continued to arrive throughout the day and at 2.30pn (1430)

           on the same day there was still large amounts of fans going along

           Middlewood Road going to the Hillsborough Football Ground which is

           unusual because normally by half past two for a big match the vast

           majority of the fans are in the football ground.

           I would also say that between 2.30pm (1430) and 3.00pm (1500) at

           least two hundred fans were still making their way to the ground.     I

           also noticed that practically everyone of the fans were carrying

           cans of beer.     They were not drunk at this time but they were

           boisterous.

           During the course of the day I was approached at least six times by

           fans asking if I had any tickets for the football match.
After the football match had been halted and at about 3.40pm (1540),

due to the incident at the football ground I opened my shop and

allowed the Liverpool fans to use my phone and at one stage I had a

queue from the road into the shop and into my rear lounge.     It was

whilst I was allowing people to use the phone that seme supporters

came into the shop and stole seme of my stock            Iwas advised

by sane of the persons waiting to use the phoneto     shut up shop due

to rowdier elements of the fans coming into the shop.    I do not wish

to make any complaint with regards to the Theft of my stock.

When I did try to shut the shop I was threatened by a supporter and

whilst I was trying to shut the door, he kickedmy door and again

after I had locked it.   The people that were in my shop when I closed

it I let out by my rear door.

After I had shut the shop there were sane minor scuffles taking place

                  opposite my shop.   I don't know who was fighting

who.   This went on for a few minutes. There was no police at all

that I can recall in Middlewood Road.    Prior to the match I was

visited by a police sergeant and a constable to ascertain if I was

going to shut or stay open.     I believe this would have been about

12.30pm (1230) to 1.00pm (1300).

Other than the two police officers that visited my shop I didn't see

any other police officers in Middlewood Road, either on foot or in a

police vehicle.

           I am a married woman living at the above address with my husband and

           two children.

           I am employed as a shop assistant at S. Beres Butchers, 279 Middlewood

           Rd, Hillsborough, Sheffield and have worked there for ten

           years.   The shop is situated on a traffic light junction with Leppings

           Lane and about 100 yrds from Leppings Lane entrance of the football

           ground.On Saturday 15 April this year(150489) I was working at the

           shop from 10.00am(1000) onwards until about 3.00pm(1500).    Due to the

           fact it was semi final day we were very busy in the shop all day, the

           majority of customers being Liverpool fans who had cone to the match,

           I would like to say that the shop makes and sells, hot pies,

           sandwiches, pork pies besides meat and these are the items that were

           being purchased.    Liverpool people started to cone into the shop from

           about 10.30am(1030) onwards, buying things, and asking where pubs were

           and supermarkets for the canned beer as the morning went on more and

           more people were about and the road was very busy.    lots of fans

           Liverpool fans that is were carrying cans of beer around with them

           although I did see sane without. At about quarter to three(1445) lots



                                                                                     I 274

        of Liverpool fans were making there way to the ground along Leppings

        Lane from the direction of Hillsborough centre and from the direction

        of the Horse and Jockey and Beehive pubs in Wosely Lane.      It was

        obvious to me that a lot of these fans had been drinking because they

       were swaying from side to side when they were walking and in one

        instance I saw a liverpool fan having to be carried by two others down

        Leppings Lane because he was drunk, at one stage they stopped and

        slapped his face because he seemed unconscious. It was my observation

        that the majority of the Liverpool fans who came passed the shop had

       been or were drinking to seme extent that day although they did not

        appear to be behaving badly. At the time I was working in the shop I

       was helped by           and              who also made comments about the

           I am a married man living at the above address with my family. The

           premises

           which overlooks Middlewood Road. We are about a ten minute walk from

           the Hillsborough Football ground. Infact we can see the floodlights

           from the front of the shop. On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I set

           up a stand at the front of the shop next to the pavement. I had got

           some extra items in stock,

           similar things to sell to the football supporters attending the semi

           final. I opened the shop at about 9.00am (0900) there was not any

           football supporters about at this time. At about 10.00am (1000) I went

           to fetch                 who lives about a mile away in

           There was a steady influx of Liverpool supporters in and around the

           shop area. When I had picked up       I called in at the William Hills

           Bookmakers in Dykes Hall Road that was about 10.30am (1030). There

           must have been about 12 Liverpool supporters drinking cans of beer or

           lager either in the bookies or just outside. They all appeared well

           behaved I returned to the shop at about 10.45am (1045), by this time

           there was a fair amount of traffic on the road. As soon as I returned




                                                                                    1276
I sat up my stand outside the shop, by the time I had it set up, which

was about 11.00am (1100) the area was full of people milling about.

There was lots of people parking their cars on the main road and all

the nearby side streets. A lot of the people appeared to be carrying

bags of food and about half of them were either carrying cans of beer

or drinking from them. There was a steady build up of people as time

went on. At about 12.00 to 12.30 (1200)(1230) I had two cars park

right outside the shop. I gave them directions on the right road to

take when they went heme. They all got out of the car and sat with the

car doors open and on the bonnet and boot. They started to eat

sandwiches and then got cans of beer out of the car which they started

to drink. The area reached its busiest at about l.OOpn. (1300) There

were lots sat on a wall opposite and nearly everyone was carrying cans

of beer. There is an Asian shop keeper on the next comer down

towards the ground who sells cans of beer and lager. He appeared to be

doing a very good trade. I heard one Liverpool supporter say that he

had run out of beer. That was very early on. The shopkeeper told me

the next day that he had made several trips to the warehouse that day

to re stock with drink. As time went on we became more aware that

people had been drinking by the way they were behaving. By about 2.

30pm (1430) most of the people in the area had gone down towards the

ground. The last time I paid any attention to the people outside was

at about 2.50am (1450) when there was at least 30 people still sat on

the wall over the road. With       I began to clear up my stand and

didn't give the supporters much thought until we realised what had

happened. Later on I let a number of the supporters use my phone to

call

home.

           I am a married woman living at the above address with my husband and

           daughter.

           I work as a hairdresser at

           Hillsborough, Sheffield.

           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I arrived at the Hair Salon at 8

           o'clock (0800) in the morning.     The Salon is situated in

                 facing                      which

                          Hillsborough Football ground.



           At 11 o'clock, (1100), I noticed that a large crowd of about 200/300

           football supporters were outside the White Horse pub making a lot of

           noise, shouting and swearing.      The doors to the pub were opened and a

           large majority of the crowd rushed in and the Pub's doors were closed

           and they were only letting people in after others left the pub.

           The girls in our shop,                                        said one of

           the crowd had nearly exposed his private parts whilst I had popped to

           the chip shop.

           In the same row of shops as ours is a                            As I
went for the chips I saw the shop was a mass of people with about 20

other fans outside waiting to get in. The manageress,          was

opening and shutting the shop door after every fan left.

At 12 o'clock (1200) we had two Liverpool supporters who came up to

our Salon and asked for their hair to be cut.    We refused.

These two men were very drunk and I could smell it on their breaths.

The Police came and removed them verbally from the shop.

From our shop window I saw hundreds of supporters getting off coaches

                  Most of them were carrying cans of beer, same even

having crates of beer, walking to the ground.

I believe most of the fans I saw were Liverpool supporters as that is

where they park their coaches and I could hear distinctive Liverpool

accents.

I have witness about four semi finals, but I couldn't believe the

amount of fans and their drunken behaviour.     There were more than

before.

I also saw a lot of Police in the area of our shop.

We were advised by the Police to keep our premises' door shut after

the incident with the two lads.

At about half past two (1430), myself and my daughter left the shop to

go home in my car, which was parked near to the shop.     The White

Horse Pub was still full and the area was a sea of what I believe

drunken people and I was petrified.

There were hundreds on the pavements outside the off licence,

drinking beer from cans and bottles.

When we got in the car we couldn't get on Halifax Road for a long time

as people fell in the road and into my car.

I got on the Halifax Road and tried to get down Leppings Lane but was

advised by the Police to take a different route.
        I was absolutely petrified for the safety of myself and my daughter

        and I wished to tell of the fans drunken behaviour.

           I am a married man and I live at the above address with my wife and

            lildren.

                                  for




           The premises are situated on the main connecting road from Sheffield

           city centre, into the Hillsborough area.

           Next door



           I have worked for this company at this location for 10 or 11 months

           now and during this time I have seen spectators of all teams going to

           and from the Hillsborough ground to watch the various football

           matches, in the time I have spent there, I have found the arrangements

           to be well organised and good humoured and have never seen any trouble

           whatsoever.

           On Saturday 15th April, 1989 (150489) I went into work for what was a



                                                                                    1252
normal working day, I began at 9 am (0900) in the morning, and

anticipated leaving work at about 5 pm (1700).

At about 10 am (1000 hrs) on this day; I became aware of football

supporters of various ages and of teams I didn't really know, walking

towards the Hillsborough ground.     People were smiling and were very

good natured and caused us no problems at all.

A little later at midday (1200) or just after I became aware of a

large number of football supporters in and around the

                They were of both denominations, Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest fans.     I did not see                   but I assumed

it was full as I could see at least 100 supporters standing

         Some were on our wall, others were on the

and some were                   by the

I could only describe the scene as a big party, with everyone drinking

and to be fair having a good time.

Sometime between about 1 pm (1300) and 2 pm (1400) I saw 3 or

4 youths aged about 18 to 20 years sitting on our wall, which borders

our premises

I said to                                   "We'd better go over there in

case they do any damage".

We went over to speak to them to keep an eye on                at the same

time and had a brief conversation about who would win the match, what

the score would be and the like.     The lads were Nottingham Forest fans

and I am positive they were as they were talking like Forest fans and

not with 'scouse' accents.

Whilst we talked I saw that one of the youths? who I can only describe

as a white male aged 18 to 20 years, 5'8 to 5'9 (5'8 to 5'9) tall with

a good medium build, he was clean shaven, he had dark hair, collar

length which was in a good style and was possibly brushed back more
often than not.    He was wearing blue jeans and a navy blue jumper.    He

had a programme of some sort in his back left pocket.

Whilst talking to this youth he was drinking I think lager from a pint

pot and every so often he snorted out of a little brown pill type

bottle which contained some sort of substance which gave off a vile

smell.

The effect on this youth of the substance appalled me.    He went a

purple colour and slipped into what I would describe as oblivion, he

was unable to sit without assistance and at one stage I thought he was

dead.     I have no idea what was in the bottle but it's effects were

horrific.

The smell was overpowering so I moved away and continued my work which

included

The next event of any note was Liverpool supporters asking to use our

phones to tell their friends in Liverpool to book a bet on a horse, I

didn't want any trouble so I relented and allowed them to use the

phones.    Some used the toilets and one was urinating up the side

_________ r I had a word with him and he told me to "Fuck off". He

then moved on and I think urinated at the other side of our premises.

Finally I asked the supporters to use the                   and I sensed

that they were resentful of being told not to come onto our premises,

so I became even more watchful and anxious that the fans would damage

                  I even allowed them to carry on using the phone and

toilets so as to prevent them getting angry and damaging



Everything remained as I have described until about 2.45 pm (1445)

or thereabouts.     Then I became aware of a stream of supporters heading

off towards the ground, I couldn't give an exact number but it was in

the hundreds.
After the bulk of the people had left the area we walked around our

premises and collected glasses and bottles which had been left by the

fans and either disposed of them                                  Again

to prevent any one using them to damage our property.

At about 3 pm (1500) I turned on the radio to listen to the game

and became aware from what was said, that a disaster had occurred and

that the death toll was rising.

A short while later I became aware of fans heading away from the

ground.   They looked like they were in a trance and were obviously

very upset.

I then saw our                                    some almost staggering

back from the Hillsborough ground where he had been to the match.

He appeared very shocked and was obviously very distressed at the

whole incident.

We were then very worried as our othej

              who had attended the game with         was at least a half

an hour behind          in coming back and we were relieved when he to

came back, although he was in the same state as           and was also

very distressed.

                                were all discussing the incident and

      watching the fans go by;                 I then saw a group of

fans; perhaps a dozen or so, run across the road diagonally from the

direction               towards a minibus, a blue transit with windows

in the rear.     I believed them to be Nottingham Forest fans on the mini

bus as I believe I saw a Forest scarf and a badge.     I assumed from

this that the attacking fans were Liverpool supporters.

I saw the fans run across the road, screaming and shouting and saw

them attack the transit by kicking and punching at it.     They were like

animals and I was sure if they got hold of anyone that they would have
killed then.

The next thing I saw was a red/ pink distress type flare come shooting

across the road from in front                 The flare struck the rear

offside of the van and shot up into the air and into the                in
front of the vehicle.

I was so sickened by this; that I turned away in disgust.    We all came

back into my          and had a cup of tea.   Whilst we were drinking

this I saw from my                 a brown and white coloured South

Yorkshire Travel, double decker bus, pull up directly opposite

         on the inter-city carriageway.

I heard the warning buzzer sound and saw the rear upstairs escape

window open.    About 20 or more youths filed off the bus from upstairs

and down and rein down the road with no thoughts for their safety,

towards what I gathered to be a fight or some sort of incident.      The

youths still on the bus were shouting out the open door "Fuckin Kill

them".

                   rent outside and I pulled him back in and locked the

doors again, so that no one could get in.     I have to say I was

frightened for our safety after what I had seen.

I cannot say who the attacking fans were and can only say that the bus

driver might be able to identify them further.

After a while the area became less crowded and Police vehicles and

ambulances were going up and down the road, so we decided it was safe

enough to go home, this was roughly at about 5.30 pm (1730) to 5.

45 pm (1745).

           I live at the above address which is situated approximately 1 1/2

           miles from Hillsborough football ground.

           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), at approximately 2.15pn (1415) I

           travelled to Hillsborough town, my intention was to shop in the area.

           I was surprised as I reached the town centre as to how many football

           supporters were in the area.   I knew that there was to be a football

           match at the ground at Hillsborough that day between Nottingham Forest

           and Liverpool Football Clubs, but I was surprised as to how

           many people were still in the area.

^          Hillsborough football club is approximately 10 minutes walk frcm the

           town centre.

           At around 2.20pn (1420) that day, I entered the Co-operative Food

           Store in order to purchase goods.     Inside the store I saw 10-15 youths

           purchasing alcohol, either in can form or large 2 litre bottles, I was

           shocked as to the quantity being purchased by the youths realising the

           beer would have to be drunk prior to them entering the ground.

            I later saw another group of youths in Safeways food store, which is

           also situated in the town centre, this would have been at around 2.
GUILLANDCUMMING       DIANE    FINDLAY                                        2


30pm (1430).   These youths were also purchasing bottles and cans.

Most of these youths were wearing red and white scarves and I

recognised them as Liverpool supporters.     There were two men dressed

in suits purchasing wine in the shop as well and enquiring as to where

they could obtain plastic cups . 1 would have said there were

about 15 in this group.   The youths appeared to have been drinking

prior to entering the store.     I formed this opinion because of their

behaviour and the noise they were making.

I noticed that there were a number of police officers outside the door

of the store but I didn't see what occurred between them as they left

the store.

At about 2.40pm (1440) I remember seeing another large crowd of youths

coining from the Fishermans Arms Public House, situated in one of the

side streets off Holme Lane, Hillsborough.      I would say there were at

least 30 youths, again Liverpool supporters, in this group.     I

would say that this group were 'worse for wear' through the drink.        I

watched this group as they made their way towards the direction of

the football ground.Again I was shocked on seeing these youths making

their way towards the ground at this late time of the day, appearing

in no rush to get there.In my opinion none of the groups of the

supporters I saw were disorderly in their behaviour but they all in my

opinion had been drinking alcohol at some stage and some had consumed

quite a large quantity I would say.

           I am a married man living at the above address which is a licenced

           premises known as the Cock Inn.    My wife and I have been running the

           above premises for the last nine years.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989(150489), I opened the premises at 1100

           hours which was 1 hour earlier than normal due to the fact there was

           about 20-30 Liverpool Football Supporters waiting on the car park.

           They were quite well behaved and as they had had a long journey I

           decided to let them in.    From opening there was a slow build up of

           Liverpool fans until about 1330 hours which I would estimate at this

           time I had 200-250 fans in the pub.    They were all very well behaved

           their ages ranged from 18-45 years of age.

           During their time in the premises there wasn't one wrong word or

           disorderly behaviour.     They all behaved like normal customers playing

           pool and the gaming machine.     I would estimate that each had no more

           than 4-5 pints of beer I was not aware of any going over the top and

           throwing it down the neck.     Some of the fans had been here the year

           before and were aware how long it took to get to the match.    Others I

           advised to leave their cars and catch the bus.     the fans started to

          leave the premises shortly from about 1400 hrs and by about 1425 hrs

          every single fan had left the premises.

          It was a good day there was no trouble or damage caused my takings

          were 4 times up on a normal day.

           Road, Stocksbridge, and live in the premises with my husband

        We have been at the pub 12 months today. On Saturday 15th April 1989

           (150489), I was working behind the bar, the pub opened at 11.30hrs

           (1130) and we had a few Liverpool supporters turn up for a drink.

           In total there was about 150 Liverpool supporters that came to the

           pub, and the majority came around 12 noon (1200). Most of them

        wanted some food which we gave them, the pub was reasonably full, the

           fans had turned up in cars and mini buses.    I don't know of any

           Nottingham fans in the pub. The atmosphere was great, jolly and

           singing andvery friendly.   At about 13.00hrs (1300) seme Policemen came

           in and asked Supporters from the mini buses to leave and make their way

           to the ground in the mini bus they went without any bother. I would say

           that the most had a reasonable quantity of alcohol and I couldn't see

           anyone drunk.    The majority left at or before a quarter to two (1345).

           I would welcome these fans back again tomorrow, no problems and no damage

           was caused to our premises.

           I am a married man, although am now separated and I live alone at the

           above address.

           The Owl Public House is owned by the licensee, Katherine SALT.

         Although she is the licensee the premises are co-owned by Mrs. SALT

           and her husband, Ralph SALT. They do not live on the premises so I am

           employed as manager of the licensed house.

           I have been manager here since February 6th 1989 (060289) but I have

         been in the licensing trade for about 15 years.      During that time I

           have graduated from barman to manager.    Most of my work has been done

           in Sheffield.    However I have worked at seaside towns as well.

           The Owl Public House is a good mile and a half from Sheffield

           Wednesday's stadium at Hillsborough. Sheffield Wednesday F.C. call

           themselves the Owl and these premisesare called "The Owl" and the

           neon lights outside are blue and white, the Sheffield Wednesday

           colours.

           During the week prior to 15th April 1989 (150489) the licensee,

           Mrs. SALT, discussed with me our arrangements for opening the premises

           on Saturday 15th April (150489), the day of the semi-final between




                                                                                     1295

Liverpool and Notts. Forest.      We decided to open the premises but

first I removed all removable furniture from the public rooms, all

ornaments and pictures were taken down,      the    juke   boxand       televisions

were removed, as were       all of the optics and   bottles etc.from behind

the bar.

This left two public rooms, a lounge and a bar containing nothing

moveable. The lounge is approximately 36 feet x 18 feet (36' x 18')

and the bar is approximately 18 feet x 18 feet (18' x 18') but with a

pool table pushed to one side.      Both rooms are served by a common bar

area which is between the two rooms.

I arose at about 6.00       am (0600) on that Saturday     andthe       rocins were

arranged as above.      I checked my stock and found that I had 7 kegs of

mild beer, 1 keg of Guinness, 1 keg of cider, 6 kegs of Fosters lager

and 2 kegs of Mansfield bitter beer.      Each keg contained 32 gallons of

beer.     There were also 69 cases of beer, all contained 12 bottles, the

majority being 1 pint bottles of Newcastle Brown.

I left the premises at about 9.15 am (0915) and returned at 10.15 am

(1015).     A very large crowd of football fans were waiting outside the

premises.     I estimate that there were about 200 to 250, the majority

being Notts. Forest fans.

I opened at 11.00 am (1100); I was alone with no other bar staff to

help.     I would say that there were at least 300 at that time.    Notts,

fans were drinking with the Liverpool fans and they were generally

well behaved.       I spent my time alternately between serving in the bar

and the lounge until 11.50 am (1150) when two bar staff,

        arrived.     I don't know their second names, they were temporary

staff brought in for that day.      My permanent barmaid came in at 12.00

noon (1200).       By this time there were about 500 fans inside and 200

outside.     The staff couldn't cope so I telephoned Mrs. SALT and she
OLLERENSHAW           KEITH   NORMAN                                        3


came with her husband to help out.

The staff suffered a lot of verbal abuse during the period mainly from

3 Liverpool fans, at least they had Liverpool accents.      The only

problem we had that day was from the 3 Liverpool fans.      They were in

the lounge, sitting in the comer opposite the entrance door.       I saw

each one had an empty bottle crate under his feet.     I don't know where

the crates were from but they threatened to throw them through the

windows when I tried to retrieve them.   As a result I notified Police

Officers who were waiting outside in a van.    Officers came into the

pub and told the 3 youths to leave.    They did so and there was no

further trouble.   The crowd started to disperse at about 2.45 pm

(1445) and by 3.15 pm (1515) they were all gone.     By that time there

was no beer left on the premises, not even a drop for the staff.       I

would add that I sold no spirits during that session.      We had the same

fans frcm 11.00 am (1100) until we closed at 3.15 pm (1515) when I ran

out of beer.   The vast majority were male and their ages ranged frcm

18 to 50, the majority being frcm 18 to 35 years of age.      I heard none

of them asking for tickets for the game but I did see a lot with

tickets.

I didn't open the premises again that day because I had no stock.

On Monday 17th April (170489) last I was approached by BBC Television

at about 12.00 noon (1200).    I gave them an interview.    I have since

been interviewed by Yorkshire T.V., Granada T.V., Tyne Tees T.V., Sky

T.V. and many newspapers including the Sheffield Star, the Daily

Mirror, the Telegraph, the Mail and the Independent.

The only paper to misquote me was the Sun daily newspaper who didn't

even interview me.

I would add that on an average Saturday lunchtime I normally sell

about 75 pints of beer.

        When leaving the pub the fans were not staggering drunk but they had

        certainly had enough.    They were certainly merry; on leaving the pub

        they were shouting and singing.

DATED: 270489                                                             (SIGNED)



           I em a married man and I work full time at the British Rail Sports

           Club, Farm Road, Sheffield.      I have been working for approximately

           five years.

           The club is only open to Railway and Associated members.

           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I was working at the club from 9am

           until 4pm (0900 - 1600).      At about 10.45am (1045) I saw a group

           of people outside in the car park.      The group were all males aged

           between 25-33 years.

           I opened the club at 11am (1100) and the group came into the bar

^          area.      There were about 24 of them altogether and they were in

           Sheffield for the semi-final football match between Liverpool and

           Nottingham Forrest.      The group were all Liverpool supporters and

           they must have been Railway Employees because they had membership

           cards with them.

           At the beginning of the morning the group were drinking pints of

           lacer, bitter and brown and bitters.      All of them were in good

           humour and were no problem to me or the staff.      During the dinner

           tiire they occupied one corner of our bar and were playing snooker.
I asked them if they wanted taxis calling to take them to the ground

because they didn't appear to have any transport.     They explained

that last year they came to watch the same semi-final game and they

left it until 2.30pm (1430) to set off.     They arrived just after

3pm (1500) and only missed the first few minutes of the game.

Because of this last year they didn't want a taxi booking and said

they would call their own taxis at about 2.30pm (1430).

I left them to carry on in the club and after a while most of them

began drinking shorts of Vodka, whiskey and some were on Brandy.

They were ordering a pint of beer and a short to drink as a chaser.

They were drinking like this for the last half an hour they were

here.     They were all still of good behaviour so I let them continue

drinking.      If they had been younger or disorderly I would have

ejected them from the club.

I vould say that most of them had had a fair amount to drink by the

tine they left.     The taxis they had booked arrived at about 2.30pm

(1430).     I think there were three taxis altogether, I don't know

if they all travelled to the ground by taxi, I did not actually see

them get in.

I vould say that having listened to them talking during the morning

that they all had tickets for the game, although I did not actually

see any ticket.

I came back to work on the Saturday evening and a few of those who

hac been here at dinner time were back in the bar.      I did not speak

to any of them so I can't say whether or not they had got into the

gaire.

I did hear from other members of staff that they were showing their

tickets off in the club and they had not had to hand in the

counterfoils but I did not see this myself.

           I am

           have been in the licensing trade for 9 years.     I have been the

        Licensee at the Masons Arms, Capel Street, Sheffield, since March 1989

           this year (000389).

        On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), the day of the semi final between

        Liverpool and Notts. Forest, I opened the pub at 11 o'clock (1100),

       which is more or less usual opening time.         On that day the first

        customers in the pub were Nottingham Forest fans.        Normally on a

           Saturday the pub begins to have customers about half one/two o'clock

           (1330 - 1400).     On this Saturday we began to fill up almost straight

           away.     Serving that day were                                          and

           for the first tour or so it was busy but we were coping.     I believe

           it was Nottingham Forest fans in the pub but although the pub was

           full, they were no trouble at all. They were laughing and were in

           good spirits.      The pub is only small and there is only one lager pomp

           and at one stage, around half past two and three o'clock (1430 and

           1500), I didn't think we could cope with the numbers of fans in the

           pub.     The place was heaving.   The fans were drinking anything they



                                                                                          1302
could from beers to spirits and once they had realised how short

staffed we were, when they got up to the bar they were ordering double

rounds.     One lad I recall asked for 10 pints of lager, it was chaotic

because we've only one lager point.     I believe if I'd had bottles of

whiskey in crates, I'd have sold them all.    They were drinking so much.

The pub has not got an off-licence section but I can sell for

consumption off the premises and I estimated that I had sold

approximately 60 bottles of beer for consumption off the premises.       We

bought plastic glasses especially for this particular day and after

closing time we went up the road collecting these empty bottles and

plastic glasses up.

As a point, I remember people queuing in the hall to get in and at

about 2.45 (1445) I remember looking at the clock and the pub was

still heaving and it's a good fifteen minute walk to the ground from

here.

It was about this time that fans began to leave and a local customer,

known to me as          told me that he had witnessed a Martini bottle be

stolen from the bar counter.     The bottle was loose with a metal

measure attached.     He said it was about 1/2 full but because of the

numbers in the pub had thought it best not to make a fuss.     It's

strange but the optic was left in the bar on its own.

        the local, also told me about the damage to the pipe in the gents

 toilets.     The copper pipe leading from the main cold water tank to

the top of the urinals had been pulled from the wall and twisted.        In

all I'd say it was about nine meters (9m) of pipe.     We were able to

temporarily mend it on the day but since then I have had it fixed

properly.

I was quite pleased with the behaviour on the whole, the fans were in

good spirits.     I think they might have done the damage out of
                                                                               3


         frustration at not getting served quickly.

        The last fans to leave the pub left at about five past three (1505)

        and the only people in the pub then were the staff and five locals.

           I have been the licensee of the Commercial Hotel Station Street,

           Chapeltown, Sheffield for the past three years.

           I was the licensee of the premises last year during the same venue of

           semi final between Liverpool and Notts Forest and I didn't have any

           problems with supporters at all.

           This year I was working on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) at the

           pub at about 12.30 pm (1230) to 2.30 pm (1430).     I had three batches

           of Liverpool supporters come into the premises, about 40 in total.

           They all went into the same room and had became quite rowdy.     They

           were all drinking spirits and beers during their stay and had become

           quite drunk. They began leaving in their cars and mini buses at about

           2.15 pm (1415) to the match, the last bunch of supporters left about

           twenty to three (1440) which is late because of the traffic problems

           on match days. I had doubled ray lunch takings on that afternoon due

           to these supporters.   They did not cause any injuries to any of the

           staff nor damage the pub premises.    D W KNIGHT.

           During the morning of that day I was alone at heme.    I live about

           1/2 a mile away from the ground.    Usually on match days although I

           know the matches are on we do not see any fans and supporters near

           to our house.   They do not normally park in our road because we live

                                  and people do not like to park here.

           On Saturday 15th April (150489) people began to park their cars in our

           street and the surrounding area from as early as 10.15am (1015).        The

           area filled very quickly and by about 11am (1100) the streets were

           completely filled.    Most of the cars were full of passengers not just




                                                                                         1345
                                                                           2


a couple.   There were also a number of mini buses.    I would say that

all of the supporters in our area were liverpool followers judging

from the hats and scarfs which were being worn.    Most of them were

shouting and jeering at each other but it all seemed to be in good

spirits. I did notice and was very surprised at the amount of alcohol

which was being taken from the vehicles.    Nearly every fan had at

least one 4 pack in his hand.    The alcohol was being taken from the

vehicles in carrier bags and in seme cases cans on card board trays.

I could hear from my front lounge that alot of them were asking each

other if anyone knew where a pub was which would be open.    A number

were also asking if anyone had got a ticket.

this behaviour continued until just before lpm (1300) when I left my

house to go across town.    I walked down our road and onto the main

road.   I was amazed at the numbers of liverpool fans who were lining

the streets.     I had never known Hillsborough to have so many here at

once.   Even last year there were no where near as many.    As I walked

along the road I could see small groups of supporters who all had

cans of beer in their hands.    Quite a few of them approached me

asking if I could get them tickets for the match.     They all seemed to

be in good spirits but there were very few who had not got a can of

beer with him.    Others were saying that because I was a local I must

know where to get tickets from.

I caught the bus from Hillsborough to go into town.     I sat upstairs

on the bus and no one drove past Hillsborough Park which is a large

park near to the football ground I could see hundreds of people lying

on the grass drinking.     The people appeared to be all liverpool

supporters. It was a nice day on Saturday so they were all just

lounging around before the game began.     I could not comprehend the

amount of people who were in the small area.     It was as though the
                                                                              3


whole of liverpool had moved into Hillsborough.    The time when I

caught the bus was about 1.25 pm (1325).

I came back into Hillsborough at about 3.25pm (1525) I first noticed

how slowly the traffic was moving from the main Hillsborough Shopping

centre right through to Leppings Lane.     I then noticed the amount of

people who were coming out of the ground at the Leppings Lane end.

No-one seemed to know what was happening.    There were ambulances being

driven everywhere about 30 of them going to and from the ground.       I

got off the bus at this point thinking it would be quicker to walk

heme.

When I got off people around me were trying to work out exactly what

had happened.   Seme of the supporters were saying there had been a

large fight and 6 people were dead.    Then a few minutes later other

supporters were leaving the ground saying that there were 20 dead.

I saw at one point an ambulance which had two police motorcyclists

escorting it.   The sirens and blue lights were operating.    As the

vehicles were held up at the junction at the top of Leppings Lane and

Middleton Rd. I saw two youths who were wearing Liverpool supporters

colours run over to them and try to pull one of the policemen from

his motor cycle.    The policeman managed to stay on his bike and

continue his journey, but the youths had tried to pull him off the

bike.

The people coming from the ground were very confused and upset.        Alot

were just sitting in the road crying.

As I walked back towards my road I stopped to talk to a group of

supporters who were very distressed.     Alot of them were crying and by

this time it had filtered through that there had been a massive crush

at Leppings Lane.    The supporters were all holding their tickets

which had not been handed in.    During the following hours I was shown
                                                                           4


literally dozens of complete tickets which had not been handed in at

the gates.

I brought alot of the supporters up to my house - as did all of the

residents in the area.   They wanted to use the phones to contact

their families.    I made tea and coffee and tried my best to comfort

them.

Although I feel very sorry for all of the supporters who came to our

house and would not want to cause them any further anguish, I do not

think there was one who was not holding a can of alcohol in our house

and would like to point this out, they were not drunk but had all

been drinking.

During the afternoon the phones went down and I kept a list of the

phone numbers.    The supporters left the house and when the phones

came back on I started ringing the families to let them know their

kin were safe.

Having spoken to other residents in our area since the day the people

who run the local off-licence had queues outside all day.    Other shop

owners had said they had trouble during the morning with supporters.

After getting off the bus in Hillsborough and talking to supporters -

two lads who had been at the match said that a young girl had been

pulled over the top of the fence and appeared to be dead.    They said

that as she was lifted up seme of her clothes came off.     One of these

lads said he heard another liverpool supporter shout something to the

effect of 'throw her back and we'll give her one.' The two youths

who had spoken to me vvere very distressed by this and the fact that

they would all be tarred with the same brush as those who had behaved

badly.   I do not know who the lads were.   They seemed to dissappear.

           I am a married man and I live at the above address with my wife

           Our house is situated off Leppings Lane, near to

                        Sheffield Wednesday football club.

           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I was at heme with my wife on the

           day of the Liverpool v's Nottingham Forest football match being held

           at Hillsborough Stadium.

           At about 1420 hrs on this day I went out with my wife to take our

           beagle dog for a walk, we walked out of our road and on to Leppings

           Lane and towards the Stadium, which was quiet but busy as you'd

           expect for a big match.

           We walked further along Leppings Lane towards the traffic lights

           whilst near to the Far Lams Cafe at the lights, I saw about 10

           people crowding around a single man selling tickets.

           I would describe him as a white male between 20 to 25 years, about

           5'6 tall, stocky build, clean shaven, I think he may have had short

           fair hair.     He was wearing a long cratibie type navy blue coat.

           I say 'selling tickets' I didn't actually see him pass the goods over

           but my wife did and saw money changing hands.

The 10 people I took to be Liverpool fans due to the emblems on the

hats and the clothes they wore.

The group dispersed and we continued walking along Leppings Lane

until we came out on Middlewood Road and then into Wadsley Lane.

There was a steady flow of fans walking towards vis and heading

towards the ground.   I saw that a large number of the supporters were

drinking various alcoholic drinks and had more with them.

I saw one fan with a carafe of wine from which he was drinking as he

walked.   Another fan had about half a dozen Old English Ale bottles

under his arm and in his hands, I know Old English ale is a strong

beer made by Whitebreads Brewery and could have been brought at any

one of two pubs in Wadsley Lane which are Whitbread pubs.

Another fan had six cans of stones bitter which he was distributing

to various people.

I then saw several other persons walking towards the ground who were

drinking beer out of pint pots which were obviously from one of the

pubs.

I again took all these person(s) to be Liverpool fans due to their

scouse accents and again the emblems on their hats.

At about 1430 hrs the same day we passed the Horse and Jockey Pub

in Wadsley Lane and I saw about 100 or so people who I again took to

be Liverpool fans drinking outside the pub, singing and chanting

"Liverpool, we are the greatest"   and things like that.    To be fair

they were boisterous but not unruley.

Several spoke to vis and patted the dog and spoke with a scouse accent.

Further along the road is the Wadsley Jack public house and I again

saw more Liverpool fans heading towards the ground caning from the pub.

We carried on a little further and then came back the same way past

both pubs.   All along the route I saw pint glasses, bottles and the
          FOSTERASH               ANDREW


          like discarded in hedges and at the side of the road.

          We then passed the ground and saw all the fans milling about outside

          the ground at about 1510 hrs and some were crying and were

          obviously distressed.    One said to us that a wall had collapsed.

          We then went home to see what had happened on television.

DATED: 080589                                                            (SIGNED)



           I am a                            and I live at the above address with

           my family.   I have lived at the above address for two and a half years.

           I am not an active politician, however I do have strong views on

           certain subjects.

           At about 1.50pm (1350) on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489)

                                                                  tty intention was

           to catch a bus outside Tesco superstore which is situated at the

           bottom of Moonshine lane.   The bus was due to leave at 2.10pm (1410)

           and was to take me and        to a market in Hillsborough.

           I walked along Moonshine Lane towards the junction with Merries Road

           which is where Tesco is situated. Also on the same junction is a pub

           called the 'Devonshire Arms'. I saw that there were a lot of

           football supporters who I saw were Nottingham Forest supporters. I

           knew that there was a cup semi-final at Hillsborough between

           Nottingham Forest and Liverpool that day. They were all just caning

           out of the pub and were walking down Herries Road towards the ground.

           Some were carrying cans of beer and were drinking from them.    They

           were in high spirits and a bit boisterous but they were not causing



                                                                                      1353
any trouble.   The police officers who were walking with them and

situated at certain points were observing them and sharing a joke with

them.   The atmosphere was one of good humour.   There appeared to be no

ill feeling between the supporters and the police.    This was about 2.

10pm (1420). In my opinion it would have taken about twenty minutes to

get to the ground so they had plenty of time to get there.

At this time I saw about twenty coaches drive along Herries Road from

the direction of Norwood Road.   All the coaches were from the same

company and had a Grantham address on the back of them.       These all

drove nose to tail along Herries Road towards Hillsborough.       The

supporters on these coaches were also no problem at all.

My bus arrived at about    2.15pm (1415). We both boarded the bus and

went upstairs. We sat towards the back of the bus on the left hand

side and I sat next to the window.          sat next to me.

The bus travelled along Moonshine Lane to the junction with Southey

Green Road.    The journey along the road is fairly slow on a Saturday

anyway usually but today it was busier.

At the junction of Moonshine Lane and Southey Green Road there is a

terminus where the bus stops for a short time.    Also at this location

is situated the 'Magnet' public house.    My attention was drawn to the

pub because of the amount of Liverpool football supporters outside

sitting on the benches and milling round.    There were all drinking and

showed no signs of making a move to get to Hillsborough for the game.

The car park was full and they were sitting on the wall of the pub.       I

cannot say how many there were but there were an awful lot.       They were

boisterous and noisy but in my experience of other big games at

Hillsborough nothing out of the ordinary.    I passed the comment that

due to the time they were leaving it late for getting to Hillsborough

in time for the start of the game.    From my experience I would say it
                                                                           3


would take 40 minutes to get to Hillsborough, without having to get

into the ground.

From the impression I got of the two locations of the supporters I

formed the opinion that they were segregated.

From the bus terminus the bus turned left into Southey Green Road

towards Halifax Road.   As we travelled along the road I saw that there

were no supporters walking down to the Halifax Road, even though this

is the route the supporters have to take to ensure segregation of

their correct end of the ground, Leppings Lane.

Where Southey Green Road crosses Wordsworth Avenue there is a traffic

Island and there is another pub called the White Horse.    I again saw

that there were a lot of Liverpool supporters outside the pub,

drinking, as they were at the Magnet pub.

We travelled along Southey Green Road towards Halifax Road, again

there were no supporters walking down to the ground.    It wasn't until

we reached Halifax Road that I saw the droves of Liverpool supporters

walking towards the ground.   Some of them were carrying '4 pack' cans

of beer and drinking from them as they walked along.    I would estimate

that the time was about 2.25pm (1425) at this time.    There were groups

of policemen, two's and three's, standing together, watching the

supporters.   Again there was good humour between the police and

supporters.

I would estimate that at the pace the supporters were walking it would

take about 25 minutes to get to the ground without actual getting in.

We turned left into Halifax Road towards Hillsborough and there were

hundreds of Liverpool supporters making their way down Halifax Road.

They were not restricted to the footpaths and were walking in the road

holding up the traffic. I would say the age of the supporters were the

younger end of the scale, twenties I would say.   The vast majority
                                                                           4


were carrying the cans of beer and drinking from them as they walked

along.    Seme were sitting on walls and drinking also.

Halifax Road runs into Penistone Road North and reaches a traffic

Island where Leppings Lane is situated to the right. It was noticable

that as we approached the junction the crowd was increasing from

hundreds into thousands of Liverpool supporters.    Traffic from

adjoining roads was also held up by the volume of supporters trying to

get into Leppings Lane.

We eventually turned right into Leppings Lane and crawled towards the

ground entrance.    It was getting more and more congested as we got

nearer.    There were policemen at every junction along Leppings Lane,

at each side road, which is normal for a match day.

I formed the opinion that the police had everything under control.

Between 2.40pm (1420) and 2.45pm (1445) we got to the entrance to the

ground in Leppings Lane. I saw that by the blue gates which are

situated prior to the turnstiles the area was jam-packed with fans

trying to get in.    There was one police horse with a policeman on was

positioned just prior to the gates, which are blue, these are situated

before the turnstiles. The people were crushing towards the gate

trying to get in and this crush was apparent for some distance from

the gate.    Fans were getting in through the gates and the crush was

being relieved by the police horse.    His presence was such that the

fans were allowed to approach the turnstiles with a little less of a

crush than prior to the gates.

I cannot say whether there were any supporters to the right of

the turnstiles.     I believe it is the pathway which runs towards

Penistone Road.     I have been shown a plan of the ground and I can say

there no supporters in the area of the large blue solid gate which is

marked as 'C' on the plan. I cannot say whether the gate was open, or
closed.   I did not see any supporters attempting to enter the ground

other than through the turnstiles.

I formed the opinion that although it was a crush at the outer gate

where the police horse was a felt that there was no panic, the

situation was still under control.     I also noted that in view of the

situation at Leppings Lane the supporters at the two pubs I had seen

would not make the start of the game.

Due to the amount of people at the gate I cannot say whether any cans

of beer were being carried or drunk.

I noticed that once past the entrance there were few supporters

walking along Leppings Lane from Middlewood Road.       I was not in a

position to see into the ground at all.

After the bus cleared Leppings Lane we had no problems reaching our

destination.

Although I have not been to an F.A. Cup semi final before I have been

to Hillsborough when a large crowd has been there, in excess of the

present capacity of the ground.   I have not experienced the kind of

late arrival of supporters as I saw in Leppings Lane on 15th April.

I saw no damage caused to the bus or no person threatened at all as we

negotiated the crowd in Leppings Lane.        I saw no people selling

tickets close to the ground and      I am      not in a positiontosay whether

the people in Leppings Lane had        tickets to get in.

I feel that the trouble was caused on the day by the late arrival of

supporters to the ground, in view of what I saw in Leppings Lane and

at the two public houses on route tothe ground.

At 1pm (1300) on the day of the        game    I had cause tocomeback frommy

mothers house in            I walked from               :o Dorothy Road and

into Upwood Road.   In Upwood Road there are a group       of garages for

the residents.   As I approached the garages my attention was drawn to
                                                                                   6

       a football supporter who was wearing red colours, I don't know which

       team he followed.     He was a lad in his late teens and his hair was

       straight and short.     The lad was urinating against the garages.   As I

       passed him he looked round at me and then looked away.     He was wearing

       a red and white football shirt.     He continued urinating for

       approximately three minutes.     I formed the opinion that the lad must

       have been drinking for a long time prior to him needing to urinate.

       The lad was on his own, there was nobody else with him, or in the area.

       After he had finished urinating I didn't see where he went.

       Since the disaster I have spoken to a lady who told me that the off

       licence which is situated at Wadsley Bridge on the Halifax Road, was

       sold out of all its alcohol on the day of the game, having been

       purchased by supporters.     I don't know the specific place she told me

       about.

       I have referred to the plan of the ground in my statement and I now

       produce this as an exhibit       Reference NO.

           I live at the above address with my mother

           and younger brother

           Our house is about                   from Leppings Lane, turning left

           into Leppings Ln the turnstiles and gate entrances to Hillsborough

           football stadium are a distance of about 100 yards (100yds) .

           Between the end of our road at the junction with Leppings Lane and the

           entrance to the stadium is anotherroad, Vere Road, which runs

           parallel to our road.     Between my road and Vere Road area number of

           shops one of which being a newsagents where my mum works.      These

           shops are on the same side of Leppings Lane as our road and Vere Road.

           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I left my house at 5.30am (0530)

           to go to                Leppings Lane where I work part time. I left

           the        to start delivering       at about 6.00am (0600).    I

           returned                at 10.45am (1045).    At 11.00am (1100) I left

           the        and walked along Leppings Lane from the direction of Wadsley

           Bridge to the newsagents where my mum was working.      As I walked past

           the junction with Fielding Road, the police had put barriers up across

           the junction which is normal when a big match is being played to stop




                                                                                      1359

fans going down Fielding Road.     There were two policemen standing by

the barrier. They also put barriers up at Vere Road and Bickerton Rd

and as I walked to the newsagents I saw that two policemen were at

each barrier. While walking along Leppings Lane I saw groups of

supporters standing around on pavements talking.     They were not

misbehaving at all, they were family groups with young children and

lads with girlfriends.   I wouldn't say that it was particularly

crowded at this time, I had no trouble walking along the pavement.        I

did not see any of the supporters drinking beer at this time.

I stayed in the newsagents with my mum until about 11.30am (1130)

during the time I was in the newsagents I kept looking out of the

window into Leppings Lane to see how the crowds were building up.      It

was shortly after 11.30am (1130) when I looked out of the window and

saw a group of about 8 Liverpool fans sitting in a line on a low wall

on the opposite side of Leppings Lane talking and drinking from cans.

They were about 30 yards (30yds) from where I was.     Between 11.30am

and 12.00 (1130 and 1200) the area became crowded with fans arriving

at the ground, they all appeared to be arriving in groups of 6 or 7

and standing around waiting for the gates to open.    Between 11.30 am,

and 1200 (1130 and 1200)1 left the newsagents to go to my friend's

house which is in Shenstone Road. Shenstone Road is virtually opposite

the newsagents.   To get into Shenstone Road I had to walk past the

group of Liverpool supporters sitting on the low wall.     I could see

that they were wearing Liverpool scarfs and badges.      I saw that the

cans they were drinking from were beer cans.      I noticed that a few of

them had more beer cans unopened by their feet.      They were still just

talking to each other and not misbehaving.     My friend was not at heme

so I returned to the newsagents.

I left the newsagents at about 12.15pm (1215).      I could see that the

supporters had started entering the ground through the turnstiles the

people entering the ground were mostly families with young children

and lads with their girlfriends, they were queuing quietly.      There

were a lot more people around by this time standing around in groups.

The lads sitting on the wall were still drinking and were messing

about pushing each other and playfully fighting with each other.       I

walked to the junction with my road and the two policemen let me

through the barrier.     I then went into my house.

At 2.00pm (1400) my boyfriend,                              "ears old and

lives at                                 telephone no.          came to

call for me.

We left my house, went to the newsagents to give some money to my mum

and then returned home straight away.    At this time Leppings Lane was

very crowded with many groups of Liverpool supporters standing around

eating chips and talking, there was also a steady stream of supporters

walking towards the ground all of whom were behaving themselves and

were reasonably quiet.

At 2.15pm (1415) my young brother       returned home.

At 2.50pm (1450)                          left   our houseto go to a

friend's house in Vere Road. We got to the end of our road at the

barrier and the two policemen opened the barrier to let us through.

By this time supporters were walking quickly towards the ground.

There were so many of them they were also having to walk in the road

causing the cars to move very slowly.     We had to wait a while before

we could find a gap in the stream of supporters to walk along the

pavement with them to Vere Road.     We stopped at the newsagents so

could go in to get some sweets from my mum.              kid I stood

outside watching the supporters.     We could see that the queues at the

turnstiles were becoming just a crowd which was quickly building up.



                                                                                1 361

There were two police officers standing by the turnstiles, one

standing by the bridge approx 20 yards (20yds) from the turnstiles,

two police officers at the barrier at Vere Road and a police officer

on a horse outside the shop next to the entrance to the ground.

The two police officers at the turnstiles were having to shout at the

supporters to be patient and move back from the turnstiles, the crowd

was building up quickly at the turnstiles and supporters were starting

to push each other forward in an effort to get into the ground

quicker.   I looked back towards FIELDING Road and saw what I would

estimate to be about 50 police officers standing around the junction

of my road, I didn't see where they came from and there was still a

large number of supporters walking quickly towards the ground.

came out of the newsagents so we walked to Vere Road where the two

police officers let us through.           nd I walked to our friend's

house                             there then walked back up to Leppings

Lane with intention of returning to the newsagents to see my Man.

We arrived at the barrier but because of the way the crowd had built

up from the turnstiles we could not get out of Vere Road, the junction

was packed with Liverpool supporters who were pressed up against each

other, pushing forward towards the entrance and turnstiles.      The

crowd was very tightly packed and was building up from Vere Road and

filling the entrance to the Stadium and into Leppings Lane nearly as

far as the bridge walls.    The supporters just kept pushing and

pushing getting tighter up against the turnstiles and walls, they just

became a solid mass.    The policeman on the horse was in the middle of

the crowd and the pressure of the crowd pushing appeared to be pushing

the horse towards the turnstiles, there was nothing he could do.

There were now Liverpool supporters running towards the ground

entrance and crowd singing and chanting but not aggresively but in
LEE                     EMMA LOUISE                                           5


quite large groups.      Some appeared to be staggering, unable to run

straight, bumping into each other, they were running f i r m the

direction of Wadsley Bridge and from the direction of the bridge over

the river Don and Middlewood Road.     There must have been at least 30

running down from Middlewood Road and at least 20 running from the

direction of Wadsley Bridge.

As they reached the crowd they ran straight into the backs of the

supporters, pushing them hard forcing them forward even more.      They

kept pushing but not getting anywhere because by now the crowd was

packed so tight.      Seme of the running supporters who were Liverpool

fans were even ducking down forcing their way through the crowds legs.

There were about 5 police officers trying to stop the supporters

pushing at the crowd pulling them away from the back but there were so

many supporters they were just pushing the police out of the way

ignoring them then continuing to push forward at the crowd chanting

and singing about 'Going to Wembley', 'Going to win, the cup' and

'Liverpool Liverpool' over and over again.

        .ooked at his watch and saw that it was one minute to three

(1459) so we walked back down to our friends house at                     I

had one last look towards the turnstiles and the people at the front

were squashed up so much they wouldn't have been able to move in any

direction.   I was frightened because it just looked as if they were

squashing each other deliberately, the people at the front were

squashed up against the wall and it looked as if they were going to

suffocate, it was terrifying and I was shaking.

       and I went into the rear garden of my friend's house

which backs onto the comer standing terrace between the West Stand

and North Stand.

After about 2 minutes a lad appeared on the balcony situated along the
        LEE                   EMMA LOUISE                                           6


        top and rear of the comer standing terrace and shouted down to us

        'They're getting crushed' he was crying.     I thought he meant outside

       the ground I was about to shout        back 'I know' but he      then shouted 'At

       the front and they're still coming in'.      He then turned and ran off

       the balcony into the ground.     When he had come out and shouted to us

       there were two supporters standing on the balcony urinating over the

       edge onto the ground below, then they ran back into the ground to see

       what was happening.

       About ten minutes later the same lad that shouted to us returned and

       shouted to us 'Has it been on the news'.      'How many dead'.     He then

       asked us to make a phone call for him.      He shouted a phone number and

       asked us to tell his mum he wasokay.

       A number of other lads came out onto the    balcony for the same reason,

        so we wrote down the phone numbers and made the calls.

        I have lived here for three years and whenever there is a big match I

        have a walk up to the ground to see the supporters but I have never

        seen anything like the crowd outside the turnstiles.

        I am not a football supporter and do not attend any matches.

                which is approximately 200 yards frcm the Leppings Lane entrance

           to Sheffield Wednesday's football Ground.

           At the rear of the shop there is a back yard with a wall adjoining

           Leppings Lane.   By looking over the wall which is about 4'6 (4'06) to

           5' (5'0) high you have a view which stretches along Leppings Lane as

           far as a left hand bend in the Road where the entrance of the

           football Ground is situated.

           Although I am Unemployed I assist

                                   on a voluntary basis.   At about 9am (0900)on

           Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I opened up the shop premises and

           was shortly afterwards joined by

           The front of the premises has a large display window which looks

           directly out onto Middlewood Road.



                                                                                    1365

I was aware that this day was the date of a semi-final F.A. Cup match

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forrest which was to be played at

Sheffield Wednesday's football Ground.

At about 10.30am (1030) I began to notice the arrival of football fans

which I noticed were wearing Red and White coloured scarves with

Nottingham Forest football club insignia.    As the morning wore on I

began to notice that it was Liverpool insignias that was being worn in

greater numbers.    There fans tended to be in groups of five or six,

about the amount that would travel by car.

At about 11.30am (1130) I began to notice that many of the fans were

carrying 2 1/2     litre Bottles, and cans of Beer.   These were

being drunk by the fans as they walked past the front of the shop.

I also noticed at about the same time that the Numbers of fans had

increased and that a lot were congregating outside the fast food

eating establishments along Middlewood Road.

At about 1.30pm (1330) on the same day I began to notice that many of

the fans that were walking past and drinking Beer frcm cans and

bottles were slouching and appeared to me to have consumed more than

enough alchol already.     During this time I did not spend all of the

time in the shop but stood in the back yard looking over the wall as

it was a sunny, and warm day.

At about 2.30pm (1430) whilst looking over the wall I saw three men

aged in their early twenties going along Leppings Lane.      Two of these

men were assisting the third along the road and I noticed that this

third man was definately drunk.     I could see that his eyes were glazed

and he was walking very ungainly with the assistance of the other two.

I followed their progress towards the ground until they were

swallowed up by an enormous crowd which I could see had congregated

outside the Leppings Lane entrance and stretched back along Leppings
Lane towards Middlewood Road sane 50 yards with a thinning crowd as

it approached the rear of the shop.

At about 3pm (1500) I could see that the crowd at the entrance was

still very large and appeared to be tightly packed and there were

still a small number of fans running down towards the ground.

I also saw in the entranceway to the Primary School opposite where I

stood a man I would say was a 'Ticket Tout' I could see that he was

buying tickets fron fans and re-selling them to others almost

immediately.

At this time I could also see about four police officers on horseback

outside the ground in Leppings Lane and numerous pairs of officers

along the Roadways leading to the ground.    It was at this time that I

went back into the shop.

About ten to fifteen minutes later I heard the siren of an emergency

vehicle caning from the direction of Hillsborough Town Centre and

returned to the back yard wall.   I saw a fire engine turn into

Leppings Lane and travel towards the ground.    I could see that there

were still about 2000 fans outside the football ground and this

hindered the progress of the Fire Brigade.     I eventually saw it turn

into the entrance of the ground but was suprised as I could see no

evidence of smoke.

A short time after, more emergency vehicles arrived and I wondered

what was going on.

After about five or ten minutes I began to see that fans walking away

from the ground were very distressed and appeared in shock.     Many

were crying.   I then learnt about what had happened inside the ground

although no one spoke to me directly.

           I am a married man living at the above address with my wife.

           On Saturday, 15th April, 1989 (150489) I stayed at home until 1.00pm

           (1300) and then together with my wife I went to the shops in

           Middlewood Road.   We went on foot along Leppings Lane.   At this time

           there were obviously quite a few supporters on their way to the

           ground.   They seemed well behaved and in high spirits.   Seme of them

           were drinking frcm beer cans but they weren't causing any problems.

           After we had been to the shops I went back home with my wife and then

           I left her at home and went to work on my car_________________

                          just off Leppings Lane almost opposite Eskdale Rd.

           I arrived at the garage at about 1.30pm (1330) frcm where I was

           working I had a clear view of Leppings Lane and throughout the time

           the supporters were coming past I saw at least ten of them come over

           the small wire fence and urinate against the walls of the garages.        I

           can't say for sure what fans they were but I could hear the odd

           'scouser' accent. Seme of the youths who were urinating left both

           empty and full cans of beer around the garage area.   I also heard a

           number of people in small group® asking for 'spares'.     I took this



                                                                                         1369
        to mean spare tickets.        I heard at least five people ask this and

        they had Liverpool accents.

        At about five minutes to three (1455) the same afternoon, I heard a

        cheer from the ground which I presumed meant the teams had come out

        onto the pitch.    At the same time I saw a large group of supporters

        walking down Lappings Lane from the direction of the railway station.

        There were hundreds of them as if a train load had just arrived.          I

        didn't see any police escorting the fans which is what usually

        happens.     I can remember thinking that it was very late for this many

         fans to arrive.   There was a strong Liverpool accent amongst the group.

        After a whle I noticed the fans caning back along Leppings Lane some of

        them very distressed.     My wife then came and told me what was

        happening.

           I ccn a married man living at the above address with my wife.   We have

           lived here for fifty one years so are used to having a large amount

           of football supporters around on semi-final days.

        At                            :here is a garage area containing twenty

           seven rented garages. I am the secretary for the garages and

           responsible to the council for them.   The main entrance to the garage

           area is off Leppings Lane and, on match days, my wife and me have to

           stand around the garages because we have problems with supporters

           using the area to urinate in.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), the day of the tragedy, my wife

           and myself went to the garages at about mid-day (1200).    Obviously, if

           the supporters cone in and look as if they are going to urinate, we

           just ask them not to.

           On Saturday (150489) most of the supporters I spoke to left and

           didn't cause any trouble. Obviously, I can't speak to them all and I

           would say that I saw a total of twelve fans urinate against the doors

           and walls of the garage.   They could be seen clearly from Leppings

           Lane and also by people in houses overlooking the garages.

We both stayed outside until the main group of supporters had stopped

caning past.   I can be sure of the time we came back into the house

because we heard a loud cheer from the ground.    It was between 2.55 pm

(1455) and 3 pm (1500) and, within a matter of seconds, I saw a group

of supporters running down Leppings Lane from the direction of the

railway station towards the football ground.     It was if a late train

had arrived, I would say approximately over a thousand of them came

past.   There was just a mass of them, all running past.    I saw a lot

of Liverpool scarves and hats and presumed that the whole crowd were

Liverpool supporters. They were not being escorted by any police and

I noticed that the Police Officers who had been standing on Eskdale

Rd and Leppings Ln had now disappeared.

After this crowd had passed we went back into the house and switched

the television on and saw what was happening at the ground.    We then

went outside to see if we could help and invited people in who were

obviously very distressed and allowed them to use the telephone.

Further to the above, on Tuesday 18th April 1989 (180489), I

collected a whole dustbin liner full of empty beer cans and bottles

           I am a married woman and I live at the above premises with my

           husband.   We work in the premises in a downstairs workshop.

           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) my husband and myself were in the

           workshop, the shop itself was open.

           From about half-past ten on that morning I was in the kitchen facing

           the window which looks out over Leppings Lane and our garden.

           Adjacent to the garden lies a driveway which leads to where our garage

           stood before it was demolished.

           From about half-past ten, there was a steady trickle of Liverpool

           fans heading down Leppings Lane towards the ground.   A few were

           sitting on garden walls, eating chips and drinking beer, pop, milk.

           Quite a few people started to came down the driveway obviously

           looking for somewhere to urinate.

           I knocked on the window and waved them off.

           A few just nodded and moved off.

           After midday between 12 (1200) and 1 o'clock (1300) the trickle began

           to grow heavier and the fans were not so keen to move away from the

           driveway when I knocked so I walked down the garden to the drive at
HOCKENHULL            ANGELA.


the bottom to move them on.

One or two were quite noticeably drunk I remember one telling me in a

slurred voice "I dont know what you're worried about.     It's only

lager."

He was of stocky build, a large framed man with I think blond hair

and moustache.   He was dressed in a red long-sleeved 't' shirt and

I think blue jeans but to be quite honest I didn't pay much attention

to him.   When he had finished urinating he moved away towards the

ground.

As the fans moved towards the ground, several threw empty beer cans

from the roadway into our garden.     When we later collected the beer

cans they were placed into an industrial dustbin which we have of

cubic capacity 240 litres.      The dustbin had been empty before save

from wood shavings about an inch in the bottom.     By the time we

finished the dustbin was completely full of beer cans, the majority

of which were of super strength Tennents lager, high alcohol or

gravity beer.

From about half-past two (1430) there was a noticeable surge of fans

towards the ground in the main mostly drunk in my opinion.

The group seemed to be mostly youths rather than families.      Several

fans were actually coming from the ground asking oncoming fans if

they had any tickets.

The number of fans coming into the driveway to urinate actually

increased and they were now coming in groups of about twenty.

I stopped going down the garden to ward them off because of the

number of the fans. I continued to knock on the window to try and

stop them but all they did was turn to me and wave their person at

me.   I could not describe a particular person who did this but there

were a lot of fans who were doing it, a dozen at a time, it appeared
HOCKENHULL           ANGELA


to be an ongoing thing.

Upset by this, I was going to get a bucket of cold water to throw

over the fans but my husband stopped me and instead went to see a'

Police Officer.

A Policeman later came and tried to prevent any further disorder.

The next thing a virtual stream of Liverpool fans most of them upset,

the others angry came out of the ground and we shut the shop.

Before we did so two Liverpool fans actually came inside the shop

demanding to use the phone.   Unfortunately my husband was already

using it, at this the fans became very abusive and a Police Officer

had to remove them from the premises.

At this we closed the shop and went upstairs to find out what had

happened on television.

In my opinion, if the Liverpool fans had been more co-operative I

believe this would never have happened.     I was upset, angered by

their actions towards me, very upsetting.    The only difference from

last year's semi-final was the sheer volume of fans coming at such a

late stage in the proceedings.   Behaviour wise I regarded it as a

normal football match.

I would be willing to give evidence in any further enquiries in this

matter.

           I am a married woman and I live at the above address with my husband

                md my                                 We have lived here for the

           past 5 1/2 years.

           The house itself is approximately       fards away from Hillsborough

           Football Ground, Sheffield Wednesday's home ground however I am not a

           football fan myself.    One of the main gates into Hillsborough lies

           within Leppings Lane.    Consequently away supporters walk along

           Leppings Lane in order to get into the grounds.   On match days they

           are usually escorted by Police Officers into the ground.

           At about a quarter to nine (0845) on Saturday 15 April 1989

           (15041989) I was at home getting my young son                ready for

           his grandad to take him home when I glanced out of the front

           window.   I was in the front roan of my home at this time.   A dark

           blue what I took to be a Ford Transit van with no side windows pulled

           onto the car park of Law Brothers Coach Company which lies

                                                   The vehicle parked facing me

           and three fans got out of the passenger door, drinking from cans.        It

           was too far to see what they were drinking but the cans long like
                                                                            2
beer cans.

This was the morning of the semi-final between Notts Forest and

Liverpool so I presumed they were fans but I couldn't see any 'T'

shirts or scarves.

The next time I looked through the front window approximately half an

hour later the men were still beside the van drinking from their cans.

At this time about a quarter past nine (0915), a Police van pulled up

onto the car park and moved them along.

From that time on as I was doing the housework.     I could see through

the front window of the front room which looks out onto Leppings Lane,

a constant stream of Liverpool fans wearing red and white.

Some of the fans were openly drinking from beer cans, every type of

beer you can think of.

I do remember as the day wore on and I looked through the window, I

thought to myself that the number of people actually drinking beer

increased.    At one stage I thought everyone in the crowd had a can of

beer in his hand.     I couldn't believe how much was being drunk, I

thought the Police would have seized the beer off them.

At about a quarter past twelve (1215) I left the house to walk to the

hairdressers in Middlewood Road.      I was terrified, there were

hundreds of Liverpool fans everywhere, having a good time.      The fans

themselves were walking backwards and forwards, generally milling

about.     I walked up Leppings Lane, past the Chip Shop.   Feins were

outside the front door, inside was packed, eating chips and drinking

pop.     Odd ones had cans of beer.   I went up Leppings Lane to the

traffic lights, turned right into Catchbar Lane.      Dozens of fans were

passing me as I walked heading towards the ground.      They were happy

excited.     I went into the hairdressers on Middlewood Road.   As I was

in the hairdressers hundreds of Liverpool fans passed, sane banging on
                                                                            3


the front window, having a laugh and a joke.

As I was passing the paper shop beside the crossing on Leppings Lane

I did notice two Police Officers searching a youth.    There were also

a few near the gates.

I left the hairdressers at about 2-15pm (1415) and retraced my

route.   Hundreds of fans were still streaming towards the ground.     I

walked with them and as I was passing the main gates in Leppings

Lane, two buses had stopped at the comer opposite and were letting

fans out.   The buses themselves were packed.

By now there were hundreds of fans outside the gates and still more

hanging about in Leppings Lane itself.    I had to push my way through

the crowd of fans on the pavement opposite the gates and made my way

home.

My husband came home shortly afterwards and was watching television

in the front room.

I kept an eye on the crowd through the front window, being noisy.      By

about ten to three (1450) fans were now running towards the ground.

I saw one man obviously drunk swaying frcm side to side, his arms

around his mate.     I said to myself, 'How's he going to get in? What's

the point in going on?' to the ground I meant.

The man was white, in his thirties, about 5'6 (5'06) - 5'8 (5'06) in

height, wearing a brown coloured three quarter length overcoat with

dark trousers. He was of medium build.    That's all I can say, I only

caught a glimpse of him and he was walking away frcm me in the middle

of the road about ten yards away, towards the ground.

The crowd had thinned out by this time.    However, there were loads

of fans still drinking cans of beer, I'd say a hundred or more.

I then went upstairs and listened to the radio.    When I heard about

the disaster I came downstairs and watched the television coverage.
       As I did so I could see fans passing through the window.   Many

        including women were crying and dads were passing with their arms

        around their young sons.   That's all can remember.

        I would be willing to give evidence at any further enquiry if so

        required.

           I am a single man and live at the above address alone, however I am

           a   good friend of Constance SWEET who has been my friend forsane

           eight years and we visit each other frcm time to time.

        On Saturday 15th April, 1989 (150489) I was working in the morning at

                                                    and finished working at

           approximately ten past two (1410); frcm this location I walked

           hone down                                      which brings me into

           Penistone Road North, I walked along Leppings Lane and into

                                    all the way home I saw one or two youths

           urinating up walls and drinking frcm beer cans and wine bottles, as I

           came past the Gate Inn Public House I saw seven to eight youths

           standing on the forecourt drinking frcm pint glass, the youths were

           shouting full of high spirits for the game but I wouldn't describe

           them as drunk.

           The youths I saw on the way home were varying ages between eighteen

           to mid-twenties, the majority of them were wearing red and white

           scarves which I presumed them to be Liverpool fans.

           During the time I was walking hone I was stopped several times, in




                                                                                    1382

fact I would say between thirty to forty times by Liverpool fans

desperately asking me if I had any spare tickets for the Nottingham

Liverpool game.   I obviously told than no I hadn't any tickets but it

surprised me to see so many people without tickets expecting to get

into the game.

I got home and had a change of clothes and a sandwich and then both I

and my friend Constance who was visiting both decided to go up to the

entrance to see the horses on the way to the shops, this was

approximately two forty (1440).

We set                  into Leppings Lane, as we turned into Leppings

Lane and out of the cordoned off area the first thing that struck us

as very unusual even for a Semi final was how many of the Supporters,

Liverpool Supporters, there were still outside of the ground gates,

we were some two hundred yards (200 yds) frcm the gates and there was

a sea of red scarves and white faces still trying to get to the

ground, the Supporters were all making their way to the gates and as

they were they were drinking cans of beer and eating chips; the waste

of which was being discarded into the front gardens the road was

scattered with litter and the youths thought no more of kicking and

throwing the litter about, the youths I wouldn't say were drunk but

were singing and chanting football songs which contained swear

words; their behaviour in general was quite disorderly, seme of the

fans however were decent folk and were peacefully trying to get to

the game.

We continued up Leppings Lane towards the ground and as we were some

twenty yards (20 yds) up the lane, a swarm of fans, some twenty or

more came rushing down the road against the mainstream asking us if we

had tickets to sell, the youths who were approaching us were all

carrying four packs of beer and drinking frcm the cans they were all
BARTHOLOMEW          JOHN   RANDOLPH TOM                                 3


very boisterous, it would not be any exaggeration to say I could have

sold a hundred or more tickets between Leek Road and the ground.   The

fans were of all ages and frcm their accents and colours, scarves and

'T' shirts they were all frcm Liverpool.   I couldn't really describe

all of them other than they were all males and they were all

drinking. We continued along Leppings Lane to an area of waste land

opposite ' Cradle Days' shop and as we got there I saw two or three

youths standing in the next garden; next to the waste land, the last

garden before the hairdressing salon, the youths were urinating in

the garden without any hesitation, these again were Liverpool fans.

We continued on to within twenty yards (20 yds) of the gates to the

ground but the sheer ctensity of the fans stopped us going any

further, everyone came to a standstill, I would say we were level with

the sweet shop. It was now approximately two fifty (1450) there

were literally thousands crushing to the gates and turnstiles I looked

up to Middlewood Road and Constance commented that all you could see

was a sea of red faces and red and white colours, I said to Constance

there was no way we were going to see the horses that day.

We literally pushed our way to the other side of the road by the

bridge I could hear the fans bawling, shouting and screaming there

was a sense of panic in the area coming from the turnstiles, we

pushed our way along the pavement across the bridge passing supporters

all the time asking for spare tickets, again they were all drinking

alcohol, there was at least thirty to forty drinking on the

bridge and all of them were tossing their empties into the river, we

crossed the bridge and moved up the lane, we looked around but could

see nothing but faces and red and white scarves, we moved across and

to the other side of the bridge I turned round and saw a landrover in

the middle of the crowd by the entrance, 15 yds frcm the gates,
BARTHOLOMEW          JOHN   RANDOLPH TOM                                 4


there were plenty of Police about but they were helpless from the

crowds crushing.

We moved back towards a piece of waste land behind a tyre fitting bay

and we climbed a hill behind the tyre bay forecourt to a height of

twenty foot (20') from the road side but some forty feet high from the

level of the turnstiles we were some forty yards (40 yds) away, we

could see everything but I couldn't believe what I was seeing, at this

point I heard a voice over a public address system frcm the Police

vehicle he said "This is a Police message, this is an urgent

announcement to the Liverpool fans will you please stop pushing

forward, the crowd at the turnstile are being crushed", the Officer

repeated this over and over again, pleading to the fans to stop

pushing, I could see fans crushed flat, near to the turnstiles,

against the wall, helpless, they couldn't move because of the people

pushing from the back, at this stage I could see a mounted Policeman

on his horse he seemed to be moving into the crowd from the right hand

side of the turnstiles, he moved very slowly and carefully because the

crowd was so tightly packed, the Police Officer without thought to his

own safety slowly moved into and pushed or appeared to push the fans

away from the turnstiles as in an effort to alleviate the pressure on

those supporters being crushed at the front, the Officer addressing

the crowd from the loud speaker continued to plead and nearly begged

the fans to stop pushing the crowds forward. This had very little

effect if not any on the supporters.

At this point we were joined by other people on our advantage point,

four of which were young girls of fourteen to fifteen who I couldn't

really describe, I took them to be local girls from their accent.

I paid them very little attention and continued watching in

disbelief, another lad who was sat at the back of us, who was a
BARTHOLOMEW            JOHN   RANDOLPH TQM


Liverpool fan, asked if we had a ticket we said no we had none, he

then went back and sat down he too I couldn't really describe,

another man then climbed up the bank towards us he stood by us and

spoke to Connie.

I looted down and whilst the Mounted Officer was trying to push the

crowd back I could see the football fans were pushing a gate which

should have slid open from one side to the other, but they were

pushing it backwards and forwards as if to force it open.    They were

definately pushing it because of it's movement and momentum, the

mounted Officer signalled to other Officers who were riding up

towards the gate and he and the other three mounted Officers formed a

line to stop the crowd pushing, the Officer on the public address

system changed his message asking the people to move by the horses,

they formed their line to stop the kids in the turnstiles being

crushed, the crowd continued pushing, nobody was going anywhere, the

turnstiles were packed, the crowd was shouting, and the fans were

walking towards the horses and disappearing I thought they were going

under the horses.    There were Police Officers stuck in the centre of

the crowd helpless by this time I would say there was in excess of

two thousand and all of the width of Leppings Lane was a mass of fans.

I now noticed fans climbing up onto a metal partition, supporters

shuffled up onto a dividing wall and I could see Police Officers

lifting fans over the wall and out of the crowd saving them from

being crushed.     I commented that if they didn't stop pushing someone

was going to get killed and as I said this the shutter gate nearest

the river, the right hand one opened suddenly from the middle and the

gates were forced open from side to side, the fans surged forward on

the right and the fans on the left realised they were moving in and

also surged to the right, as the crowd moved on the right and the
BARTHOLOMEW            JOIN   RANDOLPH TOM                               6


pressure was alleviated slightly the gate to the left was opened and

the crowd funnelled in as a solid mass, the crowd suddenly disapeared

giving the effect of sand running throught an egg timer, the crowd

quite quickly disappeared into the gates and then suddenly the gate

on the right hand side was slid closed again, I could see before the

gate closed that Policemen were in the crowd directing them into the

gate.

The right hand gate now being closed the Supporters continued to

filter throught the left hand gate, within two to three minutes the

majority of the crowd had gone I would say it was just after three o'

clock.

Both I and Connie moved away and went to the local shop via Catchbar

Lane we went into a couple of shops and started to come home we came

back via Catchbar Lane and Leppings Lane, as we got to the Bridge over

the river Don we looked down at the entrance to the ground it was

very quiet, deadly silent and there was a number of people near to

the entrance of the ground who were all looking in the same

direction, I saw a few people start to trickle out, there was by this

time a Police car at the end of the road with his blue light on, I

realise now the car was blocking the road and I could hear a Fire

engine coming; a Fire Engine pulled up and firemen jumped out and

ran into the ground, an ambulance came, and then a mini bus with at

least eight or nine Policemen turned up and went running into the

ground putting on their tunics, other several emergency vehicles

came     Police vehicles, Fire engines, and ambulances, the trickle of

people got larger and as they came out we could see people holding

their arms and chests in pain as if crushed, men were crying

supporting each other, the emergency people were running and

assisting people out to the emergency vehicles.
BARTHOLOMEW          JOIN RANDOLPH TQM                                   7


I saw a Policeman assisting a young teenager out of the ground, the

lad was wearing a white jumper, when he got near to the wire fence I

saw him collapse, the Policeman bent down and began loosening his

clothes attempting to revive him, the next thing I saw was a group

of supporters at least a dozen came running out they were all

approximately twenty years old, they were shouting in anger,

"Murdering Bastards", they ran past the Policeman on the ground and

he was KNOCKED off his balance, two other Policemen came over and

started to direct them away and the youths look at them and

continually shouted at the Police "Murdering bastards, murdering

bastards" the Policeman picked himself up and continued to try and

revive the young lad who was apparently unconeious, the Police and

emergency services continued to bring people out, I then heard an

announcement in the ground, "Will the people on the perimeter track

move on to the playing area, so we can treat the injured", the pjeople

kept coming out stunned.

Supporters came out, some of which stood shouting "Murdering

bastards, Yorkshire pigs", the Police stood with great restraint,

some of the youths stood right in front of the Police swearing and

shouting to their faces.

I was absolutely shocked and disgusted at the behaviour of the fans,

one youth who stood six feet (6') away, shouted at the Police "I'm

going to come back and cut you to pieces" he aimed this at the Police,

the Police ignored all the remarks and continued to encourage the fans

to move on, a number of decent folk were also shocked by his manner

and told him to move on, this youth was approximately twenty five

years of age and 6'2 tall he was of medium build, and had a mousey

blonde colour hair which was curly, he was a white man wearing a green,

a light green, running style top with a hood, he looked like a
BARTHOLOMEW          JOHN   RANDOLPH TOM                                   8


Liverpool supporter, he was eventually pulled off up Leppings Lane.

We stood for a good three quarters of hour watching the disaster.

We eventually moved off home and fetched my camera we returned after

some fifteen minutes and saw that the emergency services were still

working hard to revive and assist injured persons, I took photographs

of the carnage in front of us. (Exhibit no.       )(Ref No.            )

I put my camera away and after a short while we heard another

announcement stating the match had been abandoned asking the fans to

retain their stubs, another surge came out and fans ran out of the

ground into the streets, I was still on top of the hill from where I

had taken my photographs.

The next thing was a private vehicle with a green light on it's

bonnet came to a screeching halt in the middle of the yard near to the

entrance of the tyre bay by the bridge to the river Don, the

person got out of the vehicle and ran towards the ground, the vehicle

being in the middle of the road, was moved physically by both Police

and supporters.

All of a sudden I heard a loud bang, I turned round and saw the first

mousey blond haired youth, the one who threatened to cut up the

Police, had returned, he was near to a second youth, who was thumping

the bonnet of the Police car, with his fists, the Police officer got

out of the vehicle and gestured with his thumb over his shoulder for

both youths to move on we heard another disturbance on the forecourt

of the tyre bay, I turned round and saw a man hanging off a tree and

he was shouting at the Police in front of him he shouted "Murdering

Bastards" he shouted that repeatedly and so loudly that he went hoarse

he appeared to have a slightly Irish accent, I can't really describe

him other than a white male in his forties wearing dark clothes, it

was now about twenty five to five (1635) and we left the area

still not knowing exactly what had happened, we went hone to see the

news, and on returning home and seeing the television we then

realised the disaster which had occurred.

I would like to add that when we returned frcm the shops there was a

pressman who was also jostled out of the way by the fans, a Policeman

moved him on obviously for his own safety.

I don't feel that I can say much more other that seeing this disaster

can only be described as a nightmare and we viewed it frcm the

outside, we have done nothing but talk and think about it since, all

the emergency services were very brave and performed their jobs

beyond their duty, the Police performed their job with great patience

and restraint, I was appalled by the minority of the fans abusing them

in the way that they did, it is my feeling that if that gate was

not opened a great many lives could have been lost.

Finally I would like to emphasise the actions of the two Police

officers, the one on the horse back and the one in the Police vehicle

who were both desperately trying to protect the lives of the people

being crushed at the front of the turnstiles.

I will gladly attend an enquiry hearing if carpelled, however, I will

feel happier if my details are kept from the press and alike as I

fear slightly for fans returning and possible repurcussions.

I would like to clarify two points, when I said the gates were being

pushed, I didn't see the fans pushing it, it is an assumption on my

behalf to say it was being pushed because of its momentum; secondly

when the gates were opened, I didn't see the fans force them open

they just opened suddenly from centre to right and left.

The film I had in my camera at the time of taking the photographs I

have handed to PC                (Ref No.       )(Exhibit No.       )

           I am a married man and I live at the above address with ray wife and

           two children.    I have lived at the above address for eighteen years.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I was at ray home, ray wife was

           working in the back garden and she mentioned to me about hearing

           supporters coming from the direction of Worrall Road, _____________




           I went upstairs into________________ this would be about two o'clock

           (1400) in the afternoon.

           From                     you can see into The Sportsman Inn public house

           car park, which is in Worrall Road.

           There I could see approximately fifty supporters but I'm not quite

           sure, and they were wearing red scarves and I could hear their

           Liverpool accents, which suggests to me that they were Liverpool

           supporters.

           The car park holds about thirty or forty cars and it was full of cars

           with supporters milling around and about them, and they were drinking

           alcohol, from glasses.       My wife has since told me that she saw fans



                                                                                      1392
when they left the pub later with cans of beer, but I'm not sure of

that. The supporters were all just enjoying themselves and were not

causing any trouble.

I then started getting changed to go out with ray wife, and at half

past two (1430) I saw the fans starting to leave the pub car park

and make their way down to the football ground.     I know it was

definitely half past two (1430) because I checked the bedroom

clock when I heard them beginning to leave the car park.

I commented to ray wife that they would be lucky to get into

Hillsborough ground for kick-off time, because I know having been a

keen football supporter in the past, and having been to Hillsborough

many times before, I have walked down there and on a normal league

game it takes fifteen minutes to walk down there, and longer when

there is an F A Cup Semi-Final game being played.

When the Liverpool supporters had left the pub car park I could see

that none of the cars had been moved, so I presumed that all of the

supporters must have walked down to the ground.

The reason why I wanted to report to the police what I had seen on

Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) was because I think that it is

relevant to what happened in the later events.

           I am a married man, retired from the                    currently residing

           at the above address.     I have lived here for 28 years.

           I live about half a mile away from Leppings Lane and the Sheffield

        Wednesday Football ground.           In my estimation it is a five minute walk

           from my house.

        At the top of Wadsley Lane there is a public house known as the Horse

           and Jockey.      It is situated                            from my house

                                        rnd is situated on the junction of Worrall

           Road and Laird Rd.

           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I was aware of a football match

           being played at Hillsborough, between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest

           Football Clubs.      On Cup semi final day I am used to the large numbers

           of supporters who attend our locality for the event.        Invariably they

           are here for car parking space and local hospitality provided for by

           the public houses.

           During the morning and noon periods of that day I was tending my back

           garden.   I was in and out of the house most of the time.

           As is usual on these occasions I saw 200 or 300 football supporters




                                                                                         1395
sat and standing in the area of Worrall Road and Laird Road.         In that

area facing the 'Horse and Jockey' pub, are grass banks, grass verges

and footpaths.      I could not see a single inch of grass for football

fans.     I saw that they were drinking from pint glasses.    I could

hear singing and chanting.     My earliest recollection of this was about

11am (1100).

At about 2.40pm (1440) my neighbour,

        came to me in the back garden.    She informed me that someone

had been violently sick in my front garden.      I could see that she

was disgusted and she suggested I take a hose pipe to the front.

I went to my garden at the front and saw the sick deposit.

I then saw about 100 or so Liverpool fans rushing down

past my house.     They were coining from the direction of the pub

towards the football ground.      They were undoubtedly in a rush.      I

noted that the time was about 2.50-2.55pm (1450-1455) I did not see

any loitering with the exception of several fans who were openly

urinating in the road.      I saw the occasional fan being assisted

towards the ground by people who assisted to prop them up.      They were

entirely incapable.      During this procession I heard the constant

drone of obsenities being shouted out as they sang.      I saw by their

favours that they were Liverpool fans.      I saw a lot of broken glass

in the area they had left.

I am aware that two residents telephoned the police to complain about

the behaviour of those fans.      I remanber that I thought, these

fans are a little late and are unlikely to get entry to the ground on

time.

Although I did not see any one particular incident of disorder or

damage I do believe that any enquiry should be aware of my

observations.     In my opinion, the crowd of approximately 100 strong
       who had left the local pub at approximately 2.45-2.50pm (1445-1450),

        their arrival at the ground would swell the existing crowd present

        clamouring to force their way through the gates.

       Most likely a good number were not in possession of tickets and in

        their drunken states would persist in their endeavour to get into the

        ground.    Judging by the behaviour of those fans that I witnessed and

        considering the huge throng of people attempting to force entry (with

        or without tickets) I consider that any action the police on duty

        considered appropriate would have met with limited success.

       A complete lack of consideration seems to be the reason for this

        tragedy.

            I am a married man and live at the above address with my wife and two

            children.

            I have lived at this address for five years and live

            Oughtibridge Comrades Club in Forge Lane,

                                                                                 is

            the 'White Heart' Public House.

            I am quite used to Football fans on visiting the Hillsborough ground

            of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, to seeing them stop off at both

            the Pub                             and the Club

            I would say that the Football fans when travelling through

            Oughtibridge to Hillsborough when they stop cause a general nuisance.

            On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I was aware that it was the cup-

            Semi-Final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Football Clubs, the

            venue for this match at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

            As early as eleven o'clock (1100) I noticed that at the Pub

            there were a group of football fans waiting to get into the 'White

            Heart'.     The road was busy with cars and I would estimate that there

            were approximately thirty waiting to get in, in quite an orderly




                                                                                      1398
                                                                          2


fashion.

I went out to the front garden to have a look closer and I could hear

frcm their accents and the scarfs that they were wearing that they

were Liverpool fans.

I watch from the front garden whilst doing seme gardening.   Fans were

coming and going to and from the Pub and their cars throughout the

rooming.

At approximately quarter to three (1445) I saw a larger number of

people leaving the Pub area obviously to go to the match.    I could

not say how long these fans had been in the Pub but I would estimate a

group of twenty left, all in high spirits.   They were singing and

swearing. I could tell again from their accents that they were from

Liverpool. They had all obviously had a few to drink and I would

describe seme of them as drunk.    They were unsteady on their feet and

they sounded drunk.

I kept an eye on these lads because they were being so rowdy.    I

consider quarter to three (1445) quite late for them to be leaving for

a three o'clock (1500) kick off.

I then noticed that the majority of the fans, seme fourteen or more,

had turned to the wall of the Pub and started urinating up the wall.

I was disgusted by their behaviour, not only by their actions but for

the fact that the pavement is narrow at this location and anybody

daring to walk by would have had to do so by walking in the road.

They had no excuse for urinating up the wall there was a Public toilet

where they had just left.

This group moved away from the wall adjusting themselves and went and

got into cars.   I presume to go to the match.

During the morning when the fans were ccming out I noticed them

urinating up my garage which is situated some ten yards down frcm my
        house                        The fans drifted away from the area and

        the area went back to its normal self, apart from the street being

        scattered with empty cans and the walls being urine stained.   The beer

        cans they left were generally scattered along the roadside,

             and the White Heart Pub side.

           States

           I live at the above address with my family.

           I was not in the area of Sheffield Wednesday football ground at the

           time of the FA Cup Semi final of 1988 (000088), however this year on

           15th April 1989 (150489) I was in the area.

           At about 1.00 pm (1300) that day I was driving in the Wadsley Lane

           area. It was about 1.50 pm (1350), when I passed the horse & Jockey

           pub.   %   attention was drawn to the pub by the large number of people

           outside the public house, and on the waste ground opposite drinking.

           I would estimate I saw about 200/300 people, who by there dress were

           football fans.    I am not able to say which team they would be

           supporting. I thought no more about it, and went home for my lunch.       I

           went out again at 2.00 pm (1400) and this time I drove up Wadsley

           Road, and into Roberston Road.    There outside the Sportsman public

           house I saw another large group of football supporters standing

           outside drinking, also in Laud Road I passed a pub known as the

           Wadsley Jack, and again I saw a large number of football fans standing

           outside drinking. It was a nice day and although none of the persons I




                                                                                         1401
        saw were being rowdy or disorderly, I was surprised that the people

       were drinking so late before the match, and I thought at the time,

       w h a t would happen was that the fans would all get down to the ground

        at the last minute.     I did not go anywhere near the ground myself.

        I have spoken to Mr                                         who lives

       close by and he has told me of the action of the fans at lunch time

       outside the horse & jockey pub.     He spoke of fans walking in crowds

        towards the ground, and urinating in gardens and in the street.

           I am presently retired.   I have lived at the above address since 1939

           (000039). I live some ten minutes walk from the Hillsborough Football

           Stadium. Although I do not support any particular football club, I

           have, however, since 1979 (000079), walked up to the Hillsborough

           Football Stadium on every occasion a match is held.    I never go in as

           a supporter but enjoy watching the supporters outside and entering

           the ground. As usual I spent considerable time in the vicinity of the

           Hillsborough Stadium when last year's semi-final was held there.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I knew there was a Semi Final

           being held at Hillsborough Stadium between Liverpool and Nottingham

           Forest so I left home shortly after 1pm (1300) to walk the ten minute

           walk to the Hillsborough ground.    At this time in Penistone Rd there

           appeared to be a decent crowd making their way towards the ground,

           traffic flow was heavy though.     There were numerous Liverpool

           supporters asking me whether I had any tickets.     I was very surprised

           at the large number of Liverpool supporters asking for tickets

           considering it was an All-Ticket match.     I saw no disorder or
                                                                         2


drunkenness in Penistone Road.

As I entered Leppings Lane I noticed large numbers of supporters

shouting abuse at Police because they didn't have tickets and they

were angry about being in Leppings Lane end.    I saw three supporters

urinating against some lock-up garages.    A man came up and chucked a

bucket of water over them.    I saw lots and lots of supporters carrying

cans of beer, they were very loud in comparison to last year's Semi

Final.   There appeared more supporters this time and they were not

very orderly in comparison to last year.

I took up a position on the bridge opposite the Leppings Lane entrance

about 1425 hours that day.

I just stood and watched the crowd build up.    There were no queues

formulating just a mass of p)ecple.   Policemen on horses were

trying without success to control the mass.     I saw a Policeman on a

horse telling fans without tickets to go away, some went but then

returned.     I could see several supporters climbing over the top of the

turnstiles.    This was about five minutes to three (1455).

I saw a Police Inspector pull a youth from out of the crowd in front

of the turnstile.     I thought then something must be wrong at the front

of the turnstile.

Where I was stood I was surrounded by youths who had not got tickets.

I heard them asking everybody including me if I had tickets.     Since

first arriving at the Leppings Lane gate and just before 3 pm (1500),

I would say the supporters had doubled in numbers.     On my initial

arrival I would say the crowd would of been manageable but by 3 pm

(1500) it was out of control totally.     A Police Land Rover with a

Public Address system requested all the supporters to come back to

alleviate the pressure off the turnstiles but there was no response.

Even when the Inspector requested them to retreat.

I then saw the Superintendent on the parapet on the Leppings Lane

bridge obviously assessing the crowd this was just before I heard the

first big roar frcm the crowd inside normally consistent with the

teams entering the pitch.

Within five minutes I saw the crowd suddenly move in a forwards

movement.     Supporters who initially were on the road outside the main

entrance had gone through the turnstiles.     I thought this was unusual

as up till then all the supporters had only been filtering through

very slowly.

I then saw a fire engine arrive and Officers alighting with first aid

equipment.     Then lots of ambulances and Police making their way into

the ground.

I remained opposite the Leppings Lane entrance until 1620 hours.     I

saw the ground emptying.

I knew something had gone wrong.

Those supporters who were then throwing abuse at Policemen were just

ignored.

I slowly walked heme but first called into the Football Stadium via a

Penistone Road entrance.     I saw where the trouble had been in the West

Stand and then made my way heme.

           I am a single woman and I live at the above address with my mother.           I

           have lived in this house all of my life.

           My father used to take me to Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield when I

           was a child to watch Sheffield Wednesday.          I last visited Hillsborough

           Stadium when Sheffield Wednesday played Wimbledon during December

           1987.




•       I
        _____________________________________________________________________________

           Having lived all my life in this house I am quite used to large crowds

           of football supporters being in the area, to attend matches at

           Hillsborough, cars are usually parked on the roadway outside our house

           on match days by the football fans.

           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I knew that the F.A Cup Semi Final

           was to be played at Hillsborough Stadium and was to be between

           Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

           I do not have to go to work on Saturdays and I decided to keep my car
                                                                            2


in my garage, and off the roadway, as a result of the football

fixture.     I knew that the road outside our house would be used by

the fans to leave their cars parked thereon. I fully expected the area

around my house to be busy with football fans.

On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) at about 11.30am (1130) I went out,

on my own, to walk to the local shops in the Hillsborough area.        It

was a fine dry day.

The street outside my house was quiet, only cars belonging to

residents were parked on it.

I noticed a lot of uniformed police officers on foot as I walked to

the shops.     I would say that at that time of the morning there was two

policemen on each street comer.

As I walked along Bradfield Road two young men came out of the 'Blue

Ball' public house I saw that these men were carrying cans of beer.

Both these men had red and white scarves on, I don't know if they were

fans of Liverpool or Nottingham Forest.

I noticed that the Hillsborough shopping centre appeared quieter than

normal with fewer shoppers present.

I walked back home with my shopping arriving about 12.30pm to 12.45pm

(1230 to 1245).     I saw that there was still lots of Policemen

in the area.     I never encountered any problems with anyone on my trips

to and frcm the local shops.     On the way home I went into a

newsagents shop and while in there a young man on his own came in and

asked the shop keeper for the directions to the 'Beehive' public house.

This man did not have any football supporters scarf on.     I presumed he

was a stranger to the area.     He was quite a way frcm this particular

public house.

About 1.45 pm (1345) I noticed our road outside was filling up with

parked motor cars. It was not too busy with people.
I went out again at 2.45pm (1345) again on my own, to walk to a

local fruit shop                                     This shop is

situated in Marlcliffe Road.

As I walked along, I could see large crowds of mainly young men

walking towards the football ground.    These people were singing and it

sounded like drunken singing.     I would not describe it as happily

singing football songs, it was more like the singing associated with

late night drinkers.    It was a very noisy crowd I felt quite

apprehensive, as the crowd appeared to contain many young men who were

obviously drunk. I would in order to reach the fruit shop have to walk

against the flow of this crowd.    Crowds generally do not cause me any

concern living in this area, I am used to large football crowds.       It

was not the crowd that concerned me but rather the fact that many were

drunk.

In Wadsley Ln, there were cars parked on both sides of the road.

People were continually walking across the road.    Many of the people

had red and white football scarves.     I can't say which team they

supported but at that time, so close to the kick off and that location

being the part of the ground reserved for the Liverpool supporters, I

presumed that they were supporters of Liverpool.

I would estimate that it would take this crowd between 5 and 10

minutes to reach the outside of the Hillsborough Stadium.

I would say that there was at least a couple of hundred people that I

seen walk past, as I approached the comer.      I did not by any means

see all of the crowd.

I decided to return home, without visiting the shops, as I did not

wish to walk against the crowd.

I turned around and walked back towards my house the singing and noise

was continuous frcm the crowd.
                                                                             4


When I reached my path, at the front of my house, I looked back

towards this comer and I saw that the crowd was still as heavy as

ever, with no break in the crowd, all walking towards the football

ground.

It was most unusual to see crowds of fans still walking to the ground

so late as this.     I thought it is usual to see the odd lone person or

people in small groups, shortly before the kick off but not people

in the large number that I seen on that occasion, still making their

way to the ground at such a late hour.

I went back into my house and waited for half an hour, I went back to

the shop at 3.15pm (1515).     The area was now clear of people.       The

roads were full of parked cars.

In the shop the young man who was on his own told me he was a bit

uneasy on his own, with such large group of people in the area.         A

Liverpool fan came into the shop on his own and asked if he could use

the telephone.     He seemed a decent man.   I still had no idea what

had happened at the Hillsborough Stadium.

As I walked heme, I passed a telephone box, I saw a Liverpool fan

inside the telephone box and two other young men sitting on the

pavement outside, each holding their heads in their hands.

When I reached home I put Radio Sheffield on, on the radio.        I heard

repeated requests made on the radio progranme, asking for off-duty

police officers to report to Hammerton Road Police Station.        I

then frcm this radio station learned of the full extent of the

disaster at Hillsborough Stadium.     I put on the television and saw the

events at Hillsborough of the disaster, on the television.I looked out

the window with my mother as people returned to our road,

about 4.15pm (1615).     The crowd was quiet.   I was aware of an eerie

silence about them.
        I had heard sirens sounding most of the afternoon in the area.    I

       prepared to offer assistance to the supporters, use of the telephone

       or tea, but although seme of the fans visited seme of the houses in

       the road, most of them left quietly.

       On Sunday 16 April 1989 (160489) I went to the Royal Hallamshire

       Hospital,

                                                  I arrived at about 10.20

        (1020) that morning.

        In a waiting room of one of the wards, I came upon the family of a man

       who had suffered injury at the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.     They

       were waiting to hear resullts of tests on a man.   I do not know this

       man's name.

        I spoke with this family for a while, they said they would like to

        attend the church service but had to wait to find out the results of

       tests carried out on the detained family member.

        I am a married man and I live at the above address with my wife.    I

        have lived here for about the last 7 months.    We live

                                    near to a pub called Hie Horse and Jockey.

                                                   there is a large open

        expanse of grassed land.

        At about 12.30 pm (1230 hours), on Saturday 15th April 1989

        (150489), I became aware of a number of Liverpool football club

        supporters gathering on the grassed area which is almost just on the

        corner of Lower Road and Worrall. There must have been at least 300

        of them.     A lot of them were wearing Liverpool F.C. regalia, I saw

        that a lot of them were drinking beer from cans as well as spirits

        and wines.

        At the front and rear of the pub, that's the Horse and Jockey,

        there must have been at least 80 other Liverpool supporters who were

        also drinking intoxicants.     There was a lot of shouting, swearing and

        singing.     When I looked down into the rear of the pub, at one time I

        saw seme of those supporters trying to walk their friends around in

        an effort to sober them up.     This conduct continued up until about




                                                                                   1412
2.45 pm (1445), when to a man, they disappeared towards the

football ground.

I am pretty sure about the time, as my wife and I were waiting to

go shopping, and we kept checking the clock as it approached the 3

o'clock (1500), kick off time.

Whilst all these supporters were in our vicinity, I had on more than

one occasion, to go outside and tell seme of the supporters to go

elsewhere when they wanted to use our              as a toilet.

There was no responsive aggravation to this, and they turned and

walked away.

When they had left, we set out on our shopping trip and saw that

the grassed land, and pub and that area outside the pub was covered

with bottles, cans, papers and broken glass.    It was appalling to

see, although later the Licensee sent his staff outside to clear up

the mess in the vicinity of the pub.

Just after all these supporters had made their way to the ground, we

left heme and walked towards Hillsborough to do the shopping, this

was about 2.55 pm (1455).    Whilst we were doing our shopping, we

were aware of how quiet it was, because normally there is the noise

from the ground.    Whilst we were waiting for the bus to take us

hone, we saw a group of about 15 lads, outside the Co-op in

Middlewood Road, they were round about the late teens age group.      Only

one was wearing a red and white scarf, so I don't really know where they

were from.     They started fighting amongst themselves, on the pavement

pushing people aside, and then into the road and across onto the car

park at the bottom of Clarence Road/Dykes Hall Road.

I saw a Policeman arrive, in a panda car and presumed someone had sent

for the Police, just before he arrived.     I had seen one of the

fighting youths swinging a plumbers pipe bending spring above his head.


                                                                             1413
        The Policeman was on his own, and approached the crowd and was obviously

        trying to dispurse them.     The youths were very abusive towards the

        Officer, but subsequently he managed to control the situation and

        caused the youths to leave the area.     I had seen the Officer using

        his radio, and at the time we presumed he was asking for back up-we

        know now why none was available.

        I believe that most of the problems involving the youths we saw,

        were to do with alcohol, and possibly a preventative measure in

        future would be to prohibit the sale of alcohol in a specific area

        around the ground.



                                                                        SIGNED

           I am a single man and I live at the above address with ray parents and

           ray 23 year old brother        I am a supporter of Liverpool football

           club and have a season ticket for the Kop at Anfield.    I attend most

           home games, but only the special away matches.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989, (150489) Liverpool were to play

           Nottingham Forest in the Semi-Final of the F.A. Cup competition.      This

           game was to take place at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield.      I

           managed to obtain frcm Anfield, a #6 ticket for the Leppings Lane

           terrace.   This was to be ray first visit to Hillsborough Stadium.

           On match day I was travelling frcm Liverpool to Sheffield with ray

           friends,                                                              We

           travelled in          Ford Sierra and I drove this car to Sheffield,

           I went up to          house after I finished ray work on the Saturday,

           and then we set off to pick up the rest of the lads.    It was about

           11.30 am (1130) or just after that, when we left Liverpool for

           Sheffield.   We only stopped once on the journey but I can't remember

           exactly where this was.

           We were held up as the motorways were very busy.    Going through a



                                                                                        1415
                                                                             2


little town, the traffic was bumper to bumper, in a single lane of

slow moving traffic.

We arrived in Sheffield, but drove close to the ground and had to

drive about one mile away frcm the ground, past the Liverpool fans

coaches and stopped, parking alongside other motor cars that had

carried Liverpool fans to Sheffield.     I only know that this was a main

road at the top of a hill, I do not know the name of the road that I

parked in.     It was about 2.45 pm (1445) by the time I got the car

parked.     We would have arrived earlier in Sheffield, if it had not

been for the traffic congestion on the way.

My four friends and I all had tickets for the Leppings Lane terrace

and we all walked down the hill leading to the football ground

together.

The weather, I can't remember too well, but I was dressed in blue

jeans, a bright coloured yellow and

This shirt had been

yellow and the top part and shoulders is yellow background with

                                      It has a                   and the

word                on the left breast area.     I think I had on my blue

walking boots.

On the walk down to the ground, the streets were not too busy.       There

were a lot of policemen on the streets as you walked towards the

ground.     I remember thinking that there was too marry policemen in the

area for the number of fans.     The general mood of people approaching

the ground was good.

We walked directly to the ground and when I arrived there I could not

beleive the amount of people still waiting to get inside.        I was

anxious in case I would miss the kick-off having to wait in such a

big crowd.
It must have been about 2.55 pn (1455) when our group got to the

leppings Lane entrance.      It was just a mass of people outside this

entrance,    ffounted policemen were trying to organise supporters into

queues, I remember a police Land Rover or jeep with a policeman using

a loud hailer, but I could'nt hear what was being said by this man.

The fans outside the approach to the ground were in a mass, however,

it appeared to me that there was seme semblance of order immediately

outside the turnstiles.

I was being pushed around a lot outside but I managed to stay close to

                I remember       and the others being pushed away frcm me

and we would be shouting back and forth to each other.     The pushing

outside was the worst that I have ever experienced outside a football

ground.     I had no control over my movement.   I just could not believe

the crowd size outside the ground.

I could see people climbing over the wall above the turnstiles to get

into the ground.     Our group was near the edge of the turnstiles, at

the right side entrance of the ground.

I can vaguely remember someone, possibly a policeman, shouting that a

gate at the right side had been opened.

Our group moved to the right and climbed under a set of railings, just

low boxing type ring railings and around to the right of the

turnstiles.     Once I got round I saw a set of gates open.   They did not

appear to me to be fully open.      There was a policeman standing inside

these gates, and I was concerned that he would close these gates

again, before our group had all got inside.      I entered the football

ground through these gates,           *as still close to me and I'm

certain that my other friends were close by as I went in through the

open gates.     I don't remember seeing any stewards.   I do not know who

had opened these gates.
Once inside the ground, I still expected someone to ask me for ray

ticket, but no-one did.     The crowd was densely packed, particularly in

the midst of it where I was with            I think          and the others

were still with us, but it is          that I could see.     The crowd was

like a mass of ants and it moved like a single body, towards a tunnel

that was directly ahead of us.     I could see the pitch as I looked

through this tunnel.

I thought that the tunnel was the only entrance to the terracing.        I

never saw any signs directing fans to anywhere else, other than down

the tunnel.    There was no police or stewards, that I saw as the crowd

moved towards the tunnel.     Everyone was singing together.

The tunnel was packed with people and I was swept along in the crowd.

I knew that the game had started.     I feel that this must have added to

the panic in the crowds outside.

Once at the end of the tunnel and at the edge of the terracing,

      ind I moved to our right into an area I understand now to be pen

number 3.     I think that as soon as I hit the terracing,        and   I

got separated frcm the rest of our group.

The terracing in this area was "chocka" as soon as I hit the crowd I

knew it was far too busy.     After about 30 seconds, I said, or someone

said "SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET HURT HERE”. Icould not move as I

wanted to and had no control of ray own body movements.

At first          and I managed to take up a position in pen number 3

close to the back and I have indicated this location as a number 1 on

a separate grid sheet bearing my name, (Exhibit No.           )

(Case Ref. No.        ).

The pressure was tremendous in the crowd.     People were shouting out

for the game to be stopped.     I think I saw the football once.     I ccmld

not watch the game due to the danger of the situation that I found
                                                                          5


myself in.   My body was turned now, due to crowd pressure, and I found

ray back to the pitch and I was facing the stands above.     People

were still streaming out of the tunnel and onto this part of the

terracing.   This was adding to the pressure in this area.

I remarber a tremendous surge from behind me, I do not know what

caused this but I suspect it was the non-stop pouring of people onto

the terracing from the tunnel.   This surge had taken place as the game

was still being played.

The result of this downwards surge caused my feet to leave the ground

and my body to be bent forward at an angle, as I was now unable to

stand upright.   As I was moved forward, I was aware of people bent

accross the top of crush barriers. Everyone was screaming and

shouting out for help.

The pressure caused me now to be immediately in front of the gate in

pen number 3, and about 10 feet (10') away from the perimeter gate.       I

have again indicated this location on a separate grid sheet, the same

one as before. (Exhibit No.       ) (Case Ref. No.     ) The game was

still going on. I was reaching out with my arm towards the perimeter

fence but could not touch it.    I was shouting out to the policeman on

the track, outside pen 3, but I knew that he could not hear me.       I

knew that even though I was so close to the fence, that due to the

crowd size and pressure, I would never be able to get out of the

terracing over this fence.    It was by now absolute bedlam in the crowd.

I was becoming more and more worried.     It was so tight in the crowd

that I could not move.    I remember thinking to myself, whether or not

I would get out of this crowd pressure.

I saw people all around me, who had the normal colour drained from

their faces, which then turned blue.

I remember a man to my right aged about 23 years and tall, who was
shouting to me to help a girl near me.   Although he was 'nt too far

away he could not get to her in the crowd.    This girl was white,

early 20's, with short hair, she had on a pair of jeans, I can't

remember her top.

I looked at the girl who was immediately in front of me, she was

shouting, "HELP ME, HELP ME, I CAN'T BREATH". I remember someone in

the crowd shouting out, "SHE'S GOING TO DIE."    I could see that this

girl was crying, her face was turning blue.

After a struggle I managed to get my right arm between this girl's

legs and        lanaged to get an arm to her and together we managed to

lift this girl directly upwards into the air, above the crowd.       The

whole body of the girl was lifted clear of the packed crowd and once

clear she fell forward, on top of the crowd and towards the perimeter

fence.   Her ants had been pinned to her sides in the crowd.

Once clear of the crowd, I saw that she was a small girl, about 5' 2"

and of medium build.   This girl was passed forward over the heads of

the fans towards the pitch. We were so close to the gate, I feel sure

that this girl did get out of the terrace and onto the pitch.    The

game had by now stopped.

I next remember a small amount of space beside me in the terracing and

a man lying down in front of me.

I would describe this man as a white man, aged about 30 years, a

stockily built man but not fat, he had dark curly hair.    This man wore

a khaki padded anorak type coat, with no hood.    I was pulling at the

man's coat, twice I managed to pull this man almost to his feet but

each time he fell back down again.   I was saying to him "COME ON

YOU'VE GOT TO GET UP' and he was saying "I CAN'T MY LEGS ARE TRAPPED"

I could see bodies, I don't know how many, underneath this man.       I

remember a gap where I was standing beside this man and I was
thinking, we are the only two people on this terracing.    It was a

strange feeling.    I tried but I could not get this man free of the

tangle of bodies.    I was afraid that I may end up on the floor in

the crowd.

At this time the perimeter gates were open and people were getting out

of the terracing by climbing over the perimeter fence.

I remember telling        that we would never get out of the terracing

onto the pitch and that we should try to make our way back towards the

tunnel.   The whole scene was one of absolute chaos.         and I

managed to get towards a wall at the back of the terracing, I had no

idea where the tunnel was due to the crowd density.

I remember policemen at the back of the terracing, who must have cone

down the tunnel.

At the back wall        boosted me off the ground towards the crowd in

the West stand, where supporters in that stand were leaning over to

pull people out of the Leppings Lane terracing.    I was then bodily

pulled into the West Stand and I then helped other fans drag           up

into the stand.         and I were then asked to move to the back, as

the people at the front carried on lifting people from the terrace

into the West Stand.

From my position in the West Stand I could see the pitch, I could see

people trying to revive people lying on the pitch.     I began then to

realise the full extent of the tragedy.

After about 10 minutes,         and I left the West Stand and went down

the stairs leading to a large compound, among which was the tunnel

entrance.    I saw people in this area being given drinks of water in

this area, I saw fire engines racing into this area.     There were

nurses present in this area helping people.    I saw a line of uniformed

Police blocking the entrance to the tunnel.    There was a Police
Superintendent or a leader in this area and a lot of people approached

this man and were arguing with him.

       nd I stayed in this area for about 20 minutes.         I have no idea

by now of time but it was around 4 pn, (1600) I think.

I approached the police blocking the tunnel and asked if I could get

back onto the terracing to find ray friends, at first they would not

let me, but eventually a policewoman walked me down the tunnel onto

the terracing, onto pen 3.      The terracing was not busy.     I never saw

any bodies on the terracing.      I never saw the broken barrier on the

terracing.   I could'nt see our mates.     The policewoman escorted me

back along the tunnel, after a little while, about 4.30 pn (1630)

       and I left the ground.

We went to use the telephone in an undertakers, on the way up the hill

towards the car.    I phoned ray parents from there.   I saw large queues

at all the 'phone boxes.

When         ind I got back to           car, our group was all together

having met up on the walk back to the car.

I remember that as I had driven             car, that I had the car key in

ray jeans trouser pocket and I saw that when I took this key out that

it had been bent.

I drove the car to a pub, about 10 minutes drive, or less, from the

ground.   I knew from the car radio and by talking to people, the

horror of what had happened.

I got home to Liverpool about 8 pn to 8.30 pn. (0800)-(0830)

I never lost any property that day.

I had bruising on ray chest and ribs, as well as ray ants.       For days

afterwards I was finding bruises on ray body.




                                                                               1 422

        I never lost any time from work.

       A friend told me that he saw me being hauled out of the terrace into

        the West Stand, on the television.   The lad recognised me by the

           I am a single man and I live at the above address with my parents

                                     I am employed as a           at



           I have been b o m and bred in Liverpool and I have supported Liverpool

           Football Club all my life.     I have never had a season ticket and I

           attend the home games about twice a month and I always stand in the

           Kop end.

           My father        is also a supporter of Liverpool and he is a member of

                                                   He and his friends organised a

           small party of 12 people to go to the match at Sheffield on 15th April

           1989 (150489).   They hired a mini bus from a local firm to travel to

           Sheffield and they got their tickets from various sources.       I got my

           ticket from a friend down the club.     I don't know his name.    The

           ticket is number LL2 17 9 and is for entrance B in the Leppings Lane

           standing area.   I paid #6 for it.    I got it on the morning of

           Saturday 15th April (150489).

           The persons in our party were:-

           1.   Myself.



                                                                                       1424

and 7 others I don't know who they are.       All had tickets.   Myself,

                          and Gordon all had tickets for Leppings Lane

standing area.     The others had tickets for seats at different

locations.

We all met at 9.00 am (0900) at the club and we all got on the

mini bus.            irove there and back. I didn't pay much attention to

the route we took but we did go along Snake pass, where we were held

up in a traffic jam for a while at about 11.30 am (1130).        We

arrived at the Silver Fox pub in Sheffield at about 12.45 pm (1245)

and stayed there until 2.00 pm (1400).       Along the route there were

numerous other Liverpool supporters which partly caused our delay.          We

did have a few cans of beer on the bus, about 2 each and we all had

about 3 pints in the pub, except              who doesn't drink. There were

other Liverpool supporters in the pub.       They were drinking but no one

was drunk or disorderly.        The police came in the pub on 2 occasions

whilst we were there and they put a few young kids out who they

thought were under age. We all left the pub at about 2.00 pm (1400)

and a few minutes after we left we were stopped by the police who

checked us for alcohol.     They detained us for about 15 to 20 minutes
                                                                          3


and then allowed us to go on.

We arrived near the ground at about 2.40 pm (1440) and parked up

in a street that was only a couple of minutes walk away.    When we

got out of the bus there were loads of Liverpool supporters milling

about.    I did not see any of them drinking and I did not see any

disorderly conduct from anyone.

We all walked into Leppings Lane and arrived at the turnstiles just

after 2.45 pm (1445).   The scene when we got there was thousands

of people waiting in the entrance area to the turnstiles.    They were

all packed in this area and we all joined the back of the crowd.

The only policemen I saw there were three on horses. They were by the

railing fence.   Two were inside the fence and one was outside.

A couple of minutes after we got in this crowd it built up.    Suddenly

and it got very uncomfortable.     I couldn't move but the crowd was

moving around and I just had to go with them.    The crowd remained like

that until just after 3 pm (1500).    Not many people seemed to be

getting through the turnstiles.    The mounted police were opening and

closing the outer gates at this stage and letting so many people in at

a time.   This didn't ease the situation, there seemed to be the same

number of people in this area all the time.     One of the policemen rode

his horse through the crowd from the turnstiles towards Leppings Lane,

this crushed people against the sides and made the situation worse.

Just after 3 pm (1500) someone opened a gate to the right of the

turnstiles and we all poured in.

I didn't see who opened the gates.

Inside the complete crowd and I was pushed along with them. I got

separated from the others.    The only other one in our party was

              He stayed with me all along the tunnel and into pen 3

which is on the right side of the tunnel at the end.     All the way down
the tunnel the crowd surged in at faster than walking speed but not

running.

As we went down the tunnel I could see that the match had started.         I

was pushed onto the terrace at the top of pen three and down a few

steps. No one had any control over where they went.     I just couldn't

move.         ras still with me in pen 3.   I couldn't see what was

happening further down the terrace but I saw seme people run onto the

pitch and after a few minutes that eased the crush.     I saw a gap

appear along the fence between pens 3 and 4 and got onto the

pitch where I saw people were injured and dead.    I stayed on the pitch

and helped put a woman onto a makeshift stretcher.    She was apparently

dead.   I helped to carry her over towards the Kop end and she was

taken out between the Kop and the North stand.

I then went back to the West terrace to look for the others.     I found

                 on the pitch near the goal.   We then went back onto

the terrace and got pulled up into the West stand seating area.       At

that time the crush had gone, there were still a lot of people in the

terrace, but they were all helping each other.

I later left the ground at about 3.40 pm (1540).     I ntet all the

rest of our party at the mini bus except Gordon HORN.     Someone went to

look for him but couldn't find him so we went round to the hospitals

and police stations and later that Gordon had been killed and

that he was in the gymnasium at the ground.

We arrived home in the early hours of the next day.

DATED: 300489                                                               (SIGNED)



           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I went to the Football match at

           Hillsborough. I am a Liverpool Supporter.      I went with the Liverpool

           Supporters Club, London Branch.    My friend            *ho lives in

                    I don't know the address but the Phone No is                  got

           me a ticket because he is a Season Ticket holder.       It was a #6 ticket

           and for the Leppings Lane end.     I travelled with          on the

           Train.     It left London St pancreas at 0900 (0900) and it got to

           Sheffield at 12.15 (1215).

           Going from the Station to the Ground I saw people drinking at and

           outside pubs.    When we got off the train we were put on Buses and

           taken to the ground.     When we got to the ground we went off to a Pub

           for a drink.     I eventually got to the ground at 14.40 hrs (1440) on

           the way I did not see any fighting or drunkenness.

           At the ground at the turnstiles it was chaotic, there were about 2 - 3

           Thousand people trying to get in.     I did not see any Police or

           Stewards directing people outside the ground.      It was very difficult

           to get in the ground, I saw seme people getting over the wall by the

           end of the turnstiles (Nos. 1-16).       So ray friend and I climbed over



                                                                                        1429
                                                                              2


the wall.     There were a couple of Police Officers inside and they told

us we were to jump down to off the turnstile roof.     I did not see any

gates open.    We then went towards the tunnel there were no signs

directing where to go so we went down the tunnel.     The tunnel was full

of people.     Once in the tunnel youhad to go forward you could not stop

or go back.     I eventually gotthrough the tunnel and into Pen 3, it

took about 7 or 8 minutes to getthrough the tunnel.     Pen 3 was full

when I got into it.     There were noPolice or Match Stewards about.     I

was by the fence between Pens 3 and 4 about 2 or 3 yards from the back

and about 2 yards from the fence.I gotseparated from my friend in the

tunnel and I did not see him again until Saturday night when I spoke

to him on the phone.

I was in Pen 3 just as the game was about to start.     I was crushed to

start with and as more people came in I was crushed more and more.        I

knew I had to get out of there and as I was pushed slowly forward I

managed to move to the side until I was by the fence between Pens 3

and 4.     I saw seme people climb over from Pen 3 into 4.   I did this

and managed to get to the back of Pen 4, against the back wall, I was

in Pen 4, and at about 3 minutes past 3 (1503) Liverpool hit the bar

and the crowd surged forward and I saw about 30 to 40 people fall

down.    The crowd was still pressing forward and the gap created by

these people falling down was taken up by other people being pushed

forward.     I did not see anyone get up again.   The people that fell

seemed to be in the middle of Pen 4. I managed to make my way along

the back wall towards Pen 5 and the gate between Pens 4 and 5 was open.

There were people going out of this gate and I went as well and down

Pen 5 to the pitch.     There were people climbing over the fence from

Pens 4 into 5, while I was by the back wall in Pen 4 I had passed or

helped to pass up about 8 or 9 people up to the Stand above, I went
down Pen 5 the gate onto the pitch was open and I got onto the pitch

just at that time the game was called off.

I started with others to get the advertising signs board down and put

injured fans on them and took them across the pitch to the other end.

I made about 8 or 9 journeys with fans most of them were badly injured.

One of the people I helped to take over to the other end when we got

there he was collapsed.   Someone started to give him heart massage and

I gave him mouth to mouth for a few minutes then we realised that he

was dead.   He was a man about 25 years of age.   After I had done this

I stopped at the Spion Kop end of the ground and I was talking to

other fans for a while.

At about 4 o'clock (1600) I heard an announcement on the loudspeaker

saying the game was abandoned.   I left the ground at about 4.45

(1645) I feel that had the Police opened the gates of Pens 3 St 4 much

earlier a lot of people would have been saved.    I also think that more

Police were needed especially at specific points such as the entrance

to the tunnel.

I attended the same match last year (000088) and I was stopped by the

Police about 50 yards from the turnstiles.   At this point our tickets

were checked before we could go to the turnstiles.    This was not done

at this match and obviously if it had been done it would have helped

to reduce the crush.

DATED: 030589                                                            (SIGNED)



           I am a single man living at the above address with three other

           friends in a flat.    I am a self employed                       I have

           lived in the London area for the past 10 years having come down from



           As I'm a northerner ray favourite football team is Sunderland. On

           Saturday morning the 15/4/89 (15049189), ray flat mates woke me up to

           see if I wanted to go Sheffield as they are all Liverpool fans and

           had tickets for the game at Hillsborough.    I didn't have a ticket but

           decided to go up on spec.

           We left London sometime between 10 (1000) and 10.30 (1030) am after

           hiring a car to go to Sheffield.    We went up the Ml stopping once to

           get a cup of tea.    The five of us, thats myself,

           another                 who we picked up on the way,

           and                  got to Sheffield at about 1230-lpm (1230-1300) as

           traffic was flowing fairly freely.    We parked in an official car park

           near to the Nottingham end of the ground.    After leaving the car we

           went to the Shakespeare Pub, we'd seen it on the way to the car park

           and as it looked a decent pub we decided to go there for a pint and a



                                                                                     1 433
bit to eat.     Whilst we were in the pub a bloke who knew one of us

came across and asked if we knew anyone who wanted to buy a ticket.

As I'd gone up on spec I bought it off him for     6.    It was a standing

ticket for the Leppings Lane end of the ground where most of my

friends were.

We left the pub at about 2pm (1400) to walk to the ground.       We passed

lots of pubs on the way to the ground but there was no trouble

anywhere only a few people standing outside the pubs having a drink.

At no time did we get any directions from the Police as where to go.

We got to the ground sometime between 2.45 and 2.50pm (1445 and 1450)

but we had to walk right around the ground to the other end as we had

approached it from the Nottingham end and across the river bridge to

Leppings Lane.     People were all around the ground but we I got to the

Leppings Lane end there were no queues for the turnstiles just a mass

of people.    There were no Police giving any directions except for

those mounted Officers who couldn't do anything because of the

amount of people there.      There was one other Police Officer standing

on a wall, all he was doing was surveying the crowd.        I didn't see

any stewards there at all.     As I was making my way to the turnstiles

I saw a single Policeman by a big blue gate.     I saw him open the gate

and then everybody started going through it including myself. I saw

the tunnel and went into it with                        We stopped in the

tunnel and were going to go back to look for our friends and we

nearly did so because it was fairlyquiet at this time. Prior to the

gate being opened I had seen people         climbing       over a wall to getinto

the ground but I don't think they were trying to get in without

tickets.     I think it was mainly trying to get away from the crush

outside the ground.      There were no Stewards about so people weren'

t even handing tickets.     I've still got my ticket at home I think.
There were no signs telling people where to go so everybody just

headed for the tunnel where nobody in authority was.     There was no

trouble, nobody was fighting, nobody had cans with them, it was all

good natured.   When I got in the terraces with          <e were

somewhere near to the tunnel in Pen 4.     As soon as we got there I saw

how packed it was.    I told        we'd best go somewhere else as it

was too packed and dangerous and I could feel people pushing from

behind me.   This was just before the kick-off.    At this time we had

been joined by the two lads from Liverpool. I knew                   and a

lad called        Before we had time to get out of the tunnel there

was a crush behind us and we were being pushed further and further

into the terraces towards the front.     Then all of a sudden there was

a surge and I ended closer to a crash barrier.     My arms were spread

and I kept trying to put them close to my chest so I could breathe

properly.    People were getting concerned as I couldn't breathe

properly but I was that tightly packed in I couldn't even move.       I

was like that for a good 10-15 minutes and when the crowd eased off I

just fell to the floor.     The next thing was I was picked up and

manhandled over the fence and onto the pitch.     When I had got my

breath back I went looking for the others. I found           who somehow

was also on the pitch.      Peoplewere on the pitch moaning, injured,

others had coats over their faces.      When I'd recovered enought I went

with         to one of the seated areas to get a hoarding for a

stretcher.    We couldn't get one so we went up towards the Nottingham

end where a Steward gave us a hoarding.      We went back to the

Liverpool end and put a     man onit.   He was about 14 years old and was

unconscious.          and   I tookhimto where the other injured were.

       ras smacking him around the face.     He started breathing then

someone who said he was a doctor took over so we left to help someone
       else.   There was no one else to help by this time.   A loud speaker

       announcement later on told people to stay where they were to let the

       injured get out first so we stayed about another half hour then

       left.

       I didn't know the game had been stopped when it was but I can

       remember that nobody appeared to be in charge of what was going on.

       There was no medical or emergency equipment available until quite

       sometime later.   The Police appeared to be used more in a crowd

       control manner as about 100 of them were standing on the halfway line

       as if expecting a pitch invasion.    The ones by the Leppings Lane end

       just appeared stunned.   I can't recall anyone giving first aid.

       In hindsight I think that if the inner gate had not been opened a

       potential similar incident might have happened outside the ground.

       Who ordered the gate open open was in a no win situation and was

        justified in opening the gate but he could have had better information

       as to what the two pens were like and the fans directed to the outer

       pens at the end of the terraces.

                       I am a single man and I live at the above address and have

           done so for the past four years.    I have been working for British

           Telecom for the past nine years and because I always been interested

           in First Aid.    When the Firm asked for volunteers for a weeks

           intensive course run by St John's Ambulance and I passed the course

           on the 4th March last year and since then I have had to use my

           knowledge when I have been at work.

                       I have been a Liverpool Football Fan as long as I can

           remember and I have been going to the matches since I was fifteen

           years old, week in and week out.    I follow them everywhere if I

           can.    Two weeks before the Liverpool/Nottingham game at

           Hillsborough I had the chance to buy a ground ticket from a cleaner

           at my work because he couldn't go for some reason or other anyway I

           bought the ticket for the face value which was six quid the bloke's

           name I bought it off was a bloke by the name of

                       Anyway I asked around for someone to go to the match with

           but I couldn't find anybody so I was going to sell the ticket but on

           the Wednesday before the match I found out that my mate from work,




                                                                                    1437

            who lives in Little Sutton I dont know exactly where

but I can get his address if I need to and his brother

          who is away in the                       I think were going

I arranged to travel with                        in Manchester.

           On the day of the match, Saturday, 15 April 1989 (

150489) I met      at Lime Street Railway Station at eight fifteen

(0815) in the morning and we got the normal eight thirty (0830) train

out of Lime Street towards Manchester to meet           it wasnt a

football special and there was only me and        travelling together.

We got to Manchester Railway Station (Oxford Road) and met              at

that Station when he finally arrived at about eleven o'clock (1100) in

the morning and we all got the normal scheduled train which left the

station between half twelve (1230) and one (1300) I cant remember

exactly what time it was but it got into Sheffield Railway Station at

about two pm (1400) on the same day.     We walked from the Station part

of the way and then got a taxi the rest of the way, it was a black

taxi that we flagged down.     The fare was only about one pound fifty

between the three of us.     Although most of the pubs between the

Railway Station and the ground were shut I did see a few

supporters drinking from cans of beer as they were walking, they

were supporters of both clubs but they weren't rowdy or anything

they were just walking along like.

            When I got off the train I only saw a few coppers in

the City Centre and they looked like just being there so normal,

not because of the match but we didn't see any others on the way

there and no Police were giving us directions.     The first

Coppers I saw were two on horses when I got to the ground at

The Lepping Lane End.

            Because I had a ticket for Entrance 'B' Lepping Lane
BRADLEY                MICHAEL   JOSEPH


and the other two had Stand Tickets for West Stand Lepping Lane

we sort of split up at a small bridge near to the ground and we

arranged to meet there after the match had finished although

there were a lot of people milling around I didnt see anyone

obviously drunk and I didnt see any fighting.

          I must have got to the ground at half two (1430) in the

afternoon and as I walked from the bridge I could see the

Lepping Lane end of the ground and although I could see the

turnstiles there were no queues there it just seemed like there

was a solid mass of people outside the ground.    Although there

were loads of people all around me I could still walk towards the

turnstile area without much difficulty.    As I said before I only

saw two Coppers on horses at this time and I didnt see any

stewards and there were no persons telling us where to go or what

to do or anything.

          About this time the people behind me started to push

and the crowd started to move forward then it all seemed to turn

to my right away from the turnstiles, I didnt know where I was

going and I couldnt stop myself from being pushed so I just went

along with the crowd, I wasnt being crushed or anything like

that because at this time it was just a steady push.    Then I saw

I was actually inside the ground, not outside it and I still had

both parts of my ticket with me nobody had asked for it or taken

if off me.     I didnt see an open gate I didnt see one being

opened and I didnt see anybody trying to get into the ground

illegally like climbing walls and that, all I know is that I

didnt go through a turnstile I didnt get the chance to.

             Once I knew I was in the ground, inside the turnstiles

I saw the crowd in front of me and to the side of me heading
BRADLEY               MICHAEL   JOSEPH                              4


towards an opening and I could see the goal nets of the pitch

through the opening and the crowd surge just carried me on

toward the tunnel and at one point it actually felt like I was

lifted off the ground but I wasnt sure but at this time it wasnt

bothering me that much because this sort of thing has happened

at a few of these grounds but always coining out because people

wanted to get home.   Getting back to the tunnel I didnt see any

coppers or stewards in the tunnel but I didnt see any fighting

or people drinking while I was in there because it was just a

solid mass of people and nobody had room to do anything else

except walk.   At the time I was in the tunnel I was in the

middle of the crowd but when I got out onto the stand as you

look at the ground frcm the tunnel I was on the left of the

tunnel.

          Once out on the terracing I didnt think it was to bad

I got pushed right down towards the front of the terracing and I

thought "This aint bad I can see the pitch from here" but then I

thought something was wrong because the people at the back

were still pushing forward and I had nowhere to go I was being

pushed onto a white guy in front of me but I wasnt anywhere near

a barrier but I started to get a pain across my chest and it got

more difficult to breath because I was breathing out I couldnt

then breath in because of the crush I heard a girl who was two

or three people to my right screaming but I cant remember much

about her but I do remember that there were about eight to ten

lines of people between me and the front fence by the pitch.

Everybody was shouting for the people behind to get back and

they were shouting back "We cant". Then I saw a loose line of

uniform Police about a yard (1yd) away from the fence but not actually
BRADLEY                MICHAEL   JOSEPH                             5


standing on the pitch one person in the crowd shouted for them

to open the gates then we all shouted but the coppers just

stood there they didnt move forward or back or look at us they

just stood there.    My right shoulder began to hurt because it

was being pushed back because the people behind were still

pushing and the people in front couldnt go anywhere and

because of that I was starting to be "doubled up".

             Nothing seemed to happen for a long time but then

the people behind me started to move back and a sort of space

appeared and I was being pushed back by the people in front

of me trying to get back from the crush and I nearly fell

over then.     I balanced myself up and looked down in front of

me and I could see that it looked like there was nobody in

front of me except what looked like a wall of dead bodies

just lying there at first it looked like a hundred but I

could see that they were eight high for about a length of

eight foot (8').     I reckoned about Forty were there. I went to

these people with another lad who was screaming someone's

name I cant remember the name but we pulled a white lad off

the top of the bodies, he was still alive so we pulled him

back onto the cleared terraces and he was breathing so I

left him with the lad that had helped me pull him out and I

went back to the bodies, I could see that seme were

obviously dead because they had yellowy white skin and

they had blue lips and because of my First Aid Training,

these are signs that I could expect in a dead person.

             In the pile of bodies I saw an arm hanging out

and the hand was shaking so me and another lad pulled on

this arm and the lad's head came out from the pile of



                                                                        1441
BRADLEY               MICHAEL   JOSEPH


bodies and we managed to get hold of his chest and prised him

out I think we pulled him out by his right arm and we pulled

so hard that I felt it give a little so I think I damaged

his arm.   This lad was a white lad he was about my age brown

hair which was straight and short I think he was wearing a

pullover purple I think and a light coloured shirt.   We laid

him on the terracing and he didnt appear to be breathing but

I checked for a pulse in his neck and when I found that

there was still one there I started to give him mouth to

mouth but he didnt respond so I slapped his face and still

no response then I tried again still no response and I was

just going to start heart massage when a white bloke wearing

a black beret and a black coat who I thought was in St Johns

came over to me I shouted something like he's not breathing"

so he bent down over this lads top half, picked him up by

the shoulder and another two fans on the terracing picked

him up by the legs and other shoulder and carried him off

towards the pitch.    I didnt see any of those people again.

           I tried to pull other people off the pile but I

couldn't on my own because there was no-one there to give

us a hand so I went onto the pitch through an open gate.

A uniform Policeman tried to stop me but I shouted "I'm a

First Aider" and he let me onto the pitch.

           I saw a St John's man giving a white bloke lying

on the pitch mouth to mouth I went over to him and I said

something like You go and treat someone else I'll carry on

with him" so the St Johns man went of and I carried on with

the mouth to mouth.    There were two other fans kneeling by

his legs and they were pushing his chest between the times
BRADLEY                MICHAEL   JOSEPH                       7


I was breathing into him and at one point, they must have

thought that I had stopped altogether, because one of them

grabbed hold of the back of my shirt and shouted "Carry

on, carry on dont stop so I just carried on because his

eyes were closed    and he was just lying there then when I

was breathing into him he just vomited and it caught my

face and the sleeve of my jacket.     I wiped myself and

carried on and then he was sick again so I rolled him over

onto his front to save him choking on his vomit then seme

other people came with something that looked liked a

stretcher and took him to the other side of the goal

because we were on the left hand side of the goal looking

away from Leppings Lane end.

            It was then I saw a Copper with his helmet in

his hand standing to my left I shouted something like "

Give us a hand" and he shouted back "What can I do I'm

only the same" and he turned away by this time I was

distressed and crying and I think he was feeling the

same.     Then seme one else grabbed my arm and said "Help

him" and I turned round to my rear and I saw another lad

stretched out I went to him checked for a pulse and

couldnt find one so I gave him mouth to mouth and nothing

happened - checked for a pulse again still nothing so I

carried on with mouth to mouth and still nothing then I

saw two Coppers standing close by and I shouted at them

twice to get seme oxygen but they said there wasn't any &

I carried on with heart massge until two uniformed lads

came over with yellow oilskin leggings on, put an oxygen

mask on him and took him away.


                                                                  1443
BRADLEY               MICHAEL    JOSEPH


            The next thing I saw was a lad being pulled along

behind the goal by another lad so I went and gave him a

hand and the lad being dragged was shouting "roe legs roe

legs I cant walk"   We took him through the solid line of

Police across the middle of the pitch by the half way line

and through a tunnel off the pitch where there was a lot of

uniform people shouting "This way" and we ended up in a big

sports hall type thing which was split into two halves,

one where the dead bodies were beause they had jumpers

over their faces and things and the other half was for the

injured.

            We put the lad with the damaged legs where the

other injured were and the lad who I helped to carry him

in with said " I'm going to look for my brother"     and I

said "Do you know this lad" and he said "No, I've never

seen him before"    as he left someone came round in plain

clothes and said "I'm a doctor" and asked him where it hurt

and he said his stomach and legs the doctor felt around and

said "There's nothing broken" and told me to stay with him

and left.    The Coppers came round and took his name and

address then left a short time later we tried to get him to

walk about which he did then I sat him down for a bit and

he got up again said I think I'm all alright now" and we

both walked out onto the pitch again and by this time the

whole place was virtually empty and I saw that where it had

happened the fence had a hole in it where someone had cut

it down and I could see that some barriers were bent down

actually on the terracing.      Me and this kid then walked

out the ground and parted company after I checked he was

           matches.    Also a friend qualifies for 2 tickets via the Development

           Association and my other friends are also season ticket holders who

           qualify.

           On this day there were eleven of us with tickets for various sections

           of the ground, my own ticket being a       #14.00 ticket for the North

           Stand.     We were to travel to the ground in three cars.

           At about 10-30am (1030) on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I and

           the other ten met at              louse.   She is one of the other ten

           people. I was in one car with a man named            who lives in London

           but quite regularly ccroes to Liverpool for weekends,

           was the third one in this car.

           We started off from              house at about 1045 am to travel to

           Hillsborough Football Ground in Sheffield.

           We stopped at a public house on a road heading towards Huddersfield

           and away from Sheffield.     It is off the main road.    We stopped there

           for a meal and a drink and also to meet sane other friends there,

four in total.

We left there at about 2.05pm (1405) to go to the ground.    It takes us

about 15 minutes to get there.    I know this because I have been to

Hillsborough many times before and you get to know the best times to

arrive.

We arrived there and parked the car on a garage fore-court at about

2.30 to 2.40pm (1430 to 1440) after having a little difficulty in

finding a place to park.

We walked to the ground and arrived there at about 7 minutes to three-

o-clock (1453).    On the way there were a lot of other people walking

but there was no fighting or drunkenness that I could see.    There were

no policemen around at this time.

At the ground we knew which end to go to but we weren't quite sure

which entrance to make for.    There was a line of about three policemen

on horses, side on to us.     I tried to ask them where to go but they

were busy looking towards a crowd of supporters on the other side of

them.   One did point towards a gate but thats all.

We walked towards the direction in which he had pointed and came upon

a gate, a sliding concertina type and about 12 feet (12') wide.     This

gate was open and no-one around except other fans.     There were no

stewards at all.

At this stage, because we had tickets for different sections of the

ground we seperated and I eventually ended up going through the gate

on my own.

I still had my full ticket intact.     I have retained this at home.

Once through the gate you have to follow it through to the North Stand.

I went towards an entrance into the stand which was nominated on

my ticket and this was only about 3 feet (3') wide and about 3 or 4

steps up into the stand.
WESTERGREN            STEPHEN MARK                                        3


There were two police officers at the top of these steps together

with a couple of stewards.   I could see that the policeman was

standing on the steps with his back to the wall trying to stop us

coming up.   At this stage there were a lot of fans trying to get into

the stands but I could also see that it was chockabloc up there too.

There was a policewoman standing at the top with her arms spread

across the entrance stopping them and me from going any further.

I was in fact able to see that the game had just kicked off.

The policewoman was certainly having difficulties.   There were fans

ducking under her arms to get in.    In the end she just gave up because

of the pushing she was getting and stepped aside.

The fans then piled into the stand and I made my way to my seat.

Within a minute or two of sitting down I could see people spilling

out onto the track at the Lepping Lane end standing area.   There were

a lot of them climbing over the fencing.

At first the police began to push them back.   Thats the way I saw it,

but when people saw how serious it was I could see then that the same

policemen were then helping them over and getting them onto the pitch

side.

At first whatever was going on didn't seem too serious to me.     I

could see that it was very full in the middle there but it must have

been 15 minutes before I realised the seriousness of it.    By this time

the game had been stopped and most of the activity on the pitch was

fans running and helping other fans and carrying them away on

advertising boards.

Looking back on it, because of the amount of fans still outside the

ground I wonder why they didn't delay the kick off time.    I feel this

would have relieved the anxiety of the fans waiting for entry to the

ground and thereby relieving the problem inside the ground.

        Just one thing going back to the journey to the ground there was one

        stage where there was a set of traffic lights at sane road works.

       This held us up and in fact we remarked that anyone caning after us

       would probably have difficulty getting to the ground on time.

        I don't know why but it seemed to me that the whole affair was

       handled differently from the other times I have been to Hillsborough.

           I reside at the above address with my two sons

                s aged 10 and                 8 yrs of age.   I have a Dad and lads

           Season ticket for Anfield and have been a Liverpool Supporter for 31

           years.

           My late neighbour David HAWLEY was also a regular Liverpool Supporter

           and had known David for seven or eight years.

           The last time I saw David was early Saturday morning of the match and

           we had a very short conversation during which he told me that he had

           just got tickets for the match at Hillsborough.

           I borrowed a car from a mate and I left for the match about 10.30 am

           - 11.00 (1030-1100) just myself and the two lads.       There was a lot

           of traffic and we were held up quite a lot, I think it was about 2.30

           pm (1430) when we got to Sheffield. Because we were late due to the

           traffic problem we went straight to the ground. There was hundreds of

           people milling around outside the ground but there was no problems just

           a normal football crowd.    We queued up and went in through gate B

           Leppings Lane End.    After going through the turnstile I took the boys

           towards a tunnel straight ahead which leads to the standing area




                                                                                      1 450

behind the goal.   On going down the tunnel I could see the pitch,

there were people in the tunnel there was a bit of pushing but no

problems just a normal football crowd.

As I came out of the tunnel into the standing area I was concerned to

get a good view for my lads and I went to the right hand side of the

goal and worked my way down to the front of the standing area.    We

were stood against the perimeter fence immediately behind the goal.

At this time it was busy but normal no sign of anything wrong, it was

about quarter to three (1415).

The teams came out the game started it was busy but still nothing

appeared to be going wrong I remember Beasley hitting the crossbar and

then Liverpool getting a comer, it was then that I started to get a

bit concerned as I was being pushed from the rear and I felt

uncomfortable.

Because of this I thought the boys were getting uncomfortable and I

was getting concerned for their safety         did not want to move so

I dragged him out the way by his shirt tearing it.    We worked our way

back up the terraces and to our left away from the goal, it was not so

bad there but the lads couldn't see.     It was getting crowded and the

kids were getting pushed about so I decided to leave the match and go

home.   We all walked up the centre tunnel the same one we had walked

down,and there was still a lot of people coming down the tunnel

towards the standing area.   As we walked up the tunnel the game was

still going on, we were getting pushed and shoved but we could walk

up the tunnel without to much trouble. On leaving the tunnel there

was a lot of people still coming through the turnstiles but there was

no panic that I saw.    I went out through the large exit gates which

were open and there was people flooding through this gate and I did

not see anyone checking tickets from the people coming in.

       We went back to our car and started to drive home and when I turned

       on the radio I heard of the trouble at the ground.

        I did not see ray neighbour David at the match but later that evening

        I went around to see David to ask about the match but his wife said

       he had not arrived home.It was about     2.30 am (0230) the same morning

        I was in bed when I was woke up by               next door, on

       hearing this I sensed what had happened. I got dressed and went around

       to see if I could help.

       My personal opinion is that there may be someone to blame but I didn't

        see anyone do anything wrong.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I attended the F.A Cup Semi final

           between Liverpool and Motts Forest at Hillsborough football ground

           Sheffield.    I went by car with ray friends

           cine

           We set out about half past eleven (1130) in the morning.     We travelled

           to Sheffield on the motorway we were delayed in traffic and arrived

           in Sheffield about half past two (1430) and parked our car up in a

           sice street. We walked to the ground which took us about 10 to 15

           minutes.     I had a ticket for the Leppings Lane Stand, the Liverpool

           area. When were arrived at the outside of the ground we found the

           large gates closed.     The was a large crowd around these gates.    This

           was about quarter to three (1445).     I could see only one police

           officer by this gate.

           A short time later one of the gates was opened by a police officer.

           The crowd surged and pushed through this gate towards the

           turnstiles.     I pushed along with them.   There was that many people

           around there were no queues just a mass of bodies.

           We were moving towards the turnstiles with the mass of the crowd.        We




                                                                                         1453
                                                                          2

were moving over to the right to our entrance which was entrance 'B'

when a policeman told us to get under a tar and that a gate was open

at the side. As many of the crowd that could get under the bar did

and moved towards the open gate.    I got under the bar with my friends

and there was a rush by the crowd towards the open gate.    There was a

large number of people in front and behind us.    I was carried along

with the crowd.    No one was at the gate checking the tickets I still

have my full ticket and stub.    We were just being waved through the

gate. When we were through the gate into the ground all I could see

was a tunnel in the middle of the stand.    The whole of the crowd

seemed to make for this tunnel people were running towards this tunnel

because it was near kick off time so it was near 3 o clock (1500).

I cot to about half way along the tunnel when the was a block of

people and people still kept coming in behind us filling up the

tunnel.     The crowd got tighter and tighter as the people pushed from

the back.     I was in the tunnel for a short time and then came out

onto the terraces.     I was carried along with the crowd and had no

control over where I was going.    When I was out of the tunnel I was

carried out by the crowd to my right behind the goal.

I ended up about half way down the terrace I couldn't move anywhere.

My arms were down to my sides and I couldnt get them up because of

the crush.

I could hear people shouting out and screaming at the front of the

terrace.     They were shouting out that they couldnt breathe no one

could do anything because of the crush.     People were still coming in

from the back.     I was facing the pitch at this time and the game was

just about to kick off.

Just after the kick off I saw that a man had got over the perimeter

fence onto the pitch and was waving at the crowd to go back, but
                                                                           3


there was no where to go.   This man had red hair.   Then it seemed

that everyone was trying to get over the fence because of the crush.

The police were trying to push the crowd back.   The crush was getting

worse because people were still coming in from the back of the terrace.

At this point I started to panic I was pushed up against a bar and it

began to hurt.   My friends were still with me I could see that people

in the seating area above the terrace were pulling people out of the

crush.   I told my friends that we had got to get to the back of the

terrace to be pulled out.

Me and my friends pushed our way to the back of the terrace.     It must

have took us about 5 or 10 minutes.

When I got to the back there were scroe men lifting people half way up

and people in the seats above were pulling the people up.    Seme one

lifted me up and other people pulled me up into the seats.     All my

friends were pulled up as well and we were still together.     When we

were in the seats we climbed over the seats to the back of the stand

and then watch what was going on down on the terrace and on the pitch.

At first I didnt see many police but I then saw a line of them

across the half way line.   Seme police officers were helping the

injured but it seemed like mostly supporters were doing this.

The crush of people seemed to last about 20/25 minutes.     I think I

was pulled out of the crowd about twenty past three (1520).

           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I went to the Hillsborough

           Football ground for the match between Liverpool and Nottingham

           Forest.    I am a Liverpool supporter and travelled to the ground

           in my own car.    I am a    season ticket holder and obtained my

           ticket from Anfield.       I paid #6 for a standing area in Lappings

           Lane.     I travelled with my son         who is 16 years old,



           who can be contacted at the same address.

           I travelled directly to the game, not stopping for any

           purpose.    As we left the end of the M602 at Manchester to join

           the A57 we were caught in heavy traffic due to road works.         We

           were caught in this jam for approximately twenty minutes.        We

           were then subject to further delays to the ground due to the

           heavy volume of traffic, prior to arriving at the ground.        I

           didn't see any supporter consuming alcohol.

           I arrived in Sheffield at about 2.25 pm. (1425).      I parked my car on

           the entrance drive to Gallaghers Tabacco Factory.       I don't know

           the name of the road which this is on.       I did not receive or



                                                                                          1457
see any Police direction or escort from any Police officers

from my arrival point to the ground.    There seemed to be a big

Police presence away from the ground standing by shops and pubs.

On route to the ground I saw no disorder, fighting or drunkeness.

We arrived at the ground at about 2.40 pm (1440).    As soon as

we arrived at the ground we immediately came involved in a mass

of people, not an organised queue, who were all stood still. I

asked one Policewoman on horseback the direction to B turnstile

and she just pointed to the mass and said 'over there'. I saw

no stewards at all near the turnstiles due to the mass of

people some three to four thousand, I was not able to find our

official entry point.    We entered through a main gate, not

through a turnstile and were just carried through with the mass

of the crowd.   As I say we did not go through a turnstile we

entered through a main folding gate which led directly to a

tunnel I didn't see the turnstile gates open the only gate I

saw open was the gate I entered through I did not see this gate

or any other gates being opened at all. I didn't witness any

unauthorised entry into the ground all I saw was people

climbing up over the fences and walls at the sides to avoid

the crush outside the ground.    No person asked for my ticket

and I have two tickets in my possession that of my sons and

my own ticket, numbers LL2 43 6 (Exh         Ref         ),

and ticket number LL2 43 4 (Exh        Ref          ).

Once inside the ground I did not see any signs directing me to my

match vewing point.     I was not able to find my viewing point, due to

the mass crowd, due to the crowd I was carried through into the

tunnel with my son which led down to the stand directly behind the

goal on the Lappings Lane End.     In the tunnel I became separated frcm
my two friends and remaind just with my son.     There was free passage

along the tunnel, there was no Police control evident at this point

in the ground at all.     I did not see any stewards whatsoever as we

entered or exited from the tunnel.    Between the time I entered the

tunnel and to the time I got to my position that I was forced to take

on the stand I did not witness any disorder or any other incidents.

In the ground I saw no person consuming alcohol, it was physically

impossible for people to drink because as soon as we entered the

stand we became hemmed in immediately.    As soon as I entered the

stand I took up the position which I would roughly say would be on

your grid in the area of G/4.     I was stood with my son who was about

two foot (2') away from me just separated by one person between us.

       was stood at the end of a barrier.     Due to the confusion of

the whole crowd I did not see a barrier break.     I became concerned

for          and turned to make sure he was alright.   I wasn't able to

fully turn around but I was able to see that           was facing

towards the tunnel.     He was in some distress and up against a barrier.

All I know is that           thought he'd broken his leg on the support

of the barrier as he was pushed around.     I would have got into the

stand at about 2.55 pm (1455) as soon as we got into the stand and

became involved in an excessive crush.     It was too late to get out of

the crush.    I became frightened as I was unable to move at all I was

trapped there.    I was stood as I say with my son, at no point whilst

I was in the stand did I witness any fighting or disturbance. I was

just aware of people shouting and screaming in distress. I was

directly in the middle of the     large crush which started as soon as

we entered the stand, within minutes of this people were climbing

over the fence trying to get out of the crush.     There was one

Policeman stood at the gate at the front by the pitch, by his actions
he appeared to be looking in to the crowd and waving to the people to

get away from the fence.     I could see that people at the front were

being crushed up to the fence and were in great distress.

Although people were able to climb over the fence these were not

people against the fence as it was physically inpossible for them to

climb out it was people who were behind them who were climbing over

the people at the front.    The people who climbed over the fence went

to the gate where the Policeman was stood and although I didn't see I

believe it was them that was responsible for the gate being opened.

All I can say about the Policeman is that his head was completely

bald as I saw when his hat was knocked off later.

When the gate was eventually opened a few people who were directly by

it managed to get out but the rest getting out seemed to be a very

slow process.     The whole mass of people in the stand seemed to surge

forward towards the gate. We only moved only about a foot (1').       At

that        managed to get himself away from the barrier and I was

able to take hold of him.     By this time a lot of people were climbing

over the fence.     There was about 200 on the pitch and I think at

this time the game itself came to a halt.     Behind me people from

the stand were being lifted up into the seated stand behind.

There was two Police officers stood at the front of the seating

stand they were certainly doing nothing.     They didn't appear to be

using any radios or helping anybody in any way.     As a result of

being involved in a crush I received bruising to my groin and

thighs, my son also received t o m thigh and groin muscles. I didn't

receive hospital treatment in Sheffield nor did my son.



            I did not directly witness that I was aware of

although I didn't assist I was aware of a body of a man wearing
black pants in his twenties being passed over peoples heads

towards the pitch.      The only reason for the deaths of people in

the stand was pushing from behind and the restrictions of the

tunnel so they couldn't go back.      I left the ground at about 3.25

pm. (1525).    This was after seeing the body of a small boy wearing

a red shirt being lifted from the ground immediately by the small

gate leading into the pitch.     When we did leave it was not on the

direction of a Police officer or Steward.      It was my own decision.

 I was assisted by an unknown man and we just followed him out.

I didn't witness anything that I consider to be a criminal

offence.      The whole incident seemed to be handled   in totalutter

confusion.      I saw no Stewards trying to assist aswe wereleaving

through the tijinnel.    I saw three Police officers one   a

Policewoman just stood talking no action.

They were not directing or assisting people in anyway.They didn't

seem to have radios.

They did not seem to be making any efforts to be informing anyone

of what was happening.      I feel there is a total lack of Police

involvement directly outside the gate prior to the game starting.

They had lost control of the mass of people they were making no

effort to regain control.      They seemed to be a lot of officers

more concerned away from the ground.      Once I had managed to

leave the stand there seemed to be a long delay in the arrival

of Police Officers and ambulances. There was only one ambulance

with two crew members who couldn't cope with the number of

people, they were doing their best.      The few Police Officers

that did arrive at the back of the ground arrived too late.

The bodies were already laid out at the back of the ground.

           I am



           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I attended the F.A.Cup Semi Final

           Football match at Hillsborough in Sheffield, butween my team Liverpool

           and Nottingham Forest.

           I travelled to Sheffield in my car, driven by my son,

                        My son had obtained two tickets from Liverpool F.C. as he

           is a season ticket holder.

                     ind I left home at about 12 noon (1200) on that day and

           travelled straight to Sheffield without stopping, except for a hold up

           on the motorway near WOODHEAD, due to roadworks.

           Upon our arrival at Sheffield about 14.30 hrs (1430),            parked

           in a side road about one mile from the football ground, near to a

           small police station, but I don't know the name of the road.

           Fran this point, I walked to the ground following a large group of

           football supporters.     The crowds got larger and larger the nearer to

           the ground we got.      On the way I could see a couple of lads with a

           can of beer, but I didn't see anybody who appeared to be drunk,




                                                                                     1463
THOMPSON             RICHARD    JOSEPH                                         2


although most people appeared in high spirits, with a general feeling

of excitement amongst the crowd.

I arrived at the ground itself at about 14.40 hrs (1440) the same day

and saw a mass of people all trying to get into the ground.   There was

no form of queuing whatsoever, I received no directions from anybody

as to how or where I was to get into the ground.   All I knew was that

I was to enter through Area B, to get into the West Stand.    This

information was on my ticket.

Whilst waiting in the crowd to enter the ground, a large gate nearby,

which i think was Gate C was opened from the inside and most of the

crowd moved towards this gate and entered the ground through it.       I

would say that I was in the first fifty (50) to one hundred (100)

people to enter the ground by this gate.    Just before the gate was

opened, the crowding had been such that a few lads had climbed over

the fencing to the right of the turnstiles.   The crowding outside the

gates had been such that I am sure, had that the gate not opened,

when it did , that certain injuries, or even deaths would have

occurred.

When the gate opened, the crowd surged through, of which I was a

part.   No body checked my ticket at all.

Once inside the ground, I did not see any signs indicating where

I was to go, and I saw nobody from the ground or the police whom I

could ask.   The main body of the crowd, upon entering the gate , headed

slightly to the left towards a tunnel leading out to the terraces.         I

walked down this tunnel, which I found difficult to negotiate as there

were no lights.

When I got to the end of the tunnel, I could see that the area that I

was about to enter, behind the goal was full and there was no more

room at all.


                                                                                   1464
THOMPSON                RICHARD   JOSEPH                                   3


As soon as I saw the numbers of people in this area, I knew that

there were going to be severe problems in getting the crowd behind

me into this area, as by now the players were on the pitch

wanning up, and everyone was anxious to get in before the kick-off.

On arriving in the terrraced area my son and I moved slightly to the

left of the end of the tunnel indicated by Square Number: J1 in the

Supporters Questionnaire (Q         ). At this time, people around me

were screaming at others still in the tunnel to turn back as there

was no room, but the crowd kept coming to the point where there was

a surge of people.   This was due to a crowd of between two and three

thousand (2-3,000) more people trying to get into this area.

When the crowd surged forward at this time, I was carried along

about four or five feet (4' or 5') and then collided with the post at

the end of a barrier.    As a result of this collision with the barrier,

I suffered bad bruising to my ribs.        After collision with the

barrier, I was somehow spun round and ended up on the other side of

the barrier with my back to the goal, facing the tunnel.       At this

point, I could see my son was on the other side of the barrier trying

to brace himself against it with his arms, to avoid being crushed

against it.

I screamed to him that he was at the end of the barrier and to come

round to my side.

This he somehow managed to do.

I was then able to gasp some air as the pressure was now relieved

from my chest.   I then saw on the other side of the barrier two men

in their early twenties and a young lad of about twelve years of

age.   All three were crushed aginst the barrier due to the force of

the people behind them.     I do not know any of these people and I am

unable to describe them, other than one of the men had a light-
THOMPSON               RICHARD    JOSEPH                                    4


coloured jumper on.    All three were pleading with myself and other

people around me to help them.      I recovered sufficiently to try and

push these people backwards away from the barrier, as I could see

that the barrier was crushing the stomach area of the two men and

the chest of the young lad.      All my efforts were in vain.   The

pressure behind these people continued__________________________



                    At this point I am sure that these three people

died and my thoughts then turned to safety for myself and my son, and

I decided there and then to try and leave the ground.

My son heaved me into the air and I was passed, crawling on my hands

and knees, forward down towards the pitch on top of the heads and

shoulders of the people on the terraces, until I reached the fencing

at the front and managed to escape through a gate and onto the pitch,

where the game was now in progress.

I then looked back into the crowd trying to see where my son was; I

located him up at the back in the air obviously on top of other

people.    He then somehow rolled over the top of other people, coming

to rest spread-eagled against the perimeter fence on top of peoples

heads about a foot to a foot and a half (l'to 5'6") from the gate

through which I had exited. I heard my son call to a policeman at the

gate to help him.     I don't think that this policeman could have

realised what was happening at the tunnel end of the pen as he told my

son to get back into the crowd.      A policewoman, however, reached

through the gate and pulled my son out.

Once I saw that my son was out onto the pitch area, I turned

away and started to walk in the direction of the penalty area through

reporters and television people.      My intentions at this stage were to

leave the ground.     By now I had started to feel the pain of my rib
THOMPSON              RICHARD   JOSEPH                                   5


injuries.   A steward offered to get an ambulance for me, but I declined

as I just wanted to get away.   At this time, I was on the floor

having collapsed through a mixture of pain, exhaustion, relief that

myself and my son had escaped and emotional upset at what had happened.

Together with ini’- son, I left by going over a wall or a fence

into the South Stand and from there left the ground, arriving in the

road outside the ground at between 15.10 and 15.15 hrs (1510 and

1515). Outside the ground, my son, who had still got both our tickets,

threw them away, and we went to our car and went home.     On the way

home, I heard on the radio continuing reports of the events at the

ground and bacame very emotionally upset, as did my son.     I arrived

back home at about 17.50 hrs (1750) the same day.




My feelings as regards this event are that, had the crowd outside the

ground been controlled to some extent, it would not have been

necessary for the gates to have been opened, thereby allowing a

massive surge of people into an area that was already full.

I am prepared to attend any court or other hearing held as a result

of this inquiry.

           I am a married man living at the above address with my wife.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989, (150489) I attended the F.A. Cup Semi-

           Final at Hillsborough Football Ground in Sheffield.

           I am a Liverpool supporter.

           I left Liverpool to travel to the ground at about 10 am( 1000).    I

           travelled with my friends 1)




                      [ don't know where he lives.

                          is a season ticket holder and it was         ho queued

           for my match ticket a couple of weeks before the game.     I paid him #6

           for it.

           We travelled to the game by car it was not an organised party.

           When we were on our way to the game we stopped just outside or on the

           outskirts of Sheffield. It was only about ten minutes drive away from

           the ground.    We went to a pub.   I don't know What it is called but I

           had two pints of beer as did the other three.    We also had a pub

           lunch.    We were in there for about three quarters of an hour to an
GRANT                   JONATHON                                             2

hour.     It was empty when we got in there but when we left the rocm

was pretty packed with football fans from Liverpool.      I didn't see

anybody drunk.

Our journey to the ground from that point was hold up free in fact the

only hold up that we had on our journey was because of roadworks in

Manchester.

Having left the first pub, our car ride was only about ten minutes

long.     We were directed when we got to the ground area to a street of

houses.     This direction was by Police.   On their direction we parked

the car on a road there. The time then would be about 1 pm (1300).

The four of us, having parked up, walked for about five to ten

minutes to the ground.     We had a look at the ground and found the pub

next to the ground was shut.       We jumped on the first bus and rode for

about five minutes until we came to the first pub.

That was where we got off.     We went into the pub. It was full of

football supporters mainly Nottingham but seme Liverpool.

In the pub we all had about another four to five Pints of beer.       We

were in there about an hour and a half.

At about 2.15 pm (1415) we left the pub and caught the first bus back

to the ground.

At about 2.30 (1430) to 2.40 pm (1440) we arrived at the outer gates

of the ground. There was a large crowd in no order at all.

It was just a mass of people.       It was a deep enough mass to fill the

area around the Leppings Lane gate.

Hie gates were actually shut when I got there and there were only

Policemen on horses that were visible.

The gates were opening frcm time to time allowing supporters to enter

the turnstile area.     Then they were being shut behind the people.

We stayed in Lappings Lane for about ten minutes. All the time the

mounted Policemen were trying to get the crowds into seme kind of

order but there was nothing they could do.    Apart from that there

was no other directions by anybody.     I saw no stewards.

After the ten minute wait which was very much a crush outside.      There

was swaying and pushing.    You had to just go with the crowd. Then the

metal gates which are about six to seven foot (6' to 7') high metal

were opened again and we got in. To this point I had seen no kind of

disorder. Once inside the turnstile area the pushing relieved.      We

then moved towards the turnstiles.    Still there was no stewards

directions. I ended up next to a concertina gate to the left of the

seven turnstiles that I know as entrance 'B'. I had been there about

five minutes when the gate opened. I didn't see who opened it but me

and the other three just looked at one another.      There was no rush and

we just walked in.     Everybody else followed but still the rush wasn't bad.

I waited at the end of the tunnel for two of the lads who were in the

toilet.    That was the turnstile end of the tunnel.    Looking along the

tunnel I could see a bit of green pitch, I didn't think the game had

started but it had. I can say that when we were outside the turnstile

before the side gate opened, I saw a lot of people climbing over the

walls next to the turnstiles. They were going over like Ants.

Inside the ground I still had my ticket in full as I had not gone

through a turnstile.

When I went into the ground I saw no signs or directions to the match

viewing points.    I had no difficulty in finding my match viewing

point though.     I walked along the tunnel where there was free

passage.    I went with my three friends to pen 4.     There was no Police

Control inside the ground.     Nor was there any Steward Control.

I saw no kind of disorder inside or outside the ground.

I saw nobody drinking alcohol inside the ground.


                                                                                 1 471
GRANT                  JONATHON


Having travelled along the tunnel and gone into Pen 4.     I was stood

towards the back.   I have been shown a grid by the Police which

places my position at M3.     I could feel by this stage that everybody

was packed in tight.    I was trying to move further across to the

wings but it was virtually impossible.

At this point, I saw a man about late 20's in age, light brown short

hair, clean shaven wearing a blue kagool. Medium build 5'9 tall.

He was crouched over leaning on somebody.     I pulled him up towards

me.   He was still on his feet although I felt that had nobody been in

front of him he would have fallen over.     His face was very white. I

spoke to him.   He seemed in a daze and slime was coming frcm his

mouth.   He then vomitted on me.

Suddenly there was an almighty push from behind and I lost the man.

I would estimate ray position after the push as P5.   Luckily I went

between the barriers but there was no broken barriers in Pen 4.

I would estimate the time when I first took up ray postion prior to

the push at 3.02 pm (1502).

I felt excessing crowd crush prior to the main push.     I was in fact

unable to reach ray intended viewpoint.   When the main push came and

the surge ray feet were actually off the floor and I had to go where

the crowd went.

Prior to the push I was stood with ray friends

                            When the main push came we were all carried

pretty much the same way.

I can say again I saw no kind of disturbances, fights or unusual

incidents.

I can say that I witnessed crowd crush because I was in it.     I went

forward with the crowd unable to do anything about it.     The main

crush happened at about 304 pm (1504).
       GRANT                   JONATHON


       I can only say that the surge in the crowd came from a large push at

       the back.     I don't know the reason for the push.   I was not injured

       at all.

       After the push I saw about ten to twelve people on the pitch getting

       mouth to mouth resuscitation and other aid from the Police and

       supporters.     I saw a few people being lifted over the fence

       unconscious.

       One of them, aman of about thirty who was blue in the face.         I

       turned around.      I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

       I saw the Police and the crowd pulling at the fence and they ripped

       the spot welds puling the fence up passing people through the hole.

       I can't comment on any factors in the deaths.

        I left the ground of my own accord at about 3-30 (1530) to 3-45 pm.

        (1545) I saw no criminal offences taking place.

        In my view everything that could have been done after the event was

       Both by the Police and the crowd. I saw no stewards.

        I feel that we    should have had the larger end of the ground.

                                                                J. GRANT

           On Saturday the 15th April 1989(150489) I went with two friends to the

           Liverpool versus Nottingham Forest F.A. Cup semi final match at

           Hillsborough Sheffield.

           I am an ardent but level headed Liverpool supporter and have been so

           since I was fourteen years of age in 1954 (000054).    I have seen most

           home games in all these years and have been to many away games.       I am

           a season ticket holder and obtained a ticket for the Leppings Lane

           stand entrance B at the cost of     6 from the Anfield ground ticket

           office on the Tuesday or Wednesday evening that Liverpool     played

           Charlton.     This was about 10 days before the Hillsborough match.

           At about 10.15 am(1015) on Saturday the 15th April 1989 (150489) I was

           picked up from ray home by two friends_____________ whose address I

           and en route we were held up in heavy traffic for about an hour on

approach to the Manchester area well after we had left the M62.       I am

unable to say the precise location but the time of the hold up was

11.15 am. (1115)

At about 12.40 pn( 1240) we stopped at a restaurant type pub in the

'Snake Pass' on the approaches to Sheffied.    We all had a meal and me

and       lad two or three pints only and       only had a pint as he

was driving.   I can't say the name of the pub but I remember it had a

sign outside saying the pub didn't open till 1 o'clock(1300) and we

had to wait . There were other people there including walkers and

ramblers and also there were other Liverpool supporters there who had

also arrived in cars.    I played my guitar in the pub to 'jolly' things

a long and we left about 2 pn.(1400)

We arrived in Sheffied at about 2.25 pn(1425) and parked the car on

the road outside a newly built fire station about 15 minutes walk

from the ground.   Again I can't give the exact location.

The three of us walked together towards the ground and we passed a

pub called the 'Yew Tree' we were directed by a lady towards the

ground and on the way we checked with a Police Officer who was with

another officer standing on the pavement.

We approached the Hillsborough Stadium along Leppings Lane and as we

arrived the time was about ten minutes to 3. (1450).

The three of us were together in a slow moving mass of fans edgirg

towards the stadium entrance in Leppings Lane.    We were walking three

abreast and when we got about 30 yards from the stadium wall I started

to look for entrance B which I knew was my entry point.     We then

arrived in an area approaching the turnstiles which was a mass of

fans waiting to enter.     I could see a policeman on horseback in the

middle of the crowd.     This officer was alone but appeared to be trying

to channel the supporters to either side of him but was not directing
LATHAM                ROBERT                                            3


people verbally.

I was still looking for entrance B and the fans started to move

forward as a unit to what I assumed was an entrance or gateway but I

could not actually see one at this time.   I could not see any

direction signs at all but assumed I would cone across one as we moved

forward.

I suddenly came upon a policeman in uniform by an open gateway.   The

Policeman was holding on to the end of the gate and standing

slightly behind it as I was approaching.   The crowd was packed and

moving slowly foward but there was no rush or unruliness.   There was

no one round me who I could see drinking or doing anything unlawful.

There was no going back for me or anyone you just had to go with the

crowd.

When I was a few feet from the policeman at the gate he said to me,

"I wouldn't come in here mate."   As he said it I was up to him and

passing him and he said, "I advise you not to cone in here."

I wanted to stop because of what he said but there was no way I could

I just had to follow the crowd.

I remember thinking, "Hey Robby your're going to get arrested here."

Thinking I was now entering an area I shouldnt be in but couldn't do

anything about it.

We moved into a forecourt area beyond the gates we had entered and I

could see a tunnel directly in front of me and the football pitch at

the end of the tunnel.

There were uniformed policemen in the forecourt area to my left in

the arm    of some toilets and the tunnel. There were two officers that

I could see and although they weren't together they were within a few

feet of each other.   They did not appear to be directing people but

seemed aware and watching the fans. There was now more space and I
LATHAM                  ROBERT                                             4


could move more freely although the area was still very crowded.

I was still with my friends

We moved towards the tunnel and I realised that I had still got my

ticket.   I turned to               and said, "Hey      I've still got

my ticket", and         said, "Yeh it's another Watford init", meaning

we hadn't needed a ticket to get in.

We were moving freely into the tunnel still together and walking

slowly in the crowd.

I did not see any officials or Police in the tunnel or at the

entrance to it.

As we moved along the tunnel I could see fans urinating in the

tunnel.   There was about half a dozen fans urinating presumably

because they could not find the toilets.     I don't know if they were

just entering the terraces or had been on than and returned into the

tunnel.

               and I were still together as we left the tunnel to the

right and onto the terrace steps into what I now know to be Pen

Number three, although at the time I did not see any signs indicating

the pen number or area.

As we stood on the terrace steps I was directly behind the goal of

the Leppings Lane end and about one third of the way down the

terracing.   I was still standing with                 in that order on

my left, as I looked at the pitch.

The mcment I took up my position was about two minutes to 3(1458).

They had just announced the teams over the speakers.     Fans were still

coming in behind us and people in front of us were saying, "Don't

push any more down, you're crushing us."

There were fans coming in behind but there was no rush it seemed to

me to be the normal type of squashing you get at big matches and I
LATHAM                 ROBERT                                              5


thought it would settle down as soon as the game kicked off, as it

normally does.

Then the whistle went and the game kicked off and immediately the

crowd moved forward.    It was intense movement and I was stuck on the

crash barrier bar immediately in front of me.

People were screaming out then, "Stop pushing stop pushing we're

getting crushed."

I managed to duck down and under the barrier.

I straightened myself up and I was basically trying to look out to my

sides for a bit of roan.

I heard                 shout, "Are you alright Robby, are you alright."

I shouted I was ok.

He shouted that a number of times.

I thought I could move out slowly to the side remembering what a

friend had told me about last year's semi at Hillsborough that there

was a similar crush in this end and that there had been plenty of

space out on the wings.     I didn't appreciate that there were pens

and barriers on either side preventing access to the wings.     However,

I had been able to move to my right about ten feet and was now in line

with the right hand side goal post.    The fans were still pressing

from behind and the screams are getting worse and we are about 3

minutes into the game.(1503)

Suddenly a supporter was handed over the tops of the heads of fans

and passed over me from behind.     I helped to pass him forward.   He

was a white male, I think in his early 20 's and he seemed to be

unconscious.     We passed him forward and he was passed right down to

the front and onto the perimeter fence.

I then saw his body on top of the fence and saw someone on the pitch

side push him back.     I can't say if the person was uniformed or not.
LATHAM               ROBERT                                               6


The body fell of the fence into the crowd.

Within thirty seconds I saw another body of an adult on top of the

fencing being pushed back into the crowd.    I can't recall by who.

The Match is still in play and I suddenly saw the ball hit the

crossbar of the goal at the other end of the pitch.

There was a surge in the crowd then as they thought a goal was being

scored and all hell let loose.

There were screams and people saying, "Get back, we're being crushed."

I saw Bruce (being Bruce GROBBELAR, the Liverpool goal keeper) on the

pitch turn to his right and look into the crowd and then gesture up

the pitch with both his hands passing across the front of his body

that the game should be stopped.

I don't remember if the game is still going on and I can't see where

ray friends              are.

The man in front of me shouted, "There's problems here, let's push

back." I knew myself then that things were bad and I gripped my

hands together in front of my chest and the man in front of me pushed

me back as a ram into the crowd behind.

We were able to move up one step only and then I ranember seeing a

lot of policemen by the perimeter fence on the pitch side shouting,

"Get back move back" and waving to us to get back.    I ranember seeing

people being passed over the fence and the Police taking them down

across the fence onto the pitch, seme of the bodies being snagged by

the spikes on top of the fence.

Because I couldn't push back anymore, I could see the gate in the

perimeter fence had been opened and people were getting through one at

a time onto the pitch.

The Police were still saying, "Get back" and so I had another go

moving back with the fan in front pushing me.
LATHAM                 ROBERT                                              7


I shouted to the fan to 'stop'.   I'd moved only another step up the

terrace and I could feel a body or an arm under my foot.   I wasn't

able to look down because of the crush but I knew something human was

under my feet.

I stood stil not. daring to move any more.

We stood still for no more than six seconds but it felt like hours

and suddenly the pressure from the crowd eased as people filtered

onto the pitch.

I still did not move though because I knew that was the best thing to

do in the situation.

The fan who had been pushing me to make space was sweating profusely

and the sweat seemed to be coming out excessively from his face.

As the pressure eased the fan suddenly fell down in front of me.      It

appeared from fatigue.

This man was a white man, aged about 25 years of age, about 5'8(5'08)

tall, well built, with mousy hair, collar length and just over his

ears. He had a thinnish moustache and was clean shaven except for a

light stubble on his jaws.

I think he was wearing a 'T' shirt but I can't describe him any

further. Two other fans dropped down and tried to give mouth to mouth

resusitation and heart massage.   They seemed to be working on him for

several minutes and then a Policeman arrived and assisted.

There was by now a lot of room on the terraces and I could not say

the exact time, but people were above me in the seating stand

shouting to us to get out of the ground.

Some people who I recognised in the front row of the seating stand

are from the London Branch of the Liverpool supporters Club.    They

were leaning over and dragging fans by the arms to safety off the

terrace into the stands.
LATHAM               ROBERT                                                8


I moved exhaustedly towards the tunnel and found my friend

sitting down on the terrace crying and exhausted.

People were still shouting for us to get out but we couldn't because

people were in the tunnel in a collapsed state.

We were able to eventually walk out of the tunnel slowly.

I was not injured in the incident and left the ground at about 3.30 pm.

(1530)On the day of the match I was wearing a straw coloured cowboy

hat decorated with a white and red band around the brim with a    red

'Liver' bird badge at the front and picture of Bill Shankly on the

sides.   I had a blue denim jean jacket and bib and brace denim trousers.

I feel that there are a number of things that could have been

different and probably avoided the disaster.   They are:

There should be no perimeter fencing at the edge of the pitch.     It

should be assessed the average gate of the two semi finalist teams

and the team with the largest following allocated the larger stand.

People should come first and not the traffic problems.     There should

be a lot of signs dominating and easily visible indicating

entrances and stand areas, etc, as at Wembley our National Stadium.       I

feel there was a lack of communication on the day between the Police

and Officials on the pitch side of the fence and with officials at

the tunnel exit from the terrace.   I could not understand why a large

number of Police were arranged in a cordon across the pitch.     This is

in hindsight as I did not see the cordon on the day only in photos

later.

There should be another National Stadium in the North so that both

semis could be played together but in stadium suitable for the event

and equal seating for all.

After the match I recorded my observations of events onto an audi

tape which I now produce Ref No KW1   Exhibit No

           I am a single woman living at the above address with my parents.             I am

           a supporter of Liverpool F.C. and on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489)

           went to Hillsborough Football Ground Sheffield for the F.A. Cup semi

           final match against Nottingham Forest.          I went to the match with my

           father                        and two friends                           We

           travelled up ir             car.   Both my father & myself are season

           ticket holders and we had #14 North Stand tickets given to us by

           Liverpool F.C.'s Chairman, John SMITH.

           We left for the match at about 11.45am (1145).         We travelled through

           Stockport where we were held up due to road works for about one hour.

           We travelled straight through to Sheffiled reaching Sheffield at about

           2.20pm (1420).    We parked the car about 1 mile away from the ground

           & walked towards the ground.         We didn't notice any signs or Police

           Officers directing us to the ground but we first followed the crowd.

           We reached the ground at about 2.40pm (1440).          On the journey to

           ground only two people asked us for spare tickets which is a lot less

           than even a normal league match at Anfield.          We started to queue at

           the Leppings Lane and North Stand turnstile.          The crowd at this point



                                                                                               1483
                                                                           2


was quite dense, forming just up to the perimeter gates.    We joined

the queue & people formed up behind us.    The crowd was orderly but

not organised.   There were a few surges but we managed to keep our

feet. The crowd kept on pushing from behind.     I became seperated from

my father but I could still see him.     It was that tight that I was

unable to move my arms or anything.

I could see two Police Officers on horseback I can't remember them

doing much specific.   There was also one on foot by the far right of

the turnstiles, doing very little but you couldn't blame him for that,

one person couldn't do much.    At a point I was pushed & fell onto

the foot Officer who helped me keep my balance.     I also saw another

Officer standing on top of the turnstiles helping people up.     I didn't

see him check any tickets.     He shouldn't have done it but he was

helping pull people from the crush.     I think I looked very red in

the face at this stage & my left arm became numb people began to

take notice of my condition & tried to help me & my father as best

as they could.   The people in front of me managed to move to one side

& assist in pushing us through to the turnstiles.     Then it was just

normal I gave my ticket stub to the steward at the turnstiles

and entered the ground.

I don't really know if the gate opened by the Police at the far

right of the turnstile block had been opened before or after I entered

the ground but I beleive it assisted the people outside it relieved

the pressure.    I think the only mistake the Officers in charge made

was not making sure there was Police or Stewards directing people as

they came through into the ground.     I met up with my father once in

the ground and we both took up our match viewing point in the North

Stand just before kick off.

When you looked at the pens in the Leppings Lane end it was blatantly
                                                                          3


obvious that people were unable to move & there were too many

people in there.    The two sides of the pens were 1/2 empty, there was

plenty of space in there and the fans could have been accomodated in

there easily.

Just after the natch kicked off, supporters from the pens seemed to be

walking on the running track at the rear of the goal, I don't know how

they got there, then just before the game was stopped people began to

spill onto the pitch from the fencing.

A Police Officer then went onto the pitch & stopped the game.    After

that it was utter chaos everyone came onto the pitch.    About 200

Police Officers came onto the pitch and formed a line in front us as

if we were a threat.    People began shouting at them to help but they

stayed where they were only a very few broke rank & went to help.

The Forest fans obviously didn't know what was going on because they

started chanting.    This incensed a couple of Liverpool supporters who

ran towards the forest end.    It was at this point the Police formed a

cordon across the pitch.    The Police seemed to be at a dead loss they

didn't know what to do, it was the fans who did most of the helping

& carrying when they broke the hoardings down.

The fans were the heroes on that day.    The Police, most of them, just

did nothing.

By about 3.50 (1530) we had seen enough & left the ground and went

towards our vehicle.

The organisation of the ground was very poor I could have done

better, before the match the organisation was poor and after it was

non existant.

DATED: 150589                                                             (SIGNED)



           I am a married man residing at the above address with my wife and

           daughter.   I support Liverpool Football Club and regularly travel to

           away fixtures as well as attending home matches at Anfield.

           My father-in-law                      obtained a ticket for me, for the

           F.A. Cup Semi Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, to be

           played at Hillsborough, Sheffield on Saturday 15th April 1989

           (150489).   It was a "seat ticket" for the North Stand and cost

           #14 or #15. I travelled to the match with my father-in-law,

           brother-in-law                        a friend       and another friend

                          Two others were with us who I don't know, I beleive that

           they were father and son.   We used a Mini Bus which my father-in-law

           drove. We left Liverpool on 15th April 1989 (150489) between 10am

           (1000) and 11am (1100) and went off along the M62 but after that I

           cannot recall the route we took, and as far as I am aware we had no

           travel delays, arriving in Sheffield at about 1pm (1300).     We did not

           stop enroute. We found our own parking spot in a side road near to

           some some shops, there was a public house the Bassett nearby w h ic h was

           full of Liverpool Supporters.   It was a fine day and people were




                                                                                       148?
                                                                           2


sitting outside it overlooked a large green area.    It would be hard

to estimate the exact numbers there, but we were shoulder to

shoulder, maybe 2 or 3 hundred.   Everybody was out to have a good time

and there was no shortage of pints of ale in front of than.    I had in

the region of 5 bottles of Newcastle Brown.    The other in our group

had roughly the same amount, except for the father-in-law, who didn't

drink, because of driving. At no time did I see any sign of

drunkness, disorder or fighting, everyone was out to have a good time,

some local people were in their gardens and kids were about it was a

friendly atmosphere. All of our group left the public house at about 2.

10 pm (1410) and walked to the ground.    It was a walk of about one

mile.   There were groups of Police Officers on foot, along the route

to the ground, but as the crowd was going in one direction there was

no need for any escort or directions to be given to them.     There were

no signs of drunkness, disorder or fighting on the way.

We arrived at the Leppings Lane entrance at Hillsborough about 2.40pm

(1440). The area around the gates was a solid mass of people and had

built back into the road.   People had soon come behind us and there

was no way that you could turn back without a struggle.     It was a

definite crush and you had no control over the direction you were

taken. There were a number of mounted Police Officers.     I cannot be

certain of the exact number but I would guess 5 or 6.     They were

trying to get people to form queues and enter both the outer gates and

the turnstiles in a orderley manner.     However it was made very

difficult by the number of people in the crush.

The situation was made worse by pieople at the back pushing forward

towards the horses, the people next to the horses were then forced to

hold back, to prevent themselves being kicked or whatever by the

horses and therefore those in the middle were crusted even more.       I
                                                                              3


couldn't see any police officers, other than the mounted ones, neither

can I recall seeing any Stewards outside the ground.

I was pushed with the crowd past the Police horses and slowly my

anxiety increased as the crush intensified.     I became worried and

frightened as I was ubable to control my direction.    I couldn't do

anything, but go with the crush.    People were screaming for help and

the looks on the faces around me showed that there were a lot of

frightened people there.

I ended up being crusted against the large blue gates to the left of

the North Stand turnstiles.    There were people banging and kicking

these gates and shouting for the gates to be opened to save people

being killed.

Whilst I was posted up against the gates I realised that I was injured

and needed assistance.     I had managed to remain close to my father-in-

law and called out to him.    He is larger than me and he managed to get

between me and the crush.     He pulled me along from the large gates

and posted me into the turnstile shielding me with his own body.        The

turnstile man took all of my ticket off me.     I went through and

although I was shaking I recovered my composure, as best as I could.

Once inside I could still hear the shouting and banging on the doors

from outside.   There was a steward and definitely more than 6 Police

Officers just inside the large gates, that I had been crusted against.

After a few moments I set off with my father-in-law towards the North

Stand.   I can recall looking back towards these gates and seeing a

large number of people in the area just inside the gates.     I cannot

say whether they were open or not.     I didn't see any gate other than

turnstiles being opened, or witness any unauthorised entry.I walked

freely with my father-in-law and eventually found my seat in

the North Stand the match had started at this time.     I did not see any
                                                                         4

disorder or other incidents between entering the ground and reaching

my seat.   I did not witness the consumption of alcohol in the ground.

At a point when forest crossed a ball towards the Liverpool goal, I

became aware of people climbing fences from behind the goal and coming

onto the edge of the pitch, they did not attempt to go onto the field

of play.   There were Police Officers there, and my view is that they

were telling people to get back in behind the barriers.   After a while

more fans were coming over the fencing and eventually the fans started

to pull at the fencing.   It clearly wasn't a 'pitch invasion' and I

realised that something must have been wrong behind the goal, although

I didn't know what.

I saw help being rendered to people on the pitch everybody seemed to

be helping in their own way, although it did seem that some of the

Police didn't realise the extent of what was happening.   I kepjt my

eye on the clock and after 56 minutes I realised that the game wasn't

going to be played, there was an announcement and I left shortly after

that.

Apart from one incident when a Liverpool Supporters who was obviously

drunk, and had his belly hanging out of his shirt, standing, mocking

and waving his scarf just outside the penalty area, infront of the

North Stand, I saw no aggressive or troublsome incidents. I didn't

hear any loudspeaker announcements inside the the ground until Kenny

Dagleish made his announcement, he quietened the ground

down, making it possible for us to hear what was said.As I was making

my way from the North Stand down the ramp towards the Leppings Lane

gates I was with my father-in-law, brother-in-law,

We heard some shouts "Does anyone want Mars Bars, Coke, Orange."

There were three youths wearing Liverpool colours coming out of a

doorway to a refreshment bar on the other side of the fence to us.
They were throwing the stuff over the fence towards where we were.    It

was obvious to me that they were stealing the stuff from the bar.     I

can't see how anyone could have left the door open so I assume that

they must have broken in. I definitely saw Mars Bars thrown over, they

were so cocky about it.   Both my father-in-law and brother-in-law

shouted back at these youths that enough had happened already without

them starting.   They didn't care and laughed at us.   There were other

supporters on our side of the fence and I'm sure that if someone could

have got hold of them they would have at least had a clip round the

ear, everybody was so insensed.

I returned to Liverpool the same night and although I realised that I

had hurt my left side in the crush outside the turnstiles, I didn't

feel able to go to hospital, probably because of shock and emotion but

also because of the fact that many others were far worse than me.




I would like to add for the benefit of the Inquiry that I do not lay

the blame for what happened with any individuals actions on Saturday

15th April 1989 (150489), but suggest that the Football Association

should have learnt lessons from the Semi Final played at Hillsborough

in 1988 (000088).   I attended that match.

           At about 09.30hrs (0930) on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I left my

           home address to go to Liverpool, where I collected a hire car, from

           Avis Rental, Mount Pleasant.   It was a Vauxhall Cavalier.    I had

           hired the car to travel to Sheffield Wednesday football Ground in

           Sheffield.   I travelled with (1




           had hired the car. Some more friends also travelled with us in

           another hire car. My brother                     (30 yrs) same address

           as myself and four other friends.   I don't know the address.

                                  md another person, I don't remember.

           We all left Liverpool at about 10.30hrs (1030) to travel to

           Sheffield.   We were all Liverpool Supporters.

           My ticket for the match came from                     It cost me #6

           standing for the Leppings Lane entrance.I have retained the ticket,

           but it is at heme.

           We travelled across Snakes Pass.    We stopped at a pub about 10-15



                                                                                      1493
miles from Sheffield.   We had a couple of drinks, it was about 12.

50 hrs (1250).   We left the pub at about 1400 hrs.

There were a few other Liverpool supporters in the pub having a drink.

Traffic was very bad, vehicles were bumper to bumper, mainly Liverpool

supporters travelling towards the match.

We arrived in Sheffield at about 14.30 hrs (1430).     We parked the car

in a side street about 10 minutes from the ground in Sheffield.         It

was near a railway bridge and station.

I have visited Sheffield Wednesday football ground on two other

previous occasions, so I know the ground layout.      We walked to the

ground and towards the Leppings Lane entrance.     I did not see any

disorder or fighting the supporters were quite happy.

On arrival at the gates at 14.50 hrs (1450) I could see at least 2000+

people all crowded around the entrance.

Within the crowd were about 3 mounted Policemen on horseback.       I

recognised the one rider as being a Liverpool policeman.      There was no

queues just a great crowd of people.     People were shouting to be let

in.   Some were climbing over the wall and top of the turnstiles to get

into the ground.   I was in the crowd for about 10 minutes.     The

mood of the crowd changed, people were shouting.      A young lad about 20

years was crushed near gate C, the end turnstile near this gate.

He looked in a bad way.   People were shouting for the gates to be

opened.   Suddenly gate C was opened up from the inside.     The crowd

then surged forwards through the gate.

I was towards the front of the crowd about 15-20 feet (15'-20') from

Gate C when it was opened.    I walked forwards towards the tunnel with

my brother,                                     I did not see any

policeman or stewards at or near the tunnel.     No one checked our

tickets on entering the tunnel we were on the left hand side of it.
                                                                             3


We were still walking along and through the tunnel.     I did not see

anyone crushed or collapsed in the tunnel.     At the end of the tunnel,

I could see the pitch, the players were wanning up before the game

started.     I had intended to go left and finished up in Pen 4.    I would

describe my walk as brisk but not running.     On reaching Pen 4 the

terrace was very    busy with people.

I ducked under the first crush barrier at the top of the terrace.

After this I got pushed down towards the front, towards the fence near

the pitch.     I became trapped about 1/2 way down the terrace.    I had

lost my friends at this time we had became separated in the sudden

surge forward of the crowd. I had now became trapped in the crowd, I

had trouble breathing, I could not move.     People all around me were

shouting and screaming.

Pressure of people was all around me.      It was just after 1500 hrs.

The players had just kicked off.     I realised what was happening.      I

made the decision to get out of the pen at all costs or I would be

dead.    I gradually pushed my way forward towards the fence and the

pitch.     I could see the gate in the fence leading onto the pitch was

open.    There was a lot of police around the gate. Suddenly a woman

aged about 20 years who had her back to the fence, appeared in front

of me.     She had her head on my chest.   She was crying and saying

'help me'. My hands were up in the air and I could not move.        Hor

lips turned blue, I looked down but she had gone.      I don't where I

could not see her.     The crowd surged forward and I was pushed over to

the left and forwards.     It was left of the gate and close to the

fence. About 3 feet (3') from the fence, the crowd surged forwards

again, I managed to get my right hand onto the wire fence.        I told

myself I had to get out. It felt like I was standing on people at this

time I managed to climb up onto the fence. A Liverpool supporter and
a policeman managed to pull me over the fence.

I was totally exhausted by this time I lay down near the goal net.        I

was shaking and sweating.    My ribs, chest and back were hurting, I was

sore all over.    People were asking if I was alright, I could not speak

properly.     I was lying down for about 10 minutes.    I recovered and

stood up.    There were bodies lying on the pitch.     There appeared total

confusion.    As I looked down towards the KOP end of the pitch. I

could see an ambulance driving across the pitch.

People were lying down at the KOP end and gettingtreated.       Dead

people were lying all around, a few bodies were covered up.      Other

people were giving first aid.     I am a qualified first aider and

started walking down towards the KOP end.

But when I got there, I felt sick and weak, I just could not do

anything.

I sat down on a wall near the North Stand.    When I had recovered.       I

left the ground of my own accord.     I dont know the time, it was when

everybody else was leaving the ground.

My brother,                    talked back to where we parked the car,

and met the other members of our party at the cars.

We then returned home.

I did not witness any criminal offences.     I did not see anyone drink

alcohol in the ground.

I would like to say there was about 60 policemen       on the pitch at the

time of the disaster.     They did nothing at all to help, they just

stood there.     They could have helped the injured to get out of the

pens.

The crowd outside the gorund were not controlled correctly by the

police.

The Public address system should have been used at the time to give
       the crowd instructions on where to go.

        I would be willing to attend Court as a witness if so required.



       The above statement was obtained by me at

        Street, Liverpool business address, at 1440 hrs Tuesday 2nd May

        1989 (020589).    It was read by the person making it and signed it.

           I am a married man and I live at the above address with my wife and

           family.

           I am employed as the                      Eor

                     and have been so employed for the past four years.

                     I don't know his other name.

           I am an Everton Supporter but couldn't get a ticket for their match at

           Villa park, that was why when I was offered a ticket for the

           Hillsborough Match by                    : accepted,             had a

           batch of tickets because they are match sponsors, and consequently I

           got my ticket free of charge.



                                                                                     1498
On route to the match we stopped at a motorway service station on the

M62 for a pre arranged meet with the other vehicle, while we were

there we had a coffee. The only other stop we made was on the hard

shoulder, of the M62 because we had missed a turning, in fact a police

vehicle moved us on.

We did have an unscheduled stop due to traffic shortly after leaving

the Ml at the directions of the Police, we crawled along until we

reached Altercliffe Road in Sheffield heading towards the city centre.

This would have been about 12.20pm (1220) again following Police

advice, the time now being about 1.30pm (1330) we left the vehicle in

a side street called Lovell Lane. We had only travelled about a mile

in that time so decided to walk the rest of the way.

There was a large number of people walking the same way, both

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest fans. I saw several of both sets of

fans leaving licenced premises in PENISTONE RD, which is near to the

ground.

We asked and were given advice by several police officers along the

route, as to which way we should walk, although I must say it was

conflicting in sane instances.

We were walking for about an hour towards, the ground and I can say

that during this time I saw no trouble between the fans, although I

did see one Notts Forest lad who was well drunk, sitting on the

pavement and leaning against a wall, this was about a mile from the

ground.

We arrived at the ground about 2.45pm (1445), although at this time

the SIX of us had split up. Myself and       caught a taxi which

dropped us about 200 yds from the Spion Kop end, our tickets being for

the North Stand. We didn't see the others again until we eventually

reached the outside of the West Stand.
Having arrived at Spion Kop, we asked the Police directions for gate

A, North Stand. We were directed around the ground via the south stand

side, but just before reaching the West stand, a cordon of about

twenty police officers stopped us going any further. I showed one of

the officers my ticket and explained that we had just been directed by

the police to that point with the intention of carrying on around the

West Stand. The officer told me that we had been sent the wrong way

and would have to turn around and go all the way back. We did

eventually arrive outside the West Stand in Leppings Lane, this would

have been just after 3.00pm. (1500)

At this time there was about 200 people outside the main gate to the

West Stand, and people appeared to be going into the ground normally.

There was no particular crowd problem.

Myself and                                                         and

             in Leppings Lane outside the main gates.                    was

no longer with the party so we decided to wait for him.

As we waited the crowd reduced to about thirty, it was then that I

noticed that the main gates had been closed. A few minutes later about

four Police officers on horses together with other foot officers moved

towards us and the other thirty or so people, moving us away from in

front of the closed gates to outside a nearby corner shop. We started

to move as directed but the Police seemed dissatisfied with the pace,

and started shouting at the crowd, "Get over there" and that sort of

stuff, one mounted officer grabbed a youth by the scruff of his neck

and said, "That means you" and dragged him along. Another mounted

officer charged his horse towards my own group, and the crowd ended up

dispersed before being shepherded to the opposite side of the road,

where we stood on a footpath on the Bridge, the opposite side of the

main gates. At this time fans were still arriving and being allowed to
                                                                        4


enter the ground in small groups.

We didn't try to enter for two reasons, one we were still looking for

               and secondly we could hear quite clearly over the

ground Tannoy that play had been stopped and appeals were being made

for Liverpool fans to return to their places.

The next thing that happened was that over 100 Police officers arrived

from further up Leppings Lane and formed a cordon across the whole of

the main entrance facing towards where my group, and approximately

only thirty people were standing still on the footpath opposite. Then

about forty mounted officers arrived and stood infront of the Police

cordon again facing towards us.

There appeared to be total confusion, in Police canmunications, in

that it appeared to me that there was no valid reason why Police had

arrived outside the ground and formed the cordon. This cordon remained

for several minutes without doing anything, until fans started to exit

from the ground into the area behind the Police cordon, and apparently

from the terrace turnstile area, just before this happened about

twenty of the mounted officers came over to where we were standing and

formed another cordon in front of us. I was talking to one of the

mounted officers who told me that there was crowd trouble inside and

once it had been brought under control they would again open the

gates. Going back to the fans who were leaving it was obvious from

their distress that there was a far more serious problem inside the

ground. They were crying and saying that there were people dead, with

bodies all over the place. There was a lot of tension, between this

group and the Police cordon, because the Police were not letting them

out. There was a lot of shouting and pushing between both groups,

confusion, for a time, then the police got their act together and

starting letting the fans out and controlling the situation. Several
                                                                        5


of the officers then went into the ground. The remainder then started

controlling traffic as emergency vehicles arrived. The time at this

point was about 3.15pm. (1515)

A few points I wish to clarify are that at no time did I see any any

unauthorised entry, to the ground by any of the fans.

Secondly, I still have my ticket as I never actually got into the

ground.

I have been asked if I received any injury, I did twist the knee of my

right leg when the mounted Police officers charged towards us,

although the injury was not serious enough for me to require hospital

treatment.

I left the area of the ground at approximately 3.40pm (1540) and

walked back to the car.

I have also been asked if I witnessed any criminal offences, the

answer to this is NO.

In conclusion I feel that from various elements I witnessed, major

contributing factors were mis communication between the Police, both

in terms of traffic control several miles from the ground, and the

confusion between Police officers and the lack of instructions

irnnediately outside the ground at Leppings Lane during the period I

was present.

Earlier I referred to some main gates being closed and opened, let me

make it clear I am referring to the Iron railing gates, as opposed to

the concertina type gates.

           holder with Liverpool Football Club and have been for about 20 yrs

           About the first week in April 1989 (000489) I bought a #6.00

           terrace ticket for the Leppings Lane entrance for the semi-final match

           against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough, Sheffield.     At about 11

           am (1100) on Saturday, 15th April 1989 (150489) I left home with my

           wife and daughter in my private car to go to the match.     The route I

           took was the M53 (no delay), M56 (delay Stockport area), A6 (traffic

           delay).   I then took the A623 (road works) and then the A625 (road

           works) into Sheffield. The delays caused roe to be approximately 1

           hour to 1 and a half hours late arriving in Sheffield.     I parked my

           car in a side street off the A61 which was approximately 20

           minutes walk to the ground.   My wife and daughter went off shopping.

           Because of the traffic delays it was not possible to stop and have

           refreshments en route.   I parked my car at about 2.30 pm (1430).       I

           walked along the A61 and I saw several Policemen directing traffic.         I

           saw no-one being searched for weapons or alcohol and I was not

searched myself.    There was a free flow of fans walking towards the

Ground who were in high spirits but NOT drunk, fighting and

disorderly.    As I approached the Ground I was directed by a Policeman

to the South side of the Leppings Lane entrance where I was re­

directed by a Policeman to the North side of the entrance.    This

delayed me even further.    At this point I asked a Policeman which was

the quickest way to the entrance and he told me he was from Doncaster

Force and he enquired of a colleague.     This Policeman directed me via

the route saying that the game had been delayed 15 minutes.

The time would have been just before 3 pn (1500).    The roar of the

crowd indicated to me that it hadn't been delayed.     I eventually made

my way into Leppings Lane where I saw a party of about 12-15

Policemen walking away from the Ground.     I can't recall whether they

were wearing flat caps or helmets.     As I approached the outer gates I

saw approximately half a dozen mounted Policemen trotting away from

the Ground.    I arrived at the outer perimeter gates at about 3-7 pn

(1500-1900).    Between the perimeter gates and the turnstiles I saw

a number of mounted Policemen on horseback giving me the impression

they were parading.    There were one and two foot Policemen dotted

about.    There were a few late-comers approaching the turnstiles.

Myself and the other fans were not approached and searched by the

Police.    I think I went through "F" turnstile where I handed in my

ticket.   As I came out of the turnstile I saw no Police or Stewards.

I saw no signs directing to my entrance to the ground.     I approached

the right-hand stairway and was told that was for seat tickets only

and was directed by a Steward to the tunnel.     I saw no Steward, or

Police Officers at the entrance to the tunnel.     Just going back I did

see the gate to the right of the turnstiles partly open and standing

by it, was a Steward and a Policeman with a flat cap on.

There were other late-comers using the tunnel but I had free movement

down the tunnel.    Within the tunnel I saw a Steward who said the fans

were on the pitch and the players had gone off.       He told me not to

hurry.   As I came out of the tunnel I had relatively free access to the

terracing but I was immediately aware that there were fans climbing

over the perimeter fences, side fences to the pens and were being

pulled up to the West Stand.     I took up position in Pen 4 marked M2 on

the grid.     I saw no fans fighting or drunk but it was quite clear that

the Pens were far too overcrowded.       There were a lot of fans clearly

distressed.     I can say that the perimeter gate in Pen 3 was open but

the gate in Pen 4 was closed     There were some Policemen on the pitch,

in front of the Pen who were assisting fans to get over the fence but

there were others who were turning them back.       The time now would be

about 3.10 pn (1510).     I saw bodies on the pitch and fans generally

milling about.     I saw no fighting or drunkenness.    Compared to the

front of the crowd, where I was standing was comparatively free.          I

saw no obvious crowd surge to compound the problem it was the sheer

weight of numbers created the crush.        I was stood there about five

minutes during which time I saw a large amount of distressed fans,

seme assisted back down the tunnel.        I also assisted various fans

through the tunnel out onto the concourse at the back of the stand and

made various journeys to do this.        The fans were in various states of

distress.     At no time was I injured in the crush.     I saw many fans

lying on the concrete on the concourse and some sitting against the

walls.   At about 3.15 pn (1515) I approached a Policeman who was

standing by the open concertina gate that I had seen earlier.        He gave

me the appearance of being a Senior Police Officer.        He had had a flat

checkered cap on tunic and trousers. I requested of him, immediate

assistance by sending a lot of Policemen down the tunnel to restore
ROSS                    MAXWELL   CAIRD                                      4


order.     He made no reply.   I went back down the tunnel to see if I

could assist further.    About 5 or 10 mintues later whilst I was

standing on the terracing 5 Policemen appeared from the tunnel and

they pushed their way into the crowd down to the front.      I lost sight

of them.     I went back down the tunnel onto the concourse and was

assisting someone when I saw the five Policemen return carrying a

prostrate body along the tunnel onto the concourse and through the

open concertina gate to a waiting ambulance.      The Policeman on the

gate, the one I'd seen earlier was still there and I approached him

and said he would need a fleet of ambulances.      He made no reply.    At

about 3.40 pm (1540) I became aware of a line of Policemen across the

pitch but they may have been there earlier.      I also saw group® of

Police standing talking around the penalty area.      I also saw one or

two Policemen attending to people on the ground.      There appeared to be

lack of direction because the line of Policemen across the pitch could

have helped.     Other Policemen had appeared on the concourse but did

not take an active part in assisting the injured.      The distraught

and hysterical fans were becoming more agitated by the apparent lack

of activity by the Police to assist the injured.      So much so that

several of the fans had to be restrained, by other fans.      Some of the

Police's response appeared to be insensitive.      During the course of

this time I heard no loud-speaker announcements to assist the

operation.     Rapid evacuation of the injured via the tunnel might have

saved lives and further injury.      The only previous announcement I

heard was, as I was approaching the Ground, about 3 o'clock (1500) was

a request for Liverpool fans to move away from the entrances as there

was some crushing.     I left about 4.15 pm (1615) through a crescent of

Policemen on the concourse.       I saw a Senior Police Officer at the end

of the line.     I told him that his Force had a lot to answer for about

           I am a single man living at the above address with my parents.      I am a

           labourer with a building firm.

           I am a Liverpool supporter and have been all my life.      I went to the

           FA Cup semi final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest held

           at Hillsborough, Sheffield Wednesday's football ground, Sheffield.

           The game was held on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489).      I am a season

           ticket holder.      I got my ticket frcm Anfield and paid #6 for it, the

           ticket was for the Leppings Lane End, Standing Area.

           I travelled to the game with two of my mates, Stephen PITT,

                             Merseyside and

           Merseyside.   We went in Stephen's car.      I believe Stephen has phoned

           the hotline but          Ls not on the phone.   We started off frcm New

           Brighton at about 10 am.      (1000)   We went along 'B' and 'A' roads

           avoiding the motorway.     We did not stop on route for any reasons.      We

           had problems with traffic on the road frcm Manchester to Sheffield.

           We went along the 'B' road, Snake Pass I think.       We had started off

           early because we knew there would be traffic problems; the road is not

           a quick route but the motorway is a lot longer route.       We knew there
SEDDON                  GRAHAM   IAN                                          2


would be delays because we went to the same match last year and the

traffic was very slow moving last year.       I always travel early to away

matches.    We arrived in Sheffield between twelve (1200) and twelve

thirty.     (1230)   I don't know where but it was a side road and only a

short distance frcm the ground.

I knew the way into Sheffield because I went to the ground last year.

The signposting was quite good.        I believe it was Hillsborough

Sheffield Wednesday's ground, the signposting that is.

I noticed Police at the large roundabout quite a way out of Sheffield,

I saw Police outside most of the Pubs and anywhere where you had to

turn right.     I think there was only one right turn though.    There was

loads of coppers outside the ground and on the main roads if you

wanted directions.     They were there if you wanted them.

We all went to a Pub which is off the Middlewood Road.       We walked from

the car along Middlewood Road to a Pub which I think is called Heeleys

Bar.     It was a Tetley Pub.    There was only one room of the Pub open.

We had to go to the back of the Pub to get in,        I think there was

someone on the door.

We got in alright because we went there last year.        They welcomed us

because they seemed to like the Liverpool supporters.

There was possibly 80-100 people in there.        Half were Sheffield people

and the other half were Liverpool supporters.        I was there with the

lads at about 12.30 pm(1230) and left at about 2.30pm (1430). In the

time I was there I had about five pints,        Steve was driving and

       gelt a little unwell so they only had two pints.      On a night out

I would probably drink over ten pints.        Where I can get a drink before

a match, normally a home game, I would drink two-three pints.

There were people coming and going all the time so I cannot say how

much the Liverpool lads had to drink.
SEDDON                GRAHAM    IAN                                        3


At 2.30pn(1430), I left the Pub with the lads and walked towards the

ground along Middlewood Rd, after getting some food from the chippy

which was outside the Pub.     As we were walking along I did not see

anyone drinking from cans.     I did not see anyone on the journey

drinking other than in the Pub.

I did not see any disorder, fighting or drunkenness between our

arrival point and the ground.

We arrived at the Leppings Lane turnstiles at about 2.45pn(1445). I am

not too sure about all the other times I have given but they won't be

feu: out but I think the 2.45pn(1445) time is quite near.

As we approached the outer gates in Leppings Lane I saw two mounted

Police Officers by the outer gates.     I did not see any other Policemen

outside the ground.   I did not see any Stewards.

As we were approaching the Leppings Lane entrance I heard a few

Liverpool supporters asking for "any spares", meaning tickets.

I would say there was about 50-80 people around asking for spare

tickets.   There was just a mass of people in this area.    No orderly

queues.    It was just like being in the ground outside the entrances.

I was in the roadway - Leppings Lane, about (30') away frcm the gates.

I was being pushed from behind, in fact we all were, we were pushing

and being pushed.

I could not see which was my entrance so I just joined the crowd.

The two Police horses were at the metal gates preventing people going

through to the turnstile area.

The Police horses were side on to the gates, they covered both gates.

The Police horses iroved,    I don't know whether they were ridden away

or were pushed away by the pressure of the crowd.     I was inching my

way forward heading towards the turnstiles.     I was now in the area of

 'B' turnstile entrance, between the metal gates and the turnstiles.
SEDDON                 GRAHAM   IAN                                           4


I had no idea what the actual time was but by now I could hear the

sound of the match going on.

Everyone around me by then knew that we had missed the kick off and

they all started pushing a bit more.     We were about the middle of the

area,    I did not find it so bad because I like that atmosphere of a

crowd pushing but people around me were saying it was bad and stop

pushing to everyone.

There were people climbing up on the walls by the turnstiles to get

over and others pulling them up.      I could see 6-7 people climbing

up or who had climbed up.    The time was now about 3.02pm (1502).

The next thing I knew was the two wooden gates to my left by the

turnstiles got opened.    I don't know who opened them.     I was about

twelve feet away from the turnstiles.     All I could see was a sea of

heads and the gates being opened above the heads.

The opening of the gates let off a lot of pressure.       There was

suddenly an easing of the pressure.

One of my mates said Let's go through the turnstiles       but when we

got nearer the turnstiles I noticed that the turnstiles did not seem

to be moving.    We said "Sod it, we'll go in through the gates".        It

looked like a train of people going through.

I did not notice any Police on the gateway when I went through,          It

was still like a snake of people going through the gateway.       We all

followed each other.     We went through the gate and turned right

through the gap and entrance in the wall and we found ourselves back in

the area where we would have been if we had gone through the

turnstiles.

I did not notice any signposting for the area I was supposed to go

in.     I did not actually know the area I was supposed to go in.

I don't know why I did not go to the left when I came through the open
SEDDON                  GRAHAM   IAN                                             5


gates.     I just went with the crowd.    There was a programme seller in a

box somewhere in the area by the turnstiles inside the ground.

One of my mates wanted a programme so he broke off from the crowd.          At

this point you could see through the tunnel where everyone was going

through and I could see the match going on.       There was too many people

around the programme seller so I said, "Sod it, let's go and see the

match."    There was a lot of people in this area.

I do not know if any other gates were open and I did not know if

people were coming in through the turnstiles.       It was chocka in there

with people.

Everybody was going through the tunnel.       We just saw the tunnel and

went in.     I had not looked at my ticket which I did not hand in to

know where to go.     I have given my ticket to Steve PITT.    I don't know

if he has still got it.

We all went to the toilet which is on the left of the tunnel entrance.

All this took a few minutes. We then went straight down the tunnel.

There was no Policeman or Steward at the entrance to the tunnel.

We were able to walk down the tunnel quite freely until we came to the

end and we reached the terracing.        We were all walking quite quickly,

the tunnel slopes away near the end towards the terracing and we found

ourselves going a little quicker.        All of my mates and me were still

together.     At the end of the tunnel we were blocked by a wall of

people.

I could not see the separating fence at this time.        I just followed

everyone else and went to the right into Pen 3.        From people I

have talked to since the snake of people simply pushed their way in

straight down the terracing by the side of the fence.

Just as we reached the back of the crowd we noticed a bloke with a

young child.     I don't know if it was a lad or a girl coming out.     The
SEDDON                  GRAHAM   IAN                                          6


child was crying.     The child was about 8 or 9yrs old.    We

stopped to let them out.    We then pushed our way into the crowd to

the right, there were still people rushing in down the tunnel to get

a view behind us.     I felt people pushing me as I struggled to get in

through the crovxl.

In the Today Newspaper, dated Monday April 17th 1989 (170489), Centre

page photograph, I can be clearly seen with                ind Stephen PITT

in my position where I ended up, pushed my way to the right about

10-12 yards away from the tunnel entrance/exit.

That was the position we were hapjpy with to stay and watch the game.

The terracing is so shallow at Hillsborough you can hardly see the far

end of the ground.

We were standing there for a couple of minutes and I noticed people

were climbing over the fences to the front of the ground onto the

pitch. I never noticed what was going on around me except to the

front. The next thing I remember was a Policeman standing on the fence

behind the goal shouting "Get Back, Get back."

There was a couple more on the pitch as can be seen from the

photograph in the newspaper.      I was shouting at the Policeman, "Get

back where, there's nowhere to go."

We had no idea that people were hurt or dying.       The area where I was

standing was quite comfortable.        You could not move back although

there was no pushing.

There was a lot of people behind the Liverpool goal end as Liverpool

was playing away from us towards the Nottingham Forest end.

I saw a Policeman run onto the pitch, speak to the referee and get the

game stopped.

The players left the pitch.

After a couple more minutes people started going onto the pitch.          I
SEDDON                 GRAHAM    IAN                                            7


did not know why the game had been stopped.

As more people went onto the pitch the area where I was standing

became more free to move about.         The people were climbing over the

front fence.     I did not see if the gate in the front fencing was

open at this stage.

Me mate              «ient down the terracing towards the goal to see what

was going on.    Then he came back and called me down to the bottom of

the terracing.

The first thing I saw was the broken crash barrier.           It was bent, it

just looked like rubber.     It was near enough on the deck.       The strange

thing about that was that there was no bodies under the barrier.

I then saw a mass of bodies ten feet frcm the wall.           To me it looked

as if the bodies were all the way across the pen, about five deep.

The height of the bodies started about my knees where I was standing

and went up to my waist at the front of the pen.

I thought they were all dead because the colour of all the people were

ghostly white with dark blue lips.         I cried for a few seconds.

I shouted they are all dead.      There were a few other people around me

looking as well.

I saw a girl on the right hand side about sixteen years of age.        She

was lying in a channel right next to the front wall.      She was lying on

the bottom of the pile with only her head and shoulders free.

I asked her if she was alright.       She said, Yeah, yeah, but I just

can't feel ray legs.   She did not look shocked, she looked

comfortable. She was lying on her front and could not see what had

happened.

The next thing I noticed was a lad about 16 yrs.      He was very

pale.    He was a couple of feet above the girl.    He had just his chest

and head free.    I cannot describe him at all.    He was not really

conscious he had sick in his mouth and his head was shaking about.           I

kept his head up and talked to him for about a minute,       a bloke came,

either a copper or St Johns ambulanceman.       I told them "This bloke's

in a bad way but he's still alive".       I tried freeing him but he would

not move.    He was under about four bodies.     I left him then.

I noticed the peqple that were alive were freeing themselves frcm the

top of the pile and getting out either through the little gate at the

front of the terracing which I now noticed was open, or back up the

terracing.    When I say the top it was at the back of the pile by ray

knees or at the top by the fence.

I noticed that the Police started dragging bodies through the gate

with other fans.    I also saw a couple of Policemen had cone in through

the back with sane St Johns ambulance brigade men.

They were getting bodies off the pile as well.

The first couple of people I pulled off the pile was to the right up

against the fenceing.    That's the fencing separating pens one, two
SEDDON                  GRAHAM   IAN                                        9


and three.    The first one I took hold of was with            We carried

the body just slightly further up the terracing.      I knew they were

dead by the colour they looked as though they had been dead for a week.

I have not seen a dead body before.

The only thing I can remember was that the first three people we moved

were all big men.    They were entangled at the top of the pile.     We had

to struggle to unfree them.

I know one of the men had a moustache, maybe two, two of the men

looked like brothers.     They were in their thirties,     I cannot remember

the clothing or hair colour.      I think they had jeans on.    Everyone

seemed to have jeans on.

The first man I moved was a big man that's all I can remember, all

the three men seemed maybe as if they were mates.        They seemed to have

big bellies, beer guts.     The fellow with the moustache looked a big

hard man with a look of fear on his face.     We moved them all slightly

up the terracing.    There were others trying to help around me, pulling

bodies off.

The next thing we did was to get other bodies and pass them over the

fencing separating pen (3) three with one and two.        On the instruction

of a Policeman and other people there.      There was about six or seven

people needed to lift one body that's how heavy they were.

The first body I have tried to move was on the top of the pile.        I was

pulling his arms.    He was not trapped by anybody but he was so heavy,

I could hardly move him.     I was putting a lot of effort into it.

For the next 40 minutes I was moving bodies frcm the pile.        I remember

moving only one girl with others over that middle fence.        She was

wearing jeans.    I cannot remember anything else about her.

All the other bodies I moved, I don't know how many, were men - no

more girls or young kids. Some I passed through the small gateway to

two Police Officers onto the pitch.     I then ended up on the pitch.

As far as I can remember there were no more bodies in Pen (3).       I

had tried to find a pulse on one man, one of the ones left on the

terrace.    I tried to hit his heart but I did not know what I was

doing.     I could not find a pulse so I stopped.    I did not bother to

try anymore pulses.

I stopped two Liverpool supporters by the halfway line frcm going at

two Policemen.    They were shouting at the Policemen, "It's all your

fault".     I was trying to explain that it was not their fault but to

blame the Chief of Police."

I managed to calm them down.

I understood their feelings because it was my first reaction when I

first saw the bodies and a Policeman who had cone in through the back

onto the terracing.     The reason I stopped myself was because of the

reaction of the Police.     They were trying to help with the bodies,

they were crying.

Because the Nottingham Forest supporters did not know what was going

on they were jeering the Liverpool Fans who were on the pitch.       This

caused the Liverpool fans to get very angry.        The fans were just in

pockets on the pitch, ones and twos.     I went to several and calmed

them down.     They were very angry because they thought the Forest Fans

were jeering the dead.

I kept telling them they cannot know or they would not do that.

There was a cordon of Policemen across the pitch or just forming at

that time.

I left the ground when I knew the match had been abandoned.        I heard

it over the loudspeaker.     I went back with my mates to Nesw Brighton.

I could not believe all that had happened so quickly from the time we

got in the ground to the time I saw the bodies.        There was nothing

anybody could have done they must have died very quickly.

My views on the way the incident was handled after the match was

stopped was that there did not seem to be anyone in charge or

organising the Police.   I went up to about five or six Policemen and

saying come here help lift these bodies.    They all came and helped but

they were not organised themselves.   I never saw a steward in the

whole game.

I also think that somewhere, someone should have given messages out on

the tannoys to say what was happening.     There was enough time for

someone to run to the Police Control box and give that information out.

I went to the game last year, same ground, same teams, the biggest

difference was that it was much easier to get into the ground, last

year there was less people at the turnstiles last year, but when you

got into the ground, it was still a crush.     People complained last

year and this year that Liverpool should have had the Kop End of the

ground.   Liverpool FC complained to the Chief of Police about the end

of the ground given to Liverpool, or it might have been the FA but I

blame whoever gave us that end, I do not think this tragedy would

have happened if we had been given the other end.

I wanted to go into the pens 3/4 last year but I was not

allowed to.   Stewards told us to get to pens 1 and 2 and I went.

There were stewards at the entrance to the tunnel last year.

The Policing this year compared to last year seemed to be

concentrating on the Streets, the shops and the Pubs compared to last

year when they seemed to be more around the ground.

The gates that were opened next to the turnstiles was a fair decision

to ease the crush but the gates in the wall allowing us into the area

by the tunnel entrance should have been shut so half the crowd could

have filtered through to no 6 pen.

       If fences are put up to segregate fans, heme and away supporters, they

       should be taken down and one Club has the whole end in big games.     If

       the segregating fences had not been there then even though the fans

       all went down the tunnel the fans could have spread along the whole of

       the Leppings Lane terracing and the tragedy could have been avoided.

       Orderly queues should be formed at all times outside turnstiles just

       as we do at Anfield.     The reason I phoned the Police hotline in the

       first place was because of contents I heard on the television from a

       Policeman - Federation person, South Yorkshire Police, and the Sun

       newspaper.     They talked about looting, drunken fans attacking Police

       and urinating on Police.

       I saw a lad picking money up what he had dropped and I picked my

       jumper up which had fallen from my waist.     I was one of the last off

       the terrace, it was littered with money, a couple of watches and

       other things.     If someone had dared to pick up any of that, they would

       not have walked out alive. Urinating on Police, I had urine all over me

       but that was off dead bodies, there's no way anyone in Pen 3 or 4

       could have urinated on anybody.

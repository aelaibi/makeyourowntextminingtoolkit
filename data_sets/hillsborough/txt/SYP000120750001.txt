            officers         were         transported           to H i l l s b o r o u g h          Football        Ground where                we

            were     briefed about                the       forthcoming             event.

            After     the       briefing          and       a m ea l     myself          and    the     rest      of the           s e r i a l No.

            The     serial       supervised             by A c t i n g        PS S895          Thomas       and     Insp.          iiillett was

            We    took     up    our       position          directly          outside          a    row    of    shops        not       far    from

            already        a number          of    Liverpool             fans w a n d e r i n g        about,        some          making

            their     way       to    the    ground,          others          walking          in    completely              the    opposite

            direction.               We    were    asked        by q u i t e        a    number       of t h e s e f a n s    where             the

Road      and     under           Wadsley          Bridge.         By     this         time       the    number          of. s u p p o r t e r s

on P e n i s t o n e      Road          had       increased        quite          considerably.                    I noticed             that

quite      a majority               of       th e y o u n g e r    fans       were          carrying          cans       and      bottles           of

beer,      t*he R e q u e s t s          for       open     pubs/off          licences             also       g r ew.

The    steady           stream          of    fans       continued           to g r o w       until          at    about         S . 15 pm

(1415)       a    large           group       of    supporters            came         down Penistone                  Road       escorted

by o f f i c e r s       both       on       foot       and mounted.               Most       of    these fans              were         in

very      high         spirits,shouting                  and      chanting         and        running             about.               A number

of    these       fans        were           also       carrying        p a c k s of    beer,           drinking            it        as t h e y

w a lke d a few           spraying                it o v e r     other       membes          of    their          ’g r o u p '          After

this      group,         the       number          of    f ans    travelling                along       Penistone             Road       never

really       decreased              the       majority           heading          towards          the       ground,          but       quite       a

few w al kin g           against             the     flow      asking        "any       spares          lads."           "Any         spares."

As    time       went     pa st         the       general        demeanour             of    the    crowd          became         more

excitable           and       a    number          of    the     fans     were         running          or    jogging            I was

constantly              telling          them       to    slow     d o w n as          some w ere            falling          over        in

their      haste         to       get    to       the    ground.

At a b o u t      2.40        pm we w e r e             approached           by    our S e r i a l           Sergeant            who     was       in

possession              of a       personal             radio,     he     told         us    that       it s o u n d e d         like        there

was    fighting           in the             ground.

I began          to m a k e        my way          towards        the     ground            with    the       rest       of      my     serial

ground APS             Thomas           informed          us     that     there         was       some       sor t     of     trouble          at

       man    arrived          at     the      same          time    with a                resuscitating                machine,             myself          and

       PC    Olney       and       the    ambulance                man    carried                the    youth       through             the       g ate a n d

       he w a s        placed       on a s t r e t c h e r           and       into          the a m b u l a n c e .           By       this       time

       there       were       four       or    five          bodies       lying             alongside          the a m b u l a n c e              dead.

       I went          back    through             the       gate.        Myself             a n d PC        Olney       then       carried

       another          unconscious                male       to a n o t h e r             ambulance          with       the       help       of    some

       of    the       civilian          supporters.

       I cannot          remember             much       detail          about             what    I did after                this          time,       it       is

      a     bit    of a       blur.           I do       remember             carrying             quite       a number             of       injured

       people          form     the      back       of       the    stand and                the       tunnel       mouth          down       through

       the    gate       and       either          placing          them       in a m b u l a n c e s          or a l o n g s i d e           the wall

       of    the       enclosure          which          had       become          a       collecting          a r e a as          there          was       not

       enough ambulances                      to    carry          the    injured                straight          to    hospital.                 During

       this       I assisted             w i t h PC          Olney       to    carry             a man       from       underneath                the       s t ep s

       of    the       stand       who    was       complaining                of          some    s ort      of    b ack      injury.              He       was

       placed          onto    a    stretcher                and    straight                into a n a m b u l a n c e .                Whilst          I

      was     carrying             these       injured             peoople             to    the       ambulances             I was         aware           of

       some       of    the    fans       shouting             abuse          at       the       Police,       in f a c t          as       1 was
  helping       to    carry an          injured          man    one      of    the       fans      grabbed          hold     of m y

 arm and        tried       to    drag       me    away       from     him.         He    said      "Leave          h im alone,

 y o u ’ve    d€ne       enough        damage       opening          that      fucking          gate."           One      young     man

  I saw      Vying       on- his       stomach          with another               fan wit h        him       I turned        him

  onto    his      back    as     he    was       not    breathing            myself         and    t hat       f an then         tried

  to   resuscitate             him,     without          any    success            an a m b u l a n c e       man and        two

  other      fans     carried          him    to    the       ambulance            are a .

  When    all      the     dead       and    injured          had    been      r e m o v e d we      formed a             lijie to

  direct      the     rest       of    the    supporters             from      the       stand.          A    lot    of     the    fans

  coming      down       the     steps       from       the    stand were             very      hostile,            shouting        and

  swearing         I heard        the       comment       or    comments            similar         to       "The L i v e r p o o l

  fans    will       get    the       blame       for    this,       t h e y ’ re     blamed        for       everything"           more

  than    once.

  After      all     the    supporters             had    left       the      g r o u n d we       went       back     to    the

  North Stand            for a        de-brief,          then       to C l a y w h e e l s      Lane         garage       from     there

  we   were     transported             back       to D o n c a s t e r       to    go    off      d u t y at 8 . 0 0        pm    (2000)

I BRIAN RIDGE        of                                                                                     will

                                          T~ have     always       been       a       Sheffield         Wednesday

supporter.       I   first    became      employed      by   the     Club         through        our-

          who was then Chief Steward on the West Stand.                                 I started working

for the club as a stairs            and main gangway steward.                          I have worked on B

Gate for about the last five years.                    I have not always worked on B Gate

                                                     as they joined later.                    However, since

I have joined we have always worked                    together.          I have always worked                   on

the West Stand except when I have been asked to work as a steward on the

Kop on a couple of occasions.                I have also once worked a turnstile.




At the start of each season there                    is an annual meeting of                      the    stewards

and gatemen and talks were given on all emergency procedures, on the type

 of fire extinguishers available                and how to use those fire extinguishers,

 and the code for an emergency evacuation.                      These         talks are given by the

 police and the fire brigade.                We also receive a talk about                         the club and

 about security matters from Doug Lock.                      We are told what to do during an

 emergency.      If we       hear   the      coded    message      we    must          go   to    our     stations

 immediately-.       My   station      is,    of     course,    at      the       B    Gate      which    must   be

 opened and manned until further instructions are received.




                                                                        signed

We   are   also    shown    a video          of   the       Bradford      City    Fire    Disaster.            The

meetings were not compulsory but nearly everybody attends.                                       The meeting

is also considered to be a social event and an opportunity to sign on and

obtain     our    ID    passes    for    the      season.          For     this    purpose       I   take      two

passport photographs along-to the meeting and am issued with my ID pass.

I am also given a booklet of match receipts                              for the season. .. Printed in

the back are the match day instructions which are issued to all stewards

and gatemen.           The duties       of gatemen are             to man the gates at all               times.

Only   police      and    club    officials        are          allowed    through       the    gates.         All

supporters must          enter the ground through                  the    turnstile.           The duty of       a

gateman is to open the gates in an emergency,                              to open the gates shortly

before     the    final    whistle,       and     to    open       the    gates   when     police     or    Club

officials wish to gain entrance to the ground.




 Two men are allocated to Gate B.                       For       this    season the B Gate men have




 On a normal match day I will arrive at the ground at about 1.00-1.15 pm.

 I enter the ground through one of the gates if it has aleady been opened.

 If the gates are not opened when I arrive I enter the ground through the

 office.     I report to Stuart Thorpe or to Albert Marsh at the end of the

 West Stand by the refreshment area.                            I hand in a signed receipt and                   in

 return receive my stewards' vest.                          I then go down to my position by the

 gate.     When I arrive the gates are unlocked.                           The gatemen do not have the

 keys.      The    gates    are   of     a    large     concertina         type     construction         and    are




                                                                           signed

double doors and a small window set in one of the doors permits us to see

the immediate area outside                 the ground.       I would point out however                        that

the view is restricted.                The idea of the window is simply so that anyone

wishing to come in through the gates can easily be identified.                                     The gates

can be locked at the centre and just opened back a little way in order to

let one or two people through.                 Normally we do not open the gates all the

way in order        to let people          through.        I should emphasise              that    the gates

are not being opened and closed all the time.                            We simply open the gates

for people        shewing      their    identification,          the police     or     catering          staff.

The gate remains shut and manned throughout the whole of the match.                                             We

operate      a   rota    system whereby        one    of    us    will    remain     at     the        gate    for

fifteen minutes while the other two watch the match.                             We take it in turn

to man the gate but we are all back at the gate at half-time.                                     We operate

the same         system during       the    second half.          I always      take       the    last    turn.

This    goes     back    to   the   days when we          were    issued with keys               and    I would

 return the keys to the office.                 In those days I did not have to lock the

 gate at the end of the match but I would unlock it when I arrived.                                              At

 the end of the match the gates are opened and we wait until the fans have

 dispersed.        Sometimes all three of us will man the gate at this stage but

 sometimes only one or              two of us,       depending if somebody has                    to get home

 urgently.        However there is always someone manning the gate.                                From about

 4.35   pm       onwards      the   weekly    pay    would       be   distributed.           Albert           Marsh

 usually     pays- the        gatemen.       I hand my       vest     back when        I    get    paid.         We

 generally        take   it    in turns      to go    up    to    the West    Stand         to    collect       our

      x now    turn to ^          involvement       in the      events which occurred on                     the    15th


      April 1989 at Hillsborough.



      I arrived at the ground at approximately 10.50 am and walked around

early.    Albert did not have the keys to open the gate.




The police alio have keys for B Gate.                   I understand that-the keys in fact

fit    C Gate     also.     I    saw    a   police    officer    who    is   one   of   our   regular

policemen.        He is known as Captain Birds Eye although I do not know his

real name.        He unlocked the gate.              I then saw the chief programme seller

who was waiting outside the gate and opened the gate to let his van in.

He unloaded his programmes and then drove out.                          I shut the gates again.

At around       11.00 a m |                     [arrived.       They went up        to sign    on and

when they came down at about 11.00 am I went up and signed on.




At about        11-30 am the police briefing                took place.      The policeman who        I

 know as Captain Birds Eye spoke to us about the type of crowd to expect.

 We were    told that if there was              any trouble whatsoever we were                to go   to

 the police and we were not to get involved in scuffles.                           He showed us the

 different types of tickets which were in use but I did not take too much

 notice of this because, as a gateman, I do not take tickets in any event.

 The     talk    followed       the    format   of   last    year's     briefing.       The   briefing

 lasted about five to ten minutes.                     I think that the police officers had


  already been briefed.




  We then returned to B Gate.                The stiles opened at about 12 noon or a few

  minutes       eaVli'er.     Everything proceeded normally and we were                   involved      in

  opening and closing the gate to allow the police through.




                                                                       signed

At 2.15 pm I remarked to                                       that we were doing a normal               job.

Everything      appeared     to   be very         normal.          At     that    time    supporters     were

coming in and they were all being frisked by the police who were standing

along by the turnstiles.                 We have a very limited view outside the ground

and   could     not    see   very    much        and    could       therefore       not    see   the    crowd

building    up.       However,      at    this    time       it    did    not    seem very much        like    a

Semi-Final      since    there were        so    few people             coming   into     the seated    area.

The police were checking inside handbags                           and frisking fans as          they came

through the turnstile.




From about 2.15 pm onwards the crowd waiting to go into the standing area

began to build up.           We could see the crowds through the window in B Gate.

They were queuing for the standing area,                          turnstiles A-G.




The crowd were quite good natured at this stage.                                 Some of the fans were

banging on the gate as              they queued          for      the    turnstiles but      they were        in

good humour.          I remember that many of the supporters were singing.




Towards 2.30 pm the crowd was building up considerably.                                    I should stress

however that my view through the gate was very limited.                                   By about 2.50 pm

 the supporters started to climb onto                        the perimeter wall by the corner of

 stile    16.     I remember        that    they       passed      down     a coping      stone which         was

 loose.     They passed       it down to prevent                  it     from falling onto       somebody's

head.      It   is quite      possible       that       they had         loosened     it by climbing          up.

There was also an iron balustrade which was                              fractured.       I do not know if




                                                                           signed
                                                    -7-




that was done at the time but I remember that that was passed down also.

There was      a big burly         policeman      telling       them    to   come    down.      He was       a

fairly regular policeman w h o m I recognised.                         However      I do not know his


name.




The fans on the turnstiles were telling the policeman that people outside

were starting to get crushed.                   The next thing I remember is seeing a high

ranking policeman and a WPC helping the fans to get down.




There were no police allocated specifically to our gate but they were not

really needed.         In fact they would have been in the way.                           However,     there

were plenty of policemen around should we have needed their assistance.

The policemen did not              seem    to be    our    regular       policemen       although      I did

recognise a couple as I have said.                   Some of our regular policemen we know

by Christian names.




At about 2.55 p m _ the police              ordered B Gate             to be    opened.       I cannot be

 exact about this time because I did not have my watch on and it may have

 been a little        later.       I remember       that a police            constable with        a ginger

moustache ordered the gate to be opened.                        He said that he had orders from

 his superiors.            I told h i m that there was no way that we would open the

 gate    because      we    knew   that     there    was    a   lot     of     people    outside      without

 tickets.       I knew that there were many without tickets because one of our

 jobs    is    to prevent      people      from passing         tickets      under      the   doors    of    the

 gate.        Those   coming over         and    through   the    turnstiles were             trying    to    do




                                                                        signed

that.      Fr om that we guessed that there must have been many people without


tickets.




The crowd was beginning to get very angry outside.                                 They were not being

particularly violent^ but were                       jostling    and    shoving.     We   had     seen    this

before at many big matches                     and    it is those with no tickets who                tend     to

cause the trouble.                I also noticed that many had been drinking.




The policeman told us that he had been ordered over the radio                                      to open A

Gates.          We      were     still   not    happy    with     the   situation    and     he    therefore

opened the gates.                 Once he had opened them we pulled them back in order

to get out of the way.                   We knew what to expect but this was really just a

matter of coramon-sense.                  I had never been asked to open these gates                          for

these reasons in the past.                     I did not know whether Gate C had been opened

 or not at that stage.




 As soon as the gates were                     opened the supporters rushed into                  the ground.

 I estimate that there must have been about 200-250 people rushing through

 the gates.              Some lost their shoes in the mad rush to get in.                           After     the

 game I managed to collect three pairs of shoes and about five odd ones.




 Once      the         gates    were   opened    we    left     them open.     At    about      3.05     pm   the

 s u p p o r t e r s    started coming back out of the ground saying that people were

 dying inside.                 We were advised by police officers to remove our stewards’

 vests but             to keep on our          ID.    We were     getting    a lot    of abuse         from    the




                                                                          signed

supporters.            [and      I therefore went         into the programme sellers’ cabin

by the turnstiles to             gather our wits.          We took off our vests.               We could

see,    at this point,           that many    of    the fans     had been drinking.              We    then

began to see injured             fans   lying outside Gate B waiting for an                     ambulance

to arrive.      At that point I walked back to see what was going on.                                 I saw

the ambulances and the fire brigade.                      I did not know what was happening

inside    the   ground      except      that people were         getting crushed. ..        X did not

know how many.         At about 3.10 pm a fireman came through the gate carrying

bottles of oxygen.            These bottles were black and white.                    Someone asked me

where    they could        get   a glass     of water.        At      this point       it was    becoming

very difficult        to get into          the toilets     to get water.             I had a flask of

coffee with me so I gave the supporter a cup of coffee.                                 He was       looking


very shocked.




We stayed by         the perimeter wall waiting              to see what was happening.                     We

 kept    seeing      the    firemen       coming   in.      At     this      point     supporters       were

 beginning      to   leave.       We    did not hear       any     announcements        being    made       but

 there    was   a    lot    of    noise    going    on.      Supporters         were    being    verbally

 abusive.       We were not        threatened physically              to any extent       and we       could

 handle those threats we did receive.




 There was      a    police      control    box    situated      in    the   compound     and    I    saw    an

 older WPC treating somebody for shock.                     I could see her from where I was

 standing.        At some point Stuart Thorpe came through and told us that we

 should be careful not to become involved with the fans.                                We stayed where




                                                                       signed
                                                      -   10   -




we    were     until    about    4.15       pm   at       which      time    there    were   a' lot     of   fans

leaving.        I stayed on for a while.                       Stuart Thorpe then came and told us

to go home and confirmed that we would be paid at the next match.                                        I left


at about 4.45 pm.




I must       point     out    that     at   no   time was            there    any    liaison    or    discussion

between ourselves and the police as to whether the gates should be opened

other than our initial refusal.                       We are told to follow police orders as a

matter of policy.              The police told us to open the gate but at no time did

they instruct us              to direct      people.               I believe    that even      if we had had

those instructions             the supporters would not have                         taken any notice.         We

 certainly did not want                to open the gate but were obliged                        to    follow   the

 police instructions.




 At last year's          Semi-Final         we   encountered no              real problems.           The police

 had been keeping those without                       tickets away from the ground.                    This year

 that did not seem to happen.                    There was a great number of people without


 tickets.




 As a matter of              general    practice we                direct people      only who       specifically

 ask us to tell them where something is, for example where the toilets are

 located and where programmes                    can be bought.                We    sometimes       point people

     coming through the turnstiles in the general direction of the steps up to

     the   stand.      However,      we     are not        involved         in directing       the   flow of    the


     crow d.

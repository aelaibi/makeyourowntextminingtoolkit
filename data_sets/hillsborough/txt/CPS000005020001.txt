          Hillsborough


          I mentioned the other day that the Home Secretary had received
          a petition from the Hillsborough Family Support Group calling
          for the Director to reconsider his decision not to prosecute
          individuals or organisations in the light of their role in the
          Hillsborough stadium disaster.  It also requests an
          investigation of that decision.

          The Attorney General has replied setting out the          manner     in
          which the case was approached   and saying that he        is in
 ^        agreement with the decision.   I enclose herewith         a copy of his
          letter.   I am also forwarding  (in two Rank Xerox        boxes) the
          petition. *6

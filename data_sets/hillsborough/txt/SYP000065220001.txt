                went       together.          They     always      joined the coach at Leicester.

                At a number             of football       m atches       I have         seen the two broth er s             in the

cost     £6.00.            I sat on the            coach,     it was a single                decked vehicle.              I

sat about           halfway down on the offside                         of the        coach which a p p e a r e d         full

I think about               eight        people       including myself              boarded the         coach at

Leicester.               As far as         I can remember              the    two Hewitt           brothers    sat    down

on the       coach but             1 cant       remember where.

I cant, rein'ernber the                  coach stopping           before we got to Sheffield,                    but          its

W hen we got, near to the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football                             ground we were stopped

and spoke           to by the Police who were                      i nterested           in if we had any

alcohol           and making            sure    that M/e all       had tickets              for    the match.

The    coach was            then        parked     in a side street where a number                         of other

coaches were               parked,        it was about          ten minu t e s walk                 from the ground I

dont     remember           seeing        the Hewitt        brothers          get     off    the    coach.

There were               police     officers          in the vicinity           of the         coaches.       I walked

up to the ground on my own during                               the walk        I was asked a number                 of

t imas     by other          supporters            i•(•' I had a spare              t ic k e t .

ye a r r i v e d at         the     coach         park at about 2.0 0 pm and                      I arri v e d at the

Leppings           Lane     turnstile           of about 2.1 5          pm.

During       the walk             I didnt         see any drunken or violent                       behaviour    I also

saw a number               of Police           st a t i o n e d along    the    route.

There were               orderly queues at the Turnstiles,                            there         was also anumber

               of supporters who were                 just    hanging about           in the vicinity.

               I was     searched by the Police at                 the    turnstile and           I handed my ticket

               to the t u r nsts i1e ope rat o r .

               I saw a number            of   police    officers       the other        side of the        turnstiles

               just     inside        the ground,      there    seemed to be one or two outside                    every

               t u rn s t i 1 e .

               I a t t e n d e d the similar game last year,                    when    I watc h e d the game       from
    o,                        -
               pen three behind the goal mouth.

               I di d nt not ice a ny s t e wards             only programme           sellers     inside    the ground.

               I walked        to the tunnel          entrance     in the West          stand.      I didnt    notice any

               police      or stewards at            the entrance        to the       tunnel,,

               I made my way aIong              the    tunnel w ith ease.              However,     when    I got to the

               end the        tunnel     exit was      b locked    I made my way through and saw that                         the

               centre      of the terracing was               crowded     I think       it was about £.30          pm then.

               I jii d nt se e a ny police            or stewards        in the       tunnel     at the end or      in the

    V   cy 1 decided not to w atch                    the game     from the       centre terracing           because      of
        f\°"   the overcrowding.               Because       I a t t e n d e d the similar match           last year      I
*   0
               knew     I could get through to the side terraci ng to my                              right whi ch I

               could see was            relatively      empty.      I made my way across              the    back of the

               terracing            in pen three with diffi c u l t y because                of the    o v e r crowding       I

               then went         through the         entrance     into    pens one and two.

               across      from Liverpool            to the West       stand end of the ground but                 1 didnt

               s e e t h & fn.

               I stood n e a r         t h e Police € o n t r o 3. Bo a n ear    to      the     end of the stand.

               I didnt        take     any notice     until    after     the game started at 3 .00 p m .

               I s u d d e n 1y n o t i c e cl people     climbing       over the        centre     fencing f rom     pen

               three     to      pen two.     I saw other       people     trying       to   climb over      the

               perimeter            fencing   from    pen three     onto the          pitch.      At fist    I just
                                                                                                      S948

thought       there had been some               trouble        in the    pen it was only          later   I

r ealised        the true      content       of what      had occurred.          I didnt    see anyone

drinking         inside    the ground.            I didnt       see any

drunken       or violent,         disor d e r l y      behaviour       1 didnt    see any    criminal

offences.          I remained where             I was     until       4»30    pm o r thereabouts      when      I

left     the g o r u nd and       I walked        back to the          coach.

E v e n t u a 1 1y all    the other        passengers          returned to the          coach w ith the

e c e p t io n o f two who          I now know to be the Hewitt                   brothers Carl       and

N i cholas.

We stayed waiting              until      after 6.0 0         pm when the Police          told us to go

and that         they would       look after           the two    lads       if they turned up.

I had     left     the ground about             ten or fifteen minutes after                 the    tannoy

announcement          requesting          the   supporters        to    remain where they were            to

a s s i s t t h b e m e r g e n cy v e h i c 1 e s «

I dicint assist anyone who was                      dead or      injured       I saw first aid       being

c arried out on the              persons who were              carried onto       the    pitch.

I didnt       see a barrier           break     in pen three.

I wasnt       injured at the match.                    I remember       that when Peter B e a r d s l e y

hit    the N o t t ingham Forest             cross      bar    that    there was a surge          forward      by

the    crowd      in pen three.            I dont       remember       if they    recovered their

original         position following             the     surge.

I w ould      like to say that             it a p p e a r e d a long time         before any ambu l a n c e s

ar r ived.Also        I cant      unde rstand why             there    hadnt    been a tannoy

a n n o u n c e m e n t about what was          going     on w hich w ould have a s s i s t e d the

c rowd.

T here was        plenty of        room    in pen two where             I was    standing when the

iiiat c h k i c k e d off.

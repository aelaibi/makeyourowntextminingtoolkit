REQUEST FOR BRE TO GIVE EVIDENCE TO THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY   \JJ


Thank you for your minute of 31 May, which I have discussed with
Mr McDonald.


It does not seem that fire played any part in the Hillsborough
disaster and I would not have thought that there was any point in
your offering evidence   to this   Inquiry based on previous   fire
disasters.


On the other hand it might be helpful to Lord Justice Taylor if
you were willing to offer to help with the assessment of evidence
submitted by others on matters in which the BRE has expertise. If
you feel able to do so, I suggest that you reply accordingly to
the Secretary to the Inquiry.

REQUEST FOR BRE TO GIVE EVIDENCE TO THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

You will see from the attached that BRE has a formal request to submit
evidence to the Hillsborough Inquiry (attached).

The position is that although Mr Courtney did offer BRE assistance
(his letter of 18 May was copied to you both) we have no formal evidence
about this particular disaster. However, we could offer evidence from
previous fire disasters.

In his absence Mr Courtney asks whether you have advice and/or guidance
on how to respond to this type of request in these circumstances.

Dear Mr Courtney


HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

As you may know, the Home Secretary has asked Lord Justice Taylor
to enquire into the events at Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April
1989 in which 95 people lost their lives and many were injured.
Lord Justice Taylor is being assisted by two Assessors, Mr Brian
Johnson QPM, Chief Constable of Lancashire, and Professor Leonard
Maunder OBE, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the
University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

Lord Justice Taylor's terms of reference are as follows:-

     "To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday
     Football Ground on 15 April 1989 and to make
     recommendations about the needs of crowd control and
     safety at sports grounds."

The first stage of the Inquiry consists of oral hearings in
Sheffield, which began on 15 May.   In the second stage, Lord
Justice Taylor proposes to consider any written submissions which
may be put to him. As you may know, Lord Justice Taylor has
already issued a general invitation for written submissions, but
I am now writing to you specifically on his behalf to ask if you
would like to submit written material to his Inquiry. Perhaps
you would be kind enough to acknowledge this letter (to the
address above) and indicate whether you intend to respond to Lord
Justice Taylor's invitation. He would find it convenient if any
written submissions could reach him by 12 June if possible:
perhaps you could also kindly indicate whether or not you will be
able to meet that timetable.Submissions should likewise    be sent
to me at the Inquiry address above.
It would be helpful if six sets of any written material could be
sent. It would be also be helpful if the material could be
indexed and summarised wherever possible.

Lord Justice Taylor may wish to invite some of those who submit
written evidence to him to discuss it with him at a later stage.

                                        Yours sincerely




                                        R M WHALLEY
                                        Secretary to the Inquiry

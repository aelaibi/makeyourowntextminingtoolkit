    Subject:    THORNTON MPs CASE

    As we discussed. There seems very little to say about the inquest
    proceedings, and I suggest a brief sentence along the following
    lines:

    "So far as the inquest proceedings are concerned the position
    remains as set out by the Attorney-General during the adjournment
    debate on 26 October 1994."

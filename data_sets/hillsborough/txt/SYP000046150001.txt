To solicitors on the record
acting for Bereaved relatives,
and to the Hillsborough Steering Committee.



Dear Sirs,

                         Limited Resumed Inquests - Hillsborough

You will of course be aware that I have decided to resume the Inquests
(on a limited basis) into the deaths of the persons who lost their
lives on 15th April 1989 at Hillsborough.

You will also be aware that the intention is to take the post mortem
evidence together with a summary of the evidence as it relates to
location of the deceased, the time of death as far as it can
reasonably be established and to clear up any minor matters such as
spelling of names.

The basic format for the inquests will be that the evidence will
be presented either by way of documentary evidence eg. post mortem
report or in the case of the summary by presentation by a West
Midlands Police officer.

The evidence will be presented in a non adversarial fashion and is
intended to give to you and in particular your client(s) non
controversial evidence as it relates to each individual deceased
which is available. I am sure that you will appreciate that the
quality and quantity of evidence which it has been possible to obtain
varies from person to person.

It must be clearly understood and it is the basis on which I have
decided to resume the inquests at this stage that no evidence will be
taken nor will questions or comments be permitted which could be
considered as attacking or criticising anybody or person incorporate
or otherwise or which could in any way be construed as obstruction or
compromising the investigation which is still being undertaken by the
DPP and on which to date no conclusion has been reached.

In order to enable you and if you so wish your client(s) to be aware
of the scope of the evidence a copy of the summary will be sent to
you as soon as possible in order to enable you to consider it and in
particular to enable youFclient to be prepared for the evidence.

Although it will not be possible to recast the summaries into a
different format it may that in some case there may be a particular
point which is not clear to you or there may be some question which
your client is particularly anxious about and which is not clearly
dealt with on the summary or the post mortem.

In such a case please let me know the point or question that you wish
to have more information on.  I cannot give any undertaking that
questions submitted can or will be dealt with but provided that the
points or questions fall within the parameter of the resumed inquest

then they will be sympathetically considered and if it is conveniently
possible to deal with them at the hearing it will be done.

It may also be that either you or your clients may be aware of other
witnesses who are not referred to in the summaries. The case files do
not contain every witness statement which has been obtained.
Statements which are thought not to advance the evidence have been
excluded from the files prepared for me.  However if you wish me to
consider any  particular statement which you are aware of and which
is not mentioned in the summary please let me have details so that I
may consider it.

I think that in the majority of the cases it will not be necessary to
call the pathologist to the inquest but there may be a few cases where
a client particularly wishes to hear the pathologist in person. If
that applies to any of your clients please let me know as soon as
possible. I will then consider the evidence in the light of this
request.

I have to make it clear that under no circumstances will any South
Yorkshire Police officer be called to give oral evidence at these
resumed hearings. From my assessment of the files to date I think it
is unlikely that I will be calling any witnesses other than WMP
officers and possibly in a few cases the pathologists to give oral
evidence.

The case files are in the course of being prepared and in order to
give you as much time as possible and also to spread the load over
a period it is proposed to start sending out the summaries towards
the end of this week or the beginning of the next. A consequence of
this is that some families will be aware of the contents of the
summaries before others.  I would be grateful if you would make it
clear to your client(s) particularly if they are the ones whose
summary has not yet been sent out that there is nothing sinister in
this but that it is simply a question of logistics.

I am not yet in a position to let you know when any particular inquest
will take place. I will of course try to let you have as much notice
as possible but I am sure that you will appreciate that this is quite
a complex operation and that you must be prepared for alterations in
listing information even at the last moment. I appreciate the
inconvenience that this may cause and I will try to minimise it but I
fear that it is inevitable.

In this      connection I would be grateful if you would please let my
listing      officer whose address appears on the attached sheet know
whether      you are presently aware of any of your clients who do not
wish to      attend the inquest relating to their loved one.

Please also let my listing officer know whether there are any major
committments of your clients which might make it difficult for them
to attend on any particular dates. Whilst I will try to take such
information into account it may not be possible to meet all wishes
and the final decision on timing and date will be taken by me and my

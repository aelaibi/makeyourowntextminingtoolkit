          CRIMINAL INVOLVEMENT - TURNSTILE OPERATORS -
SUBJECT                                                             DATE      25 october 1989
          HILLSBOROUGH


          As you are aware there are now a number of allegations that are in the system
          from supporters or turnstile operators, to the effect that supporters without
          tickets for the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest Cup Semi Final match obtained
          entrance to Hillsborough Stadium on the 15 April 1989 either by paying the
          turnstile operator, or by throwing money at the operator and running through.
          I am currently investigating a number of such accusation, including action Nos.
                            and      and there are others still in the system.

          Before pursuing these allegations further I would like to draw your attention
          to the contents of the memorandum dated 31 May 1989, from Mr A.P. GREATHEAD,
          Assistant Branch Crown Prosecutor, Crown Prosecution Service at Sheffield, to
          Mr P. HAYES, Deputy Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police, in respect of
                       [ a turnstile operator reported by us for theft in similar
          circumstances to those described above (copy memorandum attached).

          The gist of the memorandum is that although          Admitted receiving and
          retaining £30 from supporters which was either thrown at or paid to him, there
          is no case of theft.  In support of this the memorandum cites the case of
          POWELL v MACRAE (1977) - Criminal Law Review 571, and states "the turnstile
          operator is no more than the recipient of a bribe, by no stretch of language
          could it be said, that the money ’belonged t o ’ the employers".

          Taking it a stage further, the memorandum concludes that while             may have
          committed an offence of bribery against Section 1(1) Prevention ot corruption
          Act 1906, (a) the consent of the Attorney General is required to proceed and
          (b) there would be evidential difficulties in respect of proving such an
          offence.  This and the fact that use of a charge of corruption a g a i n s t _____
          in these circumstances would be extremely heavy, give rise to the Crown
          Prosecution Service decision - No Further Action.

          Having regard to this advice, by Crown Prosecution Service, I would question
          the purpose /practicality of pursuing these and any other similar allegations,
          particularly when one considers the time and cost implications involved and the
          likely outcome.

          In saying this I do accept that allegations by supporters of payments to Police
          Officers for entry to the ground fall into a different category, although on
          the basis of the attached advice we may have some difficulty in instituting
          criminal proceedings against any identified officers.

          Yoi^ decision regarding these matters would be appreciated.

           Mr P Hayes Deputy Chief Consta ble                     Ref.

           Mr A P Greathead ABCP          Tel.                    Ref.


Subject                                                           Date   31 May 1989




          I have considered the file relating to alleged offences committed by
                                Jwas a turnstile operator at the Hillsborough
          football ground on the 15 April 1989, when the Hillsborough disaster
          occurred.

           He is alleged to have stolen the sum of £30, the property of Sheffield
           Wednesday Football Club.              has admitted allowing supporters
           through his turnstile although they were not in possession of tickets.
           The match being played was an all ticket match.      He admitted being
           asked by the supporters if he would accept money to let them into the
           groundbut told them he would not. He also admitted allowing supporters
           through although they had no tickets, but said he did this because of
           the crush outside the ground and those in the turnstile could not go
           backwards.    He denied taking money from anyone but said that the
           supporters threw money at him, and he couldn't do anything about it.
          ________ idmitted keeping 3 x £10 notes thrown at him by the supporters.
           The money was later recovered from his house.   He told the Police that
           he was sick about what happened that afternoon and had been thinking of
           putting the money into the Disaster Fund.

          On all these facts, there clearly is not a case or cases of theft
          committed by              The  authority of Powell-v-MacRae   (1977).
          Crim.L.R.571, a case decided on identical facts states that such a
          turnstile operator was no more than a recipient of a bribe, and by no
          stretch of language could it be said that the money "belonged to" the
          employers.                     —_

          An offence may have been committed against S.I.(l) Prevention of
          Corruption Act 1906, but a prosecution would require the Attorney
          General’s consent.    I do consider however, there may be evidential
          difficulties in respect of such an offence, concerning the words
          ’’accepting or agreeing to accept", as there was no prior agreement
          between          and the football supporters, to accept money as a
          condition of entry.

          I can see no reason to disbelieve the account given by              and
          consider that a charge of corruption would in any event be an extremely
          heavy way of dealing with a case of this particular nature.
As the evidence in respect of a charge of corruption is not in my view
strong enough to support i t , a caution in these circumstances would be
improper.

I would therefore advise no further action, and return your file.

 Dear Mr Jones

                                              SHEFFIELD

 Thank you for your letter dated 24 May 1 9 8 9 , with which you enclosed
 a process file relating to the above named who, as a turnstile
 operator was alleged to have stolen £30.00 the property of Sheffield
 Wednesday Football Club.

 The file, together with your recommendation for caution which I
 endorsed, was forwarded to the Crown Prosecution Service who
 ultimately advised that the available evidence was insufficient to
 support any criminal proceedings. Accordingly |       |has been seen
 and given advice about his future conduct when employed in similar
 circumstances.

 He further stated his wish that the £30.00 cash should be donated to
 the Hillsborough Disaster Fund and signed an appropriate form of
 disclaimer to the money.  I enclose that disclaimer together with a
 copy of the CPS advice for your information.  I understand the cash
 is retained by you at Furnival House and would be obliged if you
 could now release it to the Disaster Fund in accordance with
 wishes.

 Can I take this opportunity, on behalf of Mr Wright, to thank you and
 your officers for the way in which this incident was dealt with.

 Yours sincerely

          ^ haye considered the file relating to alleged offences committed by
          ___________________         was    a turnstile operator at the Hillsborough
          football ground on the 15 April 1 9 8 9 , when the Hillsborough disaster
          occurred.

          He is alleged to have stolen the sum of £30, the property of Sheffield
          Wednesday Football Club. |            |has admitted allowing supporters
          through his turnstile although they were not in possession of tickets.
          The match being played was an all ticket match.       He admitted being
          asked by the supporters if he would accept money to let them into the
          ground but told them he would not. He also admitted allowing supporters
          through although they had no tickets, but said he did this because of
          the crush outside the ground and those in the turnstile could not go
          backwards.     He denied taking money from anyone but said that the
          supporters threw money at him, and he couldn't do anything about it.
                  [admitted keeping 3 x £10 notes thrown at him by the supporters.
          The money was later recovered from his house.    He told the Police that
          he was sick about what happened that afternoon and had been thinking of
          putting the money into the Disaster Fund.

          On all these facts, there clearly is not a case or cases of theft
          committed  by             The  authority of Powell-v-MacRae   (1977).
          Crim.L.R.571, a case decided on identical facts states that such a
          turnstile operator was no more than a recipient of a bribe, and by no
          stretch of language could it be said that the money "belonged to" the
          employers.                     -

          An offence may have been committed against S.1.(1) Prevention of
          Corruption Act 1906, but a prosecution would require the Attorney
          General's consent.    I do consider however, there may be evidential
          difficulties in respect of such an offence, concerning the words
           accepting or agreeing to accept", as there was no prior agreement
          between _______ and the football supporters, to accept money as a
          condition of entry.

          I can see no reason to disbelieve the account given by              and
          consider that a charge of corruption would in any event be an extremely
          heavy way of dealing with a case of this particular nature.
As the evidence in respect of a charge of corruption is not in my view
strong enough to support it, a caution in these circumstances would be
improper.

I would therefore advise no further action, and return your file.

11 May 1989




A decission as to Process Re an offence of theft is requested in respect of the
following person:-


                 Born




Sheffield


       is a turnstile operator at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
Hillsborough.    On Saturday 15 April 1989 the day of the Hillsborough Football
disaster,         [
                  w as employed in his capacity as turnstile operator at
turnstile     |tn Leppings Lane.     Entry to the stadium on that occasion was by
ticket only, however,              accepted £30.00 from people passing through his
turnstile in return for entry to the ground.


Following allegations from Liverpool supporters that they had paid money to
enter the ground on the day in question, officers from the West Midlands Police
interviewed all turnstile operators known to have been working at Hillsborough
Stadium on that day.


       when interviewed by D C s ’                 and          |
                                                                , admitted that he
accepted money in return for entry to the stadium and he had indeed kept that
money following the ensuing disaster.


      1s admission is at variance with reports by Liverpool supporters in that
he claims that money was thrust at him by people who had entered his
turnstile.    Further more he claims that the crush was so great at that time
that he was forced to let them through into the ground although they had not
got tickets, he then kept the money he had accepted.


The interview with          was recorded contemporaneously and a copy of the
interview record is attached.        The £30.00 was recovered and is held by the West
Midlands Police at Furnival House, Sheffield.

I am the Secretary for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

I am aware that a man by the name of ______________is a turnstile operator

for the club and that on Saturday 15 April 1989, when Liverpool were to

play Nottingham Forrest in the F.A. Cup Semi-Final, |__|                                        was employed

in the Leppings Lane turnstiles and accepted £30.00 from Liverpool

supporters in payment to him for them to be let into the ground.

This match was an all ticket match and no one has the right to accept

money from persons in exchange for allowing them to enter the ground.

I am aware that this man has been interviewed by the police and I am

willing to abide by any decision made by the Chief Constable and Crown

Prosecution Service as to the course of action they wish to take on this

matter.

SUBJECT   LOCAL AUTHORITY RESPONSE TO HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER         DATE       14 November 1989




               This report addresses many of the issues raised in A7485 concerning
               the Sheffield Peacetime Plan of the Local Authority to South
               Yorkshire and the position of that aspect of enquiry to date.

          2.   On Thursday 26 October 1989, together with Police Sergeant
                saw Michael O g l e , the Local Authority Emergency Planning Officer.   He
               was accompanied by Miss Bashford a Solicitor from the Administrative
                and Legal Department, Sheffield Town H a l l . Originally, I had planned
                to canvass the six questions passed during our previous telephone
                conversation about the Authority's plan.      However, Mr Ogle was (not
                unnaturally) prudent and cautious ii§" his approach and it became clear
                that much more background work would be needed by us and them to
                fully explain the nature of the Authority's response to the disaster
                and the implementation of their p l a n .

          Summary of Meeting held on 26 October 1989

          3.   Mr Ogle outlined the history of the Major Peacetime Emergency Plan
                and confirmed his role as the Emergency Planning Officer.  He
                stressed two main points:-

                (i )   The plan has no legal standing in its own right since the Local
                       Authority are under no statutory duty to produce/prepare one.

               (ii)    The plan is to be viewed as a scheme or directory of key
                       departments within the Local Authority sphere of control, who
                       might usefully play a part in any disaster scenario.

          4.   I will deal briefly with the specific questions which I was asked to
                raise with him, although the paucity of some of the information
                reinforces the decision to withdraw to facilitate further enquiries.

                (a)    What part did the Emergency Planning Officer play in provision
                       of feeding and accommodation for relatives?

                       Food

                       Education Department put on standby (see Major Peacetime
                       Emergency Plan, paragraph 10(b)), but were not formally
                       requested.  They were subsequently stood down.
Accommodation

  (i)   Hillsborough Boys Club - was staffed to supplement
        parish priest etc, and became a focal point.

        (NB: Located adjacent to Hammerton Road Police Station).
        (*   See also possible relevance to complaints inquiry).

 (ii)   Burngreave Vestry - open initially and then closed again
        as surplus to requirements.

(iii)   Kelvin Community Centre - staffed by WRVS with the
        facility of food provision.

 (iv)   Sacred Heart Church Hall - volunteers provided an
        adequate service with further assistance from Local
        Authority staff, and this centre remained in operation
        overnight.

Was Emergency Planning Officer called out by Police - if so by
whom specifically and at what time?

The quick answer to the above question is "No", but see
paragraph later.

In letter to Judicial Inquiry, Local Authority's move was to
provide care, comfort and counselling. What was involved. How
were Social Services mobilised etc?

Much of the answer to this question lies in what was provided
under paragraph (a) above.

The Plan appears to have been last revised in 1987. Has the
Plan been revised since? If so when? Before or after
Hillsborough.

Briefly, the Plan has not been revised since 1987 by a formal
process and re-printing etc. Mr Ogle does say that in his
capacity as the responsible officer he was in a position to
review in his mind the Plan and alter or add to it as he saw
fit. He confirms that he made no alterations to it.

What was the method of reviewing the Emergency Plan?

Further to paragraph (d) above,   and see also paragraph (f)
below, it would be possible for   this to occur at convened
meetings with other responsible   groups. Mr Ogle does not exude
confidence in dealing with this   aspect.

           What was the date of the last contact with Force Liaison
           Officer. Before 15 April 1989? Who was the Liaison Officer?
           Was the meeting minuted? Do the Police review the Local
           Authority Plan in relation to their own?

           Mr Ogle has met with Police Liaison Officer (since
           Hillsborough) on 15 September 1989 at Barnsley.  Although no
           debriefing of Hillsborough took place due to the many
           unresolved areas of controversy and possible culpability.

           The Liaison Officer is Chief Inspector Edmunson and Police
           Sergeant

           All meetings are minuted.

          Mr Ogle was unable to remember the date (without reference to
          the file) of the last pre-Hillsborough meeting, but volunteered
          it concerned the Cosmo 1900 Russ§in Satellite and possible
          ramifications for uncontrolled landing.

           In referring to whether the Police review the Local Authority
           Plan in relation to their own, Mr Ogle goes back to his point
           about the Plan only being a check list for him to ensure the
           right departments are called out to assist.

General Points

5.     (i) Mr Ogle confirms being in possession of the respective
           emergency plans of Police, Fire and Ambulance Services, but was
           not familiar with the code word 'CATASTROPHE'.  The Local
           Authority has no reciprocal arrangements.

      (ii) Mr Ogle related a chain of events on the day (15 April 1989)
           whereby he was contacted at home by David Purcheon (Director of
           Health and Consumer Services). Mr Purcheon informed him of the
           scale of the disorder and, working from home with a duplicated
           copy of the Local Authority Emergency Plan, Mr Ogle started to
           call out various departments. He was not contacted by the
           Police directly at any stage that day.

Further Enquiries

6.   Subsequent to the meeting of 26 October 1989 I have continued to
     liaise with Liz Bashford, who has carried out enquiries to ascertain
     some of the further points which I felt needed to be amplified.
     I have produced, in flow chart form, three appendices to this report
     which are the result of those further enquiries.

       (i) Appendix A attempts to illustrate the process by which Mr Ogle,
           as Emergency Planning Officer, was notified of the disorder.
     (ii) Appendix B shows how it is possible for the Local Authority to
          argue that:-

          (a)   Their Plan was implemented, and

          (b)   It had practical benefit.

    (iii) Appendix C shows the question "Should the Plan be implemented?"
          Being raised specifically.

Taken together and in conjunction with the statement o f ________________
the appendices show a number of   layers or strands of Local Authority
acting simultaneously.  In the final analysis it may be possible to argue
that their response was, on the   whole, effective although thismay have
been partly as a result of luck   rather than judgement.
        <2-
The schema for Local Authority action channelled through Mr Ogle does
appear vague in parts.  It may also be argued on the face of it, that the
Local Authority response may have been more organised (and in such a way
that the lead agency, South Yorkshire Police, knew what support it
was/was going to get), if the formal request had come from the Police
themselves, either from the Operational Commander at the scene or via the
appointed Police Liaison Officer.

I will continue to keep you informed of developments and, of course,
pursue any direction which you deem necessary.

           the file) of the last pre-Hillsborough meeting, but volunteered
           it concerned the Cosmo 1900 Russain Satellite and possible
           ramifications for uncontrolled landing.

           In referring to whether the Police review the Local Authority
           Plan in relation to their own, Mr Ogle goes back to his point
           about the Plan only being a check list for him to ensure the
           right departments are called out to assist.

General Points

5.     (i) Mr Ogle confirms being in possession of the respective
           emergency plans of Police, Fire and Ambulance Services, but was
           not familiar with the code word 'CATASTROPHE'.  The Local
           Authority has no reciprocal arrangements.

      (ii) Mr Ogle related a chain of events on the day (15 April 1989)
           whereby he was contacted at home by David Purcheon (Director of
           Health and Consumer Services). Mr Purcheon informed him of the
           scale of the disorder and, working from home with a duplicated
           copy of the Local Authority Emergency Plan, Mr Ogle started to
           call out various departments.  He was not contacted by the
           Police directly at any stage that day.

Further Enquiries

6.   Subsequent to the meeting of 26 October 1989 I have continued to
     liaise with Liz Bashford, who has carried out enquiries to ascertain
     some of the further points which I felt needed to be amplified.
     I have produced, in flow chart form, three appendices to this report
     which are the result of those further enquiries.

       (i) Appendix A attempts to illustrate the process by which Mr Ogle,
           as Emergency Planning Officer, was notified of the disorder.
                                    -   4   -




     (ii) Appendix B shows how it is possible for the Local Authority to
          argue that:-

          (a)   Their Plan was implemented, and

          (b)   It had practical benefit.

    (iii) Appendix C shows the question "Should the Plan be implemented?"
          Being raised specifically.

Taken together and in conjunction with the statement of|_________________
the appendices show a number of   layers or strands of LocalAuthority
acting simultaneously.  In the final analysis it may be possible to argue
that their response was, on the   whole, effective althoughthis may have
been partly as a result of luck   rather than judgement.

The schema for Local Authority action channelled through Mr Ogle does
appear vague in parts.  It may also be argued on the face of it, that the
Local Authority response may have been more organised (and in such a way
that the lead agency, South Yorkshire Police, knew what support it
was/was going to get), if the formal request had come from the Police
themselves, either from the Operational Commander at the scene or via the
appointed Police Liaison Officer.

I will continue to keep you informed of developments and, of course,
pursue any direction which you deem necessary.

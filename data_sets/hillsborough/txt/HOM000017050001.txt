   Mr. R.M. Whalley,
^ ^ c r e t a r y to the Enquiry,
        Queen Anne 's Gate,
   London.
   SW1H 9AT

  Dear Mr. Whalley,

  Thank you for your letter of 7th June in connection with the briefings
  enclosed with my letter of 18th May.

  With regard to the specific point you raise I did state 3000 approximately
  and my view in this regard was based on events at Norwich City Football Club
  only two weeks prior to the Hillsborough Disaster which can be confirmed by
  the Chairman of that Club. Additionally my comments were made as a result of
  years of experience as a Director and subsequently Chairman of Luton Town F.C
  and the knowledge I have therefore gained in respect of Liverpool supporters.

  I do hope that this response is adequate for Lord Justice Taylor's
  requirements but no doubt you will let me know if this is not the case.

  Yours sincerely,




  David Evans.

 1.        I am 65 years old.          I am Chairman o£ Eastwood & Partners

 (Consulting Engineers) which I founded in 1972.                                 The firm has

 offices in Sheffield and London.                    I taught at the University of

 Sheffield from 1954-1970 as a Senior Lecturer and then became

 Professor and Head of the Department of Civil and Structural

 Engineering.          I worked as Managing Partner for Husband & Co,

 Consulting Engineers,          from 1970 to 1972.                 I am a past Pres’

 of the Chartered Institution of Structural Engineers,                                   a past

 Chairman of the Council of Engineering Institutions,                                and past

 Chairman        of    the   Commonwealth       Engineers'             Council.      I   am   an

     Honorary Doctor of Engineering in the University of Sheffield.

      Eastwood & Partners is an unlimited Company which has about

     ninety    technical      staff,    including            seven      Directors     and     six

     Associates with a total staff of just over 100.

a    bundle     o£   copy       documents        extracted            from the Firm's                 files

which       accompanies          this        statement.              When            referring       to     an

individual       document,           I shall add the relevant page number in

the bundle.


4.      I     have    been       involved        with       football                 stadia     including

Hillsborough            for          many     years.            My      first            contact          with

Hillsborough          was       in    the     late     1950's        whilst            I was     a    Senior

Lecturer        at      Sheffield            University. I               advised them on minor

matters.        My major involvement with football stadia came when I

 joined       Husband       &    Co     as    Managing          Partner.               That    firm        were

 Consulting          Engineers          to     the     Club,         Sheffield              United        F. C.,

    Southampton F. C., Nottingham Forest F.C., Swindon Town F. C. and
    Rotherham United F.C.          Whilst at Husband & Co I took particular

    responsibility       for     their   work       at       these      grounds    and    I    was

    involved in the construction of new stands at both Nottingham

    Forest F. C. and Swindon Town F. C.                  During this period there was

    the disaster at Ibrox Park.            In the aftermath of this disaster,

    I was involved in liaison with the Police concerning capacity

    of     football    stadia.      Handrails        and       crush barriers           were   the

    subject     of    much discussion and I designed equipment to test

    crush barriers which was used at the stadia of the six football

    clubs mentioned above.


A    5.     It must be remembered that all this took place before the

     1975     Act and the 1976 Guide.               Both the 1975 Act and the 1976

     Guide were a product of the "Wheatley Commission" of 1972 which

     was    set up to examine the safety of sports grounds                              following

    'the Ibrox disaster. - Sir Walter Winterbottom,                          former Manager, of...

     the England Football Team,             chaired a working party to advise

     the Wheatley commission.             That working party spent a day with

     me discussing safety at football stadia.



      6.     Eastwood & Partners         are retained as Consulting Engineers

      to     the     Club,     Sheffield     United                F. C. ,   Sunderland        F. C. ,

      Chesterfield       F. C. , and Rotherham United F. C.                       The    firm also

      does occasional work for Hull Rugby League F.C. , the Sheffield

      Sports       Stadium which has       Greyhound Racing,                 Rugby      League and

      until    this    season     had    Speedway            and    also the County Cricket

      Ground at Scarborough.

7.         I    am a very interested                 football           supporter and have two

seats in the south stand at Hillsborough very close to the West

Terrace.               I     attend ' matches             frequently,         usually     with    my

grandson, who is now aged 12.                        He has been attending matches at

Hillsborough with either me or his father since he was aged 8

and I have             never      had occasion to                  feel    that we were      in the

slightest             physical        danger,    or       that      the     Police    were   in   any

difficulty.                 The most recent fairly large crowd prior to the

 F.A.          cup Semi-Final          on 15th April               1989 was the match between

 the Club and Liverpool on 14th January 1989.                                       I attended the

 match that day and the Liverpool fans were in the West Terrace.

 I pass the Leppings Lane end turnstiles every time I enter the

 ground.



  PBT.TWRR OF » « ™ n                  & PARTHERS
■ '8.          The    firm was        first     retained           by     the Club as    Consulting

  Engineers            in     1978.      The    only       formal         letters    regarding    that

     retainer are those to my firm from the Club dated 25th October

     1978 and 1st December 1978 (pages 4 and 7).                                    The firm were

     act       on    behalf    of     the     Club    in their dealings               with the SYCC

     and/or the Sheffield Metropolitan District Council Hillsborough

     in respect of the structural aspects of the ground following

     its designation under the 1975 Act.



     9.         I have been Director in charge of all work done on behalf

     of        the   Club.      During our continuous                     retainer since December

      1978 I have been ably assisted by Mr Strange of the firm.                                         He

     was        a senior Engineer,             and has been an Associate of the firm




                                                      -    4   -
since     about        1982.         He   has     been     a   regular      attender   at

Hillsborough since he was a boy.



10.     Pages    1/2 in the bundle are a list of all the jobs which

my firm has done for the club since December 1978 (page 3 lists

those particular jobs which may be relevant for the purpose of

the     inquiry       and   from the      files    relating      to which have been

abstracted the documents of which copies appear in the attached

bundle).        The jobs did not only involve work required under the

1975 Act,       but also general up-grading and modernisation of the

ground.         Almost       every    year      there    has   been some     significant

improvement of the ground.



 11.     In liaising with the Club I have found that they have been

 very willing to spend money to improve the ground and I have

 found    that' the Club4 s Board of Director©                       in particular..have.....

 been very easy to work with.                   Mr. H. McGee has been Chairman of

 the Club throughout this time, and he has taken a keen interest

 in safety matters including attending some of the meetings with

 the Working Party             (which I shall describe in paragraph 16 of

 this     Statement).          I have had frequent personal                  contact with

 him.         He has        always stressed the need for the ground to be

 safe and has been a driving force in getting work done.



 12.     Of     the     Directors,        Mr    Whitehead      was    the   Director   with

 special responsibility for the ground at the time of the early

 meetings.            He played an active part until he ceased to be a

  Director in approximately 1983.                       He was succeeded by Mr K Addy

  and    Mr     E Baron.        They have         a particular        responsibility    for
ground matters as Directors.                   I have had frequent meetings with

them on major matters and have found their attitude to be very

co-operative at all times.


13.     There have been three Club Secretaries since the firm was

first retained by the Club in 1978.                          The first was                Mr E

England.       He was a highly experienced man and was much involved

in the works at the ground.                    He was succeeded by                  Mr R H

Chester     who     was     also    an    experienced         Club      Secretary having

previously been Secretary at Sheffield United F.C.                             and Lincoln

City F. C. .        The present Secretary is Mr G Mackrell.                         I have

always found it very easy to work with him.




 14.    It may assist the Inquiry if I make some comments about

 the relevant details of the 1975 Act ,»nd the 1976 Guide:                                 Both •

 the    1975    Act   and     the     1976      Guide       came   about      following     the

 ••Wheatley       Report"     into       the    Ibrox       disaster.      The     1975    Act

 contains      no   technical             details. These were           all    to be      found

 originally in the            1976Guide.            The current edition of the Guide

 was published in             1986.       However, for most of the time                   I was

 working under the            1976 Guide (not I believe 1973 as referred to

 in error in the preface to the 1986 Guide).



  15.    Section 1 of the 1975 Act permits the Secretary of State

  to designate as a stadium requiring a Certificate,                             referred to

  in the Act as a "Safety Certificate",                       any Sports Stadium which

  in     his    opinion       has        accommodation         for      more     than     10,000

  spectators.         As indicated the original retainer of the firm by


                                                -   6   -
the Club in       1978 followed the designation of Hillsborough as

such   a   stadium.          Section    2 of          the    1975    Act    sets        out    the

required contents of Safety Certificates.                          An application for a

Safety Certificate is made to a Local Authority (as defined in

the 1975 Act) and is governed by Section 3, which also requires

that copies of the application be sent to the Chief Officer of

Police     and the Building Authority for the area in which the

stadium     is   situated.        These       bodies         are    consulted       about      the

terms and conditions to be included in the Safety Certificate.



16.    A Working Party was set up in Sheffield to deal with such

applications which involved representatives of the Police, Fire

Service,     Building Surveyors              Division and the Legal Department

of the Local Authority.             The relevant Local Authority was SYCC

 until     1986 when the SCC took over.                    Representatives of the Club

 would also attend some meetings of the Working- Party when the

 Safety Certificate concerning Hillsborough was discussed.



 17.     The Guide is a voluntary code and has no legal force (see

 paragraph       1.1   1976 Guide and paragraph                    1 of the 1986 Guide).

 Neither of the Guides is rigid,                  and they both contemplate that

 deviation        from   their     recommendations                 will     not    necessarily

 detract      from     the    overall        safety of        a     ground.         A    flexible

 approach        is    encouraged       in     order to            take     account       of     the

 particular circumstances              at individual grounds.                     The relevant

 criterion when assessing the adequacy of safety for spectators

  in new work or re-construction is that of a reasonable degree

  of     safety.          Both    Guides          use the           words     “it       would        be

  unreasonable,        even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute


                                              -   7    -
safety of everyone attending a ground"                      (see paragraphs 1.4 and

1.5 of the 1976 Guide and Paragraph 8 of the 1986 Guide).                                  The

1986 Guide goes on to state in paragraph 6 that "the Guide does

not     attempt     to • set    a   minimum       standard"         for. any      particular

ground.           Rather,      it     attempts        "to    take      account        of   the

constraints and difficulties with are present within" existing

sports grounds (see paragraph 7                   1986 Guide).



18.     I shall deal later in this statement with the provisions

in    the     Guides     regarding       such         matters    as     crush      barriers,

perimeter       and    radial       fences.       However,      I    set    out    here    the

relevant paragraphs in both the 1976 and 1986 Guides:-

  19.     There are no material differences between the 1976 and the

  1986       Guides with regard to their comments on terraced steps

  and       crush     barriers.         Other         sections       have      been    extended

                                              -   8    -
following     the      Bradford       fire    and         to    take     account     of    their

application to sports grounds other than football grounds.                                   The

section     regarding      radial       fences         has       been     extended    so    that

paragraph    103 now states            that such               fences    "should be of the

strength of the crush barriers".                      Paragraphs 7. 9. 1 and 7. 9. 2 in

the 1976 Guide regarding perimeter fences have been replaced by

new     paragraphs      214     and    215    in      the       1986      Guide.      Finally,

additions     have       been     made       in       the       1986       Guide     concerning

estimation        of    safe     ground       capacity.                 However,     the   basic

formulae remain the same.                The 1986              Guide contains examples of

use of the formulae whereas the 1976                            Guide did not.



   TTSH BARRIERS
 20.     When the firm was first retained by the Club in 1978 there

 were barriers at the Leppings Lane end of the ground but they

 were    fewer in number than- recommended by the                             1976 GuiAe,. .'J...

 cannot speak           from myown knowledge,                   but I     believe that these

 barriers had           been installed in 1965 at the time when the West

 Stand was constructed just prior to the use of Hillsborough for
                                      1 Qfifi World Cup.               or at an even earlier

 date.


  21.     I refer to my firm- s plan No.                        1610/64E.          This is dated

  January     1980,     but has       been updated over the years to reflect

  changes.             The original barriers which were in place in 1978

  are marked        in red on the plan.                         They were insufficient in

  number     to     comply     with     the       recommendations           as     to spacing of

  barriers in paragraph 7. 7.2 of the 1976 Guide.




                                                  -   9   -
22.        Such spacing recommendations are contained in paragraph 12

o£     the    1976    Guide.        They    are       dependent upon          a   number    of

factors:              the gradient of the terrace;                      the area of        the

ground       in     which they    are     situated            ("peakviewing areas"          or

"other viewing areas");                  and the strength of the barriers.



23.        Under paragraph 12.2 of the 1976 Guide peak viewing areas

are described as the most popular parts of the terraces such as

behind the goal areas.               The central pens at the Leppings Lane

end of Hillsborough fall within such category.


 24.       AS will be seen from the tables under paragraph 12 of the

 1976 Guide,         (and Table 1 at page 38 of the 1986 Guide) barriers

 may either be Class A or Class B as defined in the tables under

 paragraph 13. 2 of the Guide.                  Class A barriers must be designed

 safely        to    resist    a "fore.- of 5. OkN/metre width                (3401bs      /foot

 width).             Such barriers must be capable of resisting a test

 load of 6.0 kN/metre width                 (4001bs /foot width) in accordance

 with Appendix C of the Guide.                        The equivalent design and test

  loads for Class B barriers are respectively                           3   .4 kN/metre width

     (2301bs        /foot width)     and     4 . 3 kN/metre         width     (2901bs      /foot

  width).           It is to be noted that the test                   loads are overloads,

     being    approximately        20%    and       27%   greater than the         respective

     design loads.


     25.     When the then Secretary of the Club, Mr. England, wrote to

     my firm on 25th October 1978                    (page 4) he sent a copy of the

      guidance notes issued by the then Licensing Authority under the

      1975 Act,      S.Y.C.C.     (pages 5-6).                 Paragraph 5 of those notes


                                                -    10   -
refers to the need to test crush barriers by an approved method

and in the presence of appropriate officers                        of the Licensing

Authority.


26.     In the first instance my firm considered the number and

spacing of the existing barriers in regard to which                               (and of

course other matters) we reported to the Club on 12th January

1979 (pages       10-22).          I refer in particular to sub-paragraph

(b) under the heading "Standing Accommodation"                         (pages 14-15).

We were then uncertain of the strength of the original barriers

and in particular whether they were Class A.                          We did, however,

recommend      the       installation        of    extra     barriers    to   permit      a

 capacity of 7, 200 persons on the West Terrace                         (including the

 lower    level     at    the   North-West         corner)    which,     it   should     be

 remembered,        in    1978 was        not sub-divided into pens by radial

 fences    (with - t h e ;hiatory of which I shall deal— later in. this ,

 Statement).              Our calculations of capacity,               in the light of

 our     recommendations        for       extra   barriers,     was     carried    out   in

 accordance with the relevant formula in paragraph 15.4 of the

 1976 Guide.               in our report to the Club we summarised our

 recommendation, (page 21-22) The second recommendation involved

 making      firm    proposals        to    the    relevant     authorities       for    the

 installation of new crush barriers together with computation of

  capacity.          The details of our calculations are recorded in a

  document dated January 1979 (page 23).



  27.     Our scheme for new barriers was prepared on the basis that

  they     would     be    Class      A    and    that     where   necessary       existing

  barriers would also be brought up to Class A.                          The spacing was


                                             -    11   -
designed by reference to the table in paragraph 12 of the                                                  1976

Guide       taking account of the gradient of                                xf ■

28.        With       the    approval       of     the        Club      we    submitted        our    formal

report       to the          Police,      Fire Service and the Licensing Authority

on     17th       January          1979   (pages     24-32).                      The   relevant     section

dealing with the West Terrace is to be found at pages                                                27-28.

With       the     report      we     submitted      our           drawing. No.           1610/2X     showing

the position of the existing barriers and that of the proposed

new barriers.



 29.        The       working       party    met    on        2nd April            1979    and the     Minutes

 (pages       33-37)          record      under     Section            B     in    respect     of    the    West

 Terrace that the proposals were accepted with regard to the new

 barriers.                    On    8th June       1979        S. Y. C. C.         forwarded    a Schedule

 formally confirming all matters w h i c h ’had been discussed within

 the       working          party     and   which        S.Y. C.C.           felt       required     attention

 (pages           43-49).             Paragraph      E2        records            the    agreement     by     the

 Police          of    a     capacity of         7, 200 persons               in respect       of the West

 Terrace provided that the additional barriers were installed.



  30.       The w o r k in the latter respect was put in hand.                                         The new

  barriers             are    marked        in   blue         on       plan       No.     1610/64E.           The

  barriers were designed by my firm (a different design from that

  of       the        existing        barriers)              and    we       supervised        the     work       of

  installation.



     31.     During the events in question on                                 the       afternoon      of     15th

     April       1989       two spans       of a total             length of about             4. 3 me


                                                         -    12   -
barrier     No.       124A on plan              1610/64E collapsed under the                     crowd

pressure.             The horizontal rails of part of barriers                                128 and

137 were       p e r m a n e n t l y   bent but the barriers remained upright and

effective.                  All these three barriers were existing barriers

in 1978, when the firm was appointed.                                 None of the new barrie

designed         by     the      firm     either       failed         or   suffered       significant

permanent deformation.



 32.    work          on       construction                 of       the    new      barriers         and

 maintenance/strengthening of the original barriers was carried

 out between June and November 1979.                                  All the existing barriers

 were tested prior to the strengthening work in order to define

 whic h needed improving.                      All the improved barriers and the new

 barriers were tested after completion of the works.                                           The firm

 carried out tests                     in accordance with Appendix C of the                           -97-

 Guide.



  33.     in     order         to      carry    out        the   tests      w e    designed     and    had

  constructed at our own expense a testing "rig".                                         A   photograph

  of the rig will be found at page                                         Our rig incorporates a

  system of pin joints to ensure that the imposed load is spread

  reasonably            uniformally            along       the       barrier      rail.         This

  important because without such a system the middle of the rail,

   under       load,        will       deflect     (move         away)     horizontally         with    the

   result that the major load is then taken up by the part of the

   rail closest to the stanchions where of course the ability of

   the     barrier             to      resist    pressure             is    at     its    greatest.

   Misleading             results        would    then be obtained,                 which is not the

   case with our rig.

                                                       -    13   -
34.     During the course of testing we had been liaising with the

Building Surveyors Department of SCC, as the appropriate member

of    the     working     party   (see     for    example     our    letter   of   19th

December 1979 - page 59).



35.     on 28th January 1980 my firm prepared a final report with

regard to testing           (pages   60-63).          Under paragraph     (b) of the

section        headed    "Crush   Barriers"       - page      61)    we describe the

result of tests           carried out to the existing barriers and the

works       of repair/maintenance which had been implemented.                         We

 also    record    that     all the strengthened barriers               had been re­

 tested satisfactorily as also had been the new barriers.                             We

 did    not     re-test    those barriers        which had already passed the

 initial tests.             In this context I refer to the test as being

 that applicable to Class A barriers.



 36.     S.Y. C.C.      indicated that they wished to have l/5th of the

 total        number of    crush barriers         throughout        the ground     tested

 each year so that each individual barrier should be tested once

  every 5 years.             On 15th July 1980 my firm wrote to S. T. C. C.

     (pages    64-65)    to indicate that it would be easier to test a

  block of barriers constituting l/5th of the total number at the

     ground rather than to do so on a more random basis.                           We had

     previously discussed this proposal                   with Mr.    Sheriff of SCC's

     Building Surveyors Department               (a member of the working party)

     and he agreed.          S. Y. C. C.   agreed;         see their letter of 18th

     July 1980 (page 66).



                                            -    14   -
37.         Within the relevant 5 year cycle,                 indeed after 3 years,

the barriers in the West Terrace were tested again in 1983.                              I

refer to the firm's report dated 29th June 1983 to Mr. Sheriff

(pages 95-96).


38.         I should explain at this point that with the installation

                in allterraces within
                    a                     the ground,  the firm

  39.        Again in accordance with the 5 year cycle, the barriers in

  the west Terrace were tested in 1988.                         As part of the firm's

  own checking procedure,                 it so happens that just beforehand we
  arranged          for an independent Company,                Sheffield Testing Works

  Limited, to check the calibration of our rig.


      40.     The   calibration was carried out on 8th July                   1988.      The

      Certificate          d a t e d   15th July   1988       and   the   record    of   the

    (which as I have indicated remain unaltered from those of the

    1976 Guide).



    PBPT METER ftflP RADIAL FENCES.

     (a)    Perimeter Fences
    41.     The perimeter              fences      were       already in position when the

     firm was          first instructed in 1978.                         I am not sure when they

     were     erected,          but        it    was    probably           soon      after     the   Ibrox

     disaster.           The fences             are at the east and west ends of the

     ground            only. There         are no perimeter fences                    in front of the

     north        or    south     stand,         which have              relatively      low   reinforced

     concrete walls.


      42      By the provisions of paragraph 7. 9. 3 of the 1976 Guide,

      because          spectators          could       lean     on       the    perimeter      fences,      we

         deemed        them to      be crush           barriers           and   so      they   had   to     be

         strengthened.              The perimeter fence atthe front of the west

         terrace was avertical                  wire mesh            fence about 2. 7 metres high.

         It was        strengthened in 1979 both by the provision of bracing

         against the existing perimeter concrete wall and the anchoring

         of the wall itself with inclined steel stays fixed to concrete
                        ,                   This work was required and approved by the
         block foundations.                 This worn

                                                          -    16    -
43.     At     some              later     date       the        Club       arranged       for     cranked

extensions             to be           fitted onto the top of the perimeter fence

leaning       towards             the     spectators           at     an angle      of    45*     with the

steel mesh cut so as to leave spikes sticking out of the top.

The firm was not asked to advise on this change and we were not

involved in its design or installation.                                      I believe that it was

installed              at        the     request      of        the       Police,    but      I   have      no

documentary evidence of this.



 (b) Radial Fences
 44.     By the early 1980'                    3    it was becoming a common practice to

 try to separate visiting supporters and home supporters.                                                   The

 Club were keen for such a separation and I believe that such

 view was shared fully by the Police.                                        I wrote to S. Y. C. C. on

 2nd September 1981                      (pages 69-70) to say that I had been asked

 by     the    C   l   u   b    to-   -arrange "for the               installation ,o,t .two. .radial

 fences in the west terrace.                            These two fences are marked 1 and

  2 on plan 8945/1A.                       The relevant provisions in the 1976 Guide

  are found at paragraph 7. 6.


  45.        There were advantages perceived by the Club in installing

  radial       fences.                 It meant that they could have both home and

  visiting supporters in the west terrace but that they could be

  segregated.                    It would also assist the Police in crowd control.

  As indicated in my letter to S.Y. C. C. dated 2nd September 1981

      (page    69)             gates    were       proposed at the rear of each fence to

      allow    access              for    policing             during      matches       as     well   as    for

      maintenance.                 I pointed out in the letter that the gates would

      be left open, but fastened back, to connect the areas during a


                                                           -    17    -
game if adjacent areas were to be occupied by supporters of the

same team.                Approval for the installation of the two radial

        ....... given by S.-T.C.C. in their letter of 14th September

1981 (pages 76-77).                 The approval was subject to the condition

(paragraph I.e.             at page 76) that the gates at the rear of the

fences should be under Police control.


46          The    installation         work      was    carried         out   by     a    firm    of

Contractors,              Blessvale,        in    October        and   November       198!.        In

 places the crush barriers passed through the radial fences and

 there was discussion between Mr Strange and Mr England about

 this,       as recorded in the memorandum of 4th November 1981 (page

 7 9   ).         There    was    further        discussion       between      them       about    the

 relevant barriers on 13th November 1981 (page 81).                                       The Police

 wanted those barriers which passed through the radial fences

 removed b ^ a u s e             otherwise' spectators            might use.them to climb

  over       the     radial       fences.         Neither        the   Club,   nor Mr         Strange

  wished the barriers to be removed because to do so might have

  affected safety.                If the relevant barriers had been removed, an

  uninterrupted             -channel"         would     have       been    created         along   the

  radial fence from the top of the terrace down to the perimeter

     fence.         Also,    spectators tend to congregate at the top of the

   west terrace rather than at the bottom by the perimeter fence

     because their view will not be obscured by the small mesh of

     the     perimeter.            It   was       agreed     in    the    discussions         on   »th

     November        1981 that the barriers would remain in position for

       the next match to see what happened.




                                                    -   18   -
47.      The next discussion between Mr Strange and Mr England took

place following the match on 17th November 1981 (page 82).                                           The

Chief        Constable          had   seen   the        barriers       in    position      and       was

content        that    they       should      remain          because       there   had       been     no

problems        at    the match.             It was,          therefore,        agreed that          the

barriers would remain in position passing through the radial

 fences as they are today.


 48.     I    wrote        to    S.Y.C.C.      on       14th       December      1981     (page      83)

 updating       them on progress               regarding the              installation of the

 radial       fences       and security gates.                     S. Y.C. C.   replied on 20th

 January 1982 (pages 84-85).                    That letter recorded doubts still

 being voiced by the Police concerning the crush barriers which

 passed        through          the   radial        fences.           I     therefore      wrote        to

 S.Y.C.C.       on 26th January 1982 (pages 86-88) with my views as to

"'Why I felt"that the relevant barriers should not. b e .terminated

 short of the radial fence.                    I pointed out the aspects of safety

  and segregation which were involved and felt that what had been

  done        was     a     "reasonable             compromise            between       the     various

  interests".              These matters were discussed at a meeting of the

  working party held on 4th February 1982 (pages 89-91).                                         It was

  agreed at that meeting that it was preferable                                     from a safety

  point of view to retain the crush barriers which passed through

  the radial fences.


   49.       The installation of two further radial fences in the west

   terrace          were    considered         in       1985.        These      were    part      of    the

      reorganisation of the west terrace which I shall refer to in




                                                    -    19    -
more detail         later in my statement.                     For the moment,        I shall

concentrate on the radial fences.


50.     I wrote to the Club on 2nd April 1985 enclosing the firm's

drawing No 6705/2 which provided for one further radial fence

adjacent to one of the existing radial                             fences to create an

obvious          corridor of "no mans'              land"      (pages    107-108).        (This

further          fence   is    numbered       3 on drawing         No.    8945/1A).         The

drawing was forwarded to S. Y. C.C. on 9th April 1985 (pages                               109-

 110)    with       a    request       that    the working         party       consider       the

 proposals         at    an    early    date.        A    copy     of the       drawing       was

 forwarded by the Club to the Police. The Police response was to

 suggest a central              fence to divide the middle section of the

 west terrace,           rather than to create the "no mans land-.                         This

 is recorded in my letter to the Club of 19th April 1985 (pages

 113-115).           There were various discussions between Mr Strange
 and Mr          Chester      concerning      the location          of   a     further radial

 fence as recorded in the memoranda of 20th April 1985 and 25th

 April 1985 (pages              116-117).


  51.        S.Y.C.C.    provided their comments                  in their letter of 2nd

  May 1985          (pages 123-125).           The Police suggestion of a radial
                    ,.          area of the terrace was accepted,
  fence to separate the central area
  but        a   different      location       for       the    fourth       radial   fence    was
  suggested.             There was       further         correspondence         and discussion

  concerning the location of these fences during May and June
      1985       On 13th June 1985 I met Chief Superintendent Moseley and

      Councillor Smith           (who I       believe was         deputy chairman of the

      Police Committee at that time) to discuss the further radial


                                                -    20   -
fences.       The outcome of this meeting was recorded in my letter

of     17th    June      1985        to     the    Club     (pages       138-139).          Chief

Superintendent           Moseley, was             favourably       disposed      towards         the

creation of a ••corridor" of "no mans'                       land" with a gate to the

pitch,       following the experience of his officers at the recent

match between the Club and Liverpool F. C.                               The corridor would

provide       an easy access               for the Police to the pens on either

side, via the gates at the rear of the radial fences.                                      I wrote

to the        Police on           25th June        1985 about these proposals                (page

 142).        Mr   Strange          then     received     a telephone           call      from   the

 Police on 27th June 1985 (page 144) in which there was further

 discussion        about          the     radial    fences     necessary        to    create     the

 corridor; no mans'               land" and also a central radial fence in the

 west       terrace.          I    added      a    manuscript      note    to    Mr       Strange's

 memorandum of the telephone call agreeing that a central fence

’ should be installed for the time being,..provided that it did

 not        make   the      packing         of     spectators       in    the    west       terrace

 "impossible".


 52.        Application           for     planning    consent      was    made       by    a letter

 dated 5th July               1985      (pages     145-148).       Detailed drawings were

  submitted to S.Y.C.C.                   on 25th July 1985 (pages 153-154).                      The

     relevant drawings are numbered 6705/6 and                            17.        The proposals

     were    agreed      by    S. Y. C. C.       in their    letter       of    30th      July    1985

     (pages    155-156),          subject to the addition of extra gates.                              I

     wrote to S.Y.C.C.             on 1st August 1985 (pages 157-158) to clarify

     the position regarding the extra gates                          because I was unclear

     what SYCC required.                There was a meeting of the Working Party at

     the    ground     on     7th August           1985   (pages     160-162)        which amongst
other matters discussed the extra gates.                        The positions of the

extra gates were duly clarified and agreed and X confirmed the

position to the Club in my letter dated 15th August 1985 (pages

163-165).          The     two    extra   radial           fences    were   subsequently,

installed that summer.



(c)       Gates
53.       There are seven gates through the perimeter fence of the

West Terrace.             These are shown on drawing 11424/2.                   When the

firm was appointed Nos.               1, 2, 4 and 6 were certainly already in

place and have not been modified in the meantime other than by

the addition of a quick release bolt so as to ensure that the

 gates could be opened quickly and easily in emergency even if

 the gate is subjected to the same pressure as a crush barrier.

 (This      type    of bolt      is   fitted to all gates              in the perimeter

 fence at this ground).


 54   .   We also believe that No.              5 is also an original gate (pre-

 1978) but when the access corridor was created by installing an

 additional radial fence in 1985, steps were added on the inside

 to provide easier access for the Police.



  55.      The origin of gate 7 is not known.                       It is not recorded as

  being in place in our drawings of the ground in 1978.                            We have

  not      been    able    to    find in our      files       any    record of it being

  constructed under our control.                      There is a possibility that it

  has      been    there    since before we became the Club-s                   consulting

  engineers,        but we think it more likely that it was constructed
                                                                                            We

know that it was in place in 1988, because when we ordered the

quick release bolts for the gates in 1988 (to which I refer in

paragraph 61)        it was discovered that we had ordered one less

than was required.            An extra one had to be made.



56.     The   gate      number    3 was      constructed under our control                   in

1985.         It was specifically requested by the Police,                          and was

approved by the licensing authority before installation.                                     It

was made to match gate No.                 4, which was in the other half of

the old central pen.


 57.     The width of each of the gateways is as follows: -



                          1        2         3           4       5         6

 58.      The width of gates in the perimeter fences had been the

 subject      of     discussion on various               occasions        between    1978    and

  1985.       The Police and the fire service both have an interest

  in this matter.             From the Police point of view, they are most

  likely      to   need    the    gates      to    get       onto the terrace        to     quell

  unruly behaviour.               Various senior officers have said over the

  years that the gates should not be too wide because that would

  make it easy for troublemakers to spill out onto the pitch if

  the police open the gate to get into the terrace.                                   The fire

  service are naturally mindful of the possibility that the gates

   may    have     to    be   used     for       evacuation      of   the      terrace      in    an

                                                 - 23 -
emergency.             Hence,    at Bramall        Lane ground where there is a

stand part of which has some timber in its construction,                                         the

gates     from     the    terrace      in    front      have     been     made wider         than

normal, so as to assist rapid evacuation of spectators onto the

pitch.


59.     It should be remembered that at all relevant times,                                      the

1976      Guide,       which    contains      no   recommendation as to width                     of

gates     in     perimeter       fences,     was     in       force.          The    1986 Guide

suggests at paragraph 215 that such gates should be a minimum

 of 1100mm wide.               The size of the gates in the perimeter fence

 at Hillsborough was of course approved by the Working Party.

 As indicated,           the Police in particular have said that they do

 not     want    gates       which   are     too     wide      because        of    the    risk    of

 spectators rushing onto the pitch at times when the gates may

 be     opened     by the Police            to gain access to the terraces                        for

 crowd control purposes.                     All gates have been discussed with

 the      Police       and   Fire    Service       at     least        once    a year.            The

  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club has always willingly provid

  whatever gates have been requested by the licensing authority.

  We      as     the     Club's      engineers          have      prepared drawings                and

  specifications to give what we understood was being requested,

  and     the    drawings       have    then       been       submitted to the licensing

  authority.             The drawings have been considered by the working

  party,        including        Police      and     Fire       Service,           and    have    been

  approved.             The Club have then had the gates constructed,                              and

  installed under our supervision.




                                               -   24     -
60.      Although the gates are not marked, they are very obvious.

They cannot be operated from the inside.                                  They are designed

be under the control of the Police. Therefore, they can only be

operated from the pitch side.                        Once the gate has been opened by

the Police its position is obvious.


61.         I personally had a concern about the ability to open the

gates with pressure of spectators against them (they originally

 had Simple bolts).                     Of my own initiative in 1987 I designed a

 •quick        release       mechanism-.           The          design   can be    seen   from the

 drawings prepared by Mr Strange in August 1987 (pages 190-1*1).

 This        design was         forwarded to SCC on                      19th August   1987    (page

 1,„.            They     replied          on    15th October            1987   suggesting that a

 prototype be manufactured and fitted to one of the gates                                           for

  testing purposes.                This was done and a meeting was held on 25th

  February 1988 with                    S CC    and the Police to see the prototype

  operation.              The prototype             was approved           and installed in all

  gates        on the perimeter                  fence.          We have recently tested the

  opening          of    gate     «o.          3 with       a    test    load   applied   to   it    of

  6kN/metre.              It could be opened with the arm extended so as not

  to be in line with the gate when it suddenly opened.

            in paragraph 87 o£ the 1986 Guide (formerly paragraph 9.7.2 of

            the 1976 Guide).


            63         The    tunnel    and ramp were already in existence when the

            firm        was     commissioned      by   the       Club       in    1978   to     assist    in

            obtaining          the     Safety    Certificate.                    The   tunnel    had     been

            constructed as part of the West Stand development in time for

            the World Cup games in 1966.


             64.       The firm has carried out a survey of the levels within the

             tunnel.           These are shown on the attached drawing 11424/3.                            It

             will be seen that on entering the tunnel from the direction of

             the turnstiles,            there is an upward slope for about 4m.                         There

             is then a smooth transition leading to a downward slope which

             gradually increases to about 1 in 12 at 12%. into the tunnel,

                 about       1 in 8~ at 14%m,      and finally at about 1. in 6-for. * 3m

                 length between          16 and    19m.          The ramp then levels out to a

                 quite gentle inclination where it passes between the gates at
                                     terrace                     The ramp is steeper than 1 in 10
                 the entrance to the terrac

                 over a length of about 6m.


                 6,.     Although I had been very heavily involved in safety work

                 in     football       grounds    in   1970-72,            including     the    Hillsborough

                  ground,      the invitation to help the Club in 1978 was the first

                  occasion on which I had used the 1976 Guide.                            In studying xt

                  made manuscript notes of important points.                              These notes were

                  Placed on file.               Attached at page 8(A) is a photocopy of one

                  of the two sheets             of notes which I wrote.                   It will be seen




                                                             -    26   -
    that the recommendation concerning slope of ramps is one of the

    points in the 1976 Guide about which I made a special note.



    66.     On    3rd November             1979 as evidenced in my letter of 27th

    October       1978     (page       6(B))        I    met        the    Chairman     of    the   Club,

    Mr. McGee to discuss our appointment.                                     I also made a detailed

    inspection of the ground.                           Amongst the many matters which I

    remarked was the part of the ramp which had a slope of more

    than 1 in 10.                It was noticeable that instead of creating a

    constant incline,            which would have had a slope of about one in

     15.4m, the designer had chosen to align the floor of the tunnel

     so that       there was          an    upward slope to a hump,                     followed by a

     downward slope which was therefore steeper than would have been

     necessary without the hump.


■    67.     At that meeting I was given a list of drawings of various,

     parts of the ground.                    This list had been provided in September

     1977 by Husband & Co. the Club- s previous consulting engineers

     at     the    request       of    Mr.     R.       Whitehead          a director of the Club,

      (pages      6(0      to    6(K)).                 It will          be   seen that the list of

      drawings refers almost exclusively to the North stand,                                          and to

      the     west       stand     including             the        terrace      and    the   North     West

      terrace,       all    of     which       had been              designed by Husband & Co.

      There are 67 drawings referring to the West terrace and stand,

      and the North West corner stand.                                    Those of which I requested

      copies       were     ticked,          and        were        included       in   the    list    which

      accompanied my letter to Mr.                            England dated 6th November 1978

          (pages 6(H) and (M)).



                                                          -    27    -
68.      One o£ the drawings for which I asked was number 24A which

is entitled ' Section Through Access Tunnel' .                                I felt that the

ramp in the tunnel needed investigation.



69        I recall that the Fire Service representatives also noted

the slope in the tunnel floor at an early date.                                        I remember

having a discussion with them during a walk round the ground xn

one of the early meetings.                   It is possible this was on the

 occasion of the very first meeting of the Working Party with

 the club representatives at the ground on » t h December,                                     1.7..

 The Fire Service were represented at that meeting, according to

 a note on our file             (page 9(A)) by Mr.                  B. Dunstan and Mr.                 B.

 Jones.          There are no minutes of this meeting on our file, and

 x      believe    it was     mainly   for           the   purpose          of     inspecting          the

 ground and expressing preliminary views regarding safety works.

-However,         t h « e were various subsequent meetings.over the

  months December 1978 to April 1979, with senior members of the

     F i re   Service at the ground, during which we inspected the Wes

     stand and the tunnel.             Some of these were meetings                             of the

  70.   At one of the meetings listed above, but I cannot specify

  which,      I       recall    discussing          with      the    Working    Party,    three

  matters      involving        ramps.              In    chronological       order we    first

  discussed the ramp through the tunnel to the West terrace.                                   We

  then discussed desirability of adjusting the exit from the Kop

  through         a   tunnel    at   the      North       East      corner of the ground.

  Third,      we discussed changes to the existing ramp forming part

  of    the    exit      from    the back           of the       Kop.        These latter two

  matters         are    mentioned       at    various         times    in     the   Minutes   of


                                                -    29   -
meetings,       but because the general              feeling was that no change

„as to be made to the ramp in the West terrace tunnel,                              it is

not minuted.               Generally,    it was only the respects in which

action was required which were recorded.



71.     Since       1979,     the    complete       Working       Party    consisting   of

experienced          senior     representatives              of   the    various   parties

involved has toured the ground on many occasions.                              During the

time S.Y.C.C.          were the licensing authority,                    these inspections

were made systematically twice per year.                            Since SCC have been

 the Licensing authority,               the inspections have been reduced to

 one per year.              So far as I know, during these ten years, there

 has    never       been    any suggestion by             any     member of the Working

 Party,        or   anyone    else    for that matter that the ramp in the

 tunnel        should be altered,         even if this were to be reasonably

 practicable.


  72.     in my view there is a lack of clarity in the 1976 and 1986

  Guides.           Neither differentiate, between a ramp in which the

  ■■heavy crowd flow” is downhill,                  and one in which it is uphill.

  The Guides         are clearly meant to cover only the case in which

  the spectators have to go downhill, tightly packed, at the end

  Of a match.               They acknowledge that the period of "greatest"

   (the    1976      Guide)    and "great"          (the     1986 Guide)     risk to crowd

  safety at football grounds is at the time of leaving.                              That is

   the normal situation with spectators descending from stands or

   embankments         to ground level.                  Exactly the opposite position

      applies in the case of the ramp through the tunnel of the west

      stand.

                                                -   30   -
7 3.    When     spectators      leave   the   West terrace,      there will     be

congestion and jostling as they converge on the space between

the     two    wing     walls    at   the    start    of   the   tunnel.         The

constricting of the crowd flow at the start of an exit route is

in line with the thinking in the 1976 Green Guide,                         paragraph

6. 3,    and the      1986 Guide,     paragraph 50.         Once the spectators

have entered the parallel sided tunnel,                    the flow will settle

down to a steady rate.                There is a gentle upward slope for a

distance of about 4m between the wing walls and then the tunnel

walls,        before the main ramp is reached.               When the spectators

 are going up the ramp to leave the ground they will be safer

 than if they were walking downhill.                  It is to be expected that

 if the ramp had a downward slope and someone tripped, it would

 be very difficult for the people immediately behind to stop to

■ give     him ' tii.     to    recover."'     - Furthermore,     the   people   even- .

  further behind have a downhill momentum which will be difficult

  to resist.


  74.    If the same density of spectators were leaving the ground

  along a route of the same width,               but with no slope, conditions

  would be reasonably safe.                 If someone trips, it will be easier

  for the people behind to slow down or stop momentorily to let

  him recover.           But if the same density of spectators were going

   along a route of the same width,                  but with an upward slope as

   here,      conditions       are likely to be safer still.               If someone

   falls,      the person immediately behind will find it much easier

   to    stop,    and    also to      bring to    a halt the people who are a

   little further behind.
75   .     in my view it would probably be safer                                    to progress     in a

heavy crowd of people up a 1 in 6 slope, than                                       to be in the same

crowd going down a 1 in 10 slope.


76.        spectators entering rather than leaving                                  the West terrace,

do, of course, have to progress down the slope which over about

a 3m length is at 1 in 6, and for a further 3m is about 1 in 8.

 But the rate at which spectators enter the ground is controlled

 by the turnstiles.                       The maximum rate at which they can be

 expected to enter is perhaps equivalent to filling the ground

 in say one hour or rather longer.                                       There should be no “heavy

 crowd       flow".                  They will       be       fed        down the    ramp    in limited

 numbers          over         an extended period                   (contrast       evacuation of the

 ground in an emergency,.                                Individuals,             or little groups of

"people,          are    i n    no    danger in passing down a 3m wide ramp whic*v

     has a slope of I in 6 over a short length.                                     If one of them did

     trip and fall,              there would be no question of a mass of peop

     piling on top of him.


     77.     paragraph 88 of the                    1986 Guide             (paragraph 9.7. 2.       of the

     1976 Guide)           says -The maximum gradient acceptable will depend

     on the ramp's length,                    purpose and usage but a ramp subject to

     heavy crowd flow should                                             not exceed a gradient of 1

     in     io-                The    Guide       also        brings       into    account   'the    ramp's

      length' .          In the present case the total length of ramp which
                                                          \    in 10 is only 6m, and the length
      has a slope of steeper than                         1    in 1 0 is o y

      which is steeper than                   1   in 8 is only about 3m.




                                                          -    32    -
78.     Apart      from these matters,                in considering whether it was

possible for the ramp to be broken out and replaced with one of

constant          slope,     there., were       structural              considerations.                I

surmised          that     the    consulting      engineer              who    designed      it    had

presumably had a reason for giving it an initial upward slope

when entering              from the turnstiles.                    I do not now have the

drawing ofthe tunnel which was loaned to me in 1979.                                        This and

others were returned to Mr. Whitehead under cover of a letter

dated       14th November          1978    (page 6(0)).                   X recollect however

 that       the    drawing       showed    that       the        ramp    needed       to   avoid the

 foundations of the tunnel walls.                           The rear part of the tunnel

 clearly          existed       before    the   West        stand was          created in about

 1966.             The    brick walls       in the rear half are old,                        and are

 obviously part of an earlier structure, whilst new brick walls

 were constructed in the front                        (terrace)          part of the tunnel.

 The foundations of the 'Older walls are at shallow depth. 50 that...

  the ramp could not be sloped down without chopping off the edge

  of the foundations,               and also having to u n d e r p i n them.                       This

  would      have        been    complicated even hazardous                     to a degree,           and

  expensive.              Questions of difficulty of works and cost did not

  however enter the equation,                    from my point of view, but rather

  the fact that any alternative a r r a n g e m e n t                         (reversing    the slope

  or even levelling it) would not have led to greater safety.



      79.    For    example,        another     way         to     reduce       the    slope      of   the

      steepest 6m length of the ramp would have been to break out the

      relevant section and to introduce some steps.                                   But in my view

      that would have produced a hazardous situation.                                      Indeed both

      the 1976 and 1986 Guides say >The gradient should preferably be


                                                  -    33    -
constant       and not broken by steps'                     (paragraph 9.7. 1 of the 1976

Guide and paragraph 87 of the 1986 Guide).



80.     To    summarise,          the    Guides        should      not     be    misinterpreted.

The    guidance       regarding the             slope       of    ramps       is expressly stated

to     apply     to    ramps        which    have       a        downward       slope    when       being

traversed by a heavy crowd flow,                        that is at the time of leaving

the     ground        not    when        filling       it.           The        circumstances         are

obviously much safer when the heavy crowd flow is going uphill

as in the case of the tunnel.                           Bearing in mind the relatively

short     length       of    ramp which          is    steeper       than       1 in    10,    and    the

fact     that        when    the    ground       is     filling          up     spectator      flow       is

light,       because        it is       controlled       by      turnstiles,       I believe that

the     ramp    is    consistent both with the spirit                           and the letter of

the Guide.



GENERAL REARRANGEMENTS AT LEPPINGS LANE ENP (TPRNgTI frEg, ETC,^_L



 81.     In the summer of 1981 Mr.                      England approached the firm for

 a discussion of the entrance arrangements                                    at the Leppings         Lane

 end    of     the    ground.            We opened          a file        on    13th August         1981.

 The    arrangements             as they then existed                can most easily be seen

 from    a     drawing       number       6705/1        (page       146)       which     was    in    fact       ^

 prepared by my firm much later in 1985.                                   I should mention t h a t f ^

 wall        shown    on     the    drawing        running          from       turnstile       No    23     is

 slightly        mis-drawn.             In fact it runs             to the column             (the small

 square)        shown       on    the    left    (south)          side     of    the    drawing.          The

 drawing should be read in conjunction with notes prepared by Mr




                                                   -   34    -
Strange      in or about August/September 1981 which describe the

then system in force.


82.    The two sketch drawings numbered 3563/1/ and 2 prepared in

August 1981            (pages 73-74) show my firm's preliminary ideas for

alternatives                 involving      extra      turnstiles             and,    to     varying

degrees,        segregation of crowd once access had been gained via

the turnstiles.


83.      So far as I am aware the initiative for this study came

 from the Club, though it is possible that one of the interested

 authorities had raised the matter without our knowledge.                                            The

 Club were of course interested in crowd control/management in

 all     parts         of    the    ground,      not   just     in   the       spectator          areas,

 including the areas of access to the turnstiles.                                         Egress from

'the    g r o u n d    wis also'cousidered.                Indeed p a r a g r a p h - 6 . 2 of t h e

 1976     Guide         says       that   the    period    of    greatest            risk    to    crowd

 safety is at the time of leaving the ground.



 84.      in     the        event,    the       firm was      not    asked       to       develop    its

 embryonic schemes any further in 1981.                                   I    presume that,         the

 Club did not see the matter as being of priority at that time

  This     was        understandable          in my view.            It       must be remembered

  that      they        were       carrying     out    extensive      works          to     the    ground

  overall             year     by    year       (described      by    me        earlier       in     this

  statement).                At the time they were also in the Second Division

  with the             consequence        that attendances           at their home                matches

  were smaller than they were after their promotion to the First

  Division.                  Nor to the best of my own knowledge had there been
any serious difficulties at matches with regard to ingress to

or egress from the Leppings Lane end of the ground.                                        Neither

in 1981 nor later in 1985 was it ever suggested to me by the

Club or by any other body represented on the working party that

a     scheme       of     rearrangement         was        required          to     alleviate       any

difficulties of that sort.


85.        in    1985,     by   which      time          the       Club     were    in   the     First

Division,           Mr. Chester,          successor            to     Mr.     England      as       Club

 secretary,         wrote       to   me    on     22nd          February          1985   (page      100)

 resurrecting            the    question        of       possible         improvements         at    the

 Leppings         Lane end.          I do not have any specific recollection

    but believe          that the letter followed a brief mention of the

    matter in informal discussions a day or two beforehand.



    86        A meeting'wais arranged with Mr. Chester on 6th March 1985.

    My    staff    prepared      a rudimentary                 sketch showing the              existing

    lay-out       (page 101).        Before the meeting I sketched a possible

    alternative lay-out by marking up the sketch as shown at page

    102   .      A new drawing showing those amendments was prepared for

     the purpose of my meeting with Mr. Chester (page 103).                                      At that

     meeting X made further manuscript markings on the sketch (page

     104).


     87.        I then worked up a scheme (drawing 6705/2) two versions of
                                                     inc             Three copies were sent to
     which appear at pages                105        106.
     Mr.      Chester under cover of my letter of 2nd April 1985 (pages

      107-108).            The principles,               as reflected in my letter of 2nd

      April 1985 involved the segregation of home and away supporters


                                                     -    36   -
not merely within the ground itself, but also after access had

been   gained     via       the     turnstiles          (as     indicated,      this    was    of

particular       concern          to    the    Club      and,      as    I    understood      the

position,     the Police).               Flexibility was also provided by the

possibility      of        allocating         either a large or a small viewing

area to visiting supporters.                       With the separate "channelling"

to the various             divided parts           of the west           stand and terraces

 account had to be taken of the need to provide extra lavatories

 and refreshment areas.


 88.   As will be apparent from our drawing No.                              6705/2 (page 105)

 and drawing No. 6705/1 (the then existing layout)                               (page 146) we

 proposed six extra turnstiles.                        Two of the existing turnstiles,

 numbered 17 and 18, were to be demolished.                                    By dividing

 remaining sixteen by an additional internal fence incorporating

" gates   (one    tence        already         existed)         Nos.    1/6 would servs        the

  north stand,         Nos.    7/12 the north-west terrace and Nos.                           13/16

  part' of      the    seated          area   of   the west stand              (that stand was

  itself to be divided into two).                               A new bank of turnstiles

  (numbered 17/21 on drawing 6705/2) was proposed to serve the

  central area of the terrace with a new wall being constructed

  from    the    corner        of       turnstile       No.      16     in   effect    to   make

  fundamental division between turnstiles 1/16 and the areas into

  which they fed on the one hand and the rest of the turnstiles

   on the other.              For those turnstiles to the south we suggested

   a further three with internal fences which would constrain the

   spectators         to    go up the          stairs to the southern half of the

   stand seating.             The remaining turnstiles led to the south-west

   terrace.           Bach of the areas so created was to have exit gates


                                                   -   37   -
of the appropriate width to permit evacuation of the ground in

less than eight minutes.


89.      Under cover of a letter dated 9th April                         1985 drawing No

6705/2      showing       the    proposals       was       sent    to     S. Y. C. C.   for

consideration by the Working Party (pages 109-110).                               It will

be seen that        Mr.    Chester had already supplied a copy of the

drawing     to   the      Police with     whom        he   had    been    in discussion

concerning         the     proposals.            This       is    in     line    with    my

understanding that,             of all   the authorities           concerned,       it was

 the Police who were most involved because of their particular

 interest     in    crowd       management       and       control,      especially     the

 segregation of home and away supporters.



 90.     on 12th April 1985 Mr Strange had a conversation with Mr.

 Chester as recorded in his note which appears at page 111-                               It

 will be seen that the Club              were still considering the question

 of the number of turnstiles to be incorporated in the scheme.

  On 17th April 1985 Mr Strange had a discussion with                                          J

               ----------1suggested that there should be a total
  page 112.                 ^
  of 34 turnstiles:   a further four to supplement the existing

  six serving the north stand,                   an extra two to supplement the

  six which we had suggested should serve the area assigned to

      home standing supporters,           and a reduction of one in the two

      banks of turnstiles to be used by visiting standing supporters,

                 wished the turnstiles to be in pairs.




                                             -   38    -
91.     We duly revised the drawing of the proposed scheme.                                               On

19th     April      1985     Mr   Strange         wrote            to    Mr.    Chester       enclosing

drawing No.         6705/3 (pages 113-115).                        As will be seen from such

drawing       we    accurately          reflected -1                                  suggestion

numbers of turnstiles, and we included necessary alterations to

proposed walls and fences to ensure segregation and channelling

of supporters.


92.      On 20th April 1985 Mr Strange had a telephone conversation

with Mr.        Chester who indicated that he was still not satisfied

 that     the      number    of proposed turnstiles was                              right.         He was

 still having discussions with his colleagues at the Club (page

 116).


 93.     On        25th     April       1985        there               was     another        telephone

 conversation Between M r Strange and Mr.                                      Chester      (.page .11.7.1,

 By then Mr.          Chester had returned a copy of drawing So.                                     6705/3

 with various manuscript markings of his own.                                              We cannot now

  find in our files that particular copy.                                        We believe that it

 will have been used by our draughtsman, I                                                    I to
  the negative of drawing 6705/3 to produce drawing 6705/4                                                 (it

  will be seen that the signature and date are identical in both

  drawings).               In all probability the marked up copy received

  from     Mr.      Chester       was    then           destroyed.                    Mr.     Chester      had

  suggested          that     there      should           be       an     area       in     front    of    the

  turnstiles          to    be    used       by   visiting               supporters         separate      from

  those       areas        leading      to    the        turnstiles             to    be    used     by   home

      supporters.         He wished to have gates enclosing this area.                                         He

      also proposed four banks of three turnstiles together with a


                                                    -    39    -
gate which he suggested might be used to let spectators into

the    ground        at all          ticket       matches.               It will be seen on Mr

Strange's         note       that      the       latter       wrote           "disaster-       i n . square

brackets          against        this       suggestion.                        The    square     brackets

indicate that this was Mr Strange’s reaction to that particular

suggestion.            I   should also explain that as I am Chairman of the

firm and also Director in overall charge of work done on behalf

of the Club,             Mr Strange's notes of telephone conversations are

all     placed        before         me.     They    have         the         dual    function both      of

recording what had been discussed and incorporating, always in

 square brackets,               Mr Strange's comments/views where appropriate

 i„ order          that I shall be awareof                     these before he and I come to

 have our          own discussions.                      In the circumstances Mr                    Strange

 did        not    indicate          to     Mr.     Chester             his    personal     view of      the

 proposal          that      a gate         should be          used to permit entry to the

’ground for ail-ticket matches.                                It       anybody was- to -communicate .

 those views,               then it was             for me          to do so.              Moreover,     the

 moment was not appropriate because we were still working on our

  proposals.               Anyway we knew that once a scheme had been agreed

  in principle with the Club it would have to be submitted to the

  working Party,               a process which indeed we had already begun, as

  I have          indicated,          on     9th April            1985         by sending our d r a w m g

  6705/2 to S. W. C. C.


  94         Following the conversation with Mr. Chester on 25th April

      1,85 we sent to him new drawing No.                                 6705/4 on 26th April !985

      (pages      1 1 8 - 1 1 9 ).         On 1st May 1985 Mr. Chester telephoned to

      ask    for our         -guess-        of     the       likely       cost of implementing the
                              f   « 1201                                       This was for the purpose
      scheme in its then form (page 120).                                      This

                                                         -   40     -
of a meeting of the Club Board of Directors due to take place

the       next     day.             On       the   following               day,    2nd       May    1985,    we

delivered our letter (pages                        121   - 1 2 2 ) with our broad estimate.

This was           £66, 600.       in respect of the proposals for changes to

turnstiles,               fences       and    gates          appearing            on     drawing       6705/4

(including the proposed radial fence on the west terrace), such

figure        to     Include       professional              fees;                and    £60,700.,      again

including           professional             fees,    for the              necessary         consequential

works to lavatories and refreshment areas under the west stand.

 we also mentioned certain other separate works.                                                   However, in

 relation to the re-organisation scheme the total cost estimate

 was £127, 300.


 95   .     On 2nd May           1985 S. Y. C. C.            confirmed            (pages      123-125)      that

 our        earlier         proposals          submitted              to     them       in    the     form    of

" drawing          6705   /2 ,” which by how had been overtaken, was generally

 acceptable to the working party subject to an additional gate

  being provided between turnstile No.                                     16 and the wall proposed

  to        abut     it    as    shown        on   drawing            6705/2.            Requirements         for

  minimum widths of gates in the areas outside the stadium itself

  were also indicated,                   I understand at the request of the Fire

  service.             The relevant measurements are shown in manuscript on

  the copy of drawing 6705/2 which S. Y. C. C. returned to us

   (page           125).    Other        conditions           were          also        imposed      concerning

  radial fences and extra gates in the perimeter fence (aspects

  with which I have dealt elsewhere in this statement).



      96.     At     this       time    we    were       involved            in discussions            with the

      police primarily concerning the radial fences.                                                We were due


                                                         -   41   -
to have a meeting with them on 8th May 1985.                                                     On the previous

day,       however,            we    received             a telephone               call       from Mr. Chester

(page       120)         to indicate that the Club's                                 Board felt unable to

expend £120, 000. on the general scheme as it was then proposed.



97   .     On    13th May                1985    Mr.      Chester wrote to me asking                                 for a

meeting           at      Hillsborough                "to    consider the                   full        implications,

operations and costings- of the proposed scheme.                                                         It should be

remembered that this was the Monday following the Saturday on

which           the      fire       at     Bradford              City      Football            ground         had     taken

 place.          I    duly met Mr. Chester on Friday 17th May 1985.                                                   It is

 ny recollection of                        such meeting that Mr.                            Chester voiced the

 concern of the Club- s Board at the likely cost of the proposed

 scheme.                 He    was        looking           for       areas       where         savings           might    be

 effected.                He said that the scheme needed to be considerably
 s i m p l i f i e d ;        also that" the existing                           t u r n s t i l e s -   twenty-three.).

 were           adequate            in    number,           but he         requested              that        two    of    the

  turnstiles which served the west stand should be re-allocated

  to       the north stand.


     98.     At          this        juncture               it        is       appropriate                   to     give    my

     understanding of the Club's position with regard to the cost of

     ground improvements.                             I   believe that the Club had built up a

     reserve             for    the        proposed              works         of      re-arrangement                 at    the

     Leppings Lane end and for other major works in the ground.                                                             The

     fire        at      Bradford           Football             Club      took        place            as    indicated

     Saturday 11th May 1985.                                 The south stand at Hillsborough had

     timber            decking.                 The       Club        therefore             realised,             after     the

      Bradford fire,                 that works would have to be carried out to the


                                                                  -   42   -
south stand.               In the event the decking had to he covered with

continuous       steel       sheets      with non-slip surfaces                  at a cost of

£59, 280    exclusive          of ■ professional                fees.      This    was   a    new

commitment which, of course, had to be and was met promptly.



99.   Moreover,         during that 1984/85 season the firm had reason

to inspect           the cantilever roof of the south stand which was

leaking.        when some of the roof sheeting had been removed we

found that the main bottom chord steel member of the cantilever

trusses were badly rusted.                  There had been significant loss of

metal.          It    was     essential     in        the       interests    of    safety     that

 removal of the rust and repainting be carried out during the

 Summer     of        1985.           The    cost           was     £67, 900      exclusive     of

 professional fees.             Curing of the leaks cost another £12,640.



 100. After the meeting with Mr. Chester on 13t,. May 1985, I was.

 away for a few days and was unable therefore to inform

 Mr   Strange         of    what   Mr.    Chester          had discussed with me.               Mr

 Strange's note of a telephone conversation with Mr. Chester on

 22nd May 1985 (page 132) refers.                               The writing at the foot of

  the note is mine, indicating to Mr Strange that he and I should

  set aside time for discussion on 28th May 1985.



  101. By 4th June 1985 we had prepared a                                   revisedscheme in line

  with     Mr    Chester's         requests.           The        scheme    is    illustrated in

  drawings       numbered respectively                 6705/5 and 6705/8A (pages               135-

  136) which were sent to the                        Club under cover of our letter                 of

  that date (page 133-134).

drawing    6705/5    existing     turnstiles              Nos.    17       and   18    were    to

remain but the alternative            in drawing 6705/8A involved their

removal and the realignment of the fence which at that time ran

from the      corner of turnstile No. 18 to the iron gates which

formed the boundary of Hillsborough itself adjoining Leppings

Lane.       As my firm's letter of 4th June 1985 indicates, we had

discerned      a    potential    "pinch          point"          when       spectators        were

leaving the ground.             Were turnstiles Nos.                    17 and 18 and the

 fence to remain in position the scheme in drawing 6705/5 would

 provide    inadequate      space     for        spectators            leaving        the   south

 stand,    the south west        terrace and the west stand.                           The exit

 time would have been in excess of the eight minutes recommended

 by the 1976 Guide.         The revised scheme in drawing 6705/8A gave

 a greater width         (an extra iron gateway) for spectators leaving

" t h e ground-at that point.         W e       also P r o s e d that t h e . « a Vi9ned

  fence should be constructed from metal sheets so that home and

  visiting supporters would be unable to see each other as they

  queued to enter the ground.


  103. on the 12th June 1985 Mr. Chester of the Club acknowledged

  our       letter and     the    accompanying                        drawings showing          the

   (page    137)    to   ascertain    their        views.                  We were     uncertain,

   however,    which scheme he wished us to put forward.                                    On 17th
                                                                      of    the Club        seeking

   „r. Chester's return he informed us that the Club preferred the

scheme      shown       on    drawing        No.       6705/8A.            Because     of    the

particular            interest       of      the   Police          in    any     proposed    re­

organisation,           on 25th' June           1985 we          submitted a copy of our

drawing No.           6705/8A to them requesting comments                         (page 142).

Approval was given orally by Inspector Calvert in a telephone

full set of drawings to Mr.                     Chester with our letter dated 8th

July 1985           (page 151) and told him of the oral approval of the

Police.


 104     on 5th July              1985 we had submitted a Planning Application

 for    the      scheme      to    SCC as the Local Planning Authority                      (pages

 1 4 5 - 1 4 8 ).            on     the   same     day       we    had    also    submitted     an

 A p plication for Building Regulation approval to the Director of

 Design and Building Services of SCC.


  105       At      that     stage     the      firm     were      involved      in   urgent    and

  intensive work in the preparation of detailed working drawings

  both      to      Place    before       the   working          party and       for use by     the

  contractors who were to carry out the work.                                  The Applications

  for       Planning         Permission         and      Building        Regulation      approval

aspects of the proposals in connection with the turnstiles, and

to realignment of hand railing.


106. There        followed         a    meeting    of    the    working          party    at    the

ground on 7th August 1965 at which the Deputy Secretary of the

Club and I were present.                       Minutes       are to be found at pages

 160-162.             The     working         party     were       able     to    witness        the

 construction of the new works which were being carried out to a

 very tight programme so as to have them completed by the start

 of the next season later in August.                           They were duly completed

 in time.


  107     At a meeting of the working party on 22nd January 1966,

 after      more      than     half      'a   season      of    experience,            the     Police

  reported         that      the        scheme     for       the      revised          segregation

  arrangements         at the Leppings Lane end "worked well on by far

  the majority of occasions                   (page 173)

   108.    I was not at the match on 15th April 1989.                                  I arrived at

   the     ground      at    approximately            4.40     p.m.       and    carried       out     an

   inspection          in    the       immediate      aftermath.                With     the    Club's

   approval the firm did tests on some of the crush barriers the

   next day,          Sunday      16th April.           The crush barrier of which two

   spans collapsed and those of which one length of the horizontal


                                                  - 46 -
rail had visibly deformed,               had not been designed by my firm,

but were       original      barriers      (probably           from   1965 or earlier).

The radial fences and peiimeter fence were all intact although

there    was       some    deformation     of       the       framing of the perimeter

fence.         I    understand     that    parts          of    the   wire    mesh   on     the

perimeter fence were cut away by spectators and/or the rescue

services on 15th April in order to gain access to the terracing

and to allow spectators to escape onto the pitch.



 109.    The two barriers which were permanently deformed on 15th

 April Nos.         128 and 137 were tested in turn.                       In each case the

 load was applied in increments of one-quarter of the test load

 until the test load of 6 W » e t r e                     specified in the 1986 Guide

 was     reached.            The   forward          deflection        of    the   barrier    was

 measured.           It was found to be behaving elastically,                        with the

 deflection increasing proportionally to the applied load.                                   The

 deflection was within the range expected for a barrier of this

 type which is in good condition.                          When the load was released,

  the deflection of the barrier was fully recovered.                                 It should

  be noted that some permanent deflection is allowed by the

  Guide (the recovery only needs to be 75% - see Annex C of the

  Guide).           The test load was reapplied so as to give the three

  cycle, of loading,             each of five minutes duration, specified in

  Annex     0.            Each time the load was                 removed,     there was      full

  recovery.


   no.    It       was    then   decided    to       determine        the    approximate      load

   which had been applied to the barriers during the incident on

   15th April.              It is possible to infer what this load had been


                                                -    47   -
2>y reloading      to     the point where                the barrier ceases              to behave

elastically.                   The    load      at       which      it     starts     to     behave

plastically,            an d     therefore            begins        to     develop       permanent

deformation,       is     in    effect       the     load      which had been applied on

15th April.



111.    Barrier    128     was       the   stronger         of    the    two.       It     began to

deform plastically at a load of 9kN/metre.                                  This is 1. 8 times

the design       load of 5kN/metre,                 and     1. 5 times the test load             (it

will be recalled that the test load is itself an overload).



112.    Barrier    137 was not quite so strong.                            It began to deform

plastically       at     a load of approximately 7. 5kN/metre.                              This is

1. 5 times the design load and 1. 25 times the test load.



113.    These test results on the two barriers which Suffered some

permanent deformation on 15th April,                             but continued to function,

show    that     their     strength was              very      comfortably      above      the   test

load required by the 1986 Guide.                            It was not possible to apply

the     test   load     to the barrier which                     collapsed,     but      in view of

the     fact that it had very satisfactorily carried the test load

in     July    1988,     it     is   reasonable           to     believe    that    it     failed   on

 15th    April    1989         because     it      was    subjected        to   a   significantly

greater crowd pressure than is envisaged in the 1986 Guide.

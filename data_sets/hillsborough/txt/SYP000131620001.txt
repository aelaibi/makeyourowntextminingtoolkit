         Dear Sir

         HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

         I write following our telephone conversation of 23 April 1990 and in
         follow-up to the letter of 2 March 1990 sent to you by Mr Mervyn Jones,
         Assistant Chief Constable.

         It is my intention to have available the video and photographic material
         likely to be used in interview with your client, for your early perusal.

         I have set aside from 1030 hours until 1700 hours on Tuesday 8 May 1990
         and from 0930 hours until 1600 hours on Wednesday 9 May 1990 for this
         purpose. The material for perusal will be available at Furnival House,
         Furnival Gate, Sheffield S1 4QN. The telephone number there is


         At the same time this will give you the opportunity of viewing the
         interview facilities on site. There is no objection to your client
         being present at this time, although anything you may wish to discuss
         with myself will have to take place separately. I will be available
         throughout the two days.

         If you have any queries beforehand I can be contacted at Nechells Police
         Station in Birmingham on

         I trust the arrangements made are suitable for you and your client.

         Yours faithfully

were    no q u e u e ’s at the tur fM^t i l e s .         I just went       straight    in.     I handed

my ticket       in.     There were StewaNj^s and Police about                      by the

turnstiles.           Once    inside the ground there were more Police Officers

and    I was searched.            I did not see any gates             open other       than the

turnstiles        gates.       I did not see anyone            climbing over         the walls       to get

into    the ground.



Inside       the ground       I did not see any^s^igns directing                   to the m atch

viewing       point,    all    I saw was        the tunnel . \ T h e r e    were    some Stewa rd s     by

the tunnel        but no Police Officers                  I walked         rough the tunnel          which

was    quite empty and           into Pen 3.         I did not      see anyone       drunk or

fightino       inside the qround.            was in the Pen            ready to w a tc h the match

      'I saw a lot of          people      fall    forward and go down.                 As they were             getting

      up agai n I saw that a crush b a r r 1                      hjd&Agiven

      feet behind         it and about          the same        distance    to the side          towards           the

      tunnel.        I could see that             some    people were       having       trouble        getting up

      and      I presumed that          people would be           injured.           I. was still       being         pushed

      a r o u n d the Pen and          I eventtt^lly ended up against                   the fence           into Pen 2 .

                    during     the     crush and     I climbed over            the f"ksjnce into Pen 2.
                                                                                                (S c O io   '<x> f^ n c J L    ■
       "here was a lot of              room    in pen 2.         I then made my                 on to the             pitch

      through the gate            in the front           fence,



      W he n    I go'TsNonto     the    pitch there were           injured       people all         over      the

      place.        There w e H        people     giving m outh to m outh and heart massage                                   to

      other       people.      I saw faYts^carrying              injured    people on a dv er ti si ng

      h oardinqs      down to the other             eTfsL of the ground so I helped                     to do this,

      I made a bout 3 journeys                 carrying        injured fans.           I saw that there were

      fans     by the goal        on the       pitch at the L eo pings Lane                  end that were

      ob vi o us l y dead because             someone     had    covered their          heads and they were

      not moving.



      After       helping    carry the fans          to the       other    end       I came    back     down again

      and sat down behind the goal my ankle was                            hurting       it was       swollen from

      being       in the P en and        I was     having       trouble\breathing.              I rested for

      about       10 mi nutes     then     I hear^Kan announcenieryt\ that                   the game was

      so    I d ecided to        leave the ground at X b o u t             1530 hrs          (1550).         I went            back

                      I did not         have any treatment                           ankle    I just        strapped               it

      up and after a couple of days                      it was alright.

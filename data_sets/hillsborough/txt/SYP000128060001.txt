               9 .OOam - On duty at E c -cIe s f ie 1d Police -Station, High Street,

                          Ecclesfield.        Transported down to Hi 1Isborough Football

               Once at the ground I attended the briefing given by Chief

               Superintendent Duckenfield, after which I commenced patrol                   in a

               transit of the Stocksbrisge area,.             My Sergeant on that transit was PS

               1347 Hunt and our sector commander was Inspector walker who

               accompanied us throughout the pat rol«                 Our patrol was mainly confined

               to the Stocks bridge area which was our allotted duty but as our sector

               commander was with us we occasionally visited the Dee pear and

               Ought bridge areas -    There were only a small number of local public

               houses in these three areas that were serving drinks to the Liverpool

               fans and although due to the fact I was the driver of the transit I
did     not -     check             any       of     the       public                houses,           as        did        my        supervisors,                       the

tans        did       not       appear             to     be        causing                any problems,.

At    2,45        p, iTi„       that          date        we        were             parkedsta tio n a ry                        in        the    Oughthrxdge

We    then            approached                the        entrance             to    the       tunnel               leading            to     the

At    th is           point       we    were           still          not       aware       of       what           had     happened                and       we       went

down      the          tunnel.              I    went           to    the       le ft      of    the           dividing             ra ilin g s              and       met

th is     I went             down         Ihe      terrace                and    manged          to        get       onto          the       perimeter

track.                At    this       point           I    re a lise d          there          had        been        some         sort           of     d isa ste r

but     I thought                 it    must           have          been       over.           However > I l o o k e d                        to my          right

to    where            an    ambulance                 was       parked          and       saw       o ffic e rs            pulling                bodies          out

of    the         terrace           through                the       gate.           Upon       seeing              th is      I    went           to     a s s is t

bodies            for       signs       of        life          but       it    was       obvious              they       were          dead.             Sometime

la te r       I       turned       to       look           onto       the       pitch       in       front           of     the         goal        and       saw

               At 0830 on Saturday 15 April 1989,                 I reported at Hackenthorpe in full

               Police Uniterm,             1 was deployed on serial           3» supervised by    PS    1088

               ground whereupon            all serials were briefed,.           The deployment of       serial

               was on the South            Stand entrances 21 to 28,

               I was outside turnstiles entrance F, searching fans who were entering

               by trial turnstile..           I remained at that location until approx 1503

               whereupon I was asked by another Sergeant to help clear the way along

               the s ids of the South Stand so as to enable ambulances to leave the

               ground with casualties at this stage I became aware of a problem

               inside the ground..

               After assisting with the clearance of the passageway I then went to

               the entrance 19 22 E entrance to assist other officers who were

               he 1 pi ng with casualties from inside the ground.                    For the next few
           hours    Iwas      assisting          with       carrying            casualties             from      ins ids        the

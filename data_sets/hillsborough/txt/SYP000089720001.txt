            On Saturday 15th April               1989 (150489)          I attended the Football

            Association Challenge Cup Semi-Final                        game at Hillsborough Football

            Stadium, Sheffield,           between Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham

            Forest Football Club.


                               c/vr
             I am a supporter of Liverpool Football Club,
                                                                          J          have supported the

             club all my life,            I have been attending games at Anfield since I was

             about ten years old.            I am a season ticket holder.                 I got my semi­

             final ticket from Liverpool Football Club,                         using my season ticket

             voucher.          It was a six pound ticket for the Leppings Ln terraces.



             I hired a mini-bus from Leasowe Van Hire                         in Prescot R d , whi ch I drove

             to Sheffield,         travel 1ing with me were the following named p eo pl e .

On the morning of Saturday 15th April      1989 (150489), myself and my

brother          collected the hire van and at about       10.30am (1030),       I

went to my m o t h e r ’s house in                               where we

collected,                                                 and



We then collected                     from his home address,



At about    11.15am (1115) we went to the home of                 in

               and collected,             Tony OWfcN,

          and Gary CHURCH.



At about    11.30am (1130) we collected]_____________ in

             , and commenced our journey to Sheffield.

                                                                                          S3398



                   I cannot recall the exact seating arrangements      in the rear of the v a n ;

                   but 1 can say that Gary CHURCH was seated in the double seat

                                                   I cannot   recall who was seated next to

                   Gary C HU R C H . ______________was seated in the single seat opposite Gary

                   CHURCH.



                   1 was   driving the mini-bus and during the course of the journey I had

                   no conversation with Gary CHURCH.



                   We trave 1 led to Sheffield via the M 5 7 , M62 andr M1 Motorways


                                       O V T   f i£ A y ^ | c
                   We experienced a few travel delays o^i tp &   M62 Motorway because of

                   heavy traffic and roadworks.



                   After   leaving the motorway and driving towards Sheffield we were

                   stopped in a Police stop check.     They ^ h ee ke d the vehicle for
& € J \C £ H & k
^ ,                alcohol.  After doing this the Polic/ placed a sticker on the van, and
6~/                -------
                   Respite this, we were stopped ai|^aj^r a short distance away from the

                   first stop check.



                   On driving through Sheffield towards Hillsborough,      I saw public houses

                   open with football supporters outside them drinking beer.



                   As we approached the football ground, we got directions from the

                   Police to a car-park.    The car-park was for vans and mini-buses and

                   was just off a main dual   carriageway,    I think the Penistone Rd,     We

                   parked the van at about 2.10pm (1410).



                   1 walked down to the ground from the car-park with
                                                                                      PAGE          4
                                                                                      S3398



            X cannot say who Gary CHURCH walked down to the ground with.             After we

            had all   left the mini-bus we got amongst the crowd walking down

            towards the ground,    I think the others were following on behind us.



            We received no Police directions or escort to the ground, we just

            followed the crowds.

            As best as 1 can recall the last time I saw Gary CHUF££fl was at about
                                        — ... —  -...        V_,u
            2.10pm (1410), when we all left the mini-bus in the car-park, to the

            best of my knowledge at that time he was fit and well



            I arrived outside the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground at about 2.

            15pm (1415).



            During the walk to the ground 1 had seen lads standing around drinking

            cans of beer,   but I never saw any signs of disorder,          fighting or

            drunkenn ess.



            On arriving at the entrance to the ground,            I could see a lot of people

            milling about   in Leppings Lane and whatyi would describe as two

            separate masses of people stret chi no/back from the turnstiles to the
 cA T       area of the outer perimeter g a t e s /   I could see one policeman on
P a u c ^
            horseback   in the middle? of this/mass of people who were approaching
  'YT       the turnstiles. He was I t ry i nor to separate the crowd into queues,            but
u.          because he was on his d w n X his efforts were wasted,



            I joined onto the crowd heading to the turnstiles with my brother

                                   and                             Everyone at the front was

towards the turnstiles.            It was a very severe crush in the crowd

approaching the turnstiles,            I was getting    crushed to such an extent

that I found it difficult to breath.



The four of us eventually gained entrance to the ground through a

turnstile at about 2,30pm (1430).            I handed my ticket into the

turnstile operator.



I had not seen         any stewards   in the area approaching the turnstiles,



I   had not seen       any gates open other than the turnstiles gates,



1 had not seen         any unauthorised entry to the ground.



After getting        into   the ground I purchased a match programme and went

to the toilet.



Myself,              my brother,                  and                       all

                      3 1 ^e r^ft iabout 2.35pm
entered the tunnel toget                                (1435)



I had not seen any signs directing me to/the terraces,              but I had bean

              f
    had n o t !see     ny Police or Stewards   in the area of the entrance to

the tunnel\or          long its length.



Between entering the ground and getting onto the terraces              I saw no

signs of disorder,           I did not see anyone drinking alcohol     inside the

g round«

                                                                                    S3398



        On getting to the end of the tunnel        I could see the terraces were

        crowded and the four of us worked our way over to our left and forward

          wn the terracing to a position 1 have marked as number one               (1) on
S.O<£   the separate grid plan which I produce           (Ex No        ) (Ref No       1) .

        We arrived at position (1) at about 2.40 pm/C 1440 >.          We stood in this

        position for about 3 o r 4 minutes and during this t ime we were be i ng

        crushed quite badly as more       people / r e    coming   into the pen (number 4)



                             was getting worried,        so we decided to move over to

        our left towards the ter races over by the North Stand s i de of the

        ground which I could see were fairly quiet.



        At a time I would say was about 2.50pm (1450), we had managed to work

        our way across    pen number four to a position I have marked as            (1A ) on

        the separate grid plan.



        Duri ng the time we had been in the terraces the crush had been getting

        worse.



        We stood in position     (1A5   for about 5 to 10 minutes.       Shortly after

        getting to this position,       I can remember     people around me screaming

        out for he 1p .   I saw people shouti ng up at a po1 i ceman who was

        standi ng up in the West S t a n d , for he 1p .    I saw this policeman just

        looking out towards the pitch,       ignoring these cries for help.          I could

        not recognise or describe this policeman.



        Whilst   in position (1A) ____________________|, who is only a small bui 11

        lad, was pani cki ng because of the worsening         crush.

          All four of us then moved over to a position marked (2) on the

          separate grid plan.         I think we got to this position just as the game

          had kicked off at 3pm <1500)



          The crush was still        increasing in intensity^     so I pushed

                          over the fence into the smal/f alleyway      (pen number 5)

          was trying to get over the dividing/fence myself,            but was having

F^XJT&IUL^if f i cul^y *     Then I thi nk it wasy'when BEARDSLEY hit the crossbar at

   7""    the other end of the ground,         Vne crowd all moved forwards and gave me

          enough room to movefand I managed to climb over the fence into pen

          riumber five myself



          I walked down the pen towards the pitch and as I did so I looked back

          up the terracing and I saw that my brother                 had also got himself

          into pen f j t 'v e ,



          Myself and                           got out through the gate at the end of

          pen number five and went onto the pitch.          At this time there were a

          lot of people out on the track around the pitch and as we went onto

          the pitch I could see all the players running off the pitch.



          I ran up to a policeman who was standing by the goal.             I told him that

          people were       in trouble on the terraces and he just told me it was all

          under    control.



          I then walked over to the area of the corner flag N Stand side with

                                  and met my brother______ |and



          The four of us then went up into the North Stand.             Whilst we were

          there                   joined us.   At first none of us realised what had
                                                                             PAGE     8
                                                                             S3398

happened until we saw bodies being           carried across the pitch on

stretchers and hoardings.



I cannot remember how long we stopped in the N Stand,            but we

eventually went back down onto the pitch and then we saw                        and

some of our other travelling           companions.   Eventually all of our group

of twelve were together on the pitch,           except                    and Gary

CHURCH,



                sai d      had been taken away by a St Johns Ambulanceman

because he had been injured.           At that time we realised Gary CHURCH was

mi ss i n g .



                went off to find                     the rest of us waited for

                and       to return.    After they returned, Gary CHURCH had

still not appeared.         Tony OWEN said he thought that Gary had met some

friends he knew from               in the ground, and we wondered if he had

gone home with them.



At about 4.30pm         (16305 we left the ground and the eleven of us

returned to the mini-bus.



When Gary CHURCH failed to return to the mini-bus, we drove to a

Police Station and I thi nk Tony OWEN reported Gary CHURCH as a missing

person to the Police.



From the Police Station we were sent to a hall nearby where we were

told to wait for any news of Gary CHURCH.



I think it was about 6.30pm         (18305   by the time we got to the hall.
                                                                            PAGE      9
                                                                            S3398



At about 7 . 3 0 pm (1930),   the same night, myself,      Tony OWEN and a male

social worker who was on duty at the hall, went with a local              resident

to his house and Tony OWEN telephoned Gary C H U R C H ’S mother to see if

he had got home.       Gary's mother said he h a d n *t got home and Tony put

the phone down.



Later the same night, at about           10.30pm (2230), Tony OWEN,

                                          and                       were taken from

the hall   in a bus and were taken back to the football ground to make

enqui r ies about Gary C H U R C H .    They returned at about   11.30pm (2330),

it was then that myself and the rest of our group were told that Gary

CHURCH had died at the ground.



The eleven of us travelled back to Liverpool            together.



During the time I was       in the football ground I did not see the barrier

break in pen number three.



I was not injured myself.



I   did not personally witness any deaths.           I did not assist any of the

dead or injured persons.



I did not witness anything on that day which I considered to be a

criminal offence.



I   attended the 1988 (000088) Semi-Final and I can say that the

policing of last year's game            was much better organised than itwas on

       organisation by the Police this year was a factor in causing the

       deaths and injuries.



       At last year's game the Police were stopping fans away from the

       ground, who were drinking, also last year I never saw any pubs or
                                       <£                           ______
       outdoors open.  This year I saw people drinking outside pubs at 2pm

       (1400).     The Police should not have allowed fans to stay drinking at

       pubs so late into the afternoon.          If the pubs had not been open the

       fans would have gone down to the ground earlier rather than later.



       I   would also like to add that after 1 got out of pen number four into

       pen five,    1 saw a policeman at the gate at the end of pen five,             trying

       to close the exit gate and a policewoman arguing with him,                insisting

       the gate be left open;       the gats was left a p frflT ~ " After   I got out onto

       the pitch it was obvious to me from the/look on the faces of some of
orr
       the many police officers who were ji/t standing around doing nothing,

      ) that they hadn't got a clue whatyto do.           I do not blame the individual

       officers,    they should have been directed by senior officers.              It was

       obvious to me that they were getting no orders,             so they just stood



 •
       around.



       One or two individual    officers were diving in and helping,             but it just

       seemed to me that there was no organisation.



       As I have previously stated I had not met Gary CHURCH before the 15th

       of April    1989 (150489).     I was not introduced to Gary on that day and

       as far as I can recall       I had no conversation with him.



       1 would describe Gary as a white male, aged about             18 or 19 years.     1

       think he had fair hair.        I can't really remember much more about his

app earan ce.



I would like to add that the severe lack of Police organisation on

that day was the major factor in causing the deaths and injuries.



I also got the impression that the Police were not trained to

recognise obvious signs of distress.       They appeared to be only

concerned with dealing with hooliganism.       What was people in extreme

distress,   they interpreted as a pitch invasion and were not seeing

what was actually occurring   in the terraces.

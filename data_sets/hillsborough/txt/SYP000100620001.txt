 9.45 (0945)

 Briefing by Chief Supt Duckenfield.

 Briefing was similar to that given at previous semi-finals.   Chief Supt

 Duckenfield stated that there was no provision for the kick off\ to be

 delayed.

 First Meal.

 11.30 (1130)

 Onto track side, my position was North Stand, 20 yds from the Leppings

 Lane end.

 11.50 ( 1150)

 First few fans trickle into ground.

 2.00 (1400)

 Second meal.    I went to get meal tickets from PS Chapman at players'

 tunnel and he was in conversation with a Club Official.   I heard that at
      /)




V
2.00 p.m. (1400) there were     only12,000 fans in the ground. I told     this

to one of my colleagues at meal.

2.20 (1420)

Meal taken - canteen shut at 2.00 p.m. (1400)

2.40 (1440)

Resume position.   At this time Kop appeared full, Leppings Lane centre

sections both full and steps still visible in the corner sections, first

few fans climbing up into West Stand but I thought this was to get a

better view.

2.45 (1445)

Radio message to send two       morehorses up   to Leppings Lane   end.    The

crowd was massing outside.

2.50 (1450)

Many fans climbing into West Stand - hears Supt Marshall on the radio

saying how big the crowd was.    It appeared to me that the centre section

was now full and the steps were still visible in the corner sections.

2.55 (1455)

Liverpool team come onto the pitch, PC Buxton outside at Leppings Lane

end asks for kick off to be pub back, he says "You'll have to put it

back".   As the Notts Forest team take to the pitch I looked at the main

stand clock, it was just gone 2.56 (1456), I thought they were late, the

answer to PC Buxton was "The match will go ahead, one of the teams is

already on the pitch".   Supt Marshall says that a gate must be opened to

prevent fatalities outside the ground.

2.58 (1458)

Fans start coming out of the North Stand onto the track from the first

tunnel waving tickets asking where their seats are.         I put them back
    /?
into the stand and tell them to walk beneath and find the appropriate

tunnel.   More fans come out as game kicks off, 3-00 (1500), fans at

Leppings Lane end start to come over fence behind the goal; Supporters

in North Stand are shouting 'Shitty Ground, Shitty Ground', etc, as more

pour over the fences.     Control give message regates going to be opened.

Permission given to open gates to North Stand.    Then a large roar behind

me (apparently Peter Beardsley had hit the cross bar) still trying to

get fans into stand.      Impossible now so just trying to get them to sit

on the track, some are    walkingaround from Leppings Lane end.

3.05 (1505)

Play is just behind me and I turn and see ball go for a Notts Forest

corner.   I then realise that there is a Policeman on the pitch, by now

fans spilling onto pitch behind the goal.

3-06 (1506)

Match stops.

Man from the stand grabs me and says he can see his son in the melee, I

take him onto the pitch and we find him and return him to the side of

the pitch.     I try to get dazed and winded fans to sit at the side of the

pitch but few respond.

A press   cameraman grabs me and     shows me a man laid   face down in the

turf, I   ask him what hurts and he said his back so Itook his pulse -

strong - and tried to get him to move his toes.     He smelt of alcohol.     I

asked how much he had drunk and he said two or three pints.       Some fans

brought   a board but as the man had hurt his back I        didn't want him

moved.    Soon an ambulance man (a Liverpool fan not on    duty) checked the

man and said we could move him,       some fans were there instantly with

                        .rried the man at a run to the bottom corner of the

             pitch.   We put him down and looked to our left where a man on a board

             looked dead.       We left the other man and PC Hanson (2348) gave mouth to

             mouth as I pushed his chest and tried to

                            A nurse - Notts Forest fan not on duty - tried but to no

             avail and we carried the body behind the North Stand and into the gym to

             get it out of the public view.         Once inside I saw at least 30 other

             bodies   already    laid   out.   Three Liverpool   fans   and a tall Special

             Constable carried a body (body no 48) - Gary Collier, 22 years - and put

             it next to me.        I took it off the special and dealt with the sudden

A particular point on Ifta statements               of    ie'iff' and .piKfop' arising
from Duckenflaid*a svidence.


’
4h&a m m     cross sx-arained Ouefcenftaid ha quickly jot the necessary
admission that K and K had coma io Ihe PCS at about 3.15 and
0 had not       told K and & that police had ordered the gate to be
ip&nsd, but      aerelythat a gate had fraen #psnsd and fans antared.
B& did not       acceptthat he had     told K sad K that a gate had
been forced. That m s good enough          for our purposes and John did
not put to Q that K and X had             been shown a picture
iaroonstratimj s4mt hod Happened.


In cross from other parties it bs emerged that one of the iron
suter perimeter gates was forced by fans, In the sense that
police got it shut to relieve the crush at the turnstllss and
tha press t?f the crowd forced It d>pen. Of the crucial inner
 shutter" gates, C was opened by 0*s order and A was than
opened, also    by 0's sarder, after 0 was opened in response to
a radio iaassage that the sjaie «#uuid otherwise collapse from the
press.


The   police in the control room had m> yideoview showing        aither
*}ate £ or A     directly. The ?ideo camera shows along;, not across,
*;he walls in which those gates are situated,      fha video could
however have   shown the perimeter gate which is said to have bean
forced by fans.

la order to decide whether it is now advisable or necessary to
put   to tha police that K and K urera showna picture, we       need
to know with greater precision v^iat they were shawm, First, was
it on video     screen or a photograph <there m r a already police
photographers operating by 3,15)? Secondly, was it a barred iron
jate <ie the     perimeter gate) or a aoiid 'shutter* gate? -
pointing outthat in ay view it m s not possible       for  the yideo
to show them a shut tar gate.
  'This n a M s to be discussed teith K and I on 'Tuesday m o r n in g
  because the wits&sa to swhoa it should ba put                        i /«?
  control    ro©m> will fee called next after the prosent    witness
 #^lfatSSi -a&d sould well bebeing x x by Tuesdayearly pn»
-‘                                                                   1 can
 of course put a non-leading question, but will         look prettysilly
  if Taylor than asks what my case is about the type of gate
-shown.

:'»a.ld   you therefore fcelsphone K and   K   on   tuasday    worning?    m
.joems    ho have the claarsr #eoory.


■% own view of tfiat probably happened, for what               is «K>rthf. i a
                                                              It
 that is*hen 0 rafsrred to the forcing of a gate,             ha
                                                               meant on tha.
screen iho outer periaeter gate, and by failing           i as he adnits)
to tall it and k that he had then ordered the             shutter gate to
fea opened he gave a fatally false imprassion.

                                                    am a ma rri ed man         living at the above ad dre ss

              wi t h my family.



              At about     1215 pm on S a t u r d a y    15th April,          1989   (150489)       I left work        in

             M a n c h e s t e r and st art ed driving    towards my home              in               De rbyshi r e .



             A sh ort whi le a f t e r w a r d s at about    quarter          to one    (1245 hrs)      I got      onto

             the M67 at         it's   j u nc ti on at Den to n and starte d to drive along                   it

              toward s    the Mo t t r a m   junction.



             As     I passed Ju n c t i o n 3 on the M67       I saw that all               three   lanes on the

             motorway      came to a sud de n halt.          There     had been no previous w a r n i n g

              g iv en of any delays ahead.
                                                                                                           PAGE        2
                                                                                                           S1129



            I then had to drive               slowly behind other         cars    in the traffic        co ngestion

            and    it took me forty five minut es                 to   reach the end of the M 6 7 , wh ic h

            is the        next    jun ct io n after J u n c t i o n 3.    I usually     cover this distance

            ever yda y      in about      four to five minutes.
C'rr
       C.
            I notice d that a m a j o r i t y of the traffic a h e a d of me con si st ed of

            vans,        cars and     coaches m a i n l y of Li verpool      supporters.         I can say

            that    the suppor ter s were m a i n l y Li verpool            Su pp or te rs     because most of

            them were wearing             the Liver poo l     football     team    colours and di splaying

            Li v er po ol    team scarves.

 •          I could see that             some   of these     su pporters     were drinking           from cans of

            beer,        and after     they had drunk        from their      cans they were           th rowing them

            onto the        carriageway.         There were several          cans all   over     the

            ca rr ia ge way an d       I can recall       seeing about       12 empty    cans of Ste ll a

            A rt o i s    lager    dum pe d   in a heap on the         central    reservation.



            As    I ap p ro a c h e d the     part of the m o t o r w a y where     it turns     into a two

            lane     carriageway,         from three      lane    ca rr iageway    I saw some        vehicles

            drive along           the hard shoulder        to a v o i d the traffic      queues.



            In view of the time and the                 distance yet to be          covered to arrive at

            Hillsbo rou gh ,         in my op ini on    I feel     that   it wo uld be a close          run thing

            for    them to get to the gro un d on time.



            Also at the           point at the      end of the Mo t o r w a y     reduces from two to three

            lanes,        quite a lot of the football              traffic was      ignoring     the white

            diagonal        ma rkings     on the outside         lane wh ic h was    informing        them that

            the    lanes were         reducing.      The traffic was         carrying    on,    as    if the
                                                                                          PAGE        3
                                                                                          S 1129

             ma rk in gs did not exist, and forcing their way          into the outside of the
            &
             two lanes, ap p r o a c hi ng the moto rw ays end.



              I d i d n ’t notice an y signs   indicating   that   it was a football   traffic

              route,     although   it is a direct   route from Live rp oo l   to Sheffield.

                                                                                         SI G N E D

        We didn't           need one    reaj/ly as there was         no drunkeness              or fighting and

        chaotic.            It seemed    like the entire        city o f /S he ff ie ld was             trying     to

        squeeze        througp two small          turnstiles.        I/have           learned since that

        £4,000        people had had to go through                  m s t i 1 es       in that area.          There

        was     no semblance         of queuing w h a t s o e v e r , just a seething mass of

         bodies.        There was       no police   contnol at all, also there was no

         stewards       present.        Last y ear was ^ii f f e rent altogether, the queuing was

        orderly,        we were      stopped short        >/f the ground and made               to produce         our

        tickets and we were made to yb-ym queues.                          This year there was                none

        of this.  This year we had to struggle our/way to our entrance

        turnstile with great difficulty.  The crufeh was terrible and I

        s u s t a i n e d a badly bruised         leg and arm. / Once            through the turnstiles

        the     pressure was         c ompletely off.      ^It yas      like walking            through      into       an

        open space,           with   police and steward’s^ everywhere

        ^     x\ q   time    did I see any gate other than turnstiles                       open,       neither      did

        I witness           the opening       of any gate or any        person entering               the ground

        illegally.           Once    inside     the ground     I made a point             of finding         a

        p ol iceman with a radio.                I went    to him and begged him to get                      in touch

        *!ith his       control      to tell     them what     the sit ua ti on was             like outside and

            situation.        He as good as       told me what      to| do.           At this        point   I was

            rying and        pleading with him.           He said to me,              "If you d o n ’t like

        matchview           point.     Once    th rough the turnstiles                I saw about       twenty

        p olicemen all          standing       just   inside   the turnstiles,             just standing
                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                       S2544

 round,        a few were       checking    bags but by and          large the m aj or i ty d i d n ’t

 seem to be doing anything.

 Once     I had    reached my seat I looked across                   to the Leppings Ln Stand

land    I could see that           the    centre    pens was     packed solid and you              could

 s ee the       heat haze       rising    from the bodies,        but to the sides           there was

] plenty of space,             however    those    in the    centre    pens    c o u l d n ’t get to this

 space     because       there were       fences    preventing       them spreading        out.         This

 in rny view       is one of the things             that    led to the tragedy.

 I did not witness any deaths                 because       by the time       they started getting

 people        from this stand       I had    left       the stand.     I left the stand               just

 a fter    the kick-off and had gone                to where     they serve the tea on the

 lower     floor.        At this    point    I looked over a concrete wall w hi ch                      is at

 the end of the N or th S tand                and    Isaw a lot of policemen            w ith dogs

 w hi c h were     barking.        It was this       that made me look over             the wall.

 What     I saw was       the    police    dogs and their       handlers and on r eflection                    I

 have     realised that          their    vehicles must       have    been    close by and         I

 believe        that    this    is what    prevented the ambu la nc es           getting     on the

 pitch as this was              the only entrance          I could see that gave direct

 vehicle        access    to the football          pitch.     At about       ten past     three        (151Q)

 I started        to make my way out of             the ground and        I saw then that all                 the

 big gates were           open.

 At no time did           I witness anyone          committing what          I consider      to be a

 criminal        offence.

 On    reflection,        comparing       last y e a r ’s game with this y e a r ’s, was                that

 you had got           exactly the       same s ituation w ith         the same supporters,              with

 people        being    pulled up onto the          Leppings Ln S tand to escape              the       crush.

 The    d ifference was,          however,    with       last y e a r ’s game there was more

 organisation.            The    police were       stopping    people and        checking      their

 tickets.         They had made a perimeter                line and you       c o u l d n ’t get   through

 w ith o u t    showing your       ticket.        Once    through you went        in single        file

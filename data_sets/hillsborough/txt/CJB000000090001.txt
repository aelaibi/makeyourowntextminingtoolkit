SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY - 9 AUGUST 1991
                                                                            3
REPORT OF THE CLERK AND FINANCIAL OFFICER

The Police (Discipline) (Senior Officers) Regulations 1985


1     Hatter for Consideration
1.1 Members are asked to consider the investigation into complaints made against
    ACC Mr Walter Jackson by Mr Trevor Hicks arising out of the Hillsborough
    tragedy. The complaints are:
      1    That he failed to take control of the disaster.
      2    That he may have colluded with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield to
            mislead the public and Senior Police Officers in respect of the opening
            of Gate C in Leppings Lane.
2     Background
2.1   The investigation into these complaints by Mr Lesley Sharpe, Chief Constable
      of Cumbria, (the Investigating Officer) was completed last year and at that
      time the Police Complaints Authority who supervised the investigation
      confirmed that the complaints have been thoroughly and satisfactorily
      investigated.
2.2 At the Authority’s meeting in September 1990 it was resolved to defer
    consideration of the complaints because of the advisability of dealing with
    them in unison with complaints made against other Officers but of lesser
    rank for which the Authority is not the Disciplinary Authority. These other
    complaints also arose out of the tragedy.
2.3 Subsequently at its meeting in October 1990 the Authority resolved to defer
    further consideration of the complaints until the inquests had been
    completed. The reason for this was the possibility of fresh evidence
    emerging at the inquests which might have a bearing on the complaints
    against Mr Jackson. None did emerge.
2.4 Now the decisions have been taken on the complaints against the other
    Officers it is appropriate and urgent that a decision is taken on the
    complaints against Mr Jackson: Urgent because of the debilitating effect
    delay and uncertainty causes.
3     The Authority’s Position as Disciplinary Authority
      The Authority is the Disciplinary Authority for Officers at and above the
      rank of Assistant Chief Constable. Its position in this regard is governed
      by the Police (Discipline) (Senior Officers) Regulations 1985. Under those
      regulations the Authority must consider the Investigating Officers report,
      that is a report of Mr Sharp, which is Appendix 1 and determine whether it
      appears that Mr Jackson may have committed an offence. If it does so appear
      the Authority must then consider whether disciplinary proceedings need to be
      taken. The statements and documents accompanying the investigating officers
      report and which are referred to in the report will be available at the
      meeting but have not been copied because of their volume.
                                                                                                      W   *   *' 'a ;»

        Prosecutions concludes that no criminal charge of Culpable Malfeasance or
        Manslaughter is appropriate then an offence of "neglect of duty" for failinq
        p J h i r°J ■           d]saster cannot be substantiated. The Director of
        Jackson          nS      deci<Jed not to bring any criminal charges against Mr

       the same as "neglect of duty" has been rejected by the J u r f a t the Coronet

       Conclusion

       °I!-t!!euevi?ence of the.Investigating Officers report, and there is nothina
       which has transpired since to offend this evidence, indeed quite the
       contrary as far as the first complaint is concerned given the decision of

       Recommendation
6.1    That members consider the Investigating Officers report and determine that

       proceedings are appropriate.

 CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING CQMPT.ATKTS



 R1    On 15 April 1989 a Football Association Cup Semi

 Final match was played between Liverpool and Nottingham

 Forest Football Clubs at the neutral Sheffield

 Wednesday ground at Hillsborough.   It is well

 documented that shortly after 'kick-off* the match was

 abandoned due to crushing in pens 3 and 4 of the

 Leppings Lane/West Stand terraces, which resulted in

 the death of 95 Liverpool Supporters and injuries to

 many others.




R2     As a result of the tragedy Mr 6 J DEAR, QPM,

Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police was

appointed to investigate the disaster and to collate

evidence for H M Coroner and for a Judicial Inquiry

which was carried out by Lord Justice TAYLOR.     On 27

September 1989 following submission of the TAYLOR

Interim Report into the disaster to the Director of

Public Prosecutions Mr DEAR agreed to accept additional

responsibility for the criminal and disciplinary

aspects of the investigation.   On 1 April 1990, with

the retirement of Mr DEAR, these responsibilities were

transferred to Mr L SHARP, QPM, LLB, Chief Constable of

Cumbria.




R3    Because the deaths and injuries occurred at the

Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough Stadium, this report

concentrates on the Liverpool supporters and the events

which surrounded them on the day of the disaster.

                         (Operations), South Yorkshire Police, in which he

                         details recommended routes to Sheffield, parking

                         arrangements, search procedures and opening times for

                        the ground.        The letter asked supporters to arrive

                        between 1030 hours and 1400 hours to ensure they were

                        in the ground for the start of the match at 1500 hours,

                        and indicated that ticketless fans should not attend.

Pages 21-22             home game at Anfield on 8 April 1989 contained an

                        article in the same vein and this was repeated in media

                        broadcasts and publications, both locally and

                        nationally.
                          R8   Some 102 coaches containing Liverpool supporters

                          travelled to Sheffield on 15 April 1989.     Host of these

                          were accompanied by a Liverpool steward and either

 Statement Pages 11-17    they, or the drivers were advised prior to departure

                          about the arrangements in South Yorkshire.     Additional

                          arrangements were made by Merseyside Police.




                          R9   The largest proportion of supporters travelled in

                          private or hire cars, vans and mini-buses.     It is

                          impossible to quantify these vehicles numerically but

                          there were no significant traffic delays to cause late

                          arrival of fans in Sheffield.   This matter is

                          considered again later in this report.   A detailed

Documents 5-6            report from British Transport Police confirms that one

Pages 23-29              special train and three service trains from Liverpool

        30-53            conveyed 825 supporters to Sheffield, and other trains

                         from other areas brought the total to 1,337.




                         RIO   By comparison, 1,932 Nottingham Forest supporters

                         travelled by a combination of special and service

                         trains to attend the match.   The conclusion was that

                         the supporters were happy and good natured with few

                         signs of intoxication.



Statement Pages          Rll   There is evidence of Liverpool and other

18-21                    supporters procuring and consuming alcohol en route to

22-24                    the game.

                            (previously referred to) some of the gates into

Statement PaRes           R13     There are many descriptions of the behaviour of

~ 8~31                     supporters in various parts of Sheffield but
32-33
                          predominantly in the area within two miles or so from
34-35
                          the ground between 0845 hours and 1500 hours.       They
36-37
                          present a picture of drinking, boisterous and rowdy
38-41
                          behaviour, some drunkeness and urinating in public and

                          secluded places.    But not all of the statements are

                          critical, some praise the behaviour of Liverpool

                          supporters.    At one location seven dustbin liners were

                          collected full of cans, bottles and other alcoholic

                                 containers, and that was on one garage

                         forecourt.     One public house sold out of beer.




                         R14     As part of the policing arrangements on 15 April

                         1989 many of the public houses within one mile radius

                         of the stadium were closed for the sale of alcohol.

                         Those licensed premises which did open instigated

                         various controls on the door but the further away from

                         the stadium the premises are situated, the more

                         attractive they were to supporters wishing to drink.

                         The further away from the stadium the premises are

                         situated, the more likely was a late arrival at the
                      stadium.   This nay have put more customer pressure on

                     other retail outlets where alcohol is sold and police

  Statement Pages    control is more difficult.     Host of the s u p p m m r V p m

 42-43               and off-licenses did open and they sold a considerable

 44-48               amount of drink on the dav.     Public houses and

 49-53               off-sales describe the significant increases in

                     their takings on 15 April 1989.      The pattern of this

                     evidence is that whilst sales increased considerably,

                     in general the behaviour of the supporters was good

                     although there were incidents of very bad behaviour.



                     R15    This bad behaviour was perhaps naturally more

                     acute nearest to the stadium.     People living near to

                     any football stadium are well accustomed, some would

                     say long-suffering, to the disruption which occurs in

                     their neighbourhood when a football match takes place.

                    By reason of their experience the local residents

                    develop the ability to identify those teams whose

                    supporters cause them the most trouble.        Given the

                    dangers of bias, prejudice and stereotyping, as a

                    result some supporters are attributed with a group

                    reputation, but the local residents are in a position

                    to compare and balance the behaviour of various

                    supporters week by week, and even year by year.




                    R16    On the day in question a picture emerges of cars

                    being parked early, those roads nearest to the stadium

Statement Pages     at the Leppings Lane end (the Liverpool end) being full

54-58               of parked cars by 1100 hours.    A considerable amount of
   59-64
               alcohol vas seen being carried and consumed.    Pane
  65-70
              seen walking towards the stadium with little nr ™
  71-74
              chance of being there for the start of the   m t p   .   There

              is some evidence that on 15 April 1989 at the Leppings

              Lane turnstiles the behaviour of the fans was the worst

              ever seen.   Through the eyes of the local residents the

              Liverpool supporters were generally more badly behaved

              in 1989 than they were on the occasion of the

              semi-final in 1988; the bad behaviour was influenced by

             alcohol; and too many fans arrived late.




             R17   But from the evidence of witnesses it is not at

             all clear that the only cause for the fans late arrival

             at the Leppings Lane turnstiles was drink-related.         The

             day of the match was warm and sunny with a temperature

             of 12 degrees Celsius or 53.6 degrees Fahrenheit.         Many

             of the supporters attending the match were intent upon

             enjoying a traditional pre match drink.    In some cases

             the alcohol led to rowdy, boisterous or disorderly

            behaviour, in others it led to a reluctance to leave

            licensed premises until the last minute.    However,
Statement
            although traffic volume was heavy on all approach
18-21
            routes and traffic delays were not a serious problem.
22-24
            some traffic hold-ups did occur to cause late arrival
75-83
            at the ground.— The police search operation Inevitably
84-88
            caused some delay to some supporters, for example the

            search of one private mini-bus took twenty minutes to

            complete, the occupants arriving at the ground at 1455
                   hours.     On balance it is likely that one cause of late

                   arrivals at the Leppings Lane turnstiles was

                   drink-related.     The build-up started at about 1420

Document 7        hours and continued until Gate C was opened at 1452

 (Video)          hours.

Schedule Pages

54-56             R18       The evidence suggests that very many of the fans

                  who arrived at the ground after 1430 hours, had been

                  drinking at public houses or from containers brought

                  from home or bought from off-licenses and other retail

                  outlets.     But there is little evidence of arrestable

                  drunkenness and there is no evidence of wide-scale

                  prosecutable drunkenness.     There was certainly an

                  element in the crowd outside the Leppings Lane

                  turnstile who were the worse for drink but the evidence

                  suggests that element was in a minority.     That element

                  contained young people influenced by drink who were

                  pushing shoving and weaving about among the crowd

                  either through impatience or bravado and there seems

                  little doubt that those arriving at Leppings Lane at a

                  time nearest to the kick-off had drunk the most and

                  were the worst behaved.     This "late arrival element"

                  would have been most likely to be among those who

                  entered the ground through Gate C at 1452 hours and

Document 8        made their way to the back of pens 3 and 4.     Of the

Pages 57-63       95 who died in pens 3 and 4 it can be shown that 23

Statement Pages   entered through Gate C after 1452 hours and of these

89-98             some had significantly high blood/alcohol levels, but

                         R19     A not unrelated difficulty was caused by fans

                         arriving without tickets despite the all-ticket nature

                         of the natch and the entreaties previously mentioned.

                       R21      From the turnstile count print-out it is possible

                       to calculate the number of fans outside Leppings Lane

                       turnstiles just before the opening of Gate C at 1452

                       hours.    The estimate is 3,264 still waiting to enter

                       the ground.     Add to that the estimated 2,000 non-ticket

                      holders and there is a potential crowd of 5,246 still

                      to come into the stadium just before the opening of

                      Gate C.




                      R22      The calculation as to the number of ticketless

                      fans who entered the stadium at the Leppings Lane end

                      is open to dispute.     There is a considerable amount of

                      evidence which suggests that there were frequent

                      requests and negotiations for tickets during the time

                      that the crowd build up outside       Leppings Lane

                      turnstile.     The police officers    intervened on   many
 occasions in the interests of preventing obstruction

 and to detect forged tickets.   Many of the supporters

 moved on in this fashion, returned, predominantly to

 the bridge area over the River Don.    From the CCTV

 video evidence there was a large number of fans

 loitering in the area outside of Gate C mnVJng no

 attempt to enter through the turnstiles.   That may have

 been because they were waiting for the crush to clear

 before presenting their tickets at the turnstile, but

 it may have been the case that they had no tickets to

 present and were waiting the opportunity to buy a

 ticket or enter the ground ■illegally.'




R23    It has been suggested that as the kick off time

approached, the West Terraces and the North Stand still

had many spaces in pens 1 and 2, 6 and 7 and the North

Stand seats, the Liverpool supporters accommodation.

Because the match was "all-ticket" and a "sell out"

these spaces must indicate that there were many ticket

holders still to come into the stadium and that would

account for the large crowd still outside the Leppings

Lane turnstiles.   If those spaces had been filled by

about 1420 hours it would have indicated that the large

crowd outside the turnstiles had no tickets, but these

spaces were still empty at that time.




R24   In an attempt to resolve the matter account has

been taken of the Club’s electronic monitoring system.

This shows that a total of 7,038 people passed through
              turnstiles A-G, the entrance to the West Terraces.

              However, the counting mechanism on turnstile G was

              defective.    The Health and Safety Executive from a

              study of the CCTV film which portrays turnstiles A-G

              and Gate C, estimated that as many as 7,644 people

              entered through turnstiles A-G but that estimate is

              based upon not only a 'head-count" of the video film

              but also a projection of figures from other

              turnstiles.   Again using the video film, the Health and

             Safety Executive estimated that as many as 2,480 people

             entered the ground through exit Gate C.    The best

             estimate available from the Health and Safety Executive

             is that 10,124 people entered through turnstiles A-G

             and Gate C.    However, this estimate does not take into

             account those people with tickets for the West Terraces

             who were allowed through turnstiles 1-16, and other

             factors such as the opening of Gate A, which distort

             the figures.   Bearing in mind that 10,100 tickets were

             sold for the West Terraces, the evidence, such as it

            is, does suggest that non-ticket holders entering the

            West Terraces (the Liverpool end) could have been as

            high as 2,000 or as low as 200.    It is impossible to be

            more precise.

                   DETAILS OF CQMPI.ATHTS




                   R27    The first complaint by Mr HICKS was made on 24

                   August 1989 in a formal statement to Mr Kenneth Philip

                   Douglas COOPER, Assistant Chief Constable,

                   Northamptonshire Constabulary, when he saw Mr HICKS in

                   relation to an earlier complaint against Chief

                   Superintendent David Godfrey DUCKENFIELD.     Mr COOPER

                   was appointed to investigate that complaint by

Document 11        letter dated 25 July 1989, under the supervision of

Page 89            Captain E N TAYLOR from the Police Complaints Authority

Document 12        who ratified that appointment and informed Mr HICKS by

Page 90            letter dated 4 August 1989.     Details of the complaint

                   are as follows:-




                   a)     That you failed to take control of the disaster.
                    R28     Subsequent to this interview Hr COOPER received

  Page 91
                 informing him that the enquiry would be dealt with by

                 another force.       On 27 September following protracted

                 negotiations, responsibility for all criminal and

                 disciplinary aspects of the investigation into the

                Hillsborough disaster, including the complaints by Hr

                HICKS, were passed to Hr DEAR for enquiries by West

                R29        Arising from that transfer of responsibility. Hr

                HICKS was re-interviewed on 22 November 1989 by

                Detective Superintendent TAYLOR with a view to

                clarification of the complaint against Chief

                Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.      He then made a second

                complaint against Assistant Chief Constable Hr JACKSON

               as follows :-




               b)         That he may have colluded with Chief

                          Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to mislead the public

                          and senior police officers in respect of the

 R31    These complaints raise allegations of both

 criminal and disciplinary offences.   Files on the

 criminal aspect of the investigation are already with

 the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Police

 Complaints Authority.   This report deals solely with

 the disciplinary aspects.



 DETAILS OF INVESTIGATION




R32     That he failed to take control of the disaster.



R33     This complaint is made only by Mr HICKS and he

explains it by a description of the events on the day

as seen through his eyes, and from a consideration of

the evidence heard by Lord Justice TAYLOR at the Public

Inquiry, which leads him to conclude that Mr JACKSON

neglected to discharge his duties relating to the

staging of the semi-final at Hillsborough on 15 April

1989.




R3A     The disciplinary offence which has to be

considered is:-



Neglect of Duty.




Being a member of a police force without good and

sufficient cause neglected or omitted to attend to or

carry out with due promptitude and diligence anything

which it is his duty as a member of a police force to
                    attend to or carry out, viz he failed to take control

                    of the disaster at Hillsborough stadium on 15 April

                    1989.




                    Contrary to the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985

                    Schedule 1 Regulation 4(1) paragraph 4(a).




                   R35      The evidence to support such a disciplinary

                   charge is the same as is currently being considered by

                   the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of Mr

                   JACKSON’S culpability for Manslaughter or Culpable

                   Malfeasance.    The offence of Manslaughter requires

                   proof of a high level of gross negligence or

                   recklessness, but the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

                   requires proof only of neglect of a duty.     Should the

                   Director decide that there is insufficient evidence to

                   prosecute for those criminal offences then the same

                  must be said in respect of the disciplinary offence of

                  Neglect of Duty.




                  R36    In that case this complaint is unsubstantiated.



                  R37    That he may have colluded with Chief

Statement Pages   Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to mislead the public a n d

163-175           senior police officers in respect of the opening of

                  Gate C in Leppings Lane.



Statement Pages   R38    This complaint is made only by Mr HICKS and he

137-162           explains it by saying that he doubts whether Mr JACKSON
 was unaware that Gate C had been opened by police at

 1452 hours because he can see no reason why Chief

 Superintendent DUCKENFIELD would not have told him that

 this had occurred.




 R39    The disciplinary offence which has to be

 considered is:-




 Falsehood or Prevarication.




 Being a member of a police force knowingly colluded

 with Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD on 15 April 1989

 to make a false, misleading or inaccurate oral

 statement that Gate C at Hillsborough stadium had been

 forced open by football supporters at 1452 hours on 15

April 1989, whereas the gate had in fact been opened on

the instructions of Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.




Contrary to the Police (Discipline) Regulations lQfls

Schedule 1. Regulation 4(1). paragraph 5(a).




R40    Although the evidence to support this

disciplinary charge forms a part of the evidence

submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions to

consider the culpability of Mr JACKSON for the criminal

offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance,

should the Director decide that there is insufficient

evidence to prosecute these criminal offences, it would

still be possible to prosecute the disciplinary charge

of Falsehood or Prevarication.

                         force available to deal with any matter which required

                         the personal attention of a Chief Officer.         He was in

                         plain clothes and after some routine duties to satisfy

                         himself that the plan for policing the semi-final

                         football match was progressing satisfactorily he went

                         to the Police Control Box at Hillsborough and briefly

                         spoke to Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.     The time

                         was shortly after 1400 hours and the only occurrence of

Document 16              note at that time was his remark while in the Control

Pages 94-103             Box that the Liverpool fans seemed to be s l o w   in
                   entering the West Terraces at the Leppings Lane end by

                   comparison with the Nottingham Forest supporters in the

                   Spion Kop.



 Document 16       R43     Mr JACKSON took his seat in the South Stand near

 Pages 94-103      to a point over the players* tunnel and saw nothing

                   untoward until after the match had started and fans

                   were coming onto the perimeter track through the

                   perimeter fence at the front of the West Terraces.     The

                  match was still in progress and he left his seat

                   promptly and went to the Police Control Box, arriving

                  at about 1507 hours, the match having been stopped by

                  then.




                  R44     He was in the Control Box for a very short time,

Statement Pages   just long enough to enquire of Chief Superintendent

163-175           DUCKENFIELD as to what was happening.    The response was

                  inconclusive and seemed to suggest that some sort of

                  pitch invasion was occurring, so he went onto the pitch

                  to find out for himself.



Statement Pages   R45     Here he spoke to Superintendent GREENWOOD and

176-187           learned of the injuries and fatalities so he returned

                  to the Control Box to ensure that ambulances and

                  resources (Operation Support) had been sent for.



Document 25       R46     He acknowledges that at that moment he was in

Page 592          overall command of the incident and began to implpmant

                  the Maior Incident Plan.   At that time he was aware

                  that crushing had occurred due to overcrowding but was
                    unaware that Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had

                    approved the opening of Gate C or any other gates.




                    R47   At about 1515 hours he was present in the Police

 Statement Pages    Control Box, which was extremely busy, when Mr Graham

 188-198            KELLY and Mr Glen KIRTON of the Football Association

 199-208            came in, accompanied by Mr Graham MACKRELL. Secretary

 209-231            to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.




                   R48    They spoke to Mr JACKSON and to Chief

                   Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and although he was engaged

Document 16        with other matters, Mr JACKSON believes that it was on

Pages 94-103       this occasion that Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

Statement Pages    told Mr KELLY that Liverpool supporters had forced open

163-175            C gate and had flooded into the ground.




                   R49    There is no evidence at all that Chief

                   Superintendent DUCKENFIELD told any of the visitors to

                   the Control Box that police had opened Gate C, or any

                   other gates, on his express approval.




                   R50    At 1530 hours Mr JACKSON was present in the Board

                   Room when Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD explained

                   his reasons for not wanting the decision to abandon the

                   match, to be made public knowledge.   Mr JACKSON

Document 25        explains that when he entered the Boardroom he believed

Pages 615          that fans had broken down a gate and had forced entry

                   into the ground, he was not aware that Chief

                   Superintendent DUCKENFIELD had authorised the opening
                    of any exit gates; and that was still his belief when

                    he left the Boardroom.




                    R51    On return to the Police Control Box he continued

                    to implement the Major Incident Plan and at about 1545

                    hours, when the injured and dead were being safely

                    dealt with, he called his ground Commanders to him,

 Statement Pages    including Superintendent MARSHALL.   While M r JACKSON

232-252            was debriefing them, the then Chief Constable, Mr Peter

                   WRIGHT, made contact by telephone, to find out what had

                   been going on.     As Mr JACKSON was speaking to Mr

Document 26        WRIGHT, Superintendent MARSHALL explained how Gate C

Pages 652-795      had been opened at his request.    The time at that

Document 25        moment was about 1615 hours although it could have been

Page 643           as early as 1600 hours, and that was the first

                   occasion, so he claims, that Mr JACKSON was aware of

                   the true circumstances surrounding the opening of Gate

                   C at 1452 hours.




                   R52    Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD has refused to

                   answer any questions about this or any other matter,

                   but the following matters of evidence are significant.




                   R53    Mr MACKRELL was on the pitch as the Liverpool

                   team came out of the playing tunnel at 1454 hours.     At

Statement Pages    about that moment he was approached by Mr Douglas John

253-270            LOCK, the Club Security Officer, who told him that Gate

                   C had either been opened or broken down, it is not

                   certain which, and between 300 and 400 fans had got
                     into the ground through the gate.     Mr LOCK had learned

                     this from the Club Control Room where there is

                    a facility for monitoring the CCTV cameras.       It is

                    clear that this reference by Mr LOCK was in respect of

                    the opening of Gate C at 1448 hours to eject a

                    non-ticket holder and about 150 fans forced their way

                    into the ground, because at about 1450 hours Mr LOCK

 Statement Pages    gave the same account to Inspector Trevor HARVEY.          But,

 Pages 271-280      of course, that was unknown to Mr MACKRELL at that

                    time.



 Statement Pages            Mr MACKRELL went to investigate, stopping to talk

 Pages 209-231      to one or two people about the arrangements for the

                    game, and when he reached Gate C he found it slightly

                    open with a trickle of fans coming through it under the

                    control of a mounted officer.     By the time Mr MACKRELL

                   would have got to Gate C, he would be witnessing the

                   tail-end of the opening authorised by Chief

Statement Pages    Superintendent DUCKENFIELD at 1452 hours.       He would not

163-175            know that the opening of Gate C he was witnessing was

                   not the same opening reported to him by Mr LOCK.       If Mr

                   LOCK had referred to the breaking down of a gate, and

                   that is not clear, then the seeds were sown in Mr

                   MACKRELL’S mind that Gate C had been broken down.



Statement Pages    R55      This is important only because Mr MACKREI.t. was

209-231            present with Mr KELLY and Mr KIRTON when they visited

188-198            the Police Control Box at 1515 hours and were allegedly

199-208            misinformed about the opening of Gate C.      It was Mr
                                MACKRELL who actually took Mr KELLY and Mr KIRTON to

                                the Police Control Box at about 1515 hours and despite

                               his own quick visit to the Control Box prior to that,

                               nothing had been said to change what Mr LOCK had told

                               him.    It is likely that it was that version of events

                               which Mr MACKRELL would have passed on to Mr KELLY on

                               their way to the Police Control Box.

                              R57     Because Mr MACKRELL was engaged in conversation

                              in the Control Box he cannot help as to what Mr KELLY

                             and he remembers being told that when the gates were

                             forced there had been an influx of Liverpool

                             supporters, he cannot be sure Mr JACKSON heard what

                             transpired.
 Statement Pages          R58    Hr KIRTON. who gave evidence to the Lord Justice

 199-208                  TAYLOR Public Inquiry, remembers going with Mr KELLY

 Lord Justice Taylor*    and Mr MACKRELL to the Police Control Box at about 1515

 Public Inquiry          hours, and speaking to Chief Superintendent

 22 June 1989            DUCKENFIELD.    He has no doubt that it was Mr

 Document 28             DUCKENFIELD who told them that the cause of the

 Pages 905-946           injuries had been the forcing of a gate and an inrush

                         of Liverpool supporters.     He remembers the reference to

                         a CCTV monitor which was showing live pictures of the

                         gate at that time.    He cannot remember Mr JACKSON in

                         the Control Box at that time and the major concern of

                         Messrs KELLY, KIRTON and MACKRELL at that time was

                        whether or not to abandon the game.



Statement Pages         R59     On leaving the Control Box, Mr KELLY called a

188-198                 meeting of interested parties including representatives

Lord Justice TAYLOR*S   of the three clubs, the referee. Chief Superintendent

Public Inquiry          DUCKENFIELD and Mr JACKSON.

21 June 1989

Document 27             R60     The meeting was held in the Boardroom at about

Pages 796-904           1530 hours and there is no evidence to suggest that

                        anything other than the question of abandoning the

                        match was discussed there.




                        R61     At 1640 hours Mr KELLY was interviewed live on

                        television and he spoke of two versions concerning the

                        cause of the overcrowding - the fans* account that the

                        police had opened the gate, and the police assertion

                        that the Liverpool fans had forced their way in.
Lord Justice Taylor*     R62    At about 1915 hours a Press Conference was held

Para 257                 made it clear that a gate had been opened by police

B nn n n p n t   90
                         because of a danger to life through crushing outside

Pages 947-948            the ground, and he also made reference to the forcing

                         of the iron perimeter gates outside Leppings Lane

                         turnstiles.



Documents 30-31         R63     Notices under Regulation 6 were served on

Pages 949-950           Assistant Chief Constable Mr JACKSON and a letter dated

Document 32             2 February 1990 from Assistant Chief Constable Mr JONES

Page 951                covers the format of these.




                        Complaint (a) - 8 November 1989 - Assistant Chief

                        Constable Mr JONES.




                        Complaint (b) - 12 January 1990 - Assistant Chief

                        Constable Mr JONES.




                       R64     The delay between receipt of the complaints and

                       the service of notices was as a result of medical

                       advice from the officer’s General Practitioner.




                       R65     When interviewed under caution on 28 June 1990 Mr

                       JACKSON maintained his assertion that he was unaware of

                       the true nature of the opening of Gate C until

                       Superintendent MARSHALL explained it to him at about

                       1615 hours.     The only puzzling issue is Mr JACKSON’S

                       failure to remonstrate with Chief Superintendent

                       DUCKENFIELD once he found out the full and accurate
  situation.   However, there is insufficient evidence

  available to show that there was any collusion between

  Mr JACKSON and Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD in

  respect of the opening of Gate C, or any other gate.

 This complaint is, therefore, unsubstantiated.

Mr J u s ti c e Taylor,
Hillsborough Enquiry,
Town H a ll,
S h effield, S. Yorks.


Dear S i r ,

           As a spectator who attended the match a t Hillsborough on 15th
April I am w riting to you to o u tlin e my experiences on t h a t afternoon.       I
appreciate t h a t you will have received many l e t t e r s , many of which may be
describing sim ila r experiences.    Nevertheless on re fle c tio n over the past
few weeks I hope t h a t the comments I make may help towards ensuring th a t
such a tragedy never happens again.

                 My son and I are Liverpool supporters who obtained standing
t i c k e t s for the Leppings Lane area of the Hillsborough ground.     As neither
of us had been to the ground before we s o l i c i t e d the advice of a colleague
of mine who regularly attends matches a t t h i s ground and who was a t the
corresponding match in 1988.

           My colleague advised us not to stand behind the goal as t h is area
had been very congested in 1988.   He suggested t h a t we stand in the
enclosure on the north west corner of the ground, area (A) in my attached
sketch.

                     In the event we arrived near to the ground before 2.00 p.m.                    We
entered the ground shortly a f t e r 2.00 p.m. through the Leppings Lane
t u r n s t i l e s marked (B) as in stru c te d in our t i c k e t s .    At t h i s time there was
no s i g n i f i c a n t crush or queues a t the t u r n s t i l e s .   After passing through
the t u r n s t i l e s the onTy apparent way to the enclosures was through the
tunnel under the stand.                  We went through the tunnel and into the area (B)
behind the goal.               At t h i s time (ca 2.05 p.m.) the area was e s s e n tia lly full
and we had d i f f i c u l t y in movingfrom the tunnel into the enclosure.                      Having
reached t h i s position i t became obvious t h a t we could not reach the area we
wished to stand in (Area A) because of the dividing fences.                           I remarked to
my son t h a t the area was uncomfortably fu ll already, would get worse, and
was unsafe because of the long distance through the tunnel and outside in
which pressure could build up with no chance of r e l i e f ; so we l e f t via the
tunnel.            I t was s t i l l not obvious how to get to area (A) or any other
area.           We walked around the s t a i r s in to the stand and noticed t h a t we could
get around the S.W. corner into the area (C).                       This area was v i r tu a l ly
empty and we could see t h a t t h i s was also the case for area (A), so I
suggested to my son t h a t I would wait there and he should look for a route
to area (A).             After a few minutes he came back and said t h a t there was a
gap in the wall to the l e f t of the t u r n s t i l e s (point D).             Consequently we
l e f t area (C) and made our way to area (A).
                                                                                                /

               Shortly before the kick o ff there was s t i l l ample room in area
(A), f a r more than i s normally the case on the Kop a t Anfield.           I t was also
very apparent t h a t there was severe overcrowding in area ( b ).          Shortly
a f t e r the kick-off we could see people being l i f t e d out of area (B) over the
fence and onto the p itc h .    This was, a t t h i s stage, being re s iste d by the
p o lice.     Once the seriousness of the s i t u a t i o n became apparent to the
police and the game stopped, the police began to do all they could to help
people out.

                I write in t h i s detail    to make the point t h a t there seemed to be
l i t t l e attempt on the p a rt of the stewards or the police to             d ir e c t
spectators to the le s s full parts of the ground and t h a t i t was not a t all
obvious how to reach these parts of the ground.             Indeed myrecollection is
t h a t the hole in the wall (D) was, from the perspective of someone coming
through the (B) t u r n s t i l e s , hidden behind a kiosk s e l li n g programmes e tc .


                    Not once during the 55 minutes before the kick off t h a t we spent
inside the ground did we hear the public address system being used to d ire c t
s p e c ta to r s .    This system could also have been used to greater e f f e c t a f t e r
the game had stopped to inform the Nottingham Forest supporters of what had
happened.            Had t h i s been the case i t would surely not have been necessary
for a so lid lin e of police to span the pitch w hilst Liverpool supporters
c arried injured and dying spectators on makeshift str e tc h e rs the length of
the pitch passing through t h i s l in e on the way.

                Given the presence of ample t e le v is io n cameras, together with the
normal surveillance cameras, I s t i l l cannot comprehend why i t was not clear
to the stewards and the police inside the stadium t h a t certain parts of the
terra ce s were fu ll and others f a r from full well before the kick o f f , and
c e r ta in ly in time to stop f u r th e r sp e cta tors going into the full p a rts , and
d i r e c t them in to the less fu ll parts of the stadium.         I suggest t h a t th is
lack of communication, together with the bad design of the entrances, must
have contributed largely to the tragedy.

                                          Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

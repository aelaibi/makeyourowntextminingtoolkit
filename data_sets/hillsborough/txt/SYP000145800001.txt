    051.     DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE DISASTER

             WAS HANDLED AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?



                   Initially?   the Police pushed the fans that got over the

    fence,    back into the pens.     They obviously didn't    realise what was

    going on.     They must have thought     it was a pitch invasion.




    Q52.     FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A S T E W A R D , WAS THERE ANYTHING

             SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS MATCH WHICH YOUR OPINION

             MADE IT DIFFERENT FROM SIMILAR PREVIOUS MATCHES?

    853.     IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO

             THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?



                  I feel that   if there had been more emergency gates      in the

    front fence or if the fence had bean like those         in Europe that fold

    out of the way or slide out of the way,        then people wouldn't have been

    killed and injured.



    I also feel that the allocation of tickets and parts of the ground for

    each team was poor.

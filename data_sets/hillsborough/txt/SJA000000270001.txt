At approximately l6.^0hrs on hearing the call for people with first aid
eJ  rience, I telephoned the Royal Hallamshire Hospital to offer my
assistance* I was asked to attend and imediately put on my uniform
and proceeded to the Hospital casualty department and was directed to
the area where walking casualties were situated.
My first task was moving beds into the Physiotherapy Gym. After that
I went t o •the Midland Station by motorcycle to obtain train times for
Stoke-on-Trent as the phone lines were jammed.
By this time it was approximated 17»^5hrs as the courdinator remarked
we have 90 minutes to catch the 7*15 train.
I then assisted in moving some walking casualties to the area where
they were awaiting transport and discharge. When most of the patients
had been found transport, I asked if I could be of further help.
I was asked to report to the Porters Lodge where I was given a key
and shown how to operate the theatre lift and asked to report to the
Sister on Ward L1 . Here X was set to work assisting a nurse transporting
patients to and from the X-Ray department. After having a cup of tea
with the nursing staff I left the hospital at approximately 00.30hrs
Sunday, and returned home.

ao the best of my recollection this is an account of my activities of
Saturday 15.^.89»

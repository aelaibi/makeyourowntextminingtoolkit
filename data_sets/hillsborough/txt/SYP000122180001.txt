             TRAF FI C P R O B L E M S - 15 A P RI L           1989     (150489)          M67/A560             - MOTTRAM

             On S a t u r d a y      15 April     1989      (150489)      I was     the D ut y Offi ce r               co vering

             the      ’G ’ Division.

             At somet im e           shor tl y a fter       12 noon     (1200)      that      day       I a t t e n d e d at

             S t a l y b r i d g e Pol ic e S t a t i o n   to discuss w i t h the D u t y                 Inspector

              c o nt i n g e n c y   planning     for    the    return of the L iv e rp o ol                 FC s u p p o r t e r s       fror

             the FA C u p Semi            final     being      played at S h e f f i e l d       that day.               This

              planning was            based on problems            e n c o u n t e r e d w he n these          s u p po r te r s        had

              retur ne d      from     previous      m at ch es    in S he ff ie ld .

             W hi l st at       the Police S t a t i o n        I became a wa re          of traffic             h ol d-u ps        at

              the     e a st e rn exit     of the M&7 w h i ch          is s i t u a t e d    close        to M o t t r a m

              village.          T h i s is not      uncommon,         traffic      o ften tail in g            back      towards

              the m o t o r w a y     purely becaus e          of the g e o g r a p h y      of the        roads.            The

             motorway          term in at es    into a single           lane     c a rr i a g e w a y    close       to a c r o s s ­

              roads      c o nt ro ll ed by traffic            lights     in a small          village          centre.             At    the

              terminus         of the m o t o r w a y    the A 5 6 0 joins         the    roun da bo ut at            this         point,

             and this          in turn     c on tr ibutes       to the     traf fi c      bottleneck.

              I was      not aware        of a ny    problems         conc er ni ng      either         d i so r d e r l y

              be haviour        or the ma nn er         in w h i c h v eh icles were           being         driven.
It was       c o nfirmed        that O f f i c e r s      had been sent               to both the             traf fi c

lights       in M o t t r a m      village        and those at H o l l i n g w o r t h to                  carry out

manual       control       an d give S h e f f i e l d          bound       traf fi c m a x i m u m         priority.

With       the    i nf o rm a ti o n   I then had          I c o ns i d e r e d        that     the    necessary           steps

had been taken to a l l e v ia t e                  the    problem.

S h o r t l y a f te rw a rd s      I went        to the M67 at Hyde a nd saw that                              tr affic

was mo v i n g       fairly        fr ee ly and that a p r op o r t i o n of                    it was made           of

Liverpool           football        s upporters.           I heard s i ng in g              from one          coach     but

nothing          else   that w o ul d suggest              rowdyism.                I then t r a v e l l e d       part w a y

a lo n g    the A 56 Q from Gee Cross,                    Hyde       towards M o t t r a m and a g a i n              saw

that       traffic was          heavy,      in constant mov em en t,                      and   c o nt ai ne d     football

supporters.             Some       of the    s u pp or t er s        s h ou t e d    to    passers         by t h r o u g h    the

car windows,            but     it a p p e a r e d good h u m o u r e d             rather      than drunken.

P rior      to going off            duty at        1.45    pm    (1345)        t r a f f ic     in the a r e a        of

M o t t r a m was still            fa ir ly h eavy but           had      cleared          considerably.              The

problem had             ceased.

This       h eavy volume           of traf fic was          dealt w i t h            in the      normal        accepted

manner,          and a l t h o u g h a n ti ci pa te d,         it    cannot         be re-routed,             and    one      can

only       give     lengthy        prefe re nc e at        the       points a l r e a d y m entioned.

I was       not aware         of    the be h av io ur       problems           until        some      time      later a nd

no   incidents were                r ec or de d    relating          to either            people      or    p ro pe rt y      in

this area.

Because          of the a f t e r n o o n ' s      tragic       events        the      return was           very

s t a g g e r e d an d no       incidents          of note       came       to our a ttention.

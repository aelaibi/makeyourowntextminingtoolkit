Dear Sir

           RE - VISITS BY MERSEYSIDE FOOTBALL CLUBS TO WEMBLEY STADIUM

Further to my letter of l6th June 1989 dealing with visits to London football
clubs by Liverpool Football Club supporters, I am now able to provide you with
some information relating to visits by Merseyside football clubs to Wembley
Stadium.

Between May 1985 and 15th April 1989 , Merseyside football clubs played at
Wembley Stadium on 10 occasions as shown below:

1.     18th May 1985 F.A. Cup Final             Everton -v- Manchester Utd

2.     20th August 1985 F.A. Cup Final          Everton -v- Manchester Utd

3-     ,10th May 1986 F.A. Cup Final            Everton -v- Liverpool

4.     16th August I986 F.A. Charity Shield     Everton -v- Liverpool

5-     5th April 1987 Littlewoods Cup           Liverpool -v- Arsenal

*6.    1st August I987 F.A. Charity Shield      Everton -v- Coventry City

 7-    16th April I988 Football League Centenary Festival

 8.    14th May 1988 F.A. Cup Final             Liverpool -v- Wimbledon

 9-    20th August I988 F.A. Charity Shield      Liverpool -v- Wimbledon

 10.    30th April I989 Simod Cup Final          Everton -v- Nottingham Forest

 On only two occasions were there incidents of concern.

        (a)      On 10th May 1986 the F.A. Cup Final - Everton -v- Liverpool.

                 A capacity crowd of 98,000 attended, there were 51 arrests, the
                 majority of which were for crime related offences.

                 Inside the stadium, 6 Everton and 10 Liverpool supporters were
                 arrested.   Outside the stadium 7 Everton and 21 Liverpool
                 supporters were arrested.

                 Over 1,000 fans were ejected, many without tickets or in
                 possession of forged tickets. Twenty five police officers were
                 injured.
       (b)     On l4th May 1988 the F.A. Cup Final - Liverpool -v- Wimbledon.

               A capacity crowd of 98,000 attended; 92 fans were arrested, 85
               from Liverpool and 7 from Wimbledon.    Over 3t000 persons were
               ejected from the stadium for possession of either forged
               tickets or no ticket at all. The stadium authorities recovered
               478 forged tickets.   Seven police officers were injured.


I hope that the brief summaries of the above matches, in addition to that
already furnished in respect of the 1989 F.A. Cup Final held on the 20th May
1989 , will be of assistance.

Please contact me if you think I can help further in this matter.


Yours faithfully

Dear Sir

I am writing in confirmation of recent telephone conversations with Detective
Inspector King concerning your request for information about the behaviour
of Liverpool Football Club supporters attending London.

I am pleased to inform you that following consultation with the Hillsborough
Enquiry Team, I am now in a position to forward to you relevant Football
Match Summary returns for your information.

The relevant returns,which are attached, are for the following matches:

     Saturday 28th November 1987 Tottenham Hotspur -v- Liverpool
     Tuesday   9th November 1988 Arsenal           -v- Liverpool
     Sunday   29th January 1989 Millwall           -v- Liverpool
     Saturday 13th May      1989 Wimbledon         -v- Liverpool

The Football Match Summaries consist of information, intelligence and assessments
provided by police officers for internal use only. They have no evidential
talue. I would point out that Liverpool played London Clubs in the Metropolitan
Police District on 17 occasions during the last two seasons. Other than
the matches referred to in the attached summaries, little or no policing
difficulties were reported when Liverpool visited London.

As discussed with Detective Inspector King, reports concerning the F.A. Cup
Finals on 10th May 1986 between Everton and Liverpool and 14th May 1988 between
Wimbledon and Liverpool are not immediately available. As soon as they become
available I will so advise your office and forward copies.

Please do not hesitate,to contact me if you require any further assistance.

Yours faithfully

                               residual support for Liverpool in London and the South East.
                             . Crowds started to build up outside the Stadium at 6pm and
                               increased to beyond capacity by 7»30pm. Start of game delayed
                               by 15 minutes to allow fans to enter.



     (b) Inside Ground: Capacity crowd with approximately 6.0G0 fans locked outside
                              the stadium. The South Bank is at present being built on
                              and a constant stream of locked out fans were ejected from
                              the building site area who were trying to gain entry without
                              payment. No serious disorder in the ground. Some 40 fans
                             ■were ejected from the building site area during the match and
     *■                       it was impractical to take all their names ar decide which

COMMENTS ON POLICING TACTICS:

Late arrival of fans 'estimated 30 to 40 thousand arrived after 7pm.

Radio reception on Force radios intermittent.
                                                          A

Intelligence from TO 20 Arsenal FC and Liverpool FC indicated a crowd
of 45,000 to 50,000.

A crowd of 54,000 inside the ground and approximately 6000 locked out
was beyond the police resources employed as per grade 'B1 matches.

The presence in Gillespie Road of a considerable number of fans before
the turnstiles opened prevented police removal vehicles operating and
therefore parked cars added to the obstruction.

Turnstiles at Gillespie Road ran out of change causing delay and further
congestion in Gillespie Road.

Fans ignored Police instruction to form queues not enough Police present
to enforce instructions.

Kick Off delayed by me until 8pm but many of the locked out fans attempted
to climb or break into the stadium.

The only police available to police outside the ground after kick off
were Mounted Section and Dog Section until reinforcements arrived from
West Ham FC match and Commissioner's reserve.

While Mounted Branch, Dog Section and local officers were splendid 'Aid
serials' generally seemed overwhelmed by the situation and were not as active
as one would hope.

Searching at turnstiles had to be abandoned because of crush.■

There were few problems inside the stadium during the match.

Due to late kick off and extra time match finished at 10.20pm in nil nil draw,
therefore fans only interested in getting home and the dispersal prsented
no problems.

Future Plans

Due to Arsenal's successful season and Tottenham's failures crowds are larger
than expected at Highbury therefore policing levels are to be reviewed.

For evening matches Commissioner's regulations will have to be 3 hours before
kick off instead of 2 hours to enable vehicles to be removed before crowds
arrive.

Turnstiles will be opened earlier and Arsenal are to supply a PA System into
.Gillespie Road to assist in directing fans to correct queues.

More Barriers will be used in Gillespie Road to operate queues.

      (a) In transit:                                                    ;
       A Millwall supporter walking to the ground was slashed about the face with either

       a Razor .Blade or a Stanley Knife. He was unable to identify his attackers» Liverpool
       supporters walking to the rear of the ground via a Walkway, threw stones into Cold
      ~iJlow Lane-but they fell amongst other Liverpool Supporterso
     *(b) Inside Ground:                      A


       Only Minor problems inside the ground during the game. One Millwall supporter got
        over the fence on to the pitch but was detainedo After the final whistle, Millwall
        Supporters forced two gates and got out into rear car park.



     (c) Im m e d ia te vicinity of Ground:
         As a result of the above incident, serious disorder took place in the car park. A
         total of Fourteen Officers were injured. Four Police Vehicles were damaged One
         seriously. Three Liverpool supporters were seriously assaulted and several Liverpool
        'Coaches damaged. .

     (d) O th e r Locations:
         One Double Decker Coach containing Liverpool Supporters was'attacked in Old Kent
         Road when a bottle of V.P. was thrown through a window. Two passengers injured.
8,'   C O M M E N T S ON PO LICING TA CTICS

      i.e Escorts, Turnstile Searches, Control of Licensing Laws, etc:


      All the Liverpool Coaches attended the meeting point at Tower Bridge as arranged. They
      were escorted to the ground without any incidents. Several hundred Liverpool Supporters
      from the London Area attended without tickets. An unknown male obviously from Liverpool
      was selling forged tickets in the car park for £15* Several persons obtained entry to
      the ground with these tickets but several were noticed at the turnstiles and the holders
      refused entry. The seller was not located. Apart from the supporters who attended by
      Coach, the rest arrived via service trains and by their own means. In the main, they
      were well behaved. Because of the position of the Turnstiles i.e. only at each end of the
      ground, the main problems were getting all the Millwall supporters into the ground before
      the start. Kany arrived late the worse for drink. The game took place with only minor
      incidents. Considering Millwall were well beaten, not too much was thrown onto the pitch.
      Some damage was caused inside the ground when Millwall supporters forced their way out
      into the car park. Lack of lighting in the Car Park was again the main problem together
      with all the debris lying about. The Liverpool Supporters who had attended by train
      were escorted to the railway station and seen off to London without any problems. To look
      back on the day, a total of 32 persons were injured. The Dog Section suffered the most,
      with Seven Officers injured One with serious back injuries. Following many games without
      any disorder, this one game showed that the Hooligan element is still present waiting to
      strike. The main targers being visiting supporters, their coaches and Police Officers.
      The Chief Superintendent from Liverpool attended the fixture                 as an observer together
      with Inspector CLOW the F.L.O. ^nd a Sergeant. We were unable to offer them any decent
      hospitality but they seemed to understand. I think they also appreciated the problems in
      Policeing First Division fixtures with a Third Division ground surrounded by waste lando

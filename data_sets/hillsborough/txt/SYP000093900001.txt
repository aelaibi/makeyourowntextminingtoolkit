               I have been a L i verpool            supporter al 1 my         Larr e . On 15th April 1989
                                                                               X'lSl      r
               (150489)     w ith my brother                             Iy<5ent to th e H i l l s b o r o u g h

               Football     Ground     in S h e f f i e l d   to see the FA Cup Semi Final                between

               Liverpool       and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.

               I t r avelled to the ground by car from my home an d had no d i f f i c u l t y                            in

               getting    to the ground.            We a r r i v e d at about        1.30 pm <1330)        that    day

               and parked/our         car near to the ground.                 We both had tickets              for the

               North S tand w h i c h had        cost £12 each and had been p u rchased from

               Livep/pool      by my brother.

               When we a r r i v e d outside        the ground there were               not m a n y fans about       so

               we went and bought           some fish and          chips and a drink of            coke.        I suppose

               it w o u l d be just after          two ociock        (1400)     I got     in, at that      tirne it was
                                                                                                                         PAGfc         2
                                                                                                                         S3816

                        easy to get through the turnstiles and                     I handed my ticket            in and the

                        stub was taken by the turnstile                   operator.

                        I got to my seat           in the N orth S tand at about 2 .03             pm (1405)          and took

                        up my      position.       I was told where         to go by a club steward.                  I was

                        sitting      in row No 5 ofthe stand near                  the side,

                        It w o u l d be about 2 . 4 5         pm (1445)    w h e n I realjXed as       I looked at the

                        L e p p i n g s Lane    terrace    that the two      centime pens were very very full.

                        It was just         like   looking at      conckeJx?';    there were      o b v i o u s l y too many

                        fans      in that area,      and    I c a n ’t u n d e r s t a n d why other   people     did not see

                        it.       I was   sure at that time         that somethiptg^was wrong.                 I remember a

                        bit    later      I saw fans trying        to    climi^dut    of the     pens but at first             the

1                   police were just               pushing    them ba^1< in.          It was as    if they did          not

                        After     the game had been stopped               I suppose    it w ould be about 3.10

                        (1510)     - 15 pm       (1515).       Ijust had to get on the pitch                   to try to help

                        the fans       I could see were          in trouble.        At first     it was    just       chaos then

                        I was a sked by some other fans to help                    carry one of the            ca^uajy^iTes^ who

         ^ "        ^breathing,           so we    rushed to the other           ejptd of the    pitch to the          left and

                        took him to the area outside the gyif».                    At that      point,    we    put the youth

                         own on the ground and some first aid man,                       came then and started to

                              treat him.        I remember they then put an oxygen mask on him,                          and       I

                        stayed there for a short              time,     trying to help the young               lad,    but then

                        I heard one of the           First aid men say to his             colleague that          the youth
                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                  S3816

             We were        told to leave the are a and we went                    back onto the         pitch

             where     I just       stayed,       in a bit of a dase.            I left the ground whe n they

             said the game was              not going to be played.

             I have never seen a video                  of what        h a p pened but    I have since         been told

             by friends        that       I was    seen running w ith the a d v e r t i s i n g         board,    on a

             film shown that              day on G r a n a d a reports.         I w o u l d be w i l l i n g   if it

             w o u l d help to view a video and                  identify myself.

             I am S'8 tall,           light       brown hair short and receding,                  med build,      I was

             wearing        blue    tracksuit       bottoms,      red tracksuit          top,    a Liverpool      cap,

             and black shoes.

             I think        that the tragedy o c c urred due to the fact                        that   there was a

             lack of secur i t y outside              the ground.           There was no s e c u r i t y this year

             and   I think         that    this was     the     real    cause of what happened.

             I do not know the              identity of the            16 yr old youth          I helped to carry.

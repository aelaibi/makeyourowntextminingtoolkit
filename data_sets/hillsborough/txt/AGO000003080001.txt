           BRIEF FOR PRIVATE OFFICE

ISSUE

What should be the CPS reaction to a potential re-trial o f ex C hief
Superintendent Duckenfield in the Hillsborough private prosecution.

ACTION REQUIRED

For the Director's information (the DPP has previously indicated that he
should not be involved in the case).

Consideration by the Casework Directorate o f our response to a retrial being
granted by the judge and any applications to us by the Hillsborough Family
Support Group.

TIMING

The HFSG meet with their legal team today to decide whether or not to apply
for a retrial o f Duckenfield.

M r Justice Hooper, the trial judge, will decide on any application for a retrial
in Leeds Crown Court on Wednesday 26 July 2000.

BACKGROUND

The history o f the Hillsborough private prosecution is well known.

The trial for manslaughter, Misconduct in a Public Office o f the two most
senior police officers on duty at the match in 1989 commenced in early June..

Following legal argument in the course o f the proceedings only the
manslaughter charges went before the jury.

On Friday 21 July ex Superintendent Murray was acquitted. At that time the
jury were unable to come to a verdict on Duckenfield. On Monday 24 July
they were still unable to reach a verdict and were discharged.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS

 While the HFSG has not yet contacted the CPS, we anticipate there may be an
 application by them for a contribution towards the costs o f continuing the
 private prosecution, or a request that we take over the private prosecution o f
 Duckenfield in order to continue it.

 The HFSG may argue that the circumstances and the quality o f the evidence
 have changed since the original CPS decisions not to prosecute the two police
 officers and not to intervene in the private prosecution (in order to discontinue
 it).
5.3   At an abuse hearing on 16 February 2000, M r Justice H ooper stated that while
      the trial should take place he would reduce to a significant extent the anguish
      being suffered by the defendants; he made it clear that the two officers would
      not immediately lose their liberty should they be convicted. He accepted that
      his ruling was highly unusual.

5.4   The jury decision to acquit Murray confirms our review decision on the
      sufficiency o f evidence against him. However, their inability to come to a
      decision re Duckenfield may indicate a slight shift in the balance o f the
      evidence towards meeting the evidential test.

6.    RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1   The Crown Court have the power to make an order for certain prosecution
       costs o f the first trial to be paid out o f central funds, under section 17 o f the
       Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985. We should not become involved in the
       financial obligations o f the private prosecutor.

6.2   If the CPS is requested to take over the prosecution in order to continue it, we
       should not be rushed into any decision. We will need to ensure that w e are
       informed o f any new evidence which may have come to light before or during
      trial. We should be willing to take representations from the parties to the
       prosecution as we did in our previous decision making process. I f we still
       consider that our previous decisions on evidential sufficiency were correct,
       then we would only take over the case if new evidence was sufficiently
       significant to warrant a change in those decisions.

6.3   If we concluded that we should take over and prosecute the case then we
       would make our own decisions as to the legal team to be used at court. We
       would not be 'led' by the HFSG.

6.4   It is difficult to see how we could be involved in the case without taking it
       over in its entirety. It is likely to be all or nothing.

7.    C O NCLUSIO N

7.1   Await tomorrow's court rulings before further consideration o f any necessary
       action to be taken.

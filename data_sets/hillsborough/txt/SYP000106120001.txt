Maltby.

At 8.00am on -Saturday 15th April 1989* ^ commenced duty at Maltby Police

Station, from where 1 was transported to Hillsborough Football Ground.

At 10.00am a briefing was held ig the main stand, which I attended.

 attend Claywheels Lane foe a meal, however, we were instructed to stand by at

 the junction of Penistone Hoad and Herries Road South.

 At                w©      were directed into the ground, and upon reaching the main stand

Continuation of statem ent of   L, ALLfe^



Upon arrival at this point I saw that many of the supporters from this

section of the stand were on the pitch and many of them appeared dazed

and distressed. It appeared that there was some major problem inside the

stand, and more and more people were trying to get through gaps in the fenci

and onto the playing area.

General control was maintained of the crowd coming onto the pitch* This

control was kept until all the crowd had left the stand.

At          we left the ground to perform stand by duties on Penistone

Road, at it's junction with Herries Road South.

At 5•20pm we returaed to the main stand where an appraisal of the day's

events was given by a senior officer.

We were stood down at                returning to Maltby at 7•50pm, where

after a further de-briefing, we retired from duty*

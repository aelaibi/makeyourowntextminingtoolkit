   NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.

2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want o f attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                     Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause o f death.

3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                           Re
     C.D. died from the industrial disease of

     C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
     on drugs.

     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                     Cause of death
     care/self-neglect').

  b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
    infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
    of the following forms be adopted:

     C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
     his/her mind was disturbed).

     C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
     induced abortion.                                                     Verdict
     C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.

  c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
    it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.
  d In the case o f a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not

       Our Ref: Hills/Sol/4/SLP/JT                                              17th September 1990


       Dear Sirs,

       Re.- RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


       If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
       of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
       on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
       due course.

       I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
       evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
       coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
       inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

       Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
       under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
       witnesses who wish to give evidence. I am at present engaged in considering
       this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

       Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
       to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
       appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
       consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

       May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
       attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

       I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
       names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
       to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

       I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
       heard from you by the end of SjgjH^mber I will assume you have no names to
       submit.

       Yours faithfully

Re:       OT8EHEK PPJtflCIS 0»Neill (DECEASED) Ko .87.

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not~to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



 S.L.Popper,
 H.M.Coroner.

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

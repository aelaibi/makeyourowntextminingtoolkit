                            FOOTBAT.T. SPECTATORS BILL


         I understand that a meeting has been arranged for 10.30 this evening
to discuss the draft announcement attached to Alan Ring's letter of 22 May.
As you know, the Home Secretary is in the Channel Islands with the Royal
party, and we do not have another Minister free to represent him at the
meeting.   However, I have been able to consult the Home Secretary, who has
seen Alan Ring's letter and its attachment.    The Home Secretary has asked
me to let you know that he is agnostic on the question of how far the
announcement should go in detailing the amendments which will be made to the
Bill;    he considers, however,    that the third paragraph of the draft
announcement should be deleted.      As at present drafted it gives the
impression that we believe Lord Justice Taylor may make comments with a
bearing on the Bill in his interim report, whereas we know that this is
unlikely to be the case.     The Home Secretary therefore thinks it best to
delete reference to Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry from the announcement
altogether.

          Copies of this letter go to the recipients of Alan Ring's letter of
22 May.

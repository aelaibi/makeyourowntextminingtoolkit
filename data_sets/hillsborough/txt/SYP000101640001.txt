Folio ing the briefin- at Hillsborough or. the 15th* of «pril 1 9 8 9 * I was deployed to work
ies at the rear of the West stand guarding the fences which had formed a sterile area in
ch the television crews and pass cars were kept* Our duties in the serial 6, under D*S.
    Korburn were to prevent the fans fron both clubs clashing and to avnid congestion in hhe area

^t 15*30 hrs that dite I recall bein~ approached by a c
                                                      7 -'~up of youths aged from 12 - 1L yrs

    were badgering ug , the Police for tickets. I was offerred £50*00 pounds, the notes being pusb
towards me, to take then into the ground. I refused.

\s late as 15*50 hrs I was still being approached and asked for tickets for the Liverpool end |
tiich I advised that they leave the area if they didnt have tickets. Throughout this time fans j
    th^pdverpool end were directed to their end of the ground, the access bein~ via parkside Hd,j
:h I v;ac able to point out from ny position. As the hick-off tir.c- neared, more and more fruas
Lved at the fencing , wanting to be let tftroufii but I 1lad to tell thcr. to go round. As their
tation grew so they began running round rather then tailing theirxtime.

It 14*20 hrs I left ny station to vice the toilets in the ground. As I looked into the ground,
ig inte ested X in the number of fans in the grou::d, I recall that the Kop end looked full to
icity, comparing it with the Leppings Lane end \:hich was enpty in its \.ing areas and yet
r in the pen behi d the net, often the place that fills first for the ;jo sl view.

•pproaching Kick—offtine accompanied by Police Consta le 1 6 9 Fillinghan v/e informed other

Of th ■ Liverpool fans urinating at the rear of th       stand and pointing out the toilets. At
xrinately 15*03 I recall hearing a t nnoy message to the effect ' \<TLL. TIL, FAi: PLEAS.'. GUT
lIu. PITCH* fearing that there may be a pitch invasion we ran into the second access tunnel
    the rvtand and there saw a number of people o    the oitch ^t the rear of the Leppings Lane              i
, the players were walking towarsd the centre of th       pitch. We immediately entered the areaxt
id the perimeter track, maiding our way towards the rear of the goal.

:iose behind the goal were what seemed to be dozens of fane and Police. I was ctill under the
»ssion that an invasion had taken place, however on nearing the scene I coild 6ee, through ga-
i    the crowd that up to a dozen peo|ile of ages ranging between 14   9   17 yrs. These youngsters

heir arms held aloft, which in turn were peessed against the mesh* Ky first reaction was to

      My feelings were of complete helplessness thinking that if only I could move the mesh X                   j
uld get somebody out* X screamed until I was hoarse, telling the fans massed beh-nd the fronv
    rowsof cr shed fans    to move back. They seemed oblivious to ny pleas, ;nd continued to climbj

s being pulled as if to open it, the weight of bocies against it though stopped tnat because
e body weight was ’ bellying out’ the bottom cf the gate*

      Despite pullin™ numerous fans over the top, an officer carrying r. loudhailer shouted behin;

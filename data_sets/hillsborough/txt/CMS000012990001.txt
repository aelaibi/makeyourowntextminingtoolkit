               HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

                   INTERIM REPORT PUBLISHED

The Interim Report of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry
under Lord Justice Taylor is published today. The Judge makes
extensive findings as to the cause     of the disaster and in his
recommendations proposes 43 instant measures capable of being
implemented forthwith and, where possible, before the start of the
next football season.

Brief Summary of Causes

Lord Justice Taylor finds that:-

"The    immediate cause of the gross   overcrowding and hence the
disaster was the failure, when gate C was opened, to cut off
access to the central pens which were already overfull.

They were already overfull because no safe maximum capacities had
been    laid down,   no attempt was made to control entry to
individual pens numerically and there was no effective visual
monitoring of crowd density.

When   the influx from gate C entered pen 3, the layout of the
barriers there afforded less protection than it should and a
barrier collapsed. Again, the lack of vigilant monitoring caused a
sluggish reaction and response when the crush occurred. The small
size and number of gates to the track retarded rescue efforts. So,
in the initial stages, did lack of leadership.

The need to open gate C was due to dangerous congestion at the
turnstiles. That occurred because, as both Club and police should
have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope with the
large numbers demanded of it unless they arrived steadily over a
lengthy period. The Operational Order and police tactics on the
day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival of
large numbers should that occur in a short period. That it might
so occur was forseeable and it did. The presence of an unruly
minority who had drunk too much aggravated the problem. So did the
Club's confused and inadequate signs and ticketing."
The Judge says:-
"Wider issues such as membership schemes, identity cards, all-
seater stadia, super stadia and long term recommendations fall to
be considered in my Final Report. So do a number of other specific
matters such as a comprehensive review of the Green Guide*, the
problem of excessive pre-match drinking, fans without tickets and
ticket touts."
* Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.

Lord Justice Taylor says that further evidence and study will be
required before he can make recommendations on these matters.
Accordingly,    he  says,   the  main   thrust of  the   interim
recommendations, as a holding exercise,

"is to reduce numbers on the terraces, to increase vigilance and
to achieve a proper balance in crowd control between  prevention
of disorder and maintenance of safety."
The Judge has made no recommendations about taking down perimeter
fences. But he says that gates in them to the pitch should be kept
open whilst the terraces are occupied. He does, however, stress
that "it will, of course, be necessary to have a police presence
sufficient to prevent pitch invasion for improper reasons through
the open gates."
The Judge finds that in the assessment of figures for capacity,
the criteria in the Green Guide were not applied with sufficient
rigour at Hillsborough. Since this may also have been the case
elsewhere, he recommends that they should be reassessed with
proper and realistic allowance for all the factors concerned. On
top of that, he proposes a further reduction of 15 per cent on
terraces as an interim measure to improve the safety margin.

The scope of the interim recommendations covers the maximum
capacities for terraces, filling and monitoring terraces, fences
and gates, crush barriers, Safety Certificates, the duties of
football clubs, police planning, communications, the co-ordination
of emergency services, and first aid, medical facilities and
ambulances.
The interim recommendations are set out in full in Chapter 24 of
the report.

Part Two of the Inquiry

Lord Justice Taylor and his Assessors will now be starting work on
Part Two of the Inquiry. This will be directed to making final and
long term recommendations about crowd control and safety at sports
grounds. The Judge will be considering the large body of written
evidence submitted to him which he may want to supplement in some
instances with further oral evidence or discussion in conjunction
with his Assessors. He will also need to make a number of visits
and inspections. He has indicated that he expects to prepare his
final report and recommendations at about the turn of the year.
Note to Editors

Following the disaster at Hillsborough stadium on April 15, when
95 people were killed, Lord Justice Taylor was appointed by the
Home Secretary:-

"To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football
ground on April 15 1989 and to make recommendations about the
needs of crowd control and safety at sports events."

Lord Justice Taylor was assisted by two Assessors: Mr Brian
Johnson QPM, Chief Constable of Lancashire, and Professor Leonard
Maunder OBE, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University
of Newcastle upon Tyne. The secretary of the Inquiry was Mr Robert
Whalley from the Home Office. The investigation of the disaster
and the gathering of evidence was carried out by the West Midlands
Police under their Chief Constable Mr Geoffrey Dear, who appointed
Assistant Chief Constable Mervyn Jones to take full time charge of
the investigation. Counsel for the Inquiry were led by Mr Andrev
Collins QC. Technical tests and studies were carried out at the
Health and Safety Executive's Research and Laboratory Services
Division in Sheffield.

The hearing began on May 15 in Sheffield Town Hall, and continued
for 31 days concluding on June 29. 174 witnesses gave oral
evidence. Transcripts of the evidence came to over 3,800 pages,
and some one and a half million words in all. Lord Justice Taylor
also received some 1550 letters.
                        CHAPTER 24 - THE RECOMMENDATIONS


315. The recommendations which follow are the minimum necessary
to ensure that existing football grounds can for the present be
safely    used,       based    upon    the       evidence      which   I have       heard   at
Sheffield and other information I have received.                          They complement
the recommendations which Mr Justice Popplewell set out after his
inquiry at Bradford.


316. Those which are asterisked should be carried out before the
1989/90 season starts.               The rest should be started forthwith and
completed as soon as possible.


Maximum Capacities for Terraces


1.      Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which
are   self-contained,          the    Safety         Certificate   should         specify   the
maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or
area.


A pen or area is to be deemed "self-contained" notwithstanding
that it has a gate or gates affording access to another pen or
area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.


2.      Each     figure       for    maximum         capacity should    be    assessed       in
accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide ("the Green Guide
figure") subject to the following qualifications:-


        (a)    in arriving at          "the Green Guide            figure",        proper and
               realistic allowance must be made for all factors which
               should    reduce       the    permissible        density      in    accordance
               with     the     range       of       maximum    figures      specified       in
               paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;


        (b)    after assessing "the Green Guide figure", a deduction
               of 15% should be made to improve the safety margin.
                                                 1
3.    Arrangements should be made:-


      (a)    to limit the number of spectators entering each self-
             contained pen or area to the maximum capacity figure
             assessed          in    accordance       with    Recommendation       2   above
             either          electronically,          mechanically,    by     a   ticketing
             arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and


      (b)    to close off further access to such pen or area when
             its maximum capacity is about to be reached.



Filling and Monitoring Terraces


4.    There should be a written agreement between the club and the
police   setting out their respective responsibilities for crowd
safety   and control and              in particular          for the filling of         each
self-contained pen or other terraced area and the monitoring of
spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding.                                  Any
variation     of       the    agreement     in   respect       of an individual match
should be agreed in writing in advance.


5.    At each match, there should be on the perimeter track,                                for
each self-contained pen or other terraced area, a steward (if the
club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police
are monitoring it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions
in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
period      the    area       is    occupied     by    spectators.          Whoever    is    so
appointed should be in addition to any other steward or police
presence.         He    should have ready access                to the police officer
authorised        under      Recommendation          9 below,    and by      radio to the
control room.


Fences and Gates


6.    All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to
the   terraced          areas       and   especially         those   with    duties    under
                                                 2
Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with
regard to the recognition of crowd densities, to the recognition
of    signs of distress          and    to crowd dynamics.           Training should
include demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to
enable       stewards     and     officers    to        recognise    different      crowd
densities.


7.     All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other
self-contained areas should be painted in a different colour from
the rest of the fence and marked "Emergency Exit".


8.     Where    there are perimeter fences,                all gates to the pitch
should be kept fully open during the period when spectators are
on the terrace.


9.     There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence
(or group of gates if they are close together) a police officer
authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a
gate    to    relieve     overcrowding.           The    officer    so   authorised    in
respect of each gate             should be        identified   for each match         and
known    to    be   so   by     all    stewards    and police       officers   in    that
vicinity.        He    should be       able   to make radio contact with              the
control room either himself or via am officer close at hand.


10.     Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided
by the club at each ground where there are perimeter fences to
permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers
of spectators if necessary.                Agreement should be reached as to
whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire brigade
or stewards.          Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so.
Whether       to use     it should be a decision of a nominated senior
police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers


11.     All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately
for signs of corrosion.                Any barrier found to be affected by a
significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.
12.    The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should
be    reviewed        immediately         to     ensure         that       it    complies      with       the
criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide.                                           If it does
not, the assessment of the maximum capacity figure for that pen
or    terraced        area,       in    accordance         with Recommendation                 2 above,
should reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates


13.    There      should           be    am     immediate             review         of    each      Safety
Certificate       by        the    responsible            local       authority,          which      should
consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued,
the    police,        the     fire      service,          the    ambulance           service       and    the
building authority.                Such a review should include am inspection
of    the   stadium.              Its    object        should         be        to   ensure    that       the
operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to
add or substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter
of urgency        following the findings and recommendations                                       in this
report.


14.    Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports
stadium      designated            under       the     1975       Act      for       which    no     Safety
Certificate           has    yet       been    issued          should      proceed        forthwith        to
remedy the situation.


15.    Every     Safety Certificate                   should be reviewed by                    the local
authority        at    least       once       annually          and    each Certificate              should
require to be renewed annually.


16.    Each      local       authority          should          review      its      arrangements          for
issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing, amending and renewing
Safety      Certificates.                Such    review          should          require      that       there
exists      or   is provided             am accountable               administrative structure
whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
effectively supervised by senior officers amd elected members and
decisions        are        properly          taken       in     accordamce          with     the        local
authority's rules.
                                                      4
17.    To assist the local authority in exercising its functions,
it    should    set    up    am Advisory       Group consisting of appropriate
members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the
fire and ambulance services,                of the building authority,                     of the
club and of a recognised supporters' club.                           The Advisory Group's
terms of reference should encompass all matters concerned with
crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and
attendance at matches.              The Advisory Group should have a chairman
from    the    local    authority,       and       am    effective        procedure.             Its
resolutions      should      be     recorded       amd   it    should       be    required       to
produce regular written reports                    for consideration by the local
authority.


Duties of each Football Club


18.    Each turnstile should be inspected amd its potential rate of
flow measured.         Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to
ensure     that       each     turnstile           remains      capable          of    admitting
spectators at the rate amticipated.


19.    The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and
the turnstiles serving it should be such as to ensure that all
the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area cam
pass through the turnstiles within one hour.                              If that cannot be
done, the capacity             of    that    viewing          area    should          be   reduced
accordingly.


20.    Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of
the area served by them is about to be reached amd arrangements
should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with
turnstile operators for this purpose.


21.    Closed    circuit       television          should     be     so   installed         as    to
enable crowd densities outside the ground, within concourse areas
and in pens amd other stamding areas, to be monitored before and
throughout a match.


                                               5
22.   All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the
ground     should     be     comprehensively               reviewed.        It    should,    in
relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye­
catching, simple and clear and should be designed to ensure the
rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing area.


23.     Information on           tickets should be               unambiguous,      simple and
clear      amd    should        correlate     absolutely            with    the   information
provided in respect              of each match both outside and                    inside the
ground.          Retained        ticket     stubs          should    containinformation
necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.


24.     Information        on     tickets     requesting            spectators     to   be   in
position by a particular time should be reviewed by clubs                                    in
conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with
the planned arrangements for admitting spectators to the ground.


25.     Each club should consult with a recognised supporters club
as    to    the     provision          of   pre-match            entertainment      aimed at
attracting spectators to the ground in good time.


Police Planning


26.     The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there
is one designated stadium or more should nominate a chief officer
to liaise with the management of each football club amd local
authority        concerned       in   respect         of   the    safety    and   control    of
crowds.


27.     The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium
and the pre-match briefing of all officers on duty there should
alert      such     officers          to    the       importamce       of    preventing      any
overcrowding amd, if any is detected, of taking appropriate steps
to remedy it.


28.     The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium
should enable the police to cope with amy foreseeable pattern in
the arrival of spectators at a match amd in their departure.                                  It
                                                  6
should provide for sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment
of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.


29.   The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion
of the officer in command at the ground.                 Crowd safety should be
the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.


30.   There should be       available in the police control roan the
results of all closed circuit television monitoring outside and
inside the ground amd the record of any electronic or mechanical
counting of numbers at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any
area of     the ground.      Officers        in the control          room should be
skilled in the interpretation amd use of these data.


Communications


31.   There should be sufficient operators in the police control
room to enable all radio tramsmissions to be received, evaluated
and   amswered.      The   radio    system      should    be    such    as    to    give
operators in the control room priority over, amd the capacity to
override,    others using the same           chamnel.       Additional        channels
should be used, where necessary,             to prevent overcrowding of the
airwaves.       Consideration should be given to sound-proofing the
control room against excessive crowd noise.


32.   To    complement     radio    communications,         there      should      be   a
completely      separate   system of land lines with             telephone links
between the control room amd key points at the ground.


33.   Within the control room,          there should be a public address
system to communicate with individual areas outside amd inside
the   ground,     with   groups    of   areas   or   with      the    whole     ground.
Important announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to
catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of noise in
the ground.      This arramgement should be prominently advertised on
every programme sold for every match.


34.   Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising
                                         7
boards to address the crowd.                   Consideration should also be given
to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to
indicate to the control room the existence of certain emergencies
or requirements.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services


35.     The    police,     fire       and    ambulance       services       should maintain
through       senior     nominated          officers       regular    liaison      concerning
crowd safety at each stadium.


36.     Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should
ensure that the fire service and ambulance service are given full
details       about    the event,        including its venue,               its timing,     the
number of spectators expected,                     their likely routes of entry and
exit,    and any anticipated or potential difficulties concerning
the control or movement of the crowd.                            Such details should be
readily available in the control rooms of each of the emergency
services.


37.     Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium
of emergency vehicles from all three services should be reviewed.
They    should        include    routes       of       access,   rendezvous       points,   and
accessibility within the ground itself.


38.     Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should
be    briefed     as     to     the    contingency         plans     for    the   arrival    of
emergency services and should be informed when such services are
called as to where and why they are required.


First Aid. Medical Facilities and Ambulances

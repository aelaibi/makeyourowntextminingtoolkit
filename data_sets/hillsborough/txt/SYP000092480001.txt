                 I reside at the above address wit h another                           person,

                 I am a supporter             of Liverpool          Fo^tfbal 1 Club and during            last season

been seen by the Police                 he did not go         into the game         but stayed on the

bus with the driver.

We    left the     car    park of

                                                  at 7 am       (0700)    on the morn in g           of the

match.     We t ra velled along            the M1 and stopped once for                    food.       We did

not have any more            traffic      hold ups and a r r i v e d        in S h ef field at about

12 m id d a y    (1200),

The Mini Bus          was       parked at the Notts Forest End                    of the ground so that

we    could get       awa y after the game,              it was about           four miles        from the

ground on a piece of waste                 land.        I have     been to Hi 1 lsbrough on four

previous        o ccasions      so I     knew where        to go.

We went     to a         nearby    pub whi ch was        full    of Notts         Forest s upporters          and

had a drink and game of poo 1.                    We    left the     pub at a quarter               to two

(1343) a nd wa lk ed to the ground.                     The a tm os p h e r e    in the     pub was

f ri endly and there was               no trouble.        On the way to the ground                   I saw a

few people        drinking       from cans     but there was           no d r u n k e n e s s .     I saw a

few m o u nt ed Police          on the way to the ground,                I did not get or ask for

a ny directions          because       I knew where        I was    going.

We a r r iv ed at the Leppi ng s Lane              t urnstiles at about             half     past two,

(1430),    at this time we were all                    together.       At this      point         there was a

crowd of        people    but    no crush or       pushing.         I had       lost one of our         party,

I think     it was               so    I wa it ed at the        rear of the        crowd the others

m oved forward and started to queue.                        While     I was waiting          there     just by

the outer        large    iron gates about             t hree m o u n t e d Police      star te d to push

the    crowd     inside    the    large    blue gates.           Beca us e of this a c t i o n our

party became        split       up and    I was    now wit h                          and                     At

this    point     it was     so tight      I lifted my feet off the ground and was

held up by the           crowd.

By the    crowd we        pushed to the        left of the          turnstiles w h i c h was           to the

seats    the wrong        turnstile       for us,       this was      caused by the Police
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     S3674

pushing     us all         the one way.         It was about       five minutes        from joining

the    crowd,       until    we    reached the turnstiles,            the only     reason       I was

w o r r i e d was    for            because     she faints       in a crowd and        it was her

first football             match.

We entered the ground through the seat                          turnstiles     not our       correct       one,

the only comment             the operator made was to                        who was the       last one

thro ug h and he was              told he    couldn't     come    through because           h e ’d the

wrong    ticket.                    was   let   into the    ground whe n       it was e xplained

that    others       had entered wit h the w rong               tickets and because           of the

crowd there was             no way he       could go back.

Once    inside       the    turnstile       there was      no    crush,    I saw one P o l i c e m a n

stood by portable             barriers      to our   right,       these    barriers were           stopping

us getting          to our    correct area,        and the P o l i c e m a n w ou ldn't       let us

through a gap          in the       barrier at first.            I w a l k e d ar ou nd towards          the

seats thinking             there might      have been a different             entrance       but    there

w a s n ’t so we      returned to the P o l i c e m a n and e xplained to him what                        had

h a ppened and        pushed through into the              correct area.

I was now with                    and            only,    we w a l k e d towards      the tunnel          w hich

leads to the terrace.                   I have never      been    in that area        before       but    I.

could see the          pitch through the tunnel.                  Before     I went    down the tunnel

I looked across             to my right and saw a large               blue    concertina gate open

and people walk in g              into the area at        the    rear of the turnstile.

The    three of us ente re d the tunnel                  and w al k e d towards       the    terrace at

this time w h ic h was             just   before   kick    off    it was     reasonable and we

could walk          comfortably.          We we re about        half way down the           tunnel       when

we were hit          from the       rear and     pushed through the tunnel              into the

terrace.        On entering          the terrace      I lost      touch with                 but               was

behind me and at one                point    had hold of her arm.             We were       pushed all

the way down the terrace                  on the   right of the goal,           I did not see or

encounter any barrier and                   came to a stop one         person away from the                gate
                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                   S3674

at the front        of the gate        in the      perimeter       fence    in Pen three.

I have m a rk e d      two   positions      on a separate          grid plan w h ic h       I produce

(Ex No            ) (Ref No                 these      positions are ma rk ed as numbers                  1

and number 2.

On    reaching    the    point near        the gate       I was aware       that           was     behind

me a nd to my       left wit h a couple of              people     between us.        There was one

man    in front     of me against          the gate,       he was    conscious       but    could only

see    the back     of his head and           could not describe            him.

At this     point      I could hear        the    crowd    cheer    but    I did not see any of

the field or        players.

I was    comp le tely jammed          in the      crowd and      could not move,           the man

s li g ht l y to the     left and      in front        of me was     jammed against me.              At

this    point    I heard              start      to scream and       I said to the          two

P o l i c e m e n standing    on the track the            other side of the          perimeter       gate

“You must       open the gate there's              people getting          crushed    in here."

The    reply from one of them was                 "I   can't."      My chest was hurting at

this    point    but    I could still         breath.       It was    then    I heard

screaming again.              It was then        I said to the Police,             " Y o u ’re going to

have    to a rrest me         I ’m going    to call you all          the    bastards       under    the

sun."     The    two P o l i c e m e n then started to panic and               looking at          each

other as     if not knowing what              to do.       The man     in front of me was also

hurling abuse at them.                 I could see a young           girl    to my    left wit h her

face    pushed against             the fence and her        b oy friend behind her was also

pushed ag ai nst        the fence.         It was about       two minutes          later w hen the

same    two P o l i c e m e n opened the gate,            at this    point    there were          no fans

on the    pitch.

I pushed the        lad out         in front of me and then            I let about         three or four

to my    right    out,       and    then I climbed out,          I then turned a ro u n d and went

to get back       t hrough the gate to get                          She was    being held up by

a m an behind her,            she was almost           unconscious.

    The m an had one side         of her and       I g r a bb ed the other and we               pul 1ed her

    through the       gate    into the    pitch.     At this        point    the game was             still

    going on.        1 went    into the    pitch and said to G r o b b e 1ar,              “ I t ’s

    h appening a g a i n Bruce     don't     play walk off."              I saw him turn a ro u n d and

    his    face went white.        At this       point             was    lying on the touchline                in

    a dazed state.           By this    time there was about              twenty    people     out      into

    the    pitch.

    I looked    into the terrace and saw a girl                    d ir ec tl y behind the goal

    against    the fence she was blue and d e fi na te ly d e a d .                  I w o ul d say the

    girl was    in her twenties.           I could not describe              her or her         clothing

    a ny further.




    I had a black       leather    jacket     on I took       this       off and threw        it on the

    pitch and       climbed up the fence.            1 do not know          if the game was still

    going on or not.

    I was    trying    to reach down to the girl              but    could not because                of the

    crushing    of the fence.           I m a n ag ed to pull       up one or two fans                so they

    could reach the top of the fence and                    pull    themselves       up.      I climbed

    down then and star te d to look for a ny of the other                          lads.                was

    still    on the    pitch    in a dazed state           the game       had stopped there was no

    players on the       pitch.

    I saw one or two          bodies    on the    pitch one        had his T shirt          pulled over

    his face    it was a white shirt,             I remember        he had one trainer on,                he

    was on the       right    of the goal     on his arm.           As    I was    looking at him.              I

    saw a p hotographer         taking a picture           of him I star te d        lashing out at

    him,    and said,    "If you take any more              photographs       I ’ll smash your

    camera."        He went a way and       1 went    to    look for               again,     I found her

    and             was w it h her then,      both were       crying and                   went       one way

    and    I went    the other.        I broke down some a d v e r ti si ng          boards       on the

                        I did about       two trips across              the   pitch w ith two           people       one was

                        def'inately dead and             I w o ul d describe        him as 33 years, big build, with

                        far    corner    of the      pitch a red cross or P o l i ce ma n said he was dead.

M s         .fJ0»vt The other           person      I helped      carry was a male aged about 20 years,                          blonde

                        hair,    with a red T shirt                          -------------------------------------

^                       breathing.        I left him with a St Johns man.

                        I saw a lot of people              carrying       people across           the    pitch and also          people

                        lying dead and          injured but        cannot describe any of them.

       ^                I went    back to the centre           of the         pitch and met                    and             agax n ,

                        At this    point       I could not believe             there was so many Police                  standing

                        a r o un d not helping with the bodies.                     Then   I heard the game was                 going

                        to be    restarted,         so   I went to one of the Police and said,                          "I am not

                        moving    from the       pitch till we find out that the game                           i s n ’t going     to be

                        played today."           After about        five minutes           I heard over          the Tannoy that

                        the game was a b a n doned.

                    r           by then.       We    climbed      into a stand and out of the ground,                          we did

                        not go back through the tunnel.                       We    passed a line of Police               in

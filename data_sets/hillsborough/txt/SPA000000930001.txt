Jo in t Report o f the Clerk and Treasurer and Chief Constable


FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO FORMER OFFICERS IN LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS


1     Purpose o f the Report

      To update members on progress regarding applications for funding of
      defence costs in legal proceedings arising out of the Hillsborough
      disaster; and to seek confirmation of the basis on which previously
      agreed funding will be provided.



      2     Recommendations

             1     The Authority is asked to note the current
                   situation and to await detailed reports if and
                   when further applications for funding are
                   received.

            2      The Authority is asked to confirm the proposed
                   terms under which financial support will be
                   provided in connection with the committal
                   proceedings, in the period between 5 February
                   and 20 July 1999.

            3      The Authority is asked to consider and give
                   guidance on the specific issues referred to in
                   sections 4.1 to 4.6, 5.2 and 6.3 of this report.



3     Progress and Legal Proceedings

3.1   Following the committal hearing which concluded at Leeds Magistrates
      Court on 20 July, a Directions hearing was held on 3 September 1999.
      We await a copy of the order made at the hearing but it has been
      reported to our solicitors that a trial date has been set for 6 June 2000
      and that the prosecutor, Miss Ann Adlington is to serve all the witness
      statements on which she proposes to rely by the end of November
      1999.
3.2   It is also been reported that the former officers applied for and were
      granted a hearing for a further application that the prosecution should
      be stayed on the grounds that it is an abuse of process. This
      application will be heard by a circuit judge on 4 January 2000. It is
      expected to last 4-5 days. An identical application had been heard by
      the Magistrate during the course of the committal proceedings, but was
      rejected. Similar issues were considered by the DPP and the court
      during the judicial review of the DPP’s decision not to take over and
      discontinue the prosecution.

3.3   An application to the Authority was made by the former officers in early
      July 1999 to meet the costs of the further hearing to stay the
      prosecution on the grounds that it is an abuse of process. Upon being
      informed that the Authority could not consider the application within the
      time frame sought by the officers, the application was effectively
      withdrawn. The Authority can expect to receive further application on
      the abuse of process proceedings and for the costs of and incidental to
      the trial of the action. The former officers’ solicitors have been
      informed that the detailed estimates of their costings will be required
      before the Authority will be in a position to consider these applications

4     Agreement on costs authorised on 21 May 1999

4.1   Costs to 5 February 1999

      a      Costs of Walker Morris (solicitors for Mr Bernard Murray)

             Messrs Walker Morris have claimed costs to 12 January 1999
             totalling £173,055.47 which are made up as follows:


                                         Fees             VAT             Total

             Solicitor’s fees      103,687.50        18,145.31     121,832.81
             Harrison QC            32,750.00         5,731.25      38,481.25
             Myerson                10,468.00         1,897.66      12,741.41

             TOTAL                  146,905.50       25,774.22     173,055.47


            Following review by the Authority’s solicitors and costs
            draftsman engaged by them, it is recommended that Walker
            Morris be offered £81,475 in respect of their fees and that
            £30,000 and £9,500 be offered in respect of Mr Harrison QC
            and Mr Myerson's fees. All sums will be subject to VAT. This
            would represent a reduction of approximately 20% on Walker
            Morris’s fees and 10% from Counsel’s fees. If agreement
            cannot be reached with Walker Morris, the costs should be
            referred to the court of assessment.




                                                                              2
      b     Winkworth Sherwood’s costs to 5 February 1999

            The total costs claimed by Winckworth Sherwood are
            £105,612.92 which are made up as follows:


                                         Fees             VAT             Total

            Solicitor’s fees        33,133.33         5,798.33       38,931.66
            Clegg QC                45,125.00         7,896.88       53,021.88
            Isaacs                  11,625.00         2,034.38       13,659.38

            TOTAL                   89,883.33        15,729.59      105,612.92


            It is proposed that Winckworth Sherwood’s fees be allowed as
            claimed, but that £41,000 and £10,500 be offered in respect of
            the Counsel fees for Mr Clegg QC and Mr Isaacs. Once again,
            this represents a 10% deduction in Counsel’s fees. If these
            deductions cannot be agreed, it is proposed that the bills be
            referred for assessment.

4 2    Terms of support for costs from 5 February 1999

      It was reported to the meeting on 16 July that informal acceptance had
      been received of the terms set out in the Authority’s offer of support
      following the 21 May resolutions. The solicitors have been asked to
      confirm this acceptance and this has now been received. Attached as
      appendix A1/A2 are copies of the formal letters which the Authority is
      now asked to approve for forwarding to the two officers, subject to the
      confirmation from the Authority’s tax inspector referred to in 4.6 below.

4.3   The costs indicated by the solicitors for the committal proceedings from
      5 February to 20 July 1999 are as follows:

      a      The costs for Walker Morris (for Mr Bernard Murray)

                                          Fees            VAT             Total

              Solicitor’s fees       79,012.50       13,827.19       92,839.69
              Disbursements*         35,970.95        6,223.86       42,194.81

             TOTAL                 114,983.45        20,051.05      135,034.55

             * includes Counsel’s fees




      b      The costs for Winckworth Sherwood (for Mr Duckenfield)


                                                                              3
                                         Fees              VAT           Total

             Solicitor's fees       84,200.00       14,735.00       98,935.00
             Counsel                69,087.50       12,090.00       81,177.81
             Disbursements           9,166.79        1,604.19       10,770.98

             TOTAL                162,454.29       28,429.19       190,883.79


      c     The indication of costs from Winckworth Sherwood totals
            £190,883.79. This exceeds the prescribed maximum set out in
            the draft agreement of £176,250. Winckworth Sherwood, on
            behalf of Mr Duckenfield, have asked the Authority to approve
            the reimbursement of the additional £14,600.

4.4   It is recommended that the Authority authorise Garretts, and the costs
      draftsman retained by them, to review the detailed costings received or
      to be received from Walker Morris and Winckworth Sherwood and to
      advise the Authority of the costs which should be offered to Walker
      Morris and Winckworth Sherwood. If the costs to be offered to
      Winckworth Sherwood are less than £176,250 and this offer is
      accepted by Winckworth Sherwood, there will be no need to consider
      the additional sums claimed by them.

4.5   Costs in connection with the DPP judicial review

      a     W alker Morris (for Mr Murray) have claimed the following:

                                         Fees              VAT           Total

             Solicitor’s fees       22,506.25         3,938.59      26,444.84
             Disbursements          15,785.30         2,641.34      18,426.64

             TOTAL                 38,291.55          6,579.93      44,871.43


      b     Winckworth Sherwood

            Winckworth Sherwood’s costs on the DPP judicial review are as
            follows:

                                Fees            VAT              Total

             Solicitor’s fees   16,050.00       2,808.75         18,858.75

      c     It is recommended that the Authority’s solicitors and costs
            draftsman review the costs claimed by Walker Morris and
            Winckworth Sherwood in order to advise the Authority on an
            offer in settlement of the costs.


                                                                             4
      It will be recalled that the DPP obtained an order that Messrs
      Duckenfield and Murray should contribute towards his costs of the
      judicial review. The DPP has yet to provide details of his costs to
      Walker Morris and to Winckworth Sherwood.

4.6   Potential tax liabilities

      It has been suggested to the Authority that the assistance to be
      provided to the former officers is taxable income which will be subject
      to PAYE deductions by the Authority and national insurance
      contributions. If this were to be the case, it could significantly affect the
      attraction of Police Authority support from the officers point of view
      and/or result in substantial additional liabilities for the Authority if it
      were to meet the additional tax. Confirmation is being sought from our
      tax inspector that PAYE and Nl are not payable. A response is
      expected within 4 to 6 weeks. It is recommended that pending receipt
      of that confirmation, no further financial assistance to be approved and
      that formal confirmation of the tetters setting out the terms of funding
      for the period from 5 February 1999 be deferred.

5     Travel and incidental costs

5.1   The solicitor representing Mr Duckenfield has also asked that the
      Authority treat as part of the approved support his clients travel and
      accommodation costs for the Leeds hearing and any other meetings or
      proceedings. Mr Duckenfield lives
                 Jrom Leeds, and needed to find accommodation for himself
      and his wife during the recent hearing. Similar costs will arise at future
       hearings.

5.2   The matter was not specifically considered at the 21 May meeting and
       it is not felt that the terms of the offer as currently drafted could be
      interpreted to cover it. The estimated costs are approximately £1,000
      to date. Members views are invited.

6     Financial and budgetary implications

6.1   The Authority has sought advice from Garretts on the potential total
      financial implications. The latest forecasts, broken down over the
      different elements of the proceedings, is set out below in summary,
       and in more detail in Appendix B.




                                                                        £000



                                                                                  5
      Costs to 5 February as claimed                                     279
      Costs 5 February to 20 July as claimed                             326
      Costs of Judicial review of DPPs decision as claimed               64
      Chief Constable’s legal costs                                      100
      Police Authority legal costs                                       186

                                                                        955

      This estimate is slightly lower than the figures circulated at the May 21
      meeting, which at that stage estimated total costs to the conclusion of
      the committal hearing of £1,013,000.

      The estimates above require qualification on a number of grounds.

      i)     no provision has been made for:

                     unfunded costs arising out of the South Sefton
                     proceedings

                     unrecovered costs from Ms A Adlington (HFSG) arising
                     out of the 'powers’ Judicial Review

                     costs in connection with the September 1999 Court
                     Hearings

                     any further tax liabilities which may arise.

      ii)    the estimates include at this stage provision for VAT on the
              former officers legal costs. It is anticipated that the Authority will
              receive confirmation that this is recoverable. The amount
              involved is approximately £100,000.

      iii)   the costs draftsman retained by the Authority has put forward
              proposals 1ot reducing the claims in the period up to 5 February
              by approximately £37,000 (13%). His assessment of further
              cost claims is in progress and will be reported.

6.2   The Authority originally set aside £0.5m in reserves to cover costs,
      arising out of the initial offer of support in February 1998. The cost
      estimates were updated at the meeting on 21 May. The latest
      estimates outlined above now confirm that the costs incurred as
      committed during 1998/9 have exceeded the original budgetary
      provision, and that the commitments resulting from the further support
      agreed in May will require additional provision.

6.3   Provision is being made in the 1998/9 Accounts for expenditure
      incurred or committed to 31 March, and earmarked provision will be
      made for further costs estimated to be committed during 1999/2000.
      The issue will be dealt with in more detail as part of the report on the
       1998/9 Accounts which is to be presented to the special meeting on 28


                                                                                   6
        September. However, the Authority is asked at this stage to approve a
        supplementary estimate - to be financed out of reserves - of £500,000
        to cover the potential liabilities identified to date.

7      C ontributions to the A u th o rity’s costs

7.1    A formal approach is to be made by the Chairman to the Home
        Secretary for financial Support towards the Authority’s costs in
       connection with Hillsborough. Home Office have the power to provide
       specific financial assistance to a Police Authority; in practice it is
       exercised infrequently, but there have been a number of recent cases
       where assistance has been granted. The Authority’s costs are not only
       those in connection with the criminal proceedings, but also resulting
       from outstanding insurance liabilities beyond the original insured limit.

        In the light of the implications of the outcome of the Hillsborough case
        for the police service generally, it is also intended that discussions will
        be held with the Superintendents Association and the Police
        Federation.

Mr D Duckenfield




Dear Mr Duckenfield

funding of your legal costs by South Yorkshire PoKce Authority ("The Authority")

I write further to the Authority's meeting cm Friday 21 May 1999.

        Dear David                   T A d ie P                  O re A                    i6 5 n r tp i

        South Yorkshire Police Authority - Costs - Mr D Duckettfield

        1 refer to Nick Painter’s letter of 1 September and revised draft agreement, srnd our
        telephone discussion subsequently about this,

        I confirm on behalf o f David agreement to the revised version subject to the following:

        1)                The restriction to legal costs and solicitors’ disbursements is not to be taken to
                          preclude any application by David in regard to reasonable expenses incurred by him.
                          I reiterate that at ali times he endeavours to minimise those expenses, as a matter of
                          common sense, and will continue to do so. There is an outstanding application In
                          this regard pending before the Authority.

        2)                The fixed amount o f £176,250 inclusive o f disbursements and V a T - you wili be
                          aware o f coursc that we have submitted a claim for a higher sum and it is the higher
                          sum which we seek'the Authority’s agreement on, We have seen M r Manning’s
                          letter to you o f 2 September and echo what he says about the timing o f work being
                          done. When we met with your costs draftsman, we understood he appreciated that
                          through available resources Walker Morris have undertaken much of the lead up
                          work at an earlier time, whereas this has been conducted by our firm when resources
                          have been available in the last few months, We of course appreciate that any figure
                          agreed up to the end o f committal will be subject to further analysis by the costs
                          draftsman and we would hope that that process will be sufficient protection for the
                          Authority id terms o f ensuring that the work carried out was reasonable and proper.
                          As wo have mentioned to your costs draftsman what is important is to look at the
                          overall situation rather than a discrete period because this car. be misleading. If the
                          Authority requires further clarification on this we will be pleased to help, and
                          confirm from our telephone discussion that we will ask our costs draftsmen to
                          prepare the detailed break up of that figure, in much the same way as the break up
                          was provided for costs up until February 1999.

         3)        In regard to Counsel's refresher fee, we had earlier agreed a figure o f £1,750 with
                   Counsel’s clerk, notwithstanding that Mr Manning agreed with Mr Harrison’s clerk
                   a lesser figure o f £1,250. The higher figure is a legitimate and fair figure for
                   Leading Counsel, notwithstanding that a later agreement was reached by the other
                   solicitors and we would hope that the Authority would understand this position. We
                   emphasise that this agreement with Mr Clegg’s clerk was reached in terms o f outline
                   figures when he was originally instructed.

         1 look forward to your advice regarding the meeting of 10 September, and naturally if we
         can assist fbrthcr in regard to the ongoing costs issues please do not hesitate to let me know.

         Yours sincerely

                 6 months.

                 In a d d i t i o n   to my full                    e employment,              I am a member           of the St.

                 J o h n ’s A m b ul an ce Sri'                 and     I u n d ertake          u n p a i d v o l u n t a r y work   for     the

                 B r i g a d e as a nursi-Rf meniber.                     The D i v i s i o n at w h i c h        I am a member             is

                 G r e e n School,           S h e f f i e l d 5.

                 I have       been a me m b e r           of the St.            J o h n A m b u l a n c e Brig a d e    for the       last

                 four a n d a half years.                     W h en    I first         joined       the St.      John Ambulance

                 B r i gade,     1 und e r t o o k a         13 week         training          course     in basic       first aid.

                 At    the    end of this             course,        there was an e x a m i n a t i o n w h i c h           I passed
N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t as     X was w a t c h i n g      television.

We were         w a tc hi ng a sports         p r ogramme        on t e l e v i s i o n when just after

3 o ’ clock       I h ea r d a lot of noise                  from two tone           horns       in the area.                   I

t ho u g h t    that    there must         be trouble at              the m a t c h and         that    the sirens

I h e a rd b e l o ng ed to Po l i c e           vehicles.

The      p r ogramme we were w a t c hi ng              on the        t e l e v i s i o n was    in t e r r u p t e d at

3. 0 7    pm for a n n o u n c e m e n t .       I know       it was at         this time          because       I

g la n c e d at     the      clock    in the      roorn.

The a n n o u n c e r     said that at           least       five     people were         dead at the

S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Footb a l l      Ground,        I was     shoc k e d whe n         I heard       this,

but      I knew that         there w ou ld        be quite a large               number         af St.     J o h n ’s

m em b e r s    w or k i n g at the      s emi-final          and     I thought       they w o u l d       be able              to

cope.

          and    I con t i n u e d    to w a t c h     the    television         to see         if a n y t h i n g   else

came      onto    the     t el ev i s i o n about H i l l s b o r o u g h .

A bo ut 3 or 4 m in ut es after                  the    first a n n o u n c e m e n t ,    there was a second

announcement            on the       t el ev i s i o n w h i c h stated         that more          people were

suspected         to be dead and            that       hundreds        of    people     had been          injured           in

the L e p pi ng s Lane          end of H il ls bo r o u g h .

When      I h eard this,                   said that          he w o u l d    try and get one of the

other St.         Jo h n ' s A mb ul a n c e s    to the gro u n d an d he began to                       ring our

D iv is io na l     Dut y Of f i ce r .       I conti nued to w a t c h              the t e l e v i s i o n and            I

saw other m em b e r s          of the St.           John Ambulance Brigade                     trying     to help

people         on the     pitch.       T hey o b v i ou sl y were            unable     to cope         because         of

the      scale    of what was          happening.

I told                 to forget        the a m bu la nc e       beca u s e we were             needed at       the

ground.          I then      ran upstairs            and     put my St.        J o h n ’s unif o r m on.                I

was w e ar in g        black    shoes,       black      tights and a grey dress.                        The    dress

initial      course w i t h a d d i t i o n a l           input    on first aid           in the workplace.

a n d a C er t i f i c a t e    was awarded.

In my third year as a me m b e r                      of St.      John's,        I attended       13 week       course

on    caring       for    the sick.          This      covers      both first aid and basic                  nursing

skills.            At the      end of the            course    the re    is an exam,          which     I passed,

a n d a C er ti f i c a t e     was awarded.

In a d d i t i o n to these            courses,        I a t t e n d e d a six week          refresher       course

All    of the        courses w h i c h        I have a t t e n d e d      last for a number             of weeks.

However ,         I w ou ld    like     to    clar i f y what        I have       stated     by saying       that

each week          of the      course        consists        of a t t e n d i n g 2 hours       session.

We     left    the house            in our       silver G r a n a d a m otor           car,    regi s t e r e d number

                        and drove           down                             right      into H e r r i e s R oad and

to     the    traffic         island at          the     end of H e r r i e s      Road.       Whe n we    reached

when     they saw our               u n i f o r m s , they      let us t h r o u g h and told us we were

w er e a lot of              people w al k i ng a w ay              from the     ground.        T hey all a p p e a r e d

to be w earing               L iv er p o o l    colours.

We     parked the            car    in L e p p in gs      Lane,       b e h i n d a fire      engine,     on the

opposite         side        of the        road to the L ep p i n g s Lane              entrance      to the

Liverpool          s u p p o rt er s were          very d i s t r e s s e d a n d a large          number       were

gate     that was            open.         As we got         into     the area,        which    is situated

between        the      t u r n s ti le s a n d the          rear of      the Le ppi ngs Lane S t a n d , it

w as    a scene         of    pure     chaos.          P e o p l e were m i l l i n g about        just    looking

dased,        many were            crying a n d        I saw a w hite            lad   pointing      to my      right

s h o u ti n g    "My brothers          there."         He was a w h i t e youth,              about       18 to      19

y e ar s    of a g e , he was        sitt ing       a ga i n s t a wall        so    I c a n ’t say how tall

he w a s , but he was             of s li m buiId,             he was       clean shaven and had blonde

wavy       hair.     He had an          injury       to his       face an d     nose and he was wearing

a    pair     of jeans w h i c h had a hole                   in one of       the knees,           but   I c a n ’t

remember which             knee.

I looked          to where     he was        pointing a n d JJ?*"saw next                 to a wall        in excess

of 30       bodies,       w hi ch wer e      laid nexj^to            one another.            These       people were

obviously          dead,    but    I am      unature to d e s c r i b e        any of them as              there was

a c o r do n of Police Of f i cej^a                standing         in front        of t h e m .     I am also

unable        to describe air/'of the Police                       Officers         who were        there.

I went        to help the boy who                had been         p o i nting and he said he was

alright          and told me       to go       into the gr o u n d where               I was       needed.

I t r i e d to get to the               pitch w i t h                 but as we had never                 been to

Hillsborough           before,      we were          lost.        Eventually,          I got onto         the    pitch

area       t h r o u g h a hole    in the metal               b a r riers    from the       terraces        in the

Leppings          Lane Stand.           I d o n ’t know how           I got     to there and             I d o n ’t

recall       seeing anyone          in the        terraces.           All     I remember          seeing was a

little       b o y ’s shoe     next       to the      fence,       it was a black            lace up and

c o u l d n ’t have       been more        than a size            twelve.       This       really upset me and

I went        really      cold.                        ^

When       I got    on to the       pL*?ch,       things were           quite       calm and the St.             J o h n ’s

side     of     the stand          1 saw a y o u t h sitting               on a board a g a i n s t            some    sand,

When     I looked at              the y o u t h an d e x a m i n e d       him,    he a p p e a r e d      to have an

his     i n jury a n d then             I left    him to             t for an a m b u l a n c e .

As    soon as        I finished           t reat i ngyChis y o u t h , I j ust went                     from one

T he y were all            very upset a bout what                    had          h a p p e n e d but     Iam unable        to

des c r ibe        the   people         I spoke       to.

By 6 o'clock             the re was        nothi ng         left     for          me an d        to do so we went

                  home.        We    first       c ol le c t e d    our     car a n d      then drove back              up to the house,

                  I have        thought a bout what                 has h a p p e n e d      for    some       time and       I feel       that

                 At 8 . 3 0 am     (0830)    an S a t u r d a y   15 April           1989   (150489),      I was     on duty          in

                  u ni fo rm at Doncaster          Pol    Stn     in company wit h             other Officers.



                 At 9 . 0 0 a m    (0900),    on the same          date,     we were          conveyed to H i l l s b o r o u g h

                 Football         Ground to     perform duties            in respect           of the Liverpool           •-•v~

                 where     I was deployed, under s up er v i s i o n of POL PS H O D G E T TS to commence

                  duty    on M i d dl ew oo d R d .


                                                                                     H & 3 Q 2 -
                  1 was    paired to work wit h P ol ic e w o m a n J O H N S O N a nd we were                     informed

                 to   perform foot          patrol     along M id dl e w o o d Rd from the                j u n c t i o n with
  t   L e p pings Ln to the            j u n c t i o n with Croft Rd         (our brief was           to prevent

      football         fans from        looting any shops).



      P OL PC JOHN S O N and myself                 patrolled one         side    of the street              from

      approximately           11.15am         (1115)     onwards.       Throughout         this     time      there was

      a steady and          constant          flow of Liverpool           fans walk i n g       in the        direction

      of the      c i ty centre.          The     f a n s , for    the most,      were     i n a good rnood and

      were well        behaved,         a l t h o u g h they were      somewhat       excitable.             However,       I.

      did see a lot of fans                   carrying     four     packs and six          packs whilst

      constantly asking POL PC J OH NS ON and myself                             the w h e r e a b o u t s    of the

      nearest       pub.      The      rest   of the morning           carried on        in the same           vein,     but

      with more            people asking          the same        question.



      At a pp r o x i m a t e l y     2 o'clock        (1400),      I recall      looking at my w a t c h and

      saying      to       POL PC JOHNSON,           " W e ’ll get a cup of tea soon because all                         the

      f ans will        b e m a k i n g t h eir way        into     the g r o u n dt o g e I t h e a t rno s p h e r e

      before      t hie g a me s t a r t s . "



      It was about          this      time w hen we were a p p r o a c h e d          by one of the            local

orr   residents who          informed us that              fans were       parking      in the street and

      then    peeing       up the sides           of the houses.



      As   kick    off time          neared      I was    sur p r i s e d to see      that Liverpool            fans

      were    still      on the street and               some were a r r i v i n g     off S YPTE        buses       with

      cans    of drinks,            w h i ch were   d i s c a r d e d whe n empty.



      There     was    no trouble         on the       street and we         c o ntinued      to patrol

      M i d d l e w o o d Rd where we         later      liaised wit h POL PS H O D G E ITS at                 the

                                                                                                                    S3 1 2 9

,        We were about            to walk       back along M i d d l e w o o d Rd when we were               informed

         that we had been d i r e c t e d to att e n d at                   the ground.         When    I. a s k e d what

         for,     s o m ebody said that            there was          fighting.



         W h e n we arri v e d at          the Leppings          Ln end of the ground,             there was a

         1arge        crowd of L i verpool            fans    outside     t he gates,     o b v i o u s l y t ryi ng to

         get    in,      but    being    told by other O f f i c e r s         that they       c o u l d n ’t go    in.



         I remember            telling     one youth to get             back and he was         very a g g i t a t e d and

         p roduced a ticket              shouting,         " I ’ve    paid good m o n e y for      this."          He

         carried         on shouting          and had to be           pushed   back,    as did others.



         At this         stage    I had no        idea what          had happened,      other    than we were

         r equired to stay at                 the gate.



         PO L PC J OH N S O N and myself                then saw an a m b u l a n c e    inside      the gates,           but

         outside         the ground and a body was                    lying at the      side of      it.     My first

         thought was           that     the    body a p p e ar ed      to be dead,      but    I thought,          "No,    it

         c a n 5t be."



         I then realised              that     people     seemed to be         coming    out    of the ground             in a

         confused         stated,       others were          d i s t r e s s e d and others were       shouting,          "You

         sho u l d be      in there."



         At    this      point    I still       was     not aware       of what   had happened,            although        it

         was    obvious        that     s o m ethin g    serious      had taken    place.        I then      looked

         ac r o s s   to the ac c e s s        road     running a r o u n d the    ground and          I saw some

         bodies,       w hich were         obv i o u s l y dead,      layed out on the ground d i r e c t l y

         opposite         the gate,       w h i c h gave access          to the Leppi n g s Ln end of               the

             A Senior Officer         then     i n structed myself        to stand with other O f f icers

              in front       of the   bodies    to    prevent   fans     leaving      the ground being able




             By this        time the fire      brigade had a t t e n d e d      the   ground and a m b u l a n c e s

             were com ing a nd going .



             I was     then d e p loyed with         other O f f icers    out    onto L e p pings Ln w i t h a

             brief     to keep fans mo v i n g away from the ground.

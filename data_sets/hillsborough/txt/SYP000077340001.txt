           I am a Police Sergeant            in the South Yorkshire Police,            stationed at

           Doncaster.

           On Saturday       15th April      1989,   I attended Hillsborough Football            ground

           for briefing          in connection the Nottingham Forest Liverpool Semi. Final



           At 11.15am that date on conclusion of t>?'e briefing                     I went with other

           members of serj^^al 24 to Middlewood/Road where we were deployed in the

           Hillsborough Shopping Pre c i n c X ^ l        was given to understand that the

           bulk of Liverpool         supporters would arrive at the ground via Middlewood

           Road but there was no significant movement of football                       supporters

           until 2.00pm.

           At 3 . 0 0 pm that date I arrested

           unemployed                                                 Liverpool,     in Middlewood Park
                                                                                   PAGE      2
                                                                                   S2160

         for being drunk and disorderly                       was very much the worse for

         drink,    he had a match ticket   in   his possession but at kick     off time he

         was not even in the vicinity of        the ground.

         Following his arrest    I conveyed     him to the Police Room atHillsborough

         Football Ground for documentation.        I was therefore not

         involved in the Leppings Lane      incident.

      Dear Peter,

      Hillsborough

      One o£ the key findings made against the South Yorkshire Police by
      Lord Juuticu Taylor w a s that there was a de facto acceptance of
      responKibility for control of the pens at the Leppings Lane end,
      this being .interpreted specifically as acceptance of responsibility
      for monitoring the numbers in those pens. See paragraphs 166 and
      J67 of the interim report.

      1 have been looking at the extent to which it is realistic to
      chftllenqe this finding at the forthcoming civil trial.

      The final Shape of our case is not yet. decided but./ in the light of

      individual yuan assumes far greater importance.                   If such a duty did
      exist then .  11 was undoubtedly brcachod.

      As the evidence came out at the inquiry, many Officers of various
      different ranks said that they believed the duty extended only to
      keeping an eye on the crowd and reacting to any signs of distress,
      in this context, overcrowding would not be seen as a problem unless
      and until some one or more persons could be observed to bcs in

 l'urther Proof of Evidence of

 of South Vorkshire Police, Snig Hill, Sheffield




 1.    1 make this statement, farther to the evidence

       which l gave to the Public Inquiry conducted by

       Lord Justice Taylor int.o the Hillsborough stadium
       disaster.


 2.    1 was on J.5th April, 1909 an Officer of the South

       Yorkshire Police with the rank of                   and

       I continue in that office,     (or amend as necessary)


3.     I have re-read the transcript of the evidence

      which i gave to the Inquiry and confirm that the

      answers which i gave to questions are accurately
      recorded.


4.    Nevertheless, the transcript gives a misleading

      impression of what I understand to have been the

      position m   relation to the control of numbers

      entering individual pens on the Leppings Lane

      terraces on lsth April, 1989.     j   believe that

      this confusion stems from the different meanings

      whjch can be ascribed to the word "monitoring".


5.    for the avoidance of doubt, my understanding of
      the position is as follows:


      5.1   On 15th April, 1989, i did not expect

            any 1’olice officer to be making a

            deliberate numerical or overall visual
      assessment of the numbers of fans

      entering each of the individual pens,


5.2   Nor did I expect any other body, e.g.

      Club Stewards or anyone else to be

      undertaking this exercise.


5.3   This contrasted with the position at

      League games where pens would be

      filled individually with a view to

      leaving some pans unoccupied for the

      purposes of segregation and crowd

      control.   This exercise did require an

      assessment of the number of tans in a

      pen, because the fans had no means of

      redistributing themselves as the gates

      at the back of the radial fences would

      be locked shut.


5.4   it is easy to see now that the gates

      at the rear of the radial fences were

      inadequate to allow for fans to re­

      distribute themselves, but that fact

      was not apparent before the disaster

      either to the Police or it seems to
      anyone else.


5.5   What I would expect from individual

      Police Officers and what T intended to

      convey by my evidence to the Inquiry

      was an alertness to problems in the
                        ' *"   1              ;              6274 \,35884-*          3742523409;# 7

                crowd which might, arise from over­

                crowding but might equally arise from

                fighting, hooligan behaviour or

                illness.           I have no reason to believe

                that any Officer failed in his duty
                in this respect.


    6.   Between 2.45 and 3.00 p.m. on the day of the
p        disaster I was


           off duty or not present at the ground

          on duty at the ground but. without a view of
          the terraces

          on duty at the ground with a view of the

          terraces (describe position and give assessment
          of crowd in terraces)

                             - A. Yes, sir.
              B              Were vou then referring solely again to the Kop? - A. Yes,
                    Q-       we were, sir, because on normal League games the away
                             supporters do not usually arrive late.

                             And vou say the trend may be due to the banning of alcohol
                    Q.       at sports grounds? - A. I think that could be correct,
                             sir, yes.

                        Q- That
                            led
                                  is vour view, is it, that the banning of alcohol has
                                  to people staying in the public houses longer than
                             thev mi°ht otherwise have done before going to the ground.
                             -a / That was something put forward by Mr. Stewart but
                             would totally agree that it does create a problem, sir.

                        0    Bv earlv 1988 then had this trend become fairly pronounced
                             as far as you were concerned? -A. It is with home supporters
              D              sir, but there again there is really no problem o them
                             getting into the.ground if theycome a little bit late.

                   rI        the Kop ' I do'Think that this was referring to an-evening
                             match as well, if I recollect, and probably problems witn
                             traffic people having to travel home from work, and it is
                             a little bit of a rush for them to get to an evening match.
                             I do think that that did refer to an evening match.

                        0. It seems to be talking about a trend, something that was
                           happening regularly from time to time? -A. Yes. It is not
                           a problem with the home supporters though, sir.

                        0     Do you not think the same thing could apply to either away
                              supporters or to both sets of supporters in a semi-.inal
                              - A. It is a possibility, sir. However, the away supporters
                              normally come, the maiority come, on coaches and trains
                              which are due to arrive fairly early at the ground, sir.

                         0    Had you any experience of people c o m i n g late to the ground
                              at the Leppings Lane end before the 1989 semi-rinal? - A.
                              No, sir, there were no problems at the 1988 semi ^inal.

                         0. Mo. I appreciate that. But at any stage during the 1988
                            or the 1989 season? — A. There had been no intelligence
                            whatsoever to suggest that anybody was going to come
                            late to the semi-final in 1989. There was no information
                            *rom the Football Liaison Officer at Headquarters and tne
                            Divisional Intelligence Officer, Detective Sergeant
                            Charlesworth, gave us no information at all regarding any
                            suggestions that any Liverpool or Nottingnam supporters

     were going to come late and Sergeant Charlesworth had been
     in touch with all the clubs involved and in fact produced
     quite a lengthy document on the intelligence and there was
     absolutely no intelligence cane to him which was passed to
     us,and I have spoken to him since, about anybody suggested
     coming late.

Q. And you had had no experience    of that either during   the ....
   -A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Yes, thank you. Now again, before the 1988 semi-final,
   one matter that was mentioned    in evidence some considerable
   time ago, did you have a meeting with the Ambulance Service
   before" the 1988 semi-final? -A. Yes, I believe they came
   to one of the meetings at Hammerton Road.

0.    What was the purpose of this meeting so far as they were
     concerned? -A. I do not think.there was any real needier
     them to come but they did - it was to do with the Police
     organisation and I do believe that somebody from the
     Ambulance Service, probably Station Officer Easton, who
     has been the normal contact that I have had with the
     Ambulance Service did come.

Q. Was that at your invitation? -A. More than likely but I
 - rtistr cOtiM- not really <confarm that.  u-     =\.           vv

0.    The same thing did not occur this year, did it, in 1989?
     -A.That is correct.    When we had the initial meeting, I
     believe which was the 22nd of March, various people came
     to do with the Police operation and there was nobody from
     the Ambulance requested to come or in fact the Fire
     Brigade, but I spoke to the Chief Inspector from operations
     and requested him to send letters to the Ambulance and Fire
     Brigade informing them of the event which was done.

0. You did not see any need then to discuss any arrangements
   with the Ambulance Service before the 1989 match? -A.
   They were not invited to the meeting, sir.

                           Did you see any need? A. I was aware that they would be
                           coming to the match and I had contact with them later on,
                           sir.

                      Q.   But you saw no need in the preparatory stages?   A. Not in
                           the actual planning of the police operation, no.

                           Can you turn on now, please, to page 449 in the core bundle.
                B Q.       We see here a communication from the club to, amongst other
                           people, you. A. That is correct, yes.

                      Q.   This is where you were sent a copy of the match day instruct­
                           ions, which I think we will find at 451. A. That is correct.

                      Q.   Was this sent for your approval? A. That is right, sir.
                           I discussed it with Superintendent Murray and on page
                           454 you will see that it is inserted "and the gates
                           opened.  That is in Mr. Murray's own handwriting.   As a
                           result of that I spoke with Mrs. Sharon Lane at 1.30 on the
                           9th June asking her to advise it and that is my writing on
                           the bottom there.

                            In that document it is quite clear, is it not, there is
                            no reference to any stewarding on the Leppings Lane end?
                 D          A. That is correct.

                            was it to pack the crowd and so on on the Leppings Lai»e
                            terraces? A. It is my view that it is the club's respons­
                            ibility for the actual packing of people on there but
                           -there are no stewards allocated to that terrace.  I was aware
                            that when I took over the job that there were no stewards
                            to do it.

                            Had the view that had previously been expressed by the
                            police in 1981 about stewards duties been abrogated as
                            far as you are aware? We see that on page 144, I think,
                            of the bundle.  This is a memorandum from Chief Super­
                            intendent Herald to Superintendent Smith and Inspector
                            Calvert. A. Yes, sir.

                            Which in the middle paragraph, as you will see, "Stress to
                            the stewards the admission of spectators on the bigger games
                            on the terracing is primarily their function and not a police
                            one". A. Yes, I see that.

                            That was a view plainly expressed in August,   1981, was it
                            not? A. That is correct.

                            Had that view been abrogated by the time you took office,
                            as far as you knew? A. Yes, sir.  I did not come to Hammerton
                            Road until 1987.

                           I know. A. And as far as I was aware on small league games
                            if we knew there was an amount of supporters that were

                          probably less than a thousand the away supporters were
                          probably put in the two centre pens.  On the large games
                          they were allowed to fill the pens on their own.

                          But you see that that memorandum refers to the tig games.
                          A . Yes .

                    Q.    Presumably the games where it is expected that the terraces
              B           at the Leppings Lane end will be full. A. Correct, sir.

                          It refers to the police view at that time that it is the
                          stewards job to pack those supporters. A. Yes, sir.   I still
                          think that it is to the stewards or to the club.    However
                          there were new stewards there so the police would monitor
                          the filling of the terraces from the control room and from
                          officers on the track.

                          But you nevertheless approved a document which did not lay
                          any duties upon the stewards at all so far as the terraces
                          were concerned. A. The senior officers approved that, yes.
                          That is correct.

                    Q.    You, as liason officer, would have to study it closely?
               D          A. Yes, that is correct.

                          it and approving it? A. No, Sir.

                          Are you saying that you did not notice that ommission?
                          A. I was aware that it said that there were no stewards
                          on the terraces but that seems to have been in the past and
                          that was the position.

                    Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: The police could have done one of
                          two things about there being no stewards there, could they
                          not.   They  could either have said: "Why are there no stewards
                          there, let   us have stewards there, that is where they are
                          supposed to be". A. Yes, Sir.

                     Q.   Or they could accept the fact that there were not going to
                          be stewards there.  It looks as though it was the latter
                          that was accepted. A. Yes, Sir.

                               MR. PHILLIPS: Can I now take you, please.  A little
                     Q.
                           later on in 1988.  You were, of course, concerned with the
                           match in April, 1988, and I think that you told us you
                           drew up the operational order. A. Yes.

                           And we have that as one of the documents that has been
                           disclosed.    I am going to ask you about that order in a
                           little while when I come on to the 1989 order. A. Yes.

                     Q.    Can we keep it fairly chronological, if we can, by going
                           to document 477, which is a meeting that took place on

                                the 9th August, 1988, at which you attended, along with
                                Mr. Murray, Mr. Marshall, and Chief Inspector Beale?
                                A. Yes.

                         Q.     You also had there representatives of the ambulance service
                                and representatives of the fire service? A. Yes, sir.

                     | Q.       This was a pre-season meeting,        was it not? A. That is
                                right, sir.                                                 ,

                         Q.     Were you were concerned with rendezvous points for both
                                the emergency services in the event of any need for them?
                                A. Thit is right, sir. I think that Mr. Murray as well
                                wanted to make contact with the people from the ambulance
                                and the fire service.

                         Q.      Did you come to, as you understood it, a clear agreement
                                 amongst the three services as a result of this meeting,
t                                as to what was to happen? A. Yes, Sir.

                         Q.      Did you clearly understand where the ambulance people were
                                  to go and the fire people were to go? A. Yes.             The ambulance
                                  people, if they were going to put their major incident
                     )            into action would send their ambulance to Herries Road
                                  bus garage to rendezvous. The fire brigade were unable to
                                  say where the.y. would, rendezvous - r They-wajvt-e-d sc?c4£ic       -----

                                  and they would send the fire engines directly there.

                         Q.      In other  words when the fire brigade were called in they
                                 had to be told the particular part of the ground to go
                                 to? A. That is correct, yes, sir, the best possible
                                 information.

                         Q.      That was something within the knowledge of Superintendent
                                 Murray, was it? A. That was stressed by the ambulance
                                 officer, yes, and I see Mr. Murray has written on the bottom
                                 of the report.

                         Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: By the fire brigade? A. Yes,             I
                                 beg your pardon.   By the fire officer.

                         q    .MR. PHILLIPS: We have a       note from Mr. Murray at the                end
                                 of the document. A. That is right.

                         Q.          "The meeting was called to establish possible rendezvous
                                     point for emergency services following a major incident.
                                     Ambulance service Herries Road, fire service will atend
                                     by PenistoneRoad or Leppings Lane, as directed by the
                                     police". A. That is right.  That then went on to Mr.
                                     Mole and he has endorsed it at the bottom, sir.

                          Q.         Yes.  Can we just mention the ambulance       service.  They were
                                     going to rondezvous at the Herries Road       bus garage.  Were
                                     they going to have a particular part of       the ground to go to
                                     from that rendezvous point? A. If there       were any ambulance

casualties which needed clearing they would be taken to
t:he gymnasium.

Was it in fact agreed that they would have an entry via
one gate near the gymnasium and an exit via*a second
gate? A. I cannot honestly remember the entry by the
gymnasium gate and the exit at gate o   . I "knew that
they were going to come to gate 'o'.

Was it agreed that they should have a clear run through
to get their ambulances in and out? A. Yes, obviously
through gate 'o' but I cannot recall them saying come in
through the gymnasium gate.   There are problems coming
in at that gate.  There are vehicles parked there by the
club and the disabled people that come to the match have
authority by the club to park in that car park.   You can
still get round but it would be difficult becuae it goes
under the North Stand and round a hut which is the ground­
sman, and it certainly is difficult to get with a vehicle
round there although not impossible.   It is easier to get
in from gate 'o'.

It is easy if the area is kept clear,              is it not? A. That
is correct.

We hear on the day, you see, that there was congestion,
there were parked vans, Police vans and that sort of thing
that were making life a bit dif ficult for the Ambulance
people.    A . t There wer e some round the gymnasium.
     However, I do b el ieve that when Operations Support
was put into being, whi ch was shortly after 3 o'clock
where Off icers would have come from all parts of the City
that it may well have been that it was an odd van that
they had come in that had been parked there.

We can look at that, p e r h a p s -- A.  But plenty of
Police Off icers about whe re I think if somebody had just
said, "Can you move such a vehicle?" it would be moved
straight away.
Do you remember a d is cussi on, because Mr. Hopkins when he
gave his evi dence could not remember it, about the allocation
 of tickets to A m b u l a n c e m e n ?            A.     That is correct, sir,
 because they had got their tickets which were for the
 South Stand and there was some talk about it - with them
 having to go to the gym nasiu m, it might be more convenient
 for them if they had their tickets in the North Stana.
 I think it was p ro bably S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray nay well
 have sug gested that.                  However, I think that the Club did
 wish- to ~he-ve--the .Ambulance O f f i c e r s jnqre .available a.t
' S i S u t l f ‘Sfeatid-^so -ttrey'-were' ne a r e r  ttr the-vpLaye'r^’i-      •

In case a player got i n j u r e d ?      A.    Probably., sir. . .       ,

At the end of this m e m o r a n d u m there is a reference to
specific i n s t r u c t i o n s being written in to the Tango
Serial's duties req ui r i n g them to assist the Fire Brigade
and the Amb ulanc e peo ple to get to the ground.           A.   That
is correct, sir.             It does not appear in the 1988/1989
order.    It was a c o m p l e t e oversight.      However, on all
the orders for the League games for the whole of last
season there was a s p e c i f i c mobile -- written on to t h e
bottom of their i n s t r u ct ions, if evacuation procedure
was in force, that they had to go to Herries Road Bus
Garage and ano ther Tango mob ile had got to come back to
the ground for any a s s i s t a n c e they could give to the Fire
Brigade.
 I think if you look at Tab 15 in the South Yorkshire Police
 bundle, you will see this same memorandum but also a copy
 of t w o ’serial orders - s p e c i m e n serial orders - such as you
 had in mind.      A.   Yes, that is correct, sir.

 This is Tango 1 and Tango 2?              A.    That's right, sir.

 These are mobile patrols, are they not?          A.   That's right,
 sir.    It depended on the size of the League match.
 Som etime s we might just only have two, sometimes there
 might be four or w h a t - h a ve-you but on all the League
 mat ches through the last season that was on the orders.

 And if we look at the s p e c i m e n order we will see under
 "Emergency Ev a c u a t i o n P r o c e d u r e " a specific reference
                                                           S.   R.   S E WE L L



to the r e n d e z v o u s point for Amb ul a n c e vehicles.        A.     That
is correct, sir.

Namely H e r r i e s Road Garage.     A.    Yes, sir.v

And a r e q u i r e m e n t to liaise and assist the personnel from
the A m b u l a n c e Service.     A.   That is correct, sir.

And, again, with the Fire Brigade, they have to give any
a s s i s t a n c e that is required. A. That's right, yes, sir.

So that o b v i o u s l y should have been in the 1989 order, should
it not?     A.        It should, yes, sir.

And you agr ee that it is not in there.               A.        That is correct,
sir.
And, of course, h a d t h e i n s t r u c t i o n been there, there would
have been in each case a serial spe cifically detailed to
help each of the eme rgency services.               A.   That is correct,
sir.
And you can not explain it except as an oversight?   A. It
was an oversight, sir.    We didn't have it in the 1988 order
and it was- an oversight.                  -■            .

But you see, Mr. Sewell, the 1988 order had been written
up before thi s meeting of 9th August.  A.I-appreciate
that fully, sir.

And if you are just going to sla vishly copy the 1988 order
it is p e r h a p s not su r p r i s i n g that you do not have it in.
A.     Yes, it wasn't a case of just copying that order,
sir.       The 1988 Semi-Final had been a successful operation
so o b v i o u s l y that order did serve a basis - a strong basis -
of the 1989 order but it was s c r u t ini sed very closely and
quite a few ame ndmen ts were made where we made a lot better
use of c e r t a i n resources which would have happened at
Phase 2 and Phase 3.             that was an omission, an oversight;
I can offer no other e x p l a n a t i o n for it, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        It was omitted from both 1988
and 1989?       A.   It wouldn.'t have been on the 1988 one,
sir, bec a u s e we didn't have the meeting until after so it
was just the 1989, sir.
     MR. PHILLIPS:    The next thing I think you did was
to have a mee ting with stewards;  is that right?   A.   That's
right, yes, sir.

We have been provided with a copy of your briefing notes to
ste w a r d s wh i c h appear to be two pages torn out of a notebook.
A.      That's right, sir, yes.

 P.h otoco pied.      A.    Yes, sir.
Is this, in fact, bec ause there is no heading to it, are
these the notes that you had for the briefing with the stewards

                      before the start of the 1988/89 season?        A.   That is
                      correct, sir.   it had bee n an occasion where Inspector
                      Colvert had been to b r i e f the stewards annually before.
                      I was asked to go.    I spo ke with him before I went, seeing
                      what sort of things he had spoken to them about, made
                      these notes and this f o r m e d the basis of a talk that I
              B       gave to them.
                   Q. You have got a copy b e f o r e you, have you?               A.       Yes,
                      sir.
                   Q. You start off by i n t r o d u c i n g yourself.        A.   Yes, sir.

                   Q. And say that you have tak en over from Mr. Calvert and
                      it says, "Mr. Lock g i v e s steward rules".       A.   Yes, Mr.
                      Lock gave - I don't kno w whether it was exactly at that
                      stage in the talk but he gave the duties of the stewards
                      and went through them a c t u a l l y in full.    I think he had
                      a booklet that he was r e f e r r i n g to and went through
                      e ve rythi ng in detail a b o u t their duties: they had got
                      to wear their tabards, they must not leave their points
                      and a whole list of i t e m s of stewards' duties which went
              D       on for some minutes.

                      that and p o s s i b l y some of his own notes as well, sir.

                       You then go on to e m e r g e n c y evacuation procedure.   A. Yes.
                       I spoke to them in d e t a i l telling them about the coded
                       message.   I had o r i g i n a l l y asked how many stewards had
                       been there from the p r e v i o u s season because there weren't
                       many new ones, but I w e n t through it in full giving them
                       the coded mes sage and t e l l i n g them, of course, that in the
                       event of that being o p e r a t i v e they must go to all their
                       exit points, cover the g a n g w a y s and gates would be opened
                       and went through it in detail.

                   Q. All these exit points, gat es and gangways referred, of
                      course, to the ones out of the ground entirely, did they
                      not?   A.   Yes, sir, t h a t ' s right.
                                                                f

                   Q. There was no ste w a r d p r e s e n t at the perimeter gate on
                      to the pitch, was t he re?           A.   No, sir, those are all
                      cov ered by P o l i c e m e n on the Track Serial-

                   Q. Then "Problem with P o l i c e Officer through Mr. Lock to me"
                      that is p r e sumab ly if th e r e is any dispute between a
                      Police Officer and a s t e w a r d ?   A.   That's right, so that
                      we got the chain of command.
                   Q. The next item, "Po lice r e s p o n s i b l e for preventing breach
                      of peace but ground r e g u l a t i o n s enforcing down to the
                      stewards."    A.    Th a t ' s right, yes, sir.
               H
                    Q. And then a sma ller note, and can I read it accurately,
                       "Problems out side P ol ice, inside really down to stewards
                       and Club."     A.   Th a t ' s right, yes, sir.

                       A
                             Q. What do you mean by that?              How did you explain that?
                                A.    I was e m p h a s i s i n g that if there were any minor
                                pro blems inside the gr o u n d where people wanted - problems with
t                               a ticket and so forth or to do with problems with cameras,
                                which were against the gro und rules, this was down to the
                                ste wards to deal with and if they had a problem that they
                       B        could not deal with, then they could go and refer it to
                                the Police Officer, but any minor problems inside the
                                ground and c o n c e r n i n g the safety of the people inside is
                                really a matter for the ste wards and the Club, and that
                                any dis order is down to the Police in dealing with breaches
                                of the peace.

                             Q. When you say p r o b l e m s inside, you are really talking about
                       C        minor problems, not major matters such as the packing of
                                pens?   A.   That's right, yes, sir.
    *
                             Q. Bec ause it is not t e r r i b l y clear from the note but, of
                                course, these were just very brief notes to remind you
                                what to say.    A.     That's right, yes, sir.

                             Q. Did you then make it c l e a r to the stewards at this briefing
                       D         that they were not r e q u i r e d to control the movement of the
                                 s p e ctato rs on the L e p p i n g s Lane terraces? A. I didn't
                             . - refer*, that, they had got to-# -sir, no.

                             Q. That is not the que stion .        A.   I was aware that there were
                                no stewards of» the L e p p i n g s Lane terraces,-sir. •-

                             Q .■I know, Mr. Sewell, you told us that already.          What I
                       E         asked you is w h e t h e r you made it plain to the stewards
                                 that they had no du t i e s to perform on those terraces.
                                 A.   I don't think I a c t u a l l y said those words, sir,
                                 but I didn't tell them that they had any duty to do on
                                 the terraces.

                             Q. So it was left in the air then?                A.   Yes.

                   Q. Then there is a reference made concerning tabards and other

                      Heysell Stadium, the Bradford fire, and it goes through
                      those showing the duties of the stewards and the Police with
                      the evacuation, and this is a Metropolitan Police training
              B       film.

                   Q. At the very end of this note we see in capital letters:  "PLAN
                      FOR DISASTER” . - A. That is the title of the film, sir.

                   Q. I see. Was there any commentary by you relating that to
                      Sheffield Wednesday’s ground? - A. About the film, sir?

                   Q. Yes. - A. I said, ’’This is what has happened at these grounds
                      here. Be very much aware.    If we get a problem here this is
                      what we have to do” , and I emphasised that. They seemed
                      quite interested in watching this film which went on for
                      about 25 minutes.

                   Q. Can we come now to 1989, and come to the first events we have
                      heard referred to which is the match on 14th January between
              D       Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday.  You organised that, did
                      you? -A. Yes, sir.

                   Q. And of course, it seems included in the-Tango unit's'dirties '
                      the very points that had been raised in August? - A. That is
                      right, yes, sir.

                   Q.    And it was some time in March, I think, when you had to get
                        youroperational order put together for the 1989 match? - A.
                        Yes, sir.

                   Q. You had available, you told us already, intelligence from Mr.
                      Charlesworth and various other sources as well as the 1988
                      order? - A. Yes, sir.

                   Q. Had you visited the club in the run up to the preparation of
                      this order? - A. Yes, sir.  There was frequent contact with
                      them.

                   Q. I think you went with Superintendent Murray in the few days
                      before the match? - A. Yes, sir.

                   Q.   Was Mr. Mackrell there? - A. Yes, sir.

                   Q.   And did you inspect the ground? - A. We did, yes, sir.

                   Q.   Were you satisfied with what you saw? - A. Yes, sir.

                   Q.   Were you troubled with the entry arrangements at the Leppings
                        Lane terraces? - A. No, sir.

                   Q.   Were you concerned at the absence of signs directing people
                        where to go? - A. At the time the signs seemed adequate.

Q. Did you give any thought to any possible problems of access to
   the terraces from those turnstiles? - A. No, sir. There had
   been no problem the previous year with the large match, and we
   did not envisage any problem this year.

Q. I understand that, Mr. Sewell.  You did not. in fact look at
   the situation at all critically at the Leppings Lane end? - A.
   no, sir.

Q. You accept, do you, as I think Mr. Mackrell accepted
   yesterday, that the signs are very misleading? - A. In
   hindsight, yes, sir.

Q. But none of that occurred to you at the time? - A. No, sir.
   If it had I should have mentioned it to the club.

Q. When you drew up the 1989 match order what was your object,
   your intention? - A. To improve on the previous year which
   already had been a successful operation.

 Q. In your statement you set out a number of ways in which you
     made alterations which are not in fact relevant to this
     Inquiry, I think, because they concern other parts of the
     ground and other serials.           I d o n ’t want to go into every
     detail, but I do want, if you will, to take up with you one or
ijA.vtwo: '•mattexs.e fetouXd .^rotv^-look,v please,. atir.Tai:.    tii©
     Yorkshire Police bundde, which gives us the 1989 match-
     order, and look at Serial 1, which is sub-sector 1? - A.
     Yes, sir.

 Q. Do you also have a copy of the 1988 match order there? -A.
    Yes, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      We d on’t have that in the bundle.

         MR. PHILLIPS:   It is not in the bundle, sir, no, but it
    has been handed in separately some considerable time ago:

 Q. Unfortunately, the pages are not numbered.  If we look to
    Serial 1 sub-sector 1, do you see there that at the end of the
    larger paragraph:  ”NO-ONE IS TO BE ALLOWED ACCESS TO THE
    TERRACES WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF A SENIOR OFFICER EXCEPT TO
    RECEIVE MEDICAL ATTENTION". - AJ Yes, sir.

 Q. That is in fact emphasised very much more strongly in the 1989
    order? - A. Yes, sir.

 Q. Why did you do that? - A. In actual fact it was Chief
    Inspector Beale’s idea to do it, but the reason behind it is
    that sometimes if some fans have got in the wrong end of the
    ground or some arrests have been made, Officers have taken
    fans out of the perimeter gates and round the edge of the
    track, and also taken prisoners round the edge of the track.
    This can create problems by the opposing fans jeering and
    possibly lead to some crowd problems. So this really is
    intended that no prisoners or people should be transferred
    round the track, and they would be taken out from the back of
                                                S.R. SEWELL


  the terraces and taken round to the correct end. That is what
  that is really indicating.  I am fairly certain Mr. Murray
  would have made some reference to that in his briefings, that
  nobody would be taken out of the perimeter gates to another
  section.  That is really what that is to indicate.

  It is not intended to prevent the gates being opened in the
  event of overcrowding in the terraces? - A. No, sir. If there
  is a problem of overcrowding it is common sense to the Police
  Officers who are on there, and the majority of the Officers on
  Serial 1 on the 1989 order are Community Constables who work
  the same positions throughout the whole of the season, sir.

  I am coming to that in a minute. There seems to be some
  conflict in the individual Officers’ eyes anyway between what
  they understand their instructions to be with regard to the
  gates and what their common sense required them to do on the
  day? - A. It is the same Sergeant that works with them
  throughout the whole season, Sergeant Chapman. Also,
  Inspector Darling that was on there, the majority of this last
  season has worked with that serial.  I would be fairly certain
  they should know the details, sir.

!. There is no provision, is there, for this serial to pay any
   attention to the question of crowd numbers in the terrace? -

   Officer gets a copy of the serial.order, ft is -only        the   '
   Sergeant and the Inspector.     I don’t think everything can be
   put down actually in the operational order, sir.

5. But this is a fairly important thing, is not it, Inspector, if
   you have got a situation where you are expecting the
   supporters themselves to sort themselves out into a
   comfortable position? - A. Yes, but also it is expected if the
   Officers on the track see any problems when monitoring the
   crowd they would relate straight to control.

Q. Without any specific instruction to that effect? - A. Yes,
   sir. They are regular Officers that work this with the
   exception of the odd few.

Q. We have already looked at the Tango provision.  You say in
   your statement that the object was to get the same people
   doing the same job as the previous year. Is that right? -
   A. Where possible, yes, sir.

Q. That is why I must take up with you, that has been said by
   other Officers as well, and I have prepared a little schedule
   - I don’t think you have got it in front of you? - A. Yes, I
   have, sir.

Q. Can I just explain it. This is just an analysis of the two
   orders, and I hope to save time rather than go through each
   individual one, we see that in. Serial 1 this year only 11 out
   of the 20 Officers - I am talking about Constables now - were
   there in 1988? - A. That is right, sir. There were changes
   with the Community Constables, and some of the other Community
                                                S.R. SEWELL


Constables were on....

     MR. PHILLIPS:   This is just a note I made, sir, to save
going through all the details.  (Document produced):

Eleven out of the 20 Constables in Serial 1? - A. Yes, sir.

That means that very nearly half of them won’t have had
experience of a Semi-Final on that serial? - A. That is
correct of a Semi-Final, sir, but a lot of the others do work
on the League matches and work on the track.

But on a League match things are very different, because you
don't get a capacity crowd at the Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes,
sir, but we have had several large matches, Manchester United,
Derby, Liverpool. We have had plenty of large matches this
last season.

I have also analysed the numbers of Serials 13-19 which are
all concerned with the Leppings Lane end, are not they? - A.
Yes, sir.

Not one of the Officers who was working on those serials
this year was working in the 1988 Semi-Final? - A. Yes, sir.
Perhaps I can explain. Sergeant Crawford last year was on the
• W e s t ^ S t c a f i & v s ■gpsta irs
was -on- the. terraces‘this year- just underneath." Sergeant'
Higgins who was here in 1988 has now left. Then the other
 four serials, 15, 16 and 17 - the ones that are outside the
 turnstiles - last year they were C Division Officers that are
 Officers from Rotherham.          Inspector Sykes, who was on their
 last year, said that he was not particularly happy with how
 the Officers from there had performed their duties last year,
 and so he wished his own Officers, which are from Ecclesfield.
 So I purposely put on Sergeants Whitlam, Morgan and Proctor
 that are with Ecclesfield Officers who throughout this season,
 the majority of them have worked on the turnstiles outside
 Leppings Lane, and are fully aware of it. In fact, Sergeant
 Proctor is the area Sergeant at Ecclesfield, and his serial
 work almost without exception on the terraces. Sergeant Payne
 is from Hackenthorpe, and he regularly with his men works at
 the ground.

Perhaps I ought to explain the    schedule a bit more because it
is not necessarily immediately    apparent. We see the number of
Constables in the first column    who did the same duty in the
two years, and it comes out at    none at the Leppings Lane end.
- A . Yes.

The serial number and broadly where that serial was stationed.
- A. Yes, sir.

The Sergeant is given in the 1988 version there. Those with
the asterisk against them mean that they were in fact working
at this ground at this match but in a different position in
1989. - A. That is right, but I think the ones that were
working in 1989 had a lot more experience of working outside
                                               17


                                                                  S.R. SEWELL


                     the turnstiles, and that is specifically why I picked them,
                     and this was in consultation with Inspector Sykes who has
                     worked that duty outside the turnstiles, I believe, most
                     matches since 1980, so I would rely on his information.

                   Q. We see, for example, that Sergeant Morgan who was the Serial 1
                      Sergeant in 1988 was working on Serial 18 in 1989? - A. That
                      is correct, sir. Sergeant Morgan used to be the plain clothes
                      Sergeant, and now Sergeant Chapman takes up his duty, and that
                      is why he has gone on the track for all of this season.
                      Sergeant Morgan throughout the past season and League matches
                      more often than not has worked on coach reception outside
                      Leppings Lane turnstiles, and is an experienced Sergeant and
                      that is why he was picked for those duties.
              c    Q. So we see that six of the Sergeants, if you look at the very
                      end column, who were on duty this year, had also been on
*                     duty in different positions in 1988? - A. That is correct,
                      sir, and again Sergeant Burman was in the West Stand this
                      year, and is one of the regular Officers who works at the
                      ground.  He normally works on the Kop, and he works in the
                      West Stand sometimes at the League matches. He is an
                      experienced Officer.  That is why they were all picked.

 It does seem to follow then, does it, that you were not
 really trying to get the same people in the same position
 as you had had last year? -A. Where possible but we were
 trying to improve.  I altered the ones on the turnstiles
 because of Inspector Sykes' ....

l' o u   have explained that. - A. Yes.

  But the net result seems to be that so far as the part
  of the ground that we are concerned with is concerned
  you did not have any of the same people on this year as
  you had in 1988? -A. Well, the ones that were on in 1988
  do not regularly attend the ground and so the ones that
  were chosen for 1989 do regularly attend the ground
  and have experience of that particular end and that is
  why they were positively chosen.  They are experienced
  officers who know what they are doing.

  You see, the reason I am asking you this, Mr. Sewell,
  and the reason I looked at this is that in your statement
  on page 4 you say, "The serials around the turnstiles
  at Leppings Lane and Penis tone Road and in the enclosure
  to the same were the same as for 1988 which had proved
  adequate."    That is not right? - A. What I mean by that,
  sir, is they were, the same amount .of men on it, that
  there; fwere four searrays ~ou tsi-djes-aitth

  Oh, the same number of people, you mean?- A. Yes.      My
  mistake, sir, but that is what I was ....

  They were not the same serials? - A. No, sir.      No, sir.
   I am sure they were an improvement on last year, sir,
   a vast improvement.

Do not you think the experience of the 1988 semi-final
 would have been something that could have been carried
 forward in the way that has been put forward, it appears,
 until now? -A. Probably a lot of those Officers that
 were on it last year on those turnstiles, I am not sure,
 but they probably were not all working the match this
 time any way.  They wsre not regular officers. The ones
 that were picked were the ones that have done it, by and
 large, throughout the wh ol e of the season on the League
 matches which have involved large matches and large crowds
 at Leppings Lane and they were officers which Inspector
 Sykes would have chosen.

   In fact then it is    experience during that season which
   you reckoned to be    more important than experience of the
   1988 semi-final? -    A. Yes, sir, for that particular match,
   yes.  The officers    knew what they were doing.

    H o w , having gone into that then you did then, I think,
    attend on the day and took part in the briefings.     Is
    that right? - A.'That is correct, sir.     I also took part
                                                       S. SEWELL

on the pre-briefing the day before which was to Inspectors
and above.

And *;e have again your notes of the - is that your note
of the briefing on the .... - A. That is correct, sir.
I have got the original here.

I do not think there is anything in it I particularly
want to ask you about.  You were really concerned with
radios, were"not you? - A. That is ri^ht, sir.   I think
probably one relevant point is that with the radio
issues,*that is serials 1 to 21, which were all the
serials which were in the ground, the Inspectors and
Sergeants were to have earpieces.

Did they all get earpieces?- A. Yes, sir.  There were
36 ordered.  That is the only amount we could get.
There were 36.

We heard from one witness that it was expected that all
of the Police Officers on serial 1 would have a radio
with them, many of them wo ul d have them because they were
Community Constables, any way?- A. Yes, sir.

 maiority of them wou ld have had then.

 They did not all have them, as we have heard. - A. Yes,
•■well, I did not issue the radios and it did not specifically
 say everybody should have got one but I assumed that they
 would have but they are not far away from another officer
 if they have got a problem.       There are 20 of them round the
 track.   They could easily walk to somebody that had got
 one and the ma jority w o u l d have had one.   There were some
 spare radios.   If anybody had asked for one they would
 have got one.

 On serial 1, you mean? -A. Yes, sir, definitely, yes.
 The constables on other serials would not have got them
 unless there was some specific duty but there was no
 problem.  I ordered 16 dozen radios, I believe it was,
 and there were some spare.

 Were those radios all tested before the event? -A. I
 assume that they would have been tested by the
 Communications Department.  I ordered them with the loud
 hailers and base station and so forth before from the
 Communications Department.  I am sure they would have
 tested them.

 With loud hailers, you say? - A. Yes.

 How many loud hailers did you have at the ground? - A.

                         I believe there were five.         I believe.

                    Q.   Where were they? -A.      In the gymnasium.

                    Q.   All of them? - A. They        were in the gymnasium available
                         for any Senior Officer        that wanted to have one.

              B     0.   You see, we heard that when a loud hailer was required
                         at the Leppings Lane terraces Constable Buxton ran back
                         to his Landrover, I think it was, to collect it from the
                         Landrover because there did not seem to be one at the
                         ground.   Were the Senior Officers told that there were
                         loud hailers there? -A. I would have thought they would
                         have been aware, sir.     They were certainly in the gym­
                         nasium with the radios.    P.C. Buxton usually takes one
                         in the Landrover for if one of the Senior Officers wants
                         a lift.   He is the driver, is P.C. Buxton, with the
                         Landrover, so he is available for any of the Senior Officers
                         outside who might want taking to anywhere round the ground.
                         He quite of t e a will take one in with him so that if
                         anybody wants to use it they can do.     He has also got
                         the loud hailers on the Landrover, got a public address
                         system.   I know down to Mr. Mole this was updated, that
               D         system, certainly some months ago any way.      He had it
                         updated on the Landrover.

                    0. Well, I know.' I was asking a b o u t 'loud ha ile rs. Would
                       Mr. Murray.-have known that there were five loud hailers -
                       in the gym? - A. I do not know, sir.

                    Q. He was your immediate Superior at this game, was not he?
                       -A. He was, sir.   He was in the control box.  They were
                       there at the   beginning any way.  They were in the gym­
                       nasium because I can recall using one in the gymnasium
                       mvself to ....

                    Q.    o w , you have told us about the issue of radios. It was
                         Sergeants and Inspectors who had earpieces then? - A. On
                         the ground serials which is 1 to 21 and obviously any
                         Senior Officers as well, Mr. Greenwood and the Chief
                         Inspectors inside the ground.

                    0. The sentence at the top of page 5 of your statement,
                       "The issue of radios including all ground serials to
                       have an earpiece"? -A. Yes, sir.

                    Q. Is one earpiece per serial? - A. To the Sergeant, yes, sir

                    Q.   Yes.   - A. Oh, yes,   sir.

                    Q.   Yes, I see. - A. Because by and large the constables do
                         not have a radio.  If they did there would be too many
                         to go through the system, the radios.  It would lust clog
                         the system up.

0. That is your briefing then.  The issue of radios on the
   day.  Did you participate in anything to do with the
   stewards on that day? - A. No, sir.  I had arranged for
   the four Inspectors in the stands to brief the sirials
   in the respective stands at 11.15.  That was Inspector
   Darling the South Stand, Inspector Calvert on the Kop,
   Inspector Woodward on the North Stand and Inspector White
   on the West Stand.  This had all been arranged with Hr.
   Lock and, I think, Sharon Lane at the club so that they
   were all aware and in fact I wrote on to the particular
   Inspectors' orders for them to do that and I am aware
   that they all did get briefed, the stewards.

Q. Yes.  And of course that briefing to the stewards would
   be in accordance with what you had previously said at the
   beginning of the season? - A.That is right.  I would
   imagine the main thing would be for the evacuation
   procedure so that they knew it because obviously on the
   large matches the club enlist a few extra stewards for
   the semi-final and obviously to ensure they were aware
   of the emergency evacuation.

Q. Now, on the day itself you also received, did you not,
    a report from M r .Charlesworth, Sergeant Charlesworth,
 ■• on intelligence? -A^ Yes, sir.     ,

          MR. PHILLIPS:    I am moving now to the bottom of
     page 7, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you.

Q.        >1R. PHILLIPS:   What did you learn from him? - A.
     On the day?

Q. Yes.  Towards the bottom of page 7 of your statement,
   you see .... - A. Yes.

Q.   . . . . you say in the paragraph about two-thirds of the way
     down, "Detective Sergeant Charlesworth gives details of
     intelligence"? - A. Yes.     That was the briefing.  Mr.
     Duckenfield was up first, then Mr. Murray, then Sergeant
     Charlesworth and he prepared a full booklet on the
     intelligence and he went briefly through one or two
     points on that which was condensed.

Q. What did you hear from him?   Can you remember? - A. I
   cannot specifically.  There were no problems about
   anything that affected me particuarly that day that
   I did not already know about.

Q. Nothing adverse? -A. Nothing at all.  I mean, I do not
   think I particularly listened to what he was saying on
   that briefing.  I knew it did not apply to me.  He had
   been talking to me several times that morning.  I had
                                     22


                                                                   S. SEWELL

     seen him probably about 7 or half-past-7 that morning.
     There were no problems and he was in contact, I am aware,
     with Liverpool and Motts, people that day. He would keep
     letting us know throughout the day that there were so
     many people on that train arriving at such-and-such a
     time, so many people on that, and this was relayed to
     officers at the Midland Station.  That was the sort of
     thing he was telling us but there was nothing that was
     out of the ordinary.

Q.   N o w , can we come to just before the match started? Did
     you get a message - I think your position was really in
     the gymnasium, was not it? -A. I got a roving commission,
     sir. but coming up to, sort of - if everything had gone
     to plan, at 3 o'clock there would have been a number of
     officers coming into the gymnasium to have a hot meal
     which had already been supplied from ....

Q. In the quarter-of-an-hour  before 3 o'clock you were in
   the gymnasium? -A. In the vicinity of it, yes.

Q. Well now, did you get a message to get in touch with
    South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive? -A. I
    do recall that they were wanting me to contact Eert
 . Jiiddleton who is,the liaison, that,..I h a v e — I.-was-.aware -— -
  .-■that' at. that- s.t.arg-6- he w o u l d b e r still -at"'the -Midiaiid^ - "'rv-:'
    Station or on his way from the Midland Station having -
    supervising.the people getting on buses down there and --...
    I told the control that if they rang Herries Road bus
    garage     they would be able to get in touch with him
    because I was not in touch with him and they would get
    him on the radio from Herries Road bus garage.

0. Were you told why they wanted you to get in touch with
   Mr. Middleton? -A. I cannot recall, sir.  They wanted
   to contact him for some reason.

Q. Did they not tell you that Leppings Lane was to be closed?
   - A. I do not recall that specifically, sir, no.

Q. At all events, you did not get through to the Passenger
   Transport? -A. No.              t

Q. You threw the ball back to control? - A. I told them how
   they could contact him, yes.       When he comes to the ground
   he stands down by the North Stand and the Kop for the
   majority of the game and I regularly go and liaise with
   him for if there are any problems with the buses.       He
   does not usually get there until some time after the
   kick-off but control probably thought I would have been
   able to get hold of him s t r a i g h t a w a y .

Q. Had you heard then messages about closing the Lane over
   your radio? -A. Probably but it does not recollect anything
                                   23



                                                               S. SEWELL

     with me,   sir.

Q. Did you know anything that was going on outside the
  . turnstiles in Leppings Lane? -A. Mo.  I am aware that
    in the - round about quarter-to-3 that there was some -
    there were obviously some problems at Leppings Lane and
    they were requesting manpower to Leppings Lane.

Q.   You responded to that, did not you? - A. Yes.   I told
     the control there were a number of officers from West
     Bar that had come up from the .station, they had been
     riding with the fans on the buses, and I went to the
     srvm. to deolov them.

Q. Did you receive a telephone call from the control box?
   - A. Not a telephone call, sir.  There is not a telephone
   link in the gymnasium.  There is one in the Police room
   which is adjacent but I did not have a telephone call,
   no.  I heard them on the radio.

Q. I see.       There is just a telephone link between the Police
   room and the control box to that side of the ground? - A.
   There are two telephones in the actual Police room which
   is across the way from the gymnasium.                There is an outside
   line .s j h L o W lu     contact cm sthe club ..'s internal,
   s-fcravgh-6 ~thr.sopglj.4to' '6he-Police h o ± a s " W t "•'£ "So'fco'fc*'*
   recall speaking to them on the telephone at that stage
   any way.

Q.-Yes.  But any way you got the message and you sent'these
   people off to Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. What instructions did you give them? -A. It was obvious
   to me that there was some problem at Leppings Lane but
   I knew nothing more than that and that they were wanting
   several serials.   Sergeant Goddard's voice was having
    like a warbling effect on the radio and at first I
   thought there was some problem with ray own radio.
   Spoke to another officer as I thought it was probably
   the battery was faulty on my own radio.   Spoke to
   another officer.   They were having the same problem.
   I then assumed it was obviously a radio fault as opposed
   to my own radio.   They did say they wanted them to
   various locations.   I realised by deploying a large
   number of men from the gym. this was possibly something
   quite serious, so I got Sergeant Sewell who was on
   logistics in the gymnasium to record the details of the
   Sergeants who I was deploying and where.




                                        / I just said
                                                       S. R. SEWELL

 I just said to the sergeant — I did not know what the problem
 was other than Leppings Lane and so the only brief to the
 sergeant was: Take your men to the location I am sending
 you to, see the senior officer up there, and do what he wants
 you to do .

 We find that the locations in your statement are at page
 nine. A. That is right, and the first lot of officers were,
 according to my watch, deployed at 2.50 and that was recorded.

 2.50? A. 2.50.

 At that time two serials were deployed to the track.   Do
 you know who Sergeant 2916 and 915 are? A. I know 1055
 is Dowson.  I will know them by sight but there were other
 officers from West Bar and all over the place.

 Is not one of those Sergeant in charge of Mr. Houson?
 A. Yes, Sergeant 2379 Swift, who was sent to the West
 Stand .

 To the West Stand? A. That is where I told them to go but
 obviously they went up the track.  I heard the evidence of
 Police Constable Houston and they went up the side of the
 North Stand.  They were obviously heading in that direction.

- ^That-vas-.vJt -2'. 50? Av- T h a t '*wais at<- 2V50 b ? :.*> -Mrcn WeVfi t' y . " ’
  were sent out and there is nothing to believe my watch was
  wrong .

 Thank you very much, that is helpful. A. That has been
 recorded and has been made an exhibit at the time.  I know
 that I then re-grouped another serial.  It says 'E1 Division,
 Crime and Vandal Sqaud.  That was with Inspector Berrisford
 and his Sergeant and ten men.  They had been a reserve serial
 who had gone out helping on Penistone Road.  I re-grouped
 those together and set them out and it was three o'clock
 when they went.

  I think you heard something over the radio about gates.
  Can you recall what you heard? A. I cannot honestly recall
  what I heard now about the gates.  There was some reference
  to gates but the radio reception was very bad.  I got the
  impression there had been a problem at the Leppings Lane
  end and there was some pitch invasion.  That was the
  impression that I got.

  Gates, when you heard about gates on the radio, did you know
  whether that referred to gates on the perimeter fence or
  gates at the turnstiles? A. I did not know, sir.  My main
  object was they were wanting men up there.  I was deploying
  men and I knew who I was sending and seeing who I had got
  left in the gym.  That was my main object.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Where you were in the gymnasium,

                            is that right, was the crowd noise a problem on reception
                            on your radio? A. Not in the gymnasium.

                      Q.    Any problem there was was actually to do with the
                            communications itself? A. That is right, yes.  We were not.
                            receiving a lot back.

                B IQ        Someone has suggested that the concrete all round makes
                            difficultes.  Has that been your experience before or not?
                            A. Not really, sir, no.

                      Q.         MR. PHILLIPS: At other times you have been able to
                            receive and transmit from the gymnasium without trouble?
                            A . Yes.

                Cl Q        You had sent these officers out and I think that you remained
                            in your position, did you? A. In that vicinity, yes.

                      Q     Did you get to understand at some stage that there was a
                            dreadful disaster happening out on the terraces? A. I do
                            recall seeing Chief Superintendent Nesbitt very shortly
                            after that.    I then went down to the edge of the field,
                            to the North Stand and the Kop.       At that stage I could
                 D          see there was a very large amount of officers up at the
                            Leppings Lane end on the pitch.       At that stage I still
                            thoughts j;herae."had-been a ptich ,iavas.ianr^i*% .'-tv

                            What time is that? A. Some time, as I recall, round about
                            ten past three or just after, but that c-ou-ld- be a~-little '
                            vague.

                            Had the game stopped? A. I think that it would have done,
                            yes.   I got the impression that there was a pitch invasion
                            and I thought there was going to be some large scale public
                            disorder.   My concern at that stage was to get back to
                            the police room becaue I knew that there was in the region
                            q £ twenty to thirty prisoners that were already in the cell
                            buses and in the police room and I thought we could have
                            some problem if the fans got back there.   That is what hit
                            my mind at that stage.   I had no idea at that stage what
                            the disaster was.

                            You had not heard anything on ydur radio to inform you
                       Q-   by this time of what was going on or what was required?
                            A. I had not, no.  I thought that there was a pitch
                            invasion at that stage.

                             How soon were you disabused of that idea? A. Shortly after
                      IQ-    they were bringing casualties down on hoardings.

                             That is when you realized? A. Yes.  At that stage I still
                       Q-    thought that it was a disorder problem and there were just
                             a few injured people but then obviously things escalated
                             and I went back to the gymnasium and things started to
                             flow from there.

                        with the fire brigade and the ambulance people in August,

                        Did you realize then that .this was just the situation that
                        had been catered for in that meeting? A. I do not think that
                        it crossed my mind actually at that stage.
              B         Did you regard it as being your duty to ensure that there was
                        proper access to the ground, proper information to the
                        emergency services? A. I had already seen Station Officer
                        Easton at the ground.    I presume he was with Mr. Higgins
                        but I do not really know Mr. Higgins by name.   He was with
                        another ambulance officer. I had seen them in the region of
                        2.15.   I was aware that they were at the ground.   I
                        just had a brief chat with them and said: "If things are
                        all quiet and you go into the gymnasium when the game has
                        started you will be-able to get a meal . I did not see
                        them after that until I saw Station Officer Easton in the
                        region of 4.30 when I spoke to him again, something like
                        that.

                       were already on the pitch when I went do w n . I have a
                       vague recollection of the other ambulance personnel
                       bewing around at the same time and having gone up towards
                       Leppings Lane e n d .

                   5. Did you   take any steps to clear the access for these
                       emergency vehicles? A. I do not think there was any
                       problem at that stage of any ambulances getting in the
                       region of gate 'o'. There were a number of mounted officers
                       that were stood by at the back of the Kop and there were
                       some dog handlers as well that had been brought in but
                       there would have been no problem of getting a vehicle
                       through.

                   Q.   There were still mounted officers in the yard behind the
                        North Stand and the Kop? A. They were actually behind the
                        Kop near to the gate entrance coming in from gate 'o'.
                        There were a number in there, probably the ones, I assume,
                        that had been on Penistone Road end.  If it was looking
                        as if there was a public order event I assumed that the
                        officer who was in charge of those may have thought that
                        he may well have been having to go on to the pitch with
                        the horses.

                   Q.    You took no specific   steps? A. No, but there was no blockage.

                   Q.    That is your evidence about that? A. Yes.

We have heard, however, that emergency vehicles that were
trying. to go to Leppings Lane and, indeed, some of the fire
officers and ambulance people who arrived, were met with
Police Officers, Constables and the like, who appeared
not to know what was going on.   Did you not detail anyone
to direct these emergency vehicles outside on Penistone
Road or at the entrances to the ground? A. There were
plenty of   officers round the gate 'o' that were
seeing to any problems with any traffic at all.   I did not
say specifically to someone: "Go and do it' , no.

How would they know what the problem was, why the fire and
ambulance had been called in, unless you told them or saw
to it that they were told? A. When the casualties were
brought off the field I think that it was fairly obvious,
and the ambulances were coming up on Penistone Road.   They
seemed to be getting up, there did not seem to be any
problem with getting up so far as I was concerned.

It does appear to   be the case that some of       these officers
did not know what   was going on and had not       thefaintest
idea why the fire brigade and the ambulances were turning
up. A. At the earlier stages I thought that there had been
a pitch invasion.    I was not aware of what       hadhappened
until I saw these   casualties bring brought       offthe field
myself -                               - ;.c 1 1 .

You then knew that the ambulance and the fire service were
being called. A'. I" assumed they had, yes, that' Is why they -
were getting there, yes.

Do you not think, looking back, you should have made it
clear to everyone round about, at the entrances from
Penistone Road, what they were required to do with regard
to these emergency vehicles? A. It would have been better
if I had specifically said something to someone but I did
not.  I never saw any problem. If I had seen any problem
at all I would have seen to it.   There was also an inspector
who was specifically seeing to the loading of officers
that would have been on coaches and in charge of the
Transits. There was Inspector Scarf in the vicinity of
Penistone Raod and he had a Sergeant working with him as
well.   I know that he did assist'with emergency vehicles
shortly after.   Having spoken to him he said that there
was no problem.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: But you never received any
 message from control as to what the situation was-
 A. I did not hear anything at all, Sir, no.

 Although they could have been in touch with you by radio?
 A. There could have been something on the radio which I
 did not hear or a problem with the radio but I did not
 get anything that I received, no.

                     (fc. Small occasions, as I understand it you are referring
                           to something like a league match, where you are not expect­

                          the two centre pens, and there would be an officer stood

                    Q . It is seg r e g a t i o n ?           A.    Yes, sir.

                    Q.    And we see that system in ope ration if you look at Document
                         21 in the South Y o r k s h i r e bundle in respect of the League
                         game inv olving Liv erpoo l and She ffield Wednesday prior to
                         this Semi-Final.      Would you look at Document 21 and the
                B        Operational Order for Serial 9.             A.   Yes, sir.

                    Q. If you look at Serial 9, in rel ation to Leppings Lane
                       terrace you see a spe c i f i c order directed to Police Officers
                       to ensure pens are filled in acc ordan ce with instructions
                       from Control.          " O c cupan cy of pens by away fans will be
                       given at b r i e f i n g . "    A.    Yes, sir.

                    Q. Do you see a sim ilar order in respect of Serial 10?
                       A.   Yes, sir.

                    Q. When you have           a large m a t c h where the whole of the terrace is
                       to be used by           those fans who you wish to control, you are
                       quite content           that they use all of the pens.       A.   that is
                       correct, yes,           sir.
                D    Q. And because you are c on tent that they use all of the pens,
                        on this app r o a c h d i r e c t e d to crowd control, there is no

                        which is the O p e r a t i o n a l Order for the Semi-Final - similar,

                        you see, for example, at Serial 14 a complete omission of
                        any written i n s t r u c t i o n s d ir ected to control of the packing
                        of the pens;    that is right, is it not?              A.   Yes, sir.

                    Q. So it follows from that that over the years such system
                       as has been employed, be it by the Police, be it by the
                       Club, for the control of pac k i n g on to the Leppings Lane
                       terrace has only been for the pur pose of crowd control;
                       that is right, is it not?    A.      I have to agree with you,
                       sir.

                    Q. It has not been for the pur p o s e of crowd safety.       It has
                       not been for the s p e c i f i c pur pose of ensuring that individual
                       pens do not get o ve rcrow ded.        That has not been the purpose
                       of those orders, has it?          A.    it has been for the control,
                       sir.

                    Q. It has not been for o v e r c r o w d i n g purposes; that is right,
                       is it not?     A.   Correct, sir, but obviously people will
                       be mon itori ng it.

                    Q. And that is why it is right, is it not, that you gave
                       your evidence e a r l i e r that when you have a large match the
                H      crowd is simply allowed, at the Leppings Lane terrace, to
                       filter on its own, by its own devices, to find its own
                       level?   A.   That is correct, yes, sir.

                    Q.   So   th is   w ould   be   fa ir ,    w ould   i t   not,   as   a    co n clu sio n ,
                                                        S.   R.   S E WE L L



there has never been in o p e r atio n a system of packing the
pens dir ected to crowd saf ety?      There has never been such
a system in operation, has there?        A.   I would have to
agree with you, sir-, but obv iousl y things were monitored
from the Con trol Box.

They may have been m o n i t o r e d but it would have to be a rather
haphazard mon itori ng;    it waiLd not be a specific system
designed to ensure that i n d i vidu al pens did not get overcrowded
That is right, is it not?           A.   I would have to agree
with you on that point, sir, it is specific, yes.

And this is the root of the problem, is it not, Inspector,
that when pac k i n g has been consider ed over the years in
the written d o c u m e n t a t i o n , the mind of those who have
been c o n s i d e r i n g it has only been applied to crowd control
and not crowd safety.              That is the root of the problem,
is it not?           A.     I wouldn''t say that safety had not been
in people's minds but --

 If safety had been in peo p l e ' s mind you would not remove
 from a Lea gue match order when you come to a Semi-Final
 order re f e r e n c e s to ens u r i n g pens are filled in a certain
 way, would you?           A.    On the large matches --             I am sorry,
-iff'rwe*vJba 1 kp.nstaxnjpfevs.»a-11 Lea gue m a t c h e s * i * s p f e / - e r i . *.
     k n o w .tha t there 'axe going to be a small si.>6 unt. of - p e o p l e >'
 they could be in the central pens, it is possible to have
 an Officer on the ste rile side.               If it is a large matclfp
 then the Off i c e r s do not go on the tertace.

Inspector, I am not que r y i n g whe ther Policemen are there,
stewards         are there, who is res ponsi ble for the system.
I am d i r e c t i n g my att en t i o n and your attention to the
purpose of the sys tems which have been employed.               A. Yes, sir.

And it is obv i o u s when one looks at it that the only time
you have   a spe c i f i c system for packing of the terraces is
when you   have crowd control in mind.         That is fair, is it
not?   A.    Yes.

In order that fans can meet their own devices, follow their
own devices, in order to go across the terrace they need
help, do they not, in order to follow their own devices?
They need some gui dance as to where they can go.     A. Yes.
By and large they d o n ’t seem to have any problems.   They
do obviously like to go behind the goal first.

"By and large" is a ref er e n c e to League matches;   it must
be, because there aren't any other 'by and large' occasions
one can look to over the years at Hillsborough other than
very few iso l a t e d large matches.    For the most part, you
are ref er r i n g to the small capacity, are you not?
A.   Yes, but there are a number of large matches that we
deal with at Hil lsorough.

But a large m a t c h inv olvin g a total capacity of the terrace.
A.   Yes, I agree it is not a total capacity.
                                                     S.     R.   SEWEL L



that is not a 'by and large' s i t u a t i o n you can refer to,
is it?   A.   I would have to agree with you, sir.

So what help do you say was p r o v i d e d at the 1989 Semi-Final
to fans arr i v i n g at the L e p p i n g s Lane terrace to use their
own devices as to which pen to go into?               What help do
you say was provided?        A.        It would be down to the
Inspector that is in charge of those serials, if he gave
any s pe cific i ns truct ions to his men which way he wanted
them to go, i.e. down the tunnel or round the sides.

What help do you say was p r o v i d e d ?             A.        I am not aware
of any.

It comes down to this, does it not, Inspector: there was
no system in 1989 as far as the packing of the terraces went
to prevent overcrowding;  there was no system - that is the
truth, is it not?   A.   Oth er than being monitored from
the Control Box.

Other than the casual m o n i t o r i n g , there was no system,
was there?   A.   Not s p e c i f i c system, sir.

And there was no spe cific help given to individual fans

filtering -acrussri-the- t e r r aces ; that is -t’r u V als ' 0 7 is it
not?       A.     I think that wou ld be correct, sir.

                  C r o s s - e x a m i n e d by MR. M U L L E R :

Officer, a pro blem arises in put t i n g an Officer into the
position on the terrace once the terrace becomes overcrowded,
does it not?    A.   That is correct, yes, sir.

But, of course,      if you - - -         A.      Or when it is            full, sir.

If what you do is make sure, to take a figure, that you
only have 54 people per 10 squ are yards, then the packing
is not that tight at all, is it?    A.   No, sir.

And in those cir cums t a n c e s you can have an Officer there
and that Off icer will not become', s w a m p e d ; that is right,
is it not?    A.   If it is not full, yes, sir.

Not full in the sense of not hav ing as many people in it
as you can physically get into it.    A.   Yes, sir.

Then, if you comply with that rule, you cannot put an Officer
there, but if you apply the rule of 54 people, for example,
per 10 square yards you can have an Officer there because
it is not that crowded.   A.   Correct, sir.

Can I turn, please, to a n o t h e r matter.    Would you look,
please, at page 478, which is your second part of your
memo.   This is in the core bundle.          A.   Yes, sir.

It is a m e e t i n g of the 9th August,           1988.         A.        That's
right, yes, sir.

Eme rgenc y evacuation.    You have already told us that
the Fire Service were c o n c e r n e d that they should be told
precisely where they w e r e wanted rather than having a
r en dezvo us point. - A.   Yes, sir, they -said it wouldn't
work for the Fire Bri gade.

Which is obv io u s l y s e n s i b l e because it is a very big place,
Hil lsborough, is it not?              A.   That is correct, sir.

And it may be more s e n s i b l e to come in from one side
rather than another if there is an emergency.          A. Yes,
and it depends where the app lianc es are coming from, sir.

Quite apart from that, what the Fire Service were saying
was that they nee ded to k n o w what the nature of the incident
or the eme rgenc y was.     A.   Yes, sir.   It is like a
Police O p e ratio ns Room, the better the information, the
earlier they can react to it.

That is men tione d in the sec ond      paragraph, obliquely anyway,
on page 478.    A.    Yes.

 They wanted to know w h e t h e r it was a road accident or a
 fire or some other sort of emergency.          A.   Yes, Iwould
vsay -iJiat is fairly o b v i o u s , s i r . ^       ------ . -

Bec ause they are often c a l l e d to a road accident.
A.    That's rtght- aRd they would have different equipment'
to go.    It is so o b v i o u s , sir.

And they would need to k n o w and need to be told that so
that they would know w h e t h e r to send a turntable ladder,
an eme rgenc y tender or w h a t ever .  A.   Exactly, sir.

And also to know how m a n y to send.       A.        That is correct,
sir.

So you were c o n s c i o u s of that and it is pretty obvious
anyway, is it not?           A.   It ought to be to a Police Officer,
 sir, yes.
Can you just help me a b o u t this:' what was the arrangement?
We can perhaps apply it to the circumstances as they arose.
We know that just a f t e r 13 minutes past 3 the Fire Service
were called, at lea st the call was initiated         A. Yes,
sir.
 By a call from the C o n t r o l Box at Hillsborough.               A.   Yes,
 sir.
 Once that has hap pe n e d , it is obviously necessary, is it
 not, that som ebody is g o i n g to be there to meet the Fire
 Brigade and brief the F i r e Brigade as to what they are
 supposed to do?    A.       E xa ctly, sir, yes.

 What is the a r r a n g e m e n t ? A.   Well, if the Control Room
 has asked for the Fir e B r i g a d e to attend to a specific

                            go and assist.

                       Q.   Is there not a s y s t e m ? A.   Well, somebody has got to
                            know where they are g o i n g to and where they have been
                            req uested to and then that person who has requested them
                            can send s om ebody there to assist them.
                   B
                       Q. Obv iously           that is what can happen.            Is there not an
                            in s t r u c t i o n for a s s i s t a n c e if you call for an emergency
                            service, for exa mple the Fire Service, you must, immediately
                            after you have made that call give instruction to somebody
                            to say, "Go and meet the Fire Brigade at the point where I
                            have told them to come /to"?                    A.   I would expect the Control
                            to do that, yes, sir.

                            You would expect them to do that.   Is there no instruction
                            to that eff ect?  A.   I would have thought it was fairly
                            commonsense, sir, that Control, if they request somebody
                            to go to somewhere, you get somebody to go to assist them.

                            It is all isft then tb c o m m o n s e n s e ?         I would think so,
                            yes, sir.
                   D
                       Q. You pro b a b l y  realise that it did not happen on this occasion
          r _,t-            because. .yau ;did        Jc d q -w about i t , <d  i  W  O
                            I'~wasn "tr in ~the Con t r o l Box ,• s i r .     r -* ~

                       Q.    I follow that you w e r e » n o t inthe Control Box*but" nobody said
                            any thing to you - there was nothing on the radio saying,
                            "The Fire Brigade are coming,           would you please tell them
                            where to go".    A.       That is correct, sir.

                        . In those c i r c u m s t a n c e s do you not think it is in fact
                          desirable that there s h o u l d be some instruction because
                          in an e m e r genc y p e o p l e have got many things to think about,
                          have they not?           A.       Yes, sir.   If an emergency evacuation
                          had been put into o p e r a t i o n in the normal course of events
                          a Tango Mobile w o u l d have been detailed to go and assist
                          the Fire Brigade.              How ever, on this Operational order it
                          had been omitted but that Tango Unit would still have to
                          be told where to go to.
                                                                        t
                        . I will leave it there.

                                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:               I was going to ask you, if it
                            had been in the order,               what the Tango Units would have
                            act ually done.       Wo u l d       they have shepherded the Fire Brigade
                            to the ground or wh a t ?             A.    No, they would have come back
                            to the ground.      They w o u l d have found out which location
                            they were going to and               then gone to that location just to
                            see if they could have               been any assistance to the Fire
                            Bri gade because o b v i o u s l y when the Fire Brigade come they
                            quite often will need to leave their units which might
                            be c au sing an o b s t r u c t i o n , blo cking things, and the
                            Police O ff icers wo u l d be able to help to get other stuff
                            round it, any a s s i s t a n c e that is required.       There is no
                            specific duty for them, sir.

     MR. MULLER:        If I c an deal with it in this way:
You say there s h o u l d have been - there was an omission but
there should have bee n a Tango Unit to deal with that.
A.   Correct.

What I am p u t t i n g to you is, should there not also be in
the order an i n s t r u c t i o n for somebody to know p o s itive ly
they have to i n s t r u c t the Tango Unit?      It has to be
somebody's job to do that, in other words to tell the
Tango Unit what he has told the Fire Brigade.               A.    The
only person who c o u l d do that is the Control here.

               C r o s s - e x a m i n e d by MR. K A L L I P E T I S :

Mr. Sewell, wo u l d you be kind enough, please, to turn to
Tab 15 in the Po l i c e bundle.  A.    Yes, sir.

The meeting about w h i c h you have told the Inquiry already.
At the very b e g i n n i n g of your evidence I have recorded you
saying this that there was a clear agreement among
the three S e r v i c e s and if SYMAS were going to put their
major incident plan into effect they would send amb ulanc es
to the Herries Road Bus Garage.          Did I record that cor rectl y?
A.   Yes, sir.
So at fhat 'meeting 'certainl^y• t+re Porce'Vfere awa-re •t+ia't   *- - *
SYMAS had drawn up a s p e c i f i c plan for Hillsborough in the
e v e n t ‘of a ma j©r d i s a s t e r at Hillsborough?- A. -Yes, sir ,-                  -
it has been made up o b v i o u s l y some time - years - prior
to that meeting, I think.

And do you recall S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray who was chairing
the meeting r e f e r r i n g to the fact that they had seen it
and it was on the file s o m e w h e r e - they thought Inspector
Calvert may have it?           A.     He may     have made some reference
to that, sir, I w o u l d n ' t dis pute it, although I cannot
recall it, but he was awa re where the rendezvous point was.

Indeed and there was no doubt at all that in the event of
a major dis a s t e r o c c u r r i n g the senior Ambulance Officer in the
ground would make his way to the gymnasium?                A.   That's
right, yes, sir.

And you knew that?            A.       Yes, sir.

Mr. Murray     knew tha t? A.                I assume       Mr. Murray knew it,
yes, sir.      He w o u l d have.

He chaired     the mee ting.            A.    He     would have, yes, sir.

And you are the O f f i c e r dra wing up the orders for the
Semi-Final.  A.     Yes, sir.

And thus the Po l i c e C o n t r o l would know that.                    A.       Yes,
sir.
Also at that m ee ting, if you turn, please, to the fourth
paragraph, "Arrangements hav e been made for the senior

                      A mb ulance O f f i c e r who attends the Wednesday Ground to
                      meet the F1 L i a i s o n Inspector outside the Players'
                      Entrance at 2.15."           A.   Yes, sir.

                   Q. That became you aft er Inspector Calvert?              A.      Yes, sir.

                   Q. And reg ularl y you w o u l d meet the Amb ulance Officers before
              B       each home mat ch and just, as it were, touch b a s e .     A.   I
                      used to see --     More often than not it would be Mr. Eason
                      that I would see.       He is the chap I had contact with.

                   Q. The last p a r a g r a p h on that page, which is a reference to
                      the North Stand.           A.   Yes, sir.

                   Q. Mr. Jones who was at that mee ting is quite definite that
                      nothing like that was ever dis cusse d at that meeting.
                      Could it be this, Mr. Sewell, that you may have picked that
                      up perhaps from c h a t t i n g to Mr. Eason or Mr. Higgins
                      p re vious ly on one of the visits where you had met at a
                      home match?              A.    R em otely possible, sir, but I have
                      a feeling that whe n we dis cussed about the senior Ambulance
                      Officer going to the gymnasium, I have a feeling that it
               D      may have been Mr. Mu r r a y who would have said, "Well, it
                      might be more c o n v e n i e n t if you are in the North Stand,
                      you have not as far to^go.".                   I think, that was probably
                      t h e . g i s ± “o=f„ tire ,Qenver,sati<on?.'‘                          I       :‘   ■il.A




                   Q. You see, other O f f i c e r s have told us that the Ambulance
                      Officers, if they are in the South Stand, they have visual
                      contact with the P ol ice Control Box.        A.   That's right
                      and I think also they are near to the players' tunnel as well.

                   Q. There was no b o d y from the Club present at this meeting, was
                      there?   A.        No, sir.     Initially it was, I think, for
                      Mr. Murray to have some liaison with the senior Ambulance
                      and Fire B r i g a d e personnel.

                   Q. Mr. Sewell, you were asked about your briefing notes in which
                      you refer to a d i s a s t e r plan and you said that was the title
                      of the film.  A.       That was the title of the film that was
                      shown, yes, sir.
                                                               f
                   Q. Was there a Po l i c e dis a s t e r plan as there was a SYMAS
                      disaster plan for H i l l s b o r o u g h Football Ground? A.             No, sir.

                   Q. Do you think there should have been?             A.     In hindsight, yes,
                      sir.

                   Q. It is a shame there was not foresight,            is it not?         A.    I
                      have to agree with you, sir.

                           LORD JUS TICE TAYLOR:   I am not quite sure what a
                      Police dis aster plan would have had in  it.

                   Q.        LORD JUS TICE TAYLOR:    You see, you had a plan for
                        a major incident.    A.    That's right, yes, sir.

                   Q. And you had a plan for see king support.  A. Correct,
                      sir, which was put into operation, Operation support.

               B             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:              Perhaps you would go on from
                        there.

                              MR. K A L L I P E T I S :   Certainly.

                   Q. Would it not have been a good idea that you, for example,
                      being the Lia ison O f f i c e r between the Police and the
                      emergency s e r v i c e s wo u l d have a designated position to go
                      to where the Police C o n t r o l Box would know where to
                      contact you and whe re the eme rgency services would know
                      where to con t a c t you and vice versa?         A.   That is
                      correct, sir.       However, I have got a radio; certainly
                      the A m b u lanc e pe o p l e knew my name, they had only got to
                      ask any Policeman, say, "Get in touch with Inspector
                      Sewell, I want to li a i s e with him straight away".
                      Similarly, I could have got in touch with them through
               D      the A m b u lanc e Control aft er being asked that way if I
                      wanted.

                   Q. But, yo-u see, “'first o f all it is £He Police -who’ha^fe 'Control
                      of the s i t u atio n when it is an emergency.  That is right,
                      is it not?       A.    That is right, sir.

                   Q.-'And it is the Police that are responsible for c o - o r d in ating
                       all the Services.   A.    Yes, sir.

                   Q.    So it would not be for the emergency services to ask where
                        you were;   they s h o u l d know that.          A.    That is correct,
                        sir.    However, I was in the iflwediate vicinity of the
                        gym nasium for the i ni tial stages, the majority of the time
                        except a short space of time I went to the pitch and when
                        I went out with S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Bates round to Leppings Lane
                        end and I am not aware of any Amb ulance Officer looking
                        for me.

                   Q. Are you aware that P ol ice Control wanted to speak to the
                      senior A m b u l a n c e Off i c e r at one stage? A. I didn't
                      get a mes sage thr ough it at all, sir, no.

                   Q. Precisely, Mr. Sewell.               You see, if there was a Police
                      Control Plan for H i l l s b o r o u g h it may well be that rather
                      than going to Snig Hill, then Snig Hill to Rotherham and
                      then R o t h e r h a m tr y i n g to c on tact an Officer in the ground,
                      Police Control might have thought of contacting you and
                      said, "Look, you are the Lia ison Officer, you know where
                      the Amb ulanc e O f f i c e r s are.        We would like one up in the

Q. Forgive me, Mr. Sewell, I don't think that is right. - A. I
   beg your pardon.

Q. We have heard from Mr. Higgins that the first thing he did
   once he realised what was happening was to go to the gymnasium
   and ask for it to be cleared to receive casualties. - A. I beg
   your pardon on that.

Q. The other thing that Police control plan might have taken into
   account, you were asked about the Tango units and what they
   could have done. We are all aware when an important person
   has to be got to the airport quickly or Royalty to get to the
   theatre through the rush hour, Tango units go to all the
   intersections and are ready to block off the traffic so there
   is a clear run through? - A. That is correct, yes, sir.

Q. That would have been a very simple and the Police are well
   aware of that sort of procedure for these Tango units to have
   done to designated hospitals? - A. Yes. I am not aware of
   ambulances having problems getting through, and I think the
   Tango units were engaged all at the ground assisting, sir.

Q. It is right to say that once everybody did get going after the
   initial delays, ambulances did not have difficulty getting
   through. - A. .1 don't think they had any, sir.

Q. The other is this, Mr. Sewell. You say that there was no
   agreement as far as you could recall that ambulances would
   come in one entrance and go out the other by the gymnasium? -
   A . Yes.

Q. In fact the vehicles that were parked by the gymnasium, there
   was a Police canteen vehicle, was not there? - A. Yes, but
   there was room to get past that.

Q. There was also a Police prison van? - A. There were two, sir.

Q. Parked adjacent to the gymnasium between it and the Police
   room and the first-aid room? - A. That is correct, sir. They
   were not blocking anything, those cell buses, because in fact
   the St. John's ambulance initially parked outside the
   ambulance room which is behind the Police room, and we always
   leave room for that to get out, sir,

 Q. We also know from the evidence that Mr. Mote and Mr. Garrett
      who, were the stand-by. ambulance who went to Gate 0; were
 • -directed by the Police to reverse' in adjacent :to c-trhe ■*'

      number of dog handlers initially behind the Kop with the
      horses, and I can only assume I think Chief Inspector Beale
      got them removed at very early stages, because it looked as
      though there was going to be a pitch invasion, and obviously

                           the horses and dogs - as soon as he realised it was not I do
                           recall him telling the dog handlers to put their dogs back
                           in the vans.

                   Q. You do recall that, do you? - A. Yes.

                   Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Who was that? - A. Chief Inspector
              B            Beale.  To the best of my recollection it was him, anyway.

                   q   .        MR. KALLIPETIS:   And what about the vans themselves? -
                           A. I think the vans would have been parked somewhere outside
                           on Penistone Road. However, there were some large jumbo cones
                           which had been placed on Penistone Road blocking the whole of
                           the nearside lane off right along outside the Penistone Road
                           entrances, so that would have assisted with any emergency
                           vehicles getting in. So there was a lot of room on Penistone
                           Road.

                                At a later stage when I went out on to Penistone Road I
                           recall there were Police vehicles parked on the central
                           reservation, and there was no problem with the roads.

               D   Q. Mr. Sewell, page 11 of your statement you refer to a time of
                      3.20 p.m. when Superintendent Bates arrived, the second line
                      of page 11 of your statement? - A. Yes, sir.

                   Q. You then go on to describe how the gymnasium was cleared, and
                      then some injured people were being brought in. Police
                      Officers were bewildered and then bodies were being
                      placed on the floor, etc. - A. Yes, sir.

                   Q. And then do you find the sentence where you say: "I was
                      asking control for a doctor to ensure that they were dead"? -
                      A. For certification, yes, sir.

                   Q. In other words, to certify people were dead? - A. Yes, sir.

                   Q. Did you radio that through to control? - A. Yes, sir, several
                      times, because I was concerned that we did not wantto have a
                      problem that people were being brought in, that there wasno
                      suggestion at all that anybody was other than dead, no
                      suggestion whatsoever, but I wanted to be satisfied that
                      nobody had forgotten to get a doctor there for the
                      certification early doors, and that was my main
                      concern.

                   Q.      -LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Did you say "you tried Several
                   ?  times?? Wereryoarhaylngtdjbfficulty '-tfoeint.getting
                      control? -A. I was not getting a reply back. They had

                            I am sure they did get it, because it was;not long after -
                            there were several doctors came to the gymn - but I recall a
                           doctor with a beard coming, and I think that he was the first
                            one there and we got him underway.

                     q   .        MR. KALLIPETIS:   In your statement you say he arrived
                             about 30 minutes after that, you see. - A. Yes.

                     Q. The doctor with the beard arrived after about 30 minutes. -
                        A. Time is very hazy, sir.  It could well have been then. It
                        was not a ridiculous time we were waiting. .

                B    Q. There is no criticism, Mr. Sewell, so d o n ’t think that, but I
                        want your help on something else. Did you eventually get a
                        reply back from control to say they had put a Tannoy message
                        out on the ground, and also they had asked Radio Hallam to put
                        a special broadcast out? - A. I did not hear that, but
                        certainly when you are in the gymnasium you would not be able
                        to hear the Tannoy inside the gymnasium.     I can only assume
                        that is how the doctors got there, so some message must have
                        got through, sir.

                                  MR. KALLIPETIS:   For your note, sir, the call from
                             ground control to Snig Hill asking them to put a message
                             through to Radio Hallam was 15.29:

                     Q. Lastly this, Mr. Sewell.  You said that there was no
                        information at all that fans were going to arrive late, and
                D       you had spoken to Sergeant Charlesworth and reaffirmed that
                        his calls round to various forces asking for there
                        intelligence did not reveal this? - A. I did not spe-ifically
                        ask him if he had done it, but he did not give us any
                        information about that all, and I am fully aware he is a very
                        dedicated Officer and goes to a lot of trouble.

                     Q. Again, no criticism of him.  I want to ask you about something
                        else.  Is there a central computer which would record all the
                        match reports from different Forces and thus make it available
                        to any force who has to plan for a particular football match?
                        - A. I am not personally aware of one. Somebody from the
                        football liaison department at Headquarters probably would be
                        able to answer that.  I am not personally aware of it myself.

                                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think we were told there was
                             not, but there are plans there should be.

                                  MR. KALLIPETIS:   Yes.   That is right, sir.   I had
                             forgotten that: "

                     Q. We have been served with details of match reports, Liverpool

                          physically pushed back from these gates at which point
                          the fans inside crumpled up their retained part of

                       their ticket and threw them out of the ground for fans
                       outside to pick up. Fourthly, from conversation
                       overheard about 100 fans were gathering outside
                       without tickets, and the conversation led the Officers
                       to believe that those fans were of the opinion that
                       the Police would let them in the ground shortly after
                       kick-off. - A. Yes, I am aware of that report you are
               B       reading from, sir.

                    Q. Was that report available to the Officers planning for this
                       match? - A. No, sir. This has been found out in thelast few
                       weeks, since the Inquiry.  I am astounded that Sergeant
                       Charlesworth was not given this information when he was making
                       his enquiries.

                    Q. This is Inspector Jarvis from Humberside, for the mach that
                       took place between Hull City and Liverpool on 18th February
                       1989. - A. Perhaps Sergeant Charlesworth could answer the
                       question, sir.   I can't. He is the one that supplies us with
                       the information.

                    Q. I am told this morning he is not available.
                D           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What   is your point,that they
                       might have heard from the Hull Police?

                             MR. KALLIPETIS:      Indeed.

                            THE WITNESS:   I am aware that he does not only just ring
                       to the host Force of the teams that are playing, he quite
                       often rings to places where they have been weeks before to see
                       about crowd behaviour and attendance and all the lot. I am
                       astounded that this was not forthcoming.

                            MR. KALLIPETIS:   Sir, there are other matters which will
                       be the matter of submissions in relation to the yellow bundle.
                       Thank you.

                    Q. Inspector Sewell, when you had your meeting, and you have Tab
                       15 in front of you, with the emergency services,.was the
                       purpose of that meeting to ensure that there was some co­
                       ordination between them and that the Police knew what the
                       plans were in the event of trouble? - A. That is correct, yes,

                       come to with the club from their point of view were anything
                       other than idea? - A. I think there was comment that they

                          would have liked to have had an ambulance at the club as
                          opposed to St. John’s Ambulance. There was some comment about
                          that, yes.

                   Q. But that was not a sufficiently serious matter for you to
                      think of minuting? - A. No. We were only talking about the
                      emergency evacuation procedure in here, but there was
              B       conversation to that effect.

                   Q. Can I ask you secondly about the monitoring which you agreed
                      was casual.  Did you hear Mr. Calvert’s evidence yesterday? -
                      A. Yes, sir.

                   Q. So far as you are aware was the system of liaison and
                      particularly the monitoring of the pens you inherited the same
                      as the one that he had been carrying out? - A. Yes, sir, I
                      cannot see there has been any change.

                   Q. Can I take you through the steps he told us about in the
                      monitoring, that the situation in the pens would be looked at
                      through the screens and through the windows of the.control
                      box? - A. Yes.
               D   Q. And that the people in the control box would be listening to
                      messages passing between people in the ground? - A. That is
                      correct, yes, sir.

                   Q. That they would, in his words, be asking those in a position
                      to answer, "What have you got outside?", that would be
                      normal? - A. Yes, sir.

                   Q. That the question would be asked of those in the West Stand,
                      "Go and have a look what the situation is below you". Would
                      that normally be asked? - A. More than likely, yes, sir.

                   Q. And that with that information an assessment and a final
                      assessment would usually be made? - A. I would imagine that,
                      yes, sir.

                    Q. And in respect of the perimeter fence his answer was,
                       "Normally the Inspector would be told to go and have a look? -
                       A. If there was thought to be a problem, yes, sir.

                    Q. And that is the system which ought to be followed? - A. That
                       is the system which has been followed, sir.

               G~ j q :Forgive m e ^ b u t - i f that ^system is followed* is others*.‘anything-

                       that unfair? - A. It has worked in the past.

Q. You say you need counting as well. The total numbers are
   being given regularly from the computer, are they not? They
   are certainly available at the touch of a button? - A. They
   are available, yes, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   The monitoring depends upon what
     over a long period people at football matches have come to
     accept as being the density is tolerable and tolerated? - A.
     That is correct, sir.

Q. They would be carrying out their other duties? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. They would have to be looking not only at the terraces but
   they would be looking over the whole of the ground, would not
   they? - A. That is correct, and then dealing with any incident
   that came over the radio as well that might happen.

Q. No-one had the specific job of standing as it were and
   exercising surveillance over the West terraces? - ft. That is
   totally correct, sir.

Q. So in the sense that I think you agree with Mr. King that it
   was casual, it would be a question of as one took a view,
   happening to notice something before any further steps would
   be taken? - A. Yes, something had to be brought to your
   attention.

Q. One would be looking around generally as one might look arounc
   this room and one might notice some people are more encumberec
   than others with paper? - A. yes, sir.

Q. But unless something drew that problem to your attention woulc
   the matter be taken any further, unless the eye or the mind 01
   the Officer was tuned in to say, "There's a problem there” .
   Would it go any further? - A. No, sir. It is down to the
   individual in the box.
Q. I think you agreed with Mr. Glasgow in answer to one of his
   questions, that these other steps, the communication with the
   o u t f & i g o i n g ^ a n d - having a look,-sending an Of Sio^rrrdown-/^
   that' would depend on something having been noticed;;-would-it?
   - A. Yes.                                                  • -
Q. Because you would not be sending runners down to all points o
   the ground to just check that everything was OK? - A. No, sir

Q. May I ask you about the briefing of the stewards. When you
   took over from Mr. Calvert you had some notes which you
   briefed from? - A. Correct, sir.

                                                              S.R. SEWELL


Q. And if we look at those notes there is written in capital
   letters at the fourth entry: ’’EMERGENCY EVACUATION
   PROCEDURE”? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did the stewards have any particular role to perform in the
   emergency evacuation procedure? - A. They were to go to the
   exits and cover the gangways and exits from the stands and the
   exterior gates.

Q. Would it be right to say that their role in the emergency
   evacuation procedure was crucial? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And unless they understood what they had to do in the
   emergency evacuation procedure the thing would founder? - A.
   That is correct, and we also had two tests, dummy runs,
   throughout the season, sir.

Q.       When   it came to discussing and briefing the stewards, what                   w
        your attention intent on focusing their minds on? - A. The
        main thing for me was the emergency evacuation.

q   .          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     They had to go to the        gates? - A.
        Yes,
Q. What did they actually do there? - A. Assist with people going
   out and make sure that the gates open.     -                 -

Q. That is the gates out of the stand? - A. Yes, and the exterior
   gates.
Q. And the exit gates? - A. Correct, sir.

Q. But beyond that.... - A. And generally just assist with people
   going out, and be there as a calming influence because they
   were obviously identifiable as stewards with the tabards on,
   sir.
q            m r . WOODWARD: You would want them to know exactly what
        to do and for them not to leave and evacuate? - A. Exactly.
        They had got to be the calming effect with the Police
        Officers of getting people out, and this was impressed upon
        them.
Q. And although some of the stewards were experienced individuals
   would it be right to say you had no knowledge in detail of
   their level of understanding? - A. That is correct.    I knew
   one or-itwo, rbut obviously I know-the senior stewards .•••w.r.-rr:c:n.

 Q. Is it right in the course of that briefing of the stewards yov
    did not give your attention to telling them about supervising
    and moving people around and dispersing them? - A. No, Mr.
    Lock went through that in full detail.

                                                 P. DARLING


Q. Was that different from other serials? - A. It may well have
   been.   Sergeant Chapman took it upon himself.

Q.   I think it follows from that you said earlier, but I will just
     check, did you realise that the boldness of that particular
     instruction had been increased from the previous year? - A. I
     did not, sir, no.

Q. I think you made a call to the club control room at some
   stage? - A. This is the room at the back of the South Stand
   where the various monitors are and also the equipment for
   counting the crowd?

Q. Yes. - A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you just make the one visit? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you help as accurately aspossible on the time? - A. I
   find it very difficult, sir.    I think I put in the statement
   ’’Some time before 2 o'clock” , and I can’t be more specific
   than that.   It was just a case of I was passing.   I had not
   got a specific responsibility for that room.    It was obviously
   located in the South Stand where my Officers were, and as I
   was passing I just called in.

Q. I think whilst you were there was discussion about the number
   then in the ground? - A. That is correct.

G. Being some 12,000? - A. Yes. Someone mentioned, I don’t know
   who it was, that there were 12,000 in the ground at that time,
   and at the same time the previous year there had been 2 0 ,00 0 .

Q. After that you became aware as others have told us of
   difficulties with the radio? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Was it about 20-to-3 that you made a further tour around the
   perimeter track? - A. Yes, it was basically intended to be my
   last walk around the perimeter track before the start of the
   match.

G. Can you help any more accurately as to the time at which you
   reached the Leppings Lane end? - A. It would be within minutes
   of 2.40, I walked from the players' tunnel along the south end
   of the track.  So I walked along half a length of the pitch
   basically.  I probably spoke to a couple of the Officers
   who were there. So it would be within 2, 3, 4 minutes that
   I was at the Leppings Lane end.

Q. At that stage was there an Officer near to each    of the
   perimeter gates? - A. There was certainly one,     I am pretty
   sure, at the corner between the South Stand and    Leppings Lane,
   and there was one behind the goal. Exactly who     they were I am
   not quite sure.

Q. Can you in fact help with the identify of any of the
   individual Officers there at that stage? - A. At that specific
   time, no.  I recall that earlier on I had spoken to P.C.

                                                                       P. DARLING
               A
                          Illingworth and P.C. Smith behind the goal, but there was a
                          movement of Officers up to the match in order that they could
                          take their meal.  So there was a movement from time to time.
                          Exactly at 2.40 who was there I cannot recall.

                       Q. What was your assessment of how full the pens were at that
                   B      stage? - A. Pens 3 and 4 were fairly full, not overcrowded by
                          any means, and causing no problem, no concern, as far as I was
                          aware. In fact, since the match I have seen a video and I
                          noticed that at about that time there were two or three
                          balloons in those two pens, and there was enough room for the
                          supporters to jump up and knock it from one to another. So it
                          was full, but there was room to move. The outer two pens or
                          the pens on the outside of 3 and 4, they were less full, as
                   C      one would expect.

                       Q. Up to that stage had you been aware of any radio
                          communications indicating the state of the crowd at Leppines
                          Lane turnstiles? - A. No, sir.

                       Q. Did you at any stage pick up that information over the radio?
                          - A. I did not, sir. no.
                   D
                       Q. Given that you say at 2.40, 2.45, the middle pens were fairly
                          full, did you envisage a need at some stage before 3 o ’clock
                          to ensure that people went to the outer pens? - A. No, sir.
                          As has already been said this morning the policy was that the
                          fans would find their own level.  I would only have taken some
                          sort of action if I had thought the crowding of those two pens
                          had got to such a stage the fans were in some sort of danger,
                   E      and it was certainly nowhere near that stage at that time.

                       Q. If that stage in your assessment had been reached what action
                          would you have taken? - A. I would have informed ground
                          control.

                       Q. What would you expect them to do? - A. I would have expected
                          someone would have been deployed to the back of the West
                   F      Stand, be it stewards of Police.  That was a matter for ground
                          control. We have got contact obviously with stewards through
                          a radio network, but that would have been ground control's
                          decision, not mine.

                       Q. I think you continued your tour of the perimeter. There were
                          one or two matters that attracted your attention on the Spion
                   G      Kop, and then you made your way towards the players’ tunnel? -
                          A. That is right, sir.

                       Q. And were you there at about 3 o'clock when the game began? -
                          A. I was, sir.

                       Q. And then shortly thereafter became aware of obvious problems
                          at the Leppings Lane terrace? - A. Yes. There was something
               H          happening.   There was some sort of commotion happening there,
                          so I walked to that end, some 20 or 30 yards behind
                          Superintendent Greenwood who had been at the tunnel with me
                          just before.

                                                                          P. DARLING
                A
                        Q. To which part of the terrace did you then go initially? - A.
                           pen 3.

                        Q. How quickly were you able to assess the situation? - A. As
                           soon as I got there it was quite clear that there were many
                B          people at the front who were having difficulty breathing and
                           who were being crushed.

                        Q. Can you help as to the state of the perimeter gates when you
                           first arrived there? - A. As far as I recall certainly gate 3
                           was open.

                        G. Did you at that stage speak to any of the Officers who were in
                           Serial 1? - A. I can't recall actually speaking to those
  #             C          Officers.    As I got there another serial joined us. Certainly
                           there were Officers from Serial 2 who had fairly easy access
                           to that part of the ground as they were in the lower South
                           Stand.    That was the most adjacent part of the ground to the
                           Leppings Lane end. There were certainly Officers from that
                           serial.   I ca n ’t identify them. Then over the next few
                           minutes more and more Officers came, but again exactly where
                D          from I am not sure.

                        Q. Looking again at the instructions to Serial 1 concerning the
                           very limited circumstances in which individual Officers are to
                           open those gates,   where reference is   made thereto a senior
                           Officer who is in   mind? - A. At least myself.

                        G. So you would not normally envisage the Sergeant being
                    E      authorised to give that instruction?    - A. No, the Sergeant's
                           duties for Serial   l are to remain at  the tunnelthroughout his
                           duties, and therefore really I am the next Officer up in rank
                           who would be walking past those Officers.

                        Q. It follows from what you said that your position up until 3
                           o'clock or very close to 3 o ’clock is mobile? - A. That is
                           right, sir.
                    F
                        G. So an individual Officer would not know where you were any
                           particular time? --A. No.

                        Q.   Does it follow that the only way to contact you, therefore,     is
                             by radio? - A. Yes, sir.

                G       Q.   Are we to take it you did not receive any request by theradio
                             to open any of those gates that day? - A. I received no
                             request at all, sir, but as I have just mentioned the amount
                             of information I was getting over the radio was very, very
                             limited.  Apart from the problem the noise was absolutely
                             deafening, especially after 2.30.

                        G.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You say it was deafening.     Was it
                H            what you would expect at a big match? - A. Yes, sir.

                        Q. More? More than you would expect?   Any Semi-Final? - A. At
                           any Semi-Final. I think it is clear the noise generated at a

                                                 P. DARLING


     Semi-Final is louder.  It is certainly the biggest crowd you
     will get at Hillsborough, and therefore the most noise. Not
     only that, the actual event itself, it is one that is so
     charged up.

Q. Yes, but I would like to understand what-this implies, that
   even if radio is working correctly at a Semi-Final you may not
   be able to communicate by it? - A. It is difficult, sir.  I
   would say it is difficult.  I am not saying it was impossible,
   and in the past it has been good enough, but it is always
   difficult simply because of the volume of noise around you.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:   Following on from that, Mr. Darling, does
     it mean in practice that the individual Officers near to the
     perimeter gates have to make their own decision as to whether
     or not to open those gates? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. As you are no doubt aware criticism has been raised already
   that some Officers were slow to do just that, open the gates.
   I would like to ask you one or two questions as to what      you
   would expect them to do in certain situations. The
   instruction they have, of course, is very clear, is not it,
   only to open if medical attention is required? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. What would you expect an individual Officer to do if he is
   hearing cries, "Let us out, we are crushed", but can't see an
   individual apparently in need of medical attention? - A. He is
   obviously going to look at the crowd, and he is going to
   assess if there is a danger there. He can see the crowd very
   clearly. He is immediately in front of them.   If he is of the
   opinion that people are in danger of being injured I    would
   think he would open the gate.

G. So that despite the apparently clear wording of the
   instruction you would hope, would you, that the Officer would
   open the gate before anyone did in fact need medical
   attention? - A. I would hope we would prevent the injury in
   the first place, yes, sir. But that will obviously be down to
   the individual Officer as to how he perceived the state of the
   crowd there.   Just a cry for help, he might not act on that
   straight away.   In fact, I don't think he would. He would
   look at the crowd, he would assess the crowd. He would be
   able to tell, I am quite sure, if people were being crushed if
   they were in difficulties, and if injuries were likely to
   follow from that.

Q. But at that stage the individual Officer is very much on his
   or her own? - A. Absolutely, sir.

Q. In assessing that situation? - A. Yes.

Q. Mr. Darling, I don't propose to take you through what you did
   so far as assisting those who obviously in distress is
   concerned.   Can I take you to one further matter towards the
   end of your statement, where you refer tocriticism you heard
   of the Police.   This is after the events had happened.  The
   criticism you heard, what was it of? - A. Basically that the
                           77



                                                P. DARLING


  Police were to blame for the crush because we had not given
  the Liverpool supporters enough tickets, or that we had given
  them the wrong end. They wanted the Kop end which holds more.
  That came from many, many fans.

Q. What did you understand that to mean? - A. They were blaming
   us that the fact was there were more Liverpool fans wanted to
   come to the Semi-Final than either were allocated in tickets
   and more Liverpool fans wanted to come than Nottingham Forest
   fans, and therefore Liverpool fans thought it only fair that
   they should get the larger proportion of tickets, which in
   fact they had not.

Q. But if only the number who had been able to buy tickets had
   come would there still have been the crush? - A. No. sir. I
   didn't speak back to them at the time because of obviously the
   distressed situation a lot were in.

Q. I am just wondering whether you interpreted that criticism as
   meaning a lot of people had come without tickets because they
   felt there should have been more tickets available? - A. Well,
   yes, that is the impression I certainly got. At the time I
   did not discuss with with those fans individually.

0. I follow that.   Thank you very much.

                    Cross-Examined bv MR. HYTNER:

G. Very briefly, I hope, Mr. Darling. At 2 o ’clock you went to
   the club control room? - A. Yes, sir, or some time before 2
   o ’clock, actually, I think.

0 . Even before 2 o'clock.  By that time you had observed yourseli
    that the Nottingham Forest fans had arrived as expected, but
    the Liverpool end was slow to be filling up? - A. In
    comparison, yes, sir.

Q. And that was your own personal observation? - A. yes.

Q. But also, although it may not have been your particular
   business so that you would not have necessarily absorbed it
   and analysed it at the time, you were told by somebody who ha<
   a view of the mechanical check on entry into the ground that
   whereas 20,000 had been there at that time last year there
   were now only 12,000 in the ground? - A. That is right, sir.

G. A shortfall an hour before kick-off of 8,000 fans? - A. An
   hour-plus, yes.

A.   They pos sibly wouldn't.
Cer tainly would not, would they?            A.     Not unless they
had been told      they d o n . ^ a l w . y s ^ o f course, have ^

 thed ° u n n e i e t h e r e e and yuisre a densely p a c k e d - c r o w d then
 many su p p o r t e r s would automatically turn rouna and go
 to the o u t s i d e s .

 when thpv reached --         Suppose they go down the tunnel
 because they still think there may be room, because they
 do n o t know the safe capacity, how would the fans then find
 their own level when they are already in the pens with
 their radial fences and they find they are get ting
 and more tightly jammed against the b a ^ i e r s , *Hst would
 crush b a r r i e r s ? A.   Those who were goi ng in last wouic
 pre sumab ly      finding it jam-packed, they w o u l d come out
 of the tunnel and come round.          In addition, certain rans,
 it is a fact they do climb over the fences.             I am not
 sayinq that we adv ocate that in any way but that does
 happen and some can move across at the back where the
  gates are open.
. So the l e v e l l i n g out would not occur until the pen was
  iam-oacked7            A.   Not necessarily jam-packed.        So.
  s u p p o r t e r s do not want to go into a part of a terracing,
  a pen, which is full.            It d o e s n ’t have to be actually
  jam-packed.
     Had anybody ever briefed you to this effect, that_there is
     danger when a pen        b   e   overcrowded even though the
                                      c   o   m   e   s


     su p porte rs will still find room to be there? Each pen
     the refore has a limited capacity which is safe and the
     D ens must not be filled beyond that capacity.             A.   I
     had not been briefed on anything of that nature.              I had
            dis cu s s e d itt The brief was that the fans would find
     their own level and obviously if Officers, including myse                                          ,
     were on the p e r i mete r track thought that pen was getting
     ex c e s siv ely p ac ked and there was any tho u g h t of danger
      occ urring, then we would have taken.some action.

3.   You see, we all know by now from the
     qiven at this Inquiry that a large number of fans like

                       is instituted.           Was it your u nd ersta nding from all the
                       briefings you had had that it was left to the fans to
                       ascertain the safe capacity of the pens rather than have
                       it imposed on them, when the fans were
                       those pens?           A.    They to an extent would find their
               B       own level but, as I have just stated, we were al^ Ys
                       conscious or we were always vigilant for any problems
                       that mioht occur there and had we seen any problems developing
                          f n  w e w o u l d have taken action.     Additionally, there are
                              n!     Stewards - -         I was aware there were stewards
                       at the~back of the W e s t Stand there and I would have expecte
                        fhem tn take some sort            action.    I was R-ot involved
                        obviously in the bri e f i n g of the stewards behind the West
                        Stand.        I do not know exactly what was said to them b u t
                        that was regarded as far as I w a s concerned as part of
                        their job - the packing, the filling of terraces.
                       If you do not u n d e r s t a n d
                                                  the next question please say so
                   ' because the last thing I want is to get you to answer a
                     question as a sort of trap and then regret answering it
                     but does it really come to this, that even though the
               D     f a n s would be anx ious to be in Pens 3 and 4, it was the
                     system that they were to be trusted to find their own level
                     to a safe cap acity?      A.    Yes, but in additio
                     considered the ste wards had certain responsibil Y
                     making sure that it did not get over-full and I repeat
                     what I said before, that if we got to a stage where we
                     thought that cap acity was being exceeded, then * e "oulc
                     take action, but c e r t ainl y there has got to be a certain
                     amount of trust in the behaviour of the supporters.
                   l    The next question is this: let us suppose that the fans in
                        their anxiety to be in Pens 3 and 4 had found their own
                        level but it was at an unsafe density and the pens were
                        p a c k e d to too dense a capacity. What did you then expect
                        would be done and by whom?        A. I would expect th
                        whoever noticed that, whoever saw that, to .inform Gr °^
                        Control so that they could take any furt^her aGtion which
                        they thought might be necessary, o b v l o u s l Y t h a t being at
                        the back of the tunnel where there were both Police Officers
                        and stewards.

                   0    Mr. Darling, iust one matter.            You identified the stewards
                        a t ’the back of the West Stand as being able possibly to
                        help with m o n i t o r i n g the situation.   How would they know
                        w h a t the state of the terrace was like?          A.  Well, they
                        To L i e , or the senior steward at the back of the terracing
                         there he is in radio contact with the Club so if there^
                        was any problem he could certainly be contacted that way.

               H         nf the t e r r a c e 7     A. I did not work behind West Stand,
                         I just u n d e r s t a n d that there is someone there who has got

                           A.   At the other side of the tunnel.
                B       Q.
                                I see. What sort of information did you think the Club
                                were in a p o s i t i o n to give him?  A.   ^ e l l » if any°ne
                                if a Police O f f i c e r or if Ground Control had noticed any
                                problems there, then through Ground Control we can inform
                                certainly the Club, i.e., Mr. Lock or Mr. Mackrell, and I
                                understand they are in a position then to passjdetails on
                                to the stewards there.

•               C
                        Q       I am sorry, are you seriously sug gesti ng the chain of command
                                miqht be that a Police Officer would notice that the pens
                                were full, tell Police Control so that Police Control would
                                pass it on to the Club officers and the Club officers would
                                tell the stewards to do something about it? A.      I said
                                before that there were both Police Off icers and stewards at
                                the back there.
                D       Q        I am asking you how the stewards at the back are expected
                                 to find out what the state of the pens are and, as I
                                 understand it, Mr. Darling, your answer is, you woulc,
                                 seriouslv expect a Police Officer to notice the Proolem,
                                 to tell Police Control, that Police Control should tell
                                 the Club's Con trol and that the Club's Control should
                                 tell the stewards.          A.   That would only be if there was
                                 a problem there.          I am not saying that should be monitore
                    E            minute by minute.          I am talking about if we saw there w as
                                 a problem b u i l d i n g up then certainly the stewards would Want
                                 to know, as wou ld the Police Officers, and that would go —
                                  that can only go through Ground Control.
                            Q. This is all very complicated.          I do not follow the
                               complication.       I thought you had told us that the orders
                               that you had r e c e i v e d in your briefing were that the fans
                    F          in that area w er e to find their own level. A.         Yes.

                            Q     And that Police Off i c e r s on the per imete r track were
                                  expected s p e c i f i c a l l y in their duties to monitor that
                                  that was h a p p e n i n g safely.      A.   Yes.
                            n  I do not u n d e r s t a n d where the stewards come into the picture
                    G       •’ at all. Did you as the Officer responsible for some of
                               those Police Off i c e r s expect the stewards behind the Stand
                               to be m o n i t o r i n g the position?    A.   They c a n n o t monitor
                               the sit uatio n in that they know exactly how many is in at
                               one moment in time.             What I am trying to say is that if we
                               aot to a stage whe re there was p o t e n tia lly a problem
                               then the s te wards and the Police Officers at the back of
                               the Leppinqs Lane terrace would need to know of that, so tn.
                H              some sort of ac t i o n could be taken, be it by stewards or
                               by Police Officers, and the only means of them being told is
                               (a) through Gr o u n d Control, which means in respect of Polic
                               Officers m e s s a g e s will be passed from Ground Control to

                    know.    They had their own brief there, I presume, and

What you do appreciate, Mr. Darling, is that the only^
people who were in a position to assess whether or no. a
problem was developing in respect of^packing on those
stands were.the Officers either on tne perimeter trac< or
those possibly in the stands that overlooked tnera? - A.
Also Ground Control - and I am not sure, altnough I
mentioned I went into the room at tne back of the south
stand where the counting machinery is, I know there are
cameras there, or that there are monitors there, ex^ctly
what part of the ground they show I do nQt kn°w *    1
not particularly look at them. It may be tnat staff
 there can also see the state ofthe terraceat Leppings
 Lane, but I do not know.
            Cross-Examined by MR. WOODvARD:

Mr. Darling, may I ask you   about thefunction   of tne
Officers in Serial 1? - A.   Yes, sir.
They are identified in documentation and we see the list
of the Officers that are there and your attention has
been drawn to a section in capitals which has been
underlined.   Do you see that? - A. Yes.

 It would seem that there is some emphasis being placed
 upon those Officers to ensure public order.   Is tnat
 ri^ht? - A. The responsibilities of tne Officers round
 the track are two-fold.   It is mainly to monitor the
 c"owd, in general terms, shall we say.   The two sorts of
 problems we can expect to occur m a football ground
 those of public order or those concerned witn         and
 they are the two areas they would be looking out fo^.

 Is it right that in 1983 there had been endeavours by a
 n L le r
        H Liverpool supporters at the west end terrace to
 get on to the pitch? - A. I do not Know, sir.

. You did not know-about that.   Not only at the end of the
  game but at earlier stages? - A. I was not aware

 You have been asked about the filling of the pens.    May
 I ask you about that?   The Kop contains thousands of
 people? - A. Yes.
  The Police had, according to the briefing, Officers at
  the entrances to the Kop, Serial 7, but also your
  Officers on the perimeter? - A. Yes, tnat is right.

. Let's take a hypothetical case.   If a considerable
  number of people in the Kop had chosen to go alldown to
  the bottom right hand corner? - A. Yes.

                       Q * match from.   Were there any Officer in the terrace in
                           the Kop, to ensure that that did not nappen?  - A. I am _
                           not sure exactly where those Officers were situated.    I
              B            was not in charge.
                       Q. At the entrances to the Kop terraces in P ^ s
                          order and ensure that these entrances remained cleat at
                          all times? - A. Yes.
                       0       So there would be, on the basis of tnat, n o Oificers   on
                               the Kop? - A. No, they would come up tne entrances

               D
                       Q. It would seem that your Officers on the perimeter, if
                          they noticed that happening, would be expected uO do
                          something about? - A. Yes.

                        Q ' all m a t t e r s which would have included that, but primarily
                            one of public order? - A. It is any problem tnat need,
               E            Police attention.

                        Q. Anything at all? - A. Anything at all.

                        Q. Even if it is not strictly a Police problem the
 j
                           intelligent Officer will deal with it? - A. Yes.

                           Q. You went round the perimeter at about 2.40? - A. That is
                   F          right, sir.
                           Q. You went round to check with your men, talk to them, see
                              whether there were any problems? - A. Yes.

                           Q. Any matters of concern and also to look yourself? - A.
                              Yes.
               G           0. To'have a look-see.   Did you have in your mind the sort
                              of thinss you would have expected tne perimeter Officers
                              to have in mind - order, any obvious matter of unsafety,

                           Q. Were you looking? - A. Yes, as I walked all the way

                           communicating with those who were directly there.

     people could reasonably be admitted to it, you v*ould do
     something about it? - A. Yes, I would.

Q. Was the state anything like that? - A. No.   It was
   nicely filled, but as I said before, not causing any
   problems.
0. I do not know who has produced this photograph.   I thin*
   it may be one of the clubs - 1988.   It looks as thougn
   it is taken some time during the match.   It was produced
   a few days ago and perhaps you were notjiere.
   there in 1938? - A. No, sir. I was at e-cclesfield Police
   Station on duty at the time.

Q.       So you cannot help us about that? -    A. No, sir.

0        That sort of situation that      you seein that photograph
         there - an experienced Officer - does that cause you any
         degree of concern? - A. No, sir.

         photographs - 29, 30 and 31 - had, for vmatever reason,
         got themselves into a particular corner, or the bulk Oi.
         thern, that would have caused problems? - A. Yes.

0. What do you have to rely on in the circumstances to
   prevent that happening? - A. You have »ot to trust tne
   supporters up to a point.   We are not in amongst tne^
   c~owd.   We have got to rely on their commonsense tnau
   they will find a reasonable level of comfort.

0. The games you have been at before, had you observed that
   happening or not, the fans living up to your expectation
   of"them? - A. In previous games?

 Q. Yes. - A. Yes, I had certainly not come across any
    problem before in that respect.

 0. May I move on a little bit and ask you about_your
    appreciation that something had gone wrong on tne day
    question? - A. Yes.
    Q. You, upon seeing there was trouble, made your way to the
       West Terraces? - A.- That is rignt.

    Q. Did you get there as quickly as you could? - A. Yes.

    0.    Are you able to say what stage    the game had got to or
          not? - A. As I recall, it had been played for a few
          minutes, but I arn rather vagueabout that.

    0. Anyway, when you got there, so far as you could see were
       the perimeter fence gates open? - A. It was open, as
       recall.

                   Q. This was not just one or two spectators? - A. No, it was
                      many.   It is very hard to hazard a guess, but double
                      figures, certainly.

              B    Q. Many, many supporters were attributing the cause of this
                      disaster to a shortage of tickets? - A. Yes.

                   Q. Accordingly, it would seem that they would seem to know
                      something about what had gone on? - A. Quite possibly.

                   0. Did you have the impression from those people that they -
                      were saying that far more people had got into tne ground
               C      than should have come in, having regard to tne ticket
                      allocation? - A. I am not sure they were saying that tnat
                      amount had actually got into the ground, but certainly
                      more were there, in general, than tney had tickets for.

                    Q. You are not just talking about a few.     It was a lot of peopl
                       saying it? - A. Yes.

                    Q. Coming from different parts of the crowd? - A. Well, these
                       were the people who had spilled out on to the pitch, so they
                       all came obviously from the Liverpool end, in fact from the
               B       Leppings Lane terrace.

                    Q. Because obviously whatever the allocation of tickets, the
                       ground has a finite accommodation? - A . Yes.

                    G. These people seemed to be saying that there numbers there wh
                       would not have been there or should not have been there
                       without tickets.

                              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Woodward. I think I follow
                         what the argument is. What the interpretation is really has
                         to be a matter of inference, but I think it is perfectly cle
                         what is said and what you say it means.

                              MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you, sir.
               D              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   And what the witness says he
                         thought it meant.

                              MR. WOODWARD:   I don't mean to cover all the
                         possibilities without closing the mind to what might have
                         happened:

                    Q. But that observation, not enough tickets, came from numbers
                       people at different times during the melee that followed? -
                       Yes.

                    G. It was a constant, cry that went out? - A. Yes.

                                         Re-Examined by MR. COLLINS:

                    G. Mr. Darling, in answer to a question from Mr. Hytner which i
                       have summarised thus, was your concern with monitoring
                       marginal or central, you said "Yes", and I was really
                       wondering what the "Yes" was in answer to. - A. I am sorry,
                       you could repeat the question I will try and qualify that,
                       sir.

                    Q. The question, and I am shortening it because it was longer
                       than this, but- the effect of the question was, was monitorin
                       the build up in the pens on the terraces part of your duty
                       that was marginal or was central, and you said "Yes".   I
                       wondered whether "Yes” was to "marginal” or to "central"? -
                       It was one of many duties.   It was an important duty.

                    G.   So it was neither marginal nor central but wasjust importan
                         - A. It was important, yes.
                H
                    Q.   Just to deal with the question of the     state ofthe pens,I
                         want to be sure you are being entirely fair to the Officers
                         under you, you see.  It is perfectly plain from the

                       operational order that the   emphasis is upon containment rather
                       than letting anyone out? -   A. Yes, but we start from the
                       premise that the gates are   closed and no-one comes on to the
                       track unless there is good   need.

                    0. Indeed, if we look at the sentence before the one in capitals,
                B      it refers to ensuring that people d o n ’t gain access tothe
                       ground? - A. Yes.

                    0. There is nothing directly in the order that deals with
                       monitoring the build up in the pens? Correct? - A. That is
                       correct, sir.                                              ~~

                    Q. Was there anything you heard said in any briefing to any of
                       the Officers that specifically dealt with any duties in
                       relation to monitoring the building up in the pens? - A. not
                       specifically, only the generality that we are always
                       monitoring the crowd in general to identify any problems.

                    Q. Would you conceive it to be part of the duties of the
                       perimeter Officers to keep an eye at all times on the build up
                       and to report in if that Officer thought that a position was
                D      reached where the build up was beginning to look a littie
                       unsafe? - A. Yes, as soon as it got to the stage wherethe
                       Officer considered that safety was in question then I would
                       expect that, yes.

                    0. Even though it was not part of the briefing as such? - A. Yes.
                       Our job at a football match, as I said before, is a case of
                       public order and safety, and clearly once you get to a stage
                       where safety is in question then Officers, I would expect and
                       I am sure they do, they act upon it.

                    Q. When you went to have a look at the position at some time
                       between 20 and quarter-to-3 I think you said the situation was
                       that the centre two pens were pretty full? - A. That is right.

                    Q. ’’Comfortably full" I think is the expression you used, whereas
                       the side pens were relatively empty? - A. Yes, there was
                       certainly plenty of room.

                    Q. Plenty of space.  If the build up continued in that way there
                       was going to be an obvious imbalance, was not there? - A. If
                       fans kept coming in through the centre tunnel, yes.

                    Q. So when you reached 3 o ’clock, kick-off time, any Officer on
                       the perimeter should have anticipated that all or virtually
                       all fans were in? He would not know anything to the contrary]
                       - A. I certainly did not receive any messages saying that
                       there were still fans outside.

                    0. So you would assume.... - A. Unless there are gaping gaps on
                       the terraces from which you conclude there are still people t<
                H      come in.

                    Q. If you assume in the absence of any information to the
                       contrary that virtually everyone is in by 3 o'clock, and if

               A
                             bearing that in mind you see that the side pens are relatively
                             empty, it must follow, must it not, that the centre pens are
                             over-full? - A. If everyone who has a ticket, if they are
                             all in there, yes.

                        Q. This is what we are assuming if we have reached kick-off. that
                           the vast majority, if not all, are in. So any Officer seeing
                B          an imbalance must appreciate that the central pens are
                           over-full? - A. It would seem obvious, yes.

                        Q.   Why did not you appreciate it? - A. At 3 o ’clock?

                        Q.   Yes? - A.   Because at 3 o'clock that is when I actually went to
                             the ....

                        Q. You were at the tunnel but you could see that end. could not
•               C          you? - A. No, I had walked round the ground from 2.40.  I got
                           involved in the incident at the Kop end at something like 10-
                           to-3. At 3 o'clock I was at the tunnel moving away
                           photographers who were crowding around that area.

                        Q. So you were not looking at the Leppings Lane end at that
                D          stage? - A. No, sir, and obviously I would be some distance
                           away, and not in the best position.

                        Q.   The only final matter I want to ask you is this.  You have
                             told Mr. Woodward just a moment ago you were trying to get
                             them to go back, and you say you were aware of you yourself
                             being abused by people at the back? - A. Yes.

                E       Q. Did it occur to you that it might be that they were reacting
                           angrily because there was nowhere for them to go? - A. It
                           could well have been.  I d o n ’t know the reason why.  I am just
                           saying that abuse was thrown back.     The reason why they were
                           upset or angry with me, it could have been one or two things.

                        0. We know people were still at that stage coming in down the
                           tunnel and joining them at the back. - A. I was not aware of
                    F      that, and certainly those I was speaking to, to me did not
                           appear to be in any great degree of problem.  In other words,
                           they were not being crushed further back, and obviously they
                           were the people I was directing my attention to, not those in
                           actual fact right at the mouth of the tunnel because I was to
                           one side of that.  It was more a general plea to those half,

                        G. Just one thing which you have not actually been asked about,
                           and may be you c a n ’t help. You assisted, I think, in bringing
                           some of the dead out of the terraces? - A. Yes, sir.

                        Q.    Was that out of pen 3? - A. Out of pen 3, sir.
                H       Q.    Did you see any brought out of pen A? - A. No. sir. I did   not
                             go beyond through pen 3.    I kept to that side.

Q          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Just before you move on to
      that, have I followed this?  If you tried to fill them
      sequentially those you put into your first choice pen
      when the next one was opened would move themselves
      across? -A.They would try to because ......

Q. What?      Over the fence or    .... - A. Over the fence.

Q         . coming out and going in again? — A. Coming out, ^oing
      to the toilets, going to the refreshments and then going
      wherever they wanted.

Q. So  then you said you decided how many you were going to
   use and opened all those you were going to use? - A. Yes,
    sir.

Q. But you said it was a policing operation.         You decided     ---
      -   A. Yes.
q   ......w hen any pen was full.    Is that right?- A. Yes.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:    Well now, it is mid-1986 the
      request is made for barrier 144 to come down?   A. Yes,
      sir.     .                                      :          -

Q     I think if we iust look at the documentation at page 319,
      that is the notes- of a meeting between Police representatives
      and the club. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You are not in fact     present.  Three items perhaps lust
   worthy of note. The     first item is that the stewards
   instructions are to     be updated. Access at Leppings Lane.
   There appears to be     a discussion about the wider door.
      And then the West Stand, the possibility of removing
      certain crush barriers at the Leppings Lane standing
      area was discussed as this would assist the flow of fans
      into the ground? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q What had y°u as Lia i so n Officer noticed was the problem
       as people came through the tunnel? - A. The barrier was
       right across the entrance to the tunnel and the    fans
       got to the barrier and stopped and we would have a build­
       up right back up the tunnel, fans would not move out and
       we could not control what was happening.   The whole of
       that area would be empty at the front and we could not
       get them in through the barrier.   That was the best    I
       think it has already been said - that was probably one
       of the best viewing points and we had considerable dis
       cussions right from the middle of the season.   This
       was brought by various officers.   I put it together
        in a report, discussed it with the Superintendents

                    Q.    Let us just consider what happened in that year 1986,
                          1987.  At the league matches were the police continuing
                          to fill pen after pen at the smaller or medium sized
                          matches? A. As required, yes.

                    Q.    At the larger league matches that year the whole terrace
                          was available?  A. If necessary, yes.

                          Were people being allowed to choose which part they went
              B Q.
                          to?  A. Yes.

                    Q.    Are you saying that you relied upon the computer system
                          that you were aware of to ensure that the total capacity was
                          not exceeded?  A. I do not think that it was ever exceeded
                          but we would certainly monitor each individual pen from
                          the control.  The then Superintendent was very very aware
                          of that situation.

                    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That was?     A. Mr. Freeman.

                    Q.    You say you monitored each pen from the control room?
                          A. Yes.

                    Q.    Just tell me what impact that monitoring would have.
               D          Supposing a certain situation was reached what would happen?
                          A. He would just say: "Close pen one".

                    Q.    By looking" a t :th-e screens and through the window?-A. Yes ;...
                          The screens were probably with the cameras looking down the
                          ground.   It was not as simple as that.     He would hear the
                          messages passing: "What have you got outside?"      The
                          West Stand: "Go and have a look what the situation is
                          below you", and it was an assessment and he would make
                          the final assessment usually.

                          He would get information from outside the ground who was
                          still to come in?  A. That is right.

                    Q.    People in the stand who could look down?          A. Yes.

                     Q.   Permiter fence?  A. Normally the inspector would be
                          told to go and have a look.

                     Q.   Look out of the window and the crowd in particular and,
                          if necessary, say close pen whatever?  A. Yes.

                     Q     That happened during 1986, 1987,      you say?    A. Certainly
                           in Mr. Freeman's time, yes.

                               MR. GOLDSACK: Can you recall up until the semi-final
                           in 1987 had there been a full capacity at Hillsborough?
                           A. I think that the nearest was probably Manchester United.
                           I am just trying to think.  Certainly the Manchester United
                           matches were always fairly full but I cannot really say
                           that there was the full capacity for the whole of that end.

                  Q.    Does it follow that when you knew the 1987 semi-final was
                         going to be at Hillsborough that was foing to be your first
                         full capacity match for a number of years?  A. Yes.

                  Q.    Was any specific consideration given to how you would deal
                         with the Leppings Lane terrace in the light of that?
                         A. I believe we decided to do it on the same method as we
                         had done before and monitor.
             B    Q.    That is to say let people go where they want to on the
                        terraces but keep a close eye from the control room?
                        A . Yes.

                  Q.    Getting input from various other people in their vantage
                        points?  A. Yes.  In fact, you were talking a few minutes
                        ago about capacity.  I think the nearest we got to capacity
                        was probably the quarter final, when Coventry played
                        Sheffield Wedesday, probably in mid March, 1987, when we
                        were very near capacity at the Leppings Lane end.

                  Q.    By 1987 you had been having metings with the stewards?
                        A. Yes.

                  Q.    Were the club asked to give the stewards any specific
              D         instructions for the semi-final, to do anything that they
                        did not normally do, for example.          A. I asked for extra
                        stewajfti’S-aotf tE'T-believe^fehey brought th€m.'f:r^)jn: Br;amall;:rr±«;'ya
    ■t* ■"              Lane but T am not sure.          They certainly a-sk-ed- for e x t r a ....
                        stewards for the semi-final.

                  Q.    ,To do what?  A. Basically on the Kop, to ensure that the
                        /Kop was controlled.  I certainly asked for extra stewards
                         for that match.

                  Q.     But was there ever any consideration given to needing
                         stewards either on the West terraces or making sure that
                         the West terraces were not full to over capacity?
                         A. I do not recall that, no.

                  Q.     You regarded that, did you, as the police responsibility?
                         A. It was something we did.  Whether it was our responsibility
                         is another matter.  It was something we did.

                  Q.     You had de facto assumed that responsibility at league
                         matches?   A. Yes.

                   Q.    And you envisaged assuming it for the semi-final?                A. yes.

                    Q. It would take them about 10 seconds to get to the tunnel,
                       would not it? - A. From gate A?

                    Q. So all that could have been organised.   In other words, in a

                       relieve the pressure of the crowd outside. We don t want ar

                       within a minute or two have organised that operation. - A.

                    Q, One matter, Mr. Creaser. Let me go back to your evidence
                       you were answering questions from Mr. Collins. You told us
                       that you accept in the Standing Orders there is no suggestii
              D        of monitoring pens by the Police? Would you confirm it is
                       your view that such a task is so obviously one for the poli<
                       it is unnecessary to even put it into Standing Orders. - A.
                       Could you repeat that? It is a subtle question. In what w,
                       do you mean, sir?

                    Q. I don’t want to put you to the task of answering the questi
                       again that my learned friend, Mr. Hytner has asked you as t
                       numbers and pens A, B,C, 1, 2, and 3 and times and the like
                       It is a very simple matter. You told us, did you not, that
                       monitoring the numbers in each of the Leppings Lane pens wa

For the attention of Mr. P.E. Bolton, Fire                        &   Emergency Planning Dept.


Dear Sirs,

HCME OFFICE CIRCULAR 11/1990
FINAL REPORT CF THE HILLSBCRCUGH INQUIRY

We duly received a copy of the initial response by the Government to
the recommendations in the Final Report of Lord Justice Taylor's
inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium disaster, which was designated
Annex B and attached to your letter of 7th February 1990.

We note that the Government has accepted the recommendation for all
seated accommodation in respect of, inter alia, national stadia and we
are making our plans accordingly for the Rugby Football ground at
Twickenham.

However, we note that in the case of other designated sports grounds
under the 1975 Act the Government will wish to discuss the question of
all seated accommodation with the authorities concerned.

My questions are twofold.    Firstly, when it is anticipated that these
discussions will take place?    There is considerable anxiety among
those of our member clubs who own grounds which have been designated
both as to the appropriateness of the decision to change than to all
seated grounds, the serious loss of capacity which would result and
the expenditure which would be way beyond their means.

Secondly, we have noted that considerable financial assistance has been
provided to the football authorities through the medium of relief from
taxation on football pools and we wonder some suitable means has been
devised of providing the necessary financial support to rugby union
football and other sports similarly, affected.

I would be grateful for any further information you are able to
provide.

Yours faithfully,



Secretary

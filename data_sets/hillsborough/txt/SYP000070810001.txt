At a p p r o x im& t e 1y "II. "15am I commenced                   duties      outside     the ground,           on

Notts        supporters.

At    1200     (noon)     the same          day    the turns t i l e s were           opened.

My duties        there      included         checking        tickets and         searching        suppo r t e r s

e nte r i ng the t u r n s t i 1e s ,

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 3 0 p m    (1430)       quite a number          of    ' d r u n k s ’ b egan    to

arrive at the t u r nstile                  attempting          to gain     entry.

T h e s e were     turned away,

A f t e r a s h o r t t irne t h e s e drun k s b e g a n g a t h e r i n g in the              ro a d way,

At 3■ 05       ( 1505)    a p p r o ;<imate 3.y S e r geant H Q Y L A N D        re 1aye d a m e s s a g e       that

he had heard over               the    radio       to the       effect    that    - "There are          spe c t a t o r

on the        pitch?"     (I was       not     issued wit h a Police Radio).

I quickly told the               t u rnstile men to              close    their       turnstile      doors.

The    turnstile man            coverihng No.                    I had to tell          him quite       fi r m l y on

2 occasions         to    close       his    turnstile,         and     bang    on the     door as a point

urgency as we were               leaving          to give a s s i s t a n c e    in the      ground.

1 ran round the Kop end onto                         the    playing area         towards      the L e p p i n q s

Lane    end - the L i v e r p o o l          supp o r t e r s    end.

As    I neared       that    end to         the    left of the          goal    posts,     I saw

approximately            100 to 200 spec t a t o r s             on the     pitch,      behind and        in front

of the goal.

As    I continued         closer       this       end,     I was   aware       there was a larger               number

of supp o r t e r s      than    I had first             realised and about 30 or 40 Po l i c e

Officers,        that     I could see.

Some    of these Liv e r p o o l            s u p p o r t e r s were    lying    down,     sitting      or

kneel i n g    on the       floor,          No one was          fighting,

1 then       realised s p e c t a t o r s were             being   trapped against            the wire          fencin

at    the front       of the suppo r t e r s             enclosure.

I went        nearer,       some SO feet away              from the          fence as    X did so,

s p ectators were            corning towards me             shouting          " T h e y ’re dead and what are

yo u fucking         doing about           it." This was              the    general    comment        of     the ever

increasing         volume        of spect a t o r s       arriving          on the    pitch.

One y o u t h a p p r o a c h e d me       holding        his    chest,       red    in the    face.          1 told

him to sit         down and began                to    reassure       him,    but    I was    in t e r r u p t e d    by d

or 3 other         spectators           shouting         o bsenities         at me    pulling me awa y               from

the youth with the red face.

The y wa n t e d me to assist                or see       to their mate who was                nearby,

o b v i o u s .1y distr e s s e d      in some way.

M y a t t e n t i o n went       to this         other y outh only a few feet away,                         again

receiving a hail              of abuse.

This    second youth was                soaked         in sweat,       red faced and          clutching         his

chest.         I reassured him as                 best    I could,          whilst    trying     to see and

a s c e r t a i n where      the nucleus              of this    incident       was.
                             /
I looked        up a n / s a w      Po l i c e    o f f i c e r s trying      t o help o b v i ously          injurea

s p e c t a t o r ^ y Oer    the fence and onto                 the    pitch.

I then        realised they were all                    being    crushed       by the s u pporters at                 the

rear    of the enclosure.

I went        to S e r g e a n t JESSQP          to my    left and          pointed    out what        X could see

and    requested        that      he    inform Gr o u n d Control              that    the    crowd b e h i n d the

fencing        needed       pulling      back         through the       tunnel       entrances.          As    I had no

radio myself.               Sergeant       JESSOP        replied that          he    couldn't      get      through.

Agai n receiving             ve r b a l / 4 b u s e , my a t t e n t i o n was       given to a y o u t h with

long    blonde       hair,       di/essed in a black                  T 1 shirt,      .jeans and scarf               who

had    come      through      the      injured and d i s t r e s s e d s u p p o r t e r s and           ran to the

other        end of the       pitch.

in-sighting           the    crowd at         that    end.

A f t e r a short time             I saw this y o u t h begin to                run back           to my      position

where       I was     still       trying      to    reassure       the d i s t r e s s e d    supporters.

As    this youth neared my                   position        I turned      to face       him,       as     I did so,        I

began to run backwards                    in an atte m p t         to arrest       him for his actions.

He slow ed down some yards                      in front       of me and baited me                  to     chase    him.

I stood my ground and he turned                           inside me        starting          to    run again.

I began to           run,    keeping         up with him turning               to my     left,          as he drew

level       wit h me      I saw a n o t h e r Police Offi c e r               in a small           f 1 ourescent

badly       cut hand.            He was      very    distressed.           I took him to a very young

I then b a n daged his hand.

When     I had secured             the    bandage as          best     I could     I took          the y o u t h    over

the     side    line,       in front         of the N o r t h S t a n d and sat              the y o u t h dow n to

and     reassure        d i s t r e s s e d supporters.

I believe a Sergeant                  from West Bar            then told me to get                  into a       l_ine

I remained           in this       line,      may    be 2 to 3 hours            just    containing             the area

                  On    Saturday,               13th         April       1989,       I commenced                duty    at    0800          am    at

                  0845        am    from        where         we    were       transported             to       Hillsborough                Football

                  Ground           arriving             at    0945       am.        We    were    there          briefed          by    senior          officers

                  on     the       forthcoming                days       p r o c e e d i n g s , and        1 was       assigned             to       Serial       33,

                  my     Sergeant             being          PS    Aitken       and       overall          in    charge       was       Inspector

                  Millett.               I was          positioned             in    company          with       PC    Highton          at       the    bottom

                  were        to    supervise                Liverpool          Supporters             safely          down       towards             the    ground

                  and        make       sure       they       behaved          in a n      orderly          manner.           Whilst             at    my    post

                  outside           the       Travellers                Public       House,       the       Liverpool             Supporters                were

                  behaving              in    an     orderly            manner       and    seemed          to    be    in    good          humour,

                  although              as    they       past       a    larger          number       of    them       were       drinking             from    cans

                  of     beer       and       lager          and    the     occasional            one       still       had       2    or    3    unopened

                  cans        in    their          hands.           The     occasional            supporters             walked             past       me

                  smelling              strongly             of    intoxicants             and    were          staggering             as    they       walked.,

                 At     about           2.45/      pm    (1445)          I was       called       to       the    Quakers     public,            hou&e       which

                  is     situated             next       to       the    Travellers             public          house,       as       there       was       some

                  kind        of    a    disturbance                there,           On    this       occasion          I did          not       enter       the

                  public           house        a*      the       disturbance             had    already          been       sorted          out.

the     side          of    the       S^rtnsrs p u b l i c          house          and       1 subsequently                    went     to

invesitgate                 this.               As     I looked down                  t hi s       alleyway           I could          see     a group

of     about          8 youths             shouting              and     thumping                at     the    e x it      door     of     the pub,

Some        of    th e      people          approached                  me    claiming              that       some       of     their       friends

were        getting            beat        up    inside           the        pub.        Other           officers          also        attended

at     the       scene         and      eventually                we     gained access                      into     these        premises,

where        on       entering             the        lounge        area          inside          I could           see     brokers g l a s s

scattered              over         the     floor           and     a    couple          of       pool        cues       snapped        in half.

There        was       no      disturbance                  at    this        time       and          from making              enquiries               with

customers              within           the      public           house           they       stated           that       it w a s      only        a

minor        scuffle             in     the          far    corner           of    the       pub.           There        were     no     complaints

made        to    the       police          a n d we            subsequently                 left        the      premises,            although           it

was     apparent               that        Liverpool              supporters                 were        involved.

Immediately                 after          leaving              these        premises             PS Aitken              inf or me d me            that

ou r    serial             was      required               at    the L e p p i n g s             Lane       end     of    the     g round and

together              with       my     serial             I attended              outside              the    gates       at     the L e p p i n g s

Lane        end.

As     we    arrived             at     t hi s        area       there        were       a       l a rg e     number        of    supporters

standing              around          in        the        streets waving                 tickets             and     saying          they         had

tickets           and wa nt ed                  to     get       into the           ground..             We    were        informed          by the

Supervisory                 officer             at     the       scene        not     to a l l o w            anyone       e l se      into        the

g r o u n d at         the       present              time and           to       form       a    cordon          across         the    gales,

About        3    to       10 m i n u t e s           later       supporters                 were       walking           out     of    the

ground,           saying            that        people           were        dying       in the             ground.            P S A i t k e n was

then        ordered            to     go     into          the    ground           with          hi s    serial          a n d we      entered           the

ground           to    the       area       at       the        rear     of       the L e p p i n g s          Lane       Stand.          As       we

entered           into         this        area        I could           see       supporters                 running          around        in a

confused              state         and     there          were         about        a dozen             or    so    people                    1         tie

             ground,          s om e     of     which        were     obviously                 dea d.      I then        entered         th e    tunnel

             in the       centre?          of    the       stand      where           people        and     other       officers          were

             rushing          up a n d         down       carrying         people           out     of     the    sta n d.         I remained           in

             this    tunnel             area     assisting            in     clearing             t hi s    area       for    other       emergency

             services             and assisting                in    removing              people        from     the     stands         into     the

             area    behind             t he    stands         where       they           could     be     treated        for      any    injuries

             they may             have.         By    this       time      this           area    had      become       frantic          with     pe o p l e

             rushing          around           not    knowing         what           to    do    or w h a t      was    really       happening.

             There    were          a    lot     of       people      severely              shocked         from       this     incident          and    1

             found     it         necessary           to     comfort         s o me        of    these      people        and      reassure        them.

             After    about             half     an       hour      most     of       the       injured        bodies        were    removed

             through          this       tunnel           a r e a a n d we           subsequently              formed a         cordon       at    the

these        would         be       the    quietest.

They       turned          out       to    be     not    very       busy and             we    spent       most       of    the       time

either          chatting             amongst           ourselves             or    to    the    stewards          or       the    Notts

in g o o d       spirits.

As     kick      off       drew       nearer           one    or    two       started          turnstile          hopping             and       one

or     two      got    locked             up    from     th e      turnstiles                higher    up.        JPttroughout all                    of

It w a s       then       t ha t    I noticed              that        somebody             h a d vo p e n e d / < n e     left       gate and

fans        were     trying         to    ge t      out,        but       they were             all    trying         to    ge t      out     of

this        gate     so     nothing        much          w as    happening,                 nobody         getting         in or        out.

The      fans      slowly          started          to     part        and       l e av e    a g a p on          th^terrace              and       I

I c o u l d n ’t c o m p r e h e n d           what        I was          seeing          and    I stood          there         just     staring

until        somebody          shook       me.           I moved           b a ck       towards        Vp(e f e n c e a n d

Somebody           then      started           passing           bjyaies            out     and a human             oKain was            formed,

I stood         on     the     track       and        passed           the      bodies          on.        I / d id n’t l o ok          at    them,

just        passed        them     on,     it s e e m e d            to    last         a while        but       I d o n ’t t h i n k

saw      bodies        just        laJM out,             with        people         walking           around        them.

As     we    did,      I looked           up and           saw       somebody             picking          money      from       the     side          of

                A board        was    brought            over      and    we    laid       the      lad        on    it.       Andy       took    his

                and    saw     his    Liverpool             scarf        tied arou n d           his      wrist          and     neck,      he w a s

and     there          was      a g r e a ts r u r ge ncy              in them           to     get       down       to Le pp i ngs             Lavie .

come      down         to      the    gym        entrance,           which        we     did,        arid o nc e          there       we     were

The      next       thing        I recall             wa s     seeing            a man        being         passed           down        the     crowd

he    fell          down       o n t o the      s t e p s » people               moved         back       for       him,       somehow,               ana

he    just          lay    there.               I looked          at        him     I knew           he     was      dead.

I rati back              for     some        reason          to     tell         martin           arid t h e n       rati b a c k          again.             By

seemed         to    take        for       ages       before           it     did       but       eventually              it      di d     and       we

We    were       told      by SergeateVjSffdison to w o r k                            in our        pairs       and       to     position

                      a nd commsmced                 duties.           For     the      first        couple          of    hours          the

spectators            from N o tt in gh am                carne      in a s t e a d y        stream and              none       caused             us

any    trouble.

The    major        problem was                directing             spectators            to    the      correct          entrances                as

a    number       of L i v e r p o o l         fans       somehow          seemed       to      h a ve    come       to    th e      wrong

e n d a n d we        kept       giving         them       the       appropriate             directions              to L e p p i n g s

Lane.

In the       fina l        h o ur    up    u n ti l       the     kick-off           the     number        of    incoming

spectators            increased            but       with       one    or    two      minor        exceptions              there          were

still       no    real      problems.                As    kick-off          time       drew       nearer        there          was       a

noticeable            increase            in the          number       of L i v e r p o o l        fans        coming       up       to       us

asking       for      directions               and    due       to    the    time,         they were            much       more       hurried

than    the       previous^n^uiring                        spectators             ha^ifeen,

Shortly          before       3 / 6 ' c l o c k S e r g e a n t E'djHson came out of the g r o u n d a n d

instructed           us t o         go    to    Leppings^ane                 e n d as        there       was     trouble             with          the

spectators.               'The      unit       immediately made                   its w a y        out     o n to     the       perimeter

track.           Upon     walking          onto       th e      track       I immediately                 looked          down       towards

Leppings          Lane      and      I saw a          number          of    fans      i^efth on          the    edge       of     the         pitch

on    the    perimeter              track       and       climbing          o vjer    the       fencing.             I immediately

                  On     initial            arrival          at    that       end,       there        seemed          to    be a g r e a t         deal       of

                   confusion,               people           standing         about       and       continuing              to    clamber          over       the

                   fencing.             My       first        r e a c t i o n w as       to    look        for    instructions                from

                   Inspector            Beresford              and      these       were       forthcoming                 when    he    instructed                the

                  unit       to    form a j i n g l e              line       cordon across                 the       line       facing       towards            pen 4

                  of L e p p i n g s         Lane.           As    we      formed        up s p e c t a t o r s        continued          to       clamber

                  over       the       fencing          and       onto      the     perimeter              tr ac k .

                  At     this      point          the        football         match       wa s      still        in    p l ay a n d      I recall             that       a

                  number          of    the       spectators               were     cont incfi ng           to w a t c h         the    match.           To    my

                   immediate            right          was     Police         C o n s ^ l T ^ 7 2             Justice            and whilst             stood       in

                  this       position             I r e ca l l        a m a /T c o m i n g       up    to     us a n d       screaming             at    us,

                  telling          us       to m o v e       and      do    something            as    there          was    a man and             people

                  dying       in the             crowd.           Initially          ou r      reaction           to       this    was    one       of

                  disbelief,                feeling          that       it w a s     more        likely          t h at     somebody          had       fainted

                  gone     terrible               wrong        and      the m a n w h o          had       s c r e a m e d at      us    previously                came

                  This     time         we       went    with         him and        to       the     fencing          immediately             behind          the

                  goal,       climbed             up    onto       the      fence        and     looked          into       the    crowd.

                  The    people             at    the    front          were      reaching            up    towards          us    and    begging             us    to

          th e     fans       tried          to       pass     him      up     to    us    but        due       to    th e      structure             of    the

          fencing            we    were       unable           to     get      hold       of       him an d          he     fell      from       our       grasp

          onto         the    ste ps .            A    gap     then       seemed          to a p p e a r         around          the man.              It w a s

          obvious            l o o k i n g at          him     t h at     he wa s         dead.

          Upon         seeing        t hi s       I went           back      towards           a    group        of       officers          to    inform

          them         of w h a t       was       happening             and     then       returned              to       where       Police          Constable

          Justice            was.        He       had       been      joined         by    other          officers              and     spectators               and

          they         were       all    pulling              at    the      fencing           trying           to    break          it d o w n       to    get

          to     bend and            give         way.         Police          Constable              Justice             went       in w h i l s t        the

          right-hand               side       of       pen 4.

          As     the        crowd       began          to     clear,         small        spaces          began           to

          appear            and    I looked              around         and     saw a number                    of    dead       bodies          or

          apparently               dead       b o d i es       laid       on    the       steps        of       pen 4 a n d           on    looking

          up a g a i n s t         the       perimeter              fencing.              This        I r ec a l l          c a u s e d me       to    freeze

          and      stare          in d i s b e l i e f         until         someone           shook        me a n d           I turned and

          clambered               out    of       th e      terracing           o n to     the        t ra c k .

          By     now bodies              were          getting          passed         out         onto     the       p i t c h a nd        in a d d i t i o n

          there         were       a number              of    people          staggering              about,             clutching          their          c hest

          area.             I then       became             involved           in    passing           bodies             out,       but    only       in       so

          much         as    taking          it       from     somebody             and    passing              it    onto       somebody             else,

          around            the    track          and       parked        at    the       front        of       pen 3 .          As     it d i d       so       two

      recall         about        him w a s        that        he    was     quite      a stocky               lad,      with         da1"k h a i r

                                                  I gave        mouth        to m o u t h      whilst           Police         Constable                West

      gave      heart           massage.           At    first           I thought        he       wa s    starting              to    come a r o u n d

      as     I thought            he wa s         starting           to     breath.           We    continued               with       our

     attempts              to    revive          him    until        it b e c a m e     obvious            t h at      we   were         wasting

      There         wa s    also       a marked          sign        of     hostility          from        fans        towards             the

By    the       time      we    got       b ac k    the       tending        to       the    dead       seemed          to    have       sorted

of    information,,               either           about       what        the     full      extent          of    the       disaster           was

or w h a t       was      going         to     happen,             I was     unable          to       tell    anyone          anything.

1     recall        then       just       standing            around        with       Police          Constable             West     for

quite        a while           u n t il      we    were       joined        by     Inspector            j-2'eresford w h o            told       us

about        half        the    unit         there       so we       continued              to s t a n d a b o u t           until       someone

suggested             we w e n t        to     find      our       helmets.            I managed             to    find mine             and

when       I returned             the        full       squad       ha d    returned             and    we    were        instructed             by

Sergeant           Eddison           to      follow          him and        we     walked         up    the       terracing           steps        at

Leppings           Lane        and      out       through          the     tunnel       to       the    b ac k     o h e         stand.

Apart        from        one    or      two       hostile          spectators           most          seemed       to     have      cleared

by    now.

A s we       were        a mobile            unit       we    were       instructed              to    go a n d      get      into       the

police          van and assist                    with       various       minor        public          situations              that       were

developing               in the         immediate             vicinity           of    the       ground       but       we    were       unable

to    get       very      far     due        to    the       traffic        eong        "        n.

We w e r e       eventually               directed            to    the     No rt                Gener               s pi t a l so         as    to

assist          with a violent                    confrontation              between             relatives          and       the     press

but    on arrival               it      did       not    require           much       intq^vention.                  We      r e m a i n e d at

the    hospital               until       approximately                  7.15pm       whereupon              we    returned           to     the

football           stadium,             which       by       now w a s      cl ea r,        quiet       and almost              ee r i e .

After        consultation with                      the       appropriate             authorities                 we w e r e      informed

to    return          to H e e l e y         and    stand          down,     which          we    did,       going        off     d u t y at

8,.3 0 p m      t h at    same       day.

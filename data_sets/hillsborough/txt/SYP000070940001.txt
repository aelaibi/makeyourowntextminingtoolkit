middle           pen     of      the    West          S t a n d , assisted           by P o l i c e       Officers           stood        on a

wall        on    the       pitch       s ide.          It     became          apparent         that      due     to   what        appeared

to     be    overcrowding                   in    the       centre         pen,     supporters            were     being          forced        to

                                                                                                                                     S 1520

side     to       eleviate             the       crush,         I assisted            by    conveying          these         fans    from

t he    fencing             and       onto       the    pitch,          where        they       were    placed         into    the

recovery           position,                to    eliviate             breathing           problems.




After        a    short          while        I then made               my way        over       to    the    No 2      gate       situated,

at     the       front       perimeter              fencing            in the        left       hand    pen.       Officers          had

already           entered             the     pen      via      this        gate     and    had made          their         way across         to

the     centre          pen,          where       they       recovered              and    conveyed          a number         of

supporters              from          this       area      and      brought          them       to    the    Mo.   2    gate,       where

together           with          other        officers            and       supporters           I a ssisted           in    conveying

these        people          from        the      g a te     to     the      pitch        for    treatment.




Once     a       number          of    people          had      been        removed        from       the    middle         pen and

fencing.               It    became           cl ear       t h at      several        people          beneath      the       crowd

appeared           to       be    dead,          and    these          people        were       in t u r n    removed         and    taken

onto     the       pitch          vi a      the     number          2 gate.




Together           with          other        officers            we    were        then        instructed         to f o r m a     line

across           the    centre           of      the    pitch          to    segregate           rival       supporters            and

assist           emergency             services            to     operate           more        freely.




During           this       time       an     announcement                  wa s    made        to   the     effect that           the m a t c h

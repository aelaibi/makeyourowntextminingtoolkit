openly        requesting              if a n y      supporters            (which were              of     course          Forest

fans)     wanted           to    sell       any     spare      tickets.               Some    Liverpool              supporters

were     on P e n i s t o n e         Road     with       tickets         because          a section            of    the H o p        had

been     reserved           for       them.

During        th e    course          of m y      duties       on     the    turnstiles,                I had        c au s e    to

others        were     from Liverpool                   and    had made           several          attempts           to    gain

obvious        again        the       Forest        supporters            were        making       a    conscious           effort           to

get into the ground.

At     3.00    p.m.        (1500)       we     were       directed          to    the       gymnasium           under       the       North

Stand      and       once       the r e ,    were       given        orders       to       proceed        along       the       trackside

at     the N o r t h       Stand,        but      at     no   time     was       I told        what       was      happening.

Upon      reaching          the       Leppings          Lane        fencing,          instructed             to m a k e     a    cordon

along      touchline             of    p i t c h as       numerous          fans       were       climbing           the    perimeter

fence      and       were spilling                onto        the    pit ch .         They looked             in   distress           and

obviously            some were          hurt        but       initial        thoughts were                only       of    pitch

invasion.             No    orders          were       given        except       to    keep       cordon and              get    fans

of f    pitch and           into       ground          again,        during       this       all       the    players           and

passed        us    they         were       saying           people       were        dead and          bring          crushed.             By

this     t im e     officers               had       taken        things        on    their       own and          began making

their        ow n   decisions,                  myself        included.               I made          my w a y     to       the     fence        and

there        saw     one       dead man              of    quite       heavy         build and           in m i d - S C T s ,        being

Myself        and     Police              Constable           E372      Justice          went         to a n      open       gate      and

obvious         he'd       been           dead a while.                 Officers            on    trackside             were        told        that

we     needed       an a m b u l a n c e             and     it w a s     then        t ha t     along       with       supporters,

a    hole     big     enough              for    the       passage        of     persons.             The    body was             passed            out

and     onto        the    trackside                 by w h i c h      ti m e    fans       had       filtered          back        and

spaces        appeared               on    terracing.               I climbed            out      of    the       gap and went                  onto

the     pitch and              began        administering                 basic        first          a i d as     quite          a few

other        officers            did.           Again,        another           obviously             dead     youth         was     placed

were     happening               and       emergency              services           began       to    arrive,          but       stil l        I

wasn't        aware        of a n y         specific              orders        given.           Liverpool             supporters               and

Police        then        began           breaking           up    hoardings           to      use     as    makeshift              stretchers

and     those        dead        and       injured were                carried across                  the     pitch         and     round           to

directed         to     rear        of L e p p i n g s       Lane       but     prior         to    that,        two

abandoned           and       for    supporters              to    remain          orderly          and     le a v e     ground

sensibly         but      to       keep     tickets          for       replay.

Once     at     rear      of L e p p i n g s          Lane    all       fans       eventually             dispersed              and     one

fan    walked          past        our    serial         in o b v i o u s      distress             and     shouted,

realised         some         of    the     enormity          of w h a t       had        happened.              Duties          then

consisted           of m o b i l e        transit           patrols          and    went       off     at     S . 30     p.m.      .(2030)

Looking         back      thoughts              obviously          come       to m i n d       and     some        are      clearer

than     others.             The     main        one     t ha t    causes          me     st ill     distress              is w h y      w e r e n ’t

a p p e a r e d , as   it w a s          normal        bobbies           took       it     upon      themselves              to

One     last     thought            is    that,        personally             n e xt      to w o r k ,      football             is m y

We spoke about the enclosed response from the FA to our request
for a factual report on the Hillsborough disaster.

I have spoken to the FA who are taking a further look at the
possibility of providing some factual material, including the
allocation of tickets. I will keep you in touch.

  Dear David,

                                                       Hi11s borough

              Thank you for your letter dated 21st April,                                        1989.

        As I am sure you will appreciate a thorough investigation of
  the events concerning the match at Sheffield on 15th April is
  currently being undertaken by my staff in order that all the
  relevant evidence is before Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry due to
  start, I believe, fairly soon.   I am reluctant to take resources
  away from that effort which is already taking up a great deal of
  time.

       In the circumstances I consider that it would not be
  appropriate to prepare any interim " factural report" by Friday of
  this week.   Please let me know if this causes you a problem.

                                                   Yours sincerely

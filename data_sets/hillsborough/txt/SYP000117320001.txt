               At     1 1 . 3 0 am       I began         mounted        patrol       duties          at    the    ground      and      was

               instructed             to w o r k         in a   pair     with      PC      1226 Ellis            of N o t t i n g h a m    Mounted

Together          with        PC    Ellis       I    toured          the       area        of       the    ground          so    as     to

the      ground,          1    ensured          that       he       was    aware           of       the    fact       that       all     the

side       roads        between       Penistone                Road       and       Leppings              Lane     were         closed        with

barriers          and     residents             only       were       allowed              into       these        streets            and     that

the      Penistone            Road    turnstiles                were       for        Nottingham               Supporters               and

Leppings          Lane        turnstiles             were       for       Liverpool                 supporters™

After       touring           the    ground          we    took       up       position              on    Penistone             Road        arid a s

the      numbers         of    supporters                began       to    grow         we      worked         outside           turnstiles

43    to    48    along        with       other          mounted          officers              who       were     spread         along

Penistone          Road,            Other       mounted             officers            from         the     serial         were        working

on    the     central          reservation                and       the    opposite                 footpath          of    Penistone

Road       encouraging              any    supporters                who       were        gathering             in    groups           to    cross

the      road      and        enter       the       ground.           There           was       a    good      presence           of     foot

patrol       officers              outside          each       turnstile              in     Penistone             Road.          The        crowds

directed          to     the       turnstiles             and       into       the      ground.              There         were       quite        a

number       of    Liverpool              supporters                who    were         attempting               to    buy       tickets           and

we; re     offering           any    amount          of    money          to       Nottingham              supporters.                  These

Liverpool          fans        were       moved          immediately                and      directed            away       from        the

ground.           There        were       very       many       people             approaching               the      ground          who     had

been       drinking           alcohol       and          the    numbers             who      were         arriving          with        cans       of

lager       and    beer        were       more       than       I    have          ever      seen         before.

I remember              hearing       a request                on personal                 radio          for a s s i s t a n c e        to

t his      was    t u.r n e cl do w n .

There       was    only        one    special             train       carrying               Liverpool             supporters                to

Wads ley         Bridge        Railway          Station             and    I       heard        confirmation                by    radio           that

it    had    arrived.               Very    shortly             after          I    heard           Inspector          H a nd--Davis

request          two    more        horses          to    attend          at       W a d s ley      Bridge         station            and

PC 2 3 1 6 S c o t t        and PW          136 M a i n w h o         were        the      closestm o u n t e d          officers

were     directed           to a t t e n d .

The     crowd where              I was        working          continued          to     growand        it s e e m e d       as

though        everyone           was       carrying           cans    of a l c o h o l .

I remember           hearing           a    r a dio      request       for       Leppings         Lane       to    be    c l o s e d a nd

then     I heard           nothing          on m y       radio       for    some        time.       I looked            at    my w at c h

at     about    2.35        pm a n d        I wa s       a    little       surprised            because       the       crowds

outside        the     ground were                 still       very    big a n d         previous          experience              of

F .A.    Cup    semi        f i n a l s , the         crowd         have    usually            started       to    thin,          outside

t he    ground       by     that       time.

I heard a            request          an    the      r a dio    for    more       horses         at L e p p i n g s      Lane       and a

further        four        were       directed           there and          then a further                 request           was    made

and     together           with       PS S o r s t y         I galloped          vi a    the     official          car       park       to

the L e p p i n g s        Lane       end     of     the      ground.

A s we w e n t       alongside              the      wall      of    the    South        Enclosure           I could          see

people        entering           the       ground        through        the       large        metal     door      at the W e s t

Stand     exit.            This       is gate         *C*.          I went        to     this     gate     andblocked               the

entrance        w ith my          horse        and       began       to m o v e      people       b ac k     from       the       gate.

They     were        very       hositle        towards          me    and were           attempting           to    get       past- and

into     the    ground           but       together           with PS So r s b y           I moved         the     crowd          back

and     the    gate        was    cl osed.            Before         the    g at e      wa s    closed       I could          see

inside        the     turnstile             area.            There    was     a massive            crowd      of    people          w ho

all     appeared           to    be     pushing          forwards          into      the       terracing.           1 heard             the

folding        metal        doors          c l ose    b e h i n d me       and    I encouraged               the    people           to

form     an o r d e r l y        qu e u e .        Some       with    tickets           did     so a n d     entered          the

ground        vi a    the       turnstiles,              but    a great          many      once     they      realised             they

could     not        get    in,       walked away              into     Leppings           Lane,       shouting          obscene

abuse     as     they went.                 They      obviously            had    no     tickets        or    they would                have

joined        the     qu eu e .

As     people        were       entering           the       ground     they were              standing       on e m p t y
  alcohol         cans     which were           littered            everywhere,             I then           saw       exit    gate         “B ’

  which      had       been    closed whilst              I was       the r e ,    open and               f an s       again      entered

  the    ground.           I sa w      no    one    come       out.

  Nearly         everyone          1 saw     left      in L e p p i n g s       Lane       w as    in     possession              ot     c 'Hi in s

            I am a single man a no N^ive with my g i r lf ri en d at the above address.

            I have been a supporter                  ofNjiverpool            Football     Clu b for several           years

I think we a r r iv ed           in S h e f fi el d about 2=30    pm (1430)          and    parked     in a

side street about               twenty minutes walk        to the ground.             On reaching

S h e f fi el d we    did not go to a pub or for some f o o d \ we wal ke d straight

to the ground.             I saw some fans drinking at a pub anflyorae lad who was

drunk        say to a Policeman,           "Take me away."        As we w al k e d along            I saw

Policemen        patrolling        on foot and on motor          bikes.        I did not see any

trouble        it was a good happy atmosphere,                 as fans made          their way to the

ground.


                   >450
We all       stayed together arid made our way to N^e Leppings                             Lane

turnst i l ^ s .     On    reaching th e\ tu rn st il es       I saw a large          crowd of        people

all m i l l i n g \ b o u t ,   there was     no o r d er ly queues      just a mass          of    people.

I saw one mountera P ol i c e m a n          near    the front    of the       crowd by the

turnstiles,          he was     trying to     push    people    back but he had no                chance

because of the            crowd.



We joined the          crowd and m a d V our way towards               the    left hand side of the
                                             \ \              <ZA T-
t urnstiles       but w hen we        reached^he        turnstiles      they were          closed.      We

made    our way to the            right,    I was    pushed about       but    not    crushed.



A PoSLicernan on foot             told us     o                                                   go a r ou n d to

was    opens.    \We all went                     the side of the turnstile and just

w al k e d    in an open g a t e , no one          checked my ticket and             I did not see any

P olice      or stewards        at this     gate.     I was    just    glad to get          in because        of

the    crowd outside.             Once   through the gate        there was       no    crush and we

all wa lk ed to the tunnel,                w hich was    straight a head of us.               I had never

been to Hi 1 lsbo rough before and went                   towards      the    tunnel       because     I

thought        it was the only way to the               terrace and all         the other          people

were    going      that w a y .
At first w he n we started to go dds^n the tunnel                            it was        not    crowded but

it a p pe ar ed dark          in the      tunnel.        We wefs singing as we went along                       the

tunnel,       but on      reaching        the terrace       it was    crswded an d we stopped,
                                                                                                     o            .
         a very short           time      I was    pushed from behind             K     was a real        surge

and we w^re all             separated.           At this    point    I remember             .t the game          had

just    kicked off.



The    surge       pushed me forward and to my                right my arms were                 down by my

side    for a while and                1 was    lifted off the ground.                My   right arm was

then up in the air and a girls                      face was       directly u n de rn ea th         it,    she

waKscreaming            and shouting            for help.     I was       being       pushed and     crushed          I

was alsfcK being          turned side on to the              pitch and was             having     great

d i f ficulty       pg b r e a t h ,



The    girl    to my right was             going    down and       1' grabbed hlhc. tagether with

                     and another          lad     I do not know       pulled her up a n d passed

ter over       t         ?^ds of people towards              the    pitch.        I did not see what

happened to her^ai>fter this.



                     and myself were about                half w a ^ down     pen three           towards       the

pitch,    and because           of the         crush there was       noNj^ay we were             going    to stay

there.        We saw people             being    pulled up into the stand and decided to

try and get back              towards      the    rear    of the    terrace,^ It was a struggle                   to
                                                                             \
g el b a c k , we were         sweating a lot but we got                  to the       (Near of    pen three.

We w e rf Njust        to the     left of the tunnel              exit as you          looiK^ay      from the

pitch,    and i f ted                      up with some other             lad and then somone              lifted
               CfqT.
me up into the stand.                    I felt shaky and          in a daze and on looking

towards       the    pitch     I saw the         players    had    left the       pitch and        people were

climbing over           the    perimeter         fence    onto the     pitch.         The Police         had

opened the gate             by now and          people were       being    passed out        onto    the       pitch.

                                                                                                        83577

We m ov ed about           half way up the stand and stood                    in a daze watching what

was    going       on.     At this       point    the    police were      doing their       best.



My a t t e n ti on was       drawn to a large man who was                    laid out on the         pitch

near    to the       right hand goal             post.     The mans      shirt had been taken off

and fans and             later    two P o l i c e m e n were working         on the man.         I saw later

that the man was             covered up and a pp e a r e d to be dead.                   I was    to far

away to recognise                the man but he was          f a t , about 30 years         old,     dark

hair,     I cannot         remember anything more about                  him.



I saw the          police    cordon off the             centre   of the      pitch and the fans were

getting      the     boards      from around        the    pitch and      carrying the       dead and

injured across             the    pitch towards          the Notts Forest         end.     I then saw an

a m b u la n ce    come    down the       pitch,    towards      our   end.



On    looking       down towards          the    pitch    I saw a photographer            lifting up

clothing          covering       the dead bodies and taking               photographs.           This was

taking      place        in front    of    pen five and si;-;, also             in front    of pen four.

I saw some fans             grab the       photographer and then the Police                  took him

away.



I saw a mass             of bodies       lying ar ou nd the       penalty area and we             had

enough so we decided to leave the stand and                              look for our friends.               We

went    down the steps at the                    rear and walked to the tunnel               w hich by

this    time had been             cordoned         off by the Police. I asked            if I could          go

back    the tunnel          to try and          find my friends        but    I was   not allo we d t o .

A man     came      up to the Police demanded to go down                        as he had        lost his    son

at first          they w ould      not    let      the man go down but because             he had lost

his son they decided                to take him down,            after    this    they took       several

people down the tunnel                   and escorted them back.

We w ai te d a ro un d this area for             a long   time and         then the Police wanted

us out of the way so we went               out     into    Leppings        L a n e .We were    looking

for a t elephone and a man from                  a funeral    parlour      told    us we    could use

his    phone so we went        in and              rang    home.



On    coming   out we met                          and he thought       the worse          be cause we

were at the funeral           parlour.      We started to make          our way back           towards

the    car and stopped at a phone              box because            wanted to phone.               On

the way back      to the      car    1 heard that     large    numbers      of fans        had died,



Be ca us e we were      upset we went       to a pub,     for about an hour and half.

After      this we made     our way back         to Liverpool      arriving at about a

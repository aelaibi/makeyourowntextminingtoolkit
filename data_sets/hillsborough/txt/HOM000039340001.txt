    Dear Mr

   »feoroMab.S<fAlttm
   Thank you for your letter of 6 August 1997 which I received on 8 August 1997.

  I have made arrangements for the Phillips report to be supplied to you. I have reservations
  about making it available to a wider audience. The report was commissioned by the (then)
A Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police in anticipation of civil actions against the Force.
™ We have appointed Winckworth Pemberton to provide legal advice to us on the Scrutiny. I
  will ask Mr OWSTON to advise me on whether the release of the Phillips report to Ms
  Adllngton would compromise issues of confidentiality.

   I have a similar reservation about the release of the report which the Chief Constable
   provided to the Home Secretary before the General Election. Again I will ask for advice
   from our solicitors.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you and your staff are entitled to unrestricted access to our store
   of material. I am happy to supply material to other people but not if ft breaches the privacy
   of others or if the material is confidential, for instance legal advice.

    I will turn now to the issues raised by Ms Ann Adiington, solicitor for tho Hillsborough
    Families Support Group. In her letter to you, dated S August 1997. she says she Is
    ‘extremely concerned at their (South Yorkshire Police) delaying tactics" in supplying the
    statements of two named individuals. Ms Adiington wrote to us on 17 July 1997 asking for
    soma statements. I wrote to you on 23 July to ask permission of Lord Justice StuafrSmith
^ t o release material. On 30 July 1997 you wrote to say that it was In order to release any
V n aterial we deemed fit to release. Your letter arrived on Friday 1 August 1997. I was out
    of the office that day and acted upon it on Monday 4 August. I do not think this can be
    construed as “delaying tactics*. Please feel free to copy all this letter to Ms Adiington if you
   wish.

   Yours sincerely




   Ian Daines

Dear Miss Adiington

Phillips Report

You recently asked for a copy of the Phillips report. I have sought legal advice on this
subject. I am advised that the report is not relevant to any current civil action against the
Chief Constable. That being the case, I am now pleased to be able to release it to you.

I have asked Constable Ken Greenway to produce a copy. You will appreciate that the
volume of requests for material, and the scale of some of those requests, mean that it may
take some days before you receive the material.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

    Address:




        I am a married man and live at the above address with my Wife.        I am born

    and bred in Sheffield but have moved about the Country with my employment.

        I have been a keen football supporter for many years and used to be a

    season ticket holder at Hillsborough along with my Wife.        I ceased going to

    live football matches because of the increased use of foul language and

    violence.

        On Saturday the 15th of April, 1989 it was my intention to meet a friend of

    uline               I don't know his address, fox a game ox goif at Concord

    Municipal Golf Course in Sheffield.     Our intention was to meet at the course at

    1.00 p.m.

        Having knowledge that the F.A. Cup semi final was being played at

    Hillsborough I decided to leave my house early to avoid any traffic congestion

    or delays.

            I left my heme at about 11.45 a.m. and drove in my car towards the golf

    course.     I was suprised how little traffic there was.   I saw one or two

     supporters about but certainly no crowds at this time.

            As I was early I decided to go for a quick drink before meeting

     I stopped at the Sicey, at the top of Sicey Avenue, Firth Park.       I parked my car

     on the car park.    There were one or two cars parked but nothing out of the

     ordinary.

            I went into the pub and ordered half a pint of lager.    The pub is basically

     one big rocm and I chose a seat not far from where 3 men were sitting.       There

     were perhaps 15 people in the pub at this time.



                                               /
        Fran where I sat I could inadvertently overhear the conversastion that 3 men

   were having.              It became apparent to me that 2 of the men were Liverpudlians and

   one had a Midlands accent, more Nottingham than Birmingham.                I listened to their

   conversation for about 7 or 8 minutes and during this time I heard them discuss

   how they were going to get into the ground without tickets.                They appeared to

   know Sheffield well as they said that the place to cause trouble would be

    outside the Leppoings Lane because of its confined entrance.                They said

    something along the lines of "We'll meet the boys in Leppings Lane, if enough

    start pushing then the Police will open the gates."               They mentioned that they had

^ m a n a g e d to do this before.         I also heard them say "We'll create havoc."      I also

    heard mention of them wanting to get behind the goal.               They each had a full pint

    in front of them.             Although I am unable to say what they drank before I got

    there.
        At some stage I got the impression that they realised that I was listening.

    L ’felt:   r a t h e r   uncoorfoirtable so drank up and left .. I then, went and played golf?   .   o r-jr*


         I finished playing.golf at about 4.30 p.m. and ,then heard .or..,tba;car radio.-..

    the news of the tragedy at Hillsborough.               I mentioned to             my earlier

    encounter in the pub and he said that really I should go to the Police.

         I thought everything over and thought that my evidence seemed insignificant

    until I heard about the trauma that Superintendent Marshall had suffered as a

    result of the gates being opened.

         It is my opinion that the creating of the crush outside the trunstiles and

     the subsequent opening of the gates was orchestrated by the Liverpool

     supporters or I should say the minority.

         The 3 men in the pub were all white. Hie 2 Liverpudlians were in their

     early 20's and the other man was aged about 35.               I would not recognise them

     again.

               I am        a    retired            sales     director        and   live     at   the     above        address             with    my

               wife.

               On        Saturday             15   April      1989    (150489)         I planned        to   play      go,lf      at       Concord

               Go 1 f * C o u r s e           in   Sheffield,         and    had   arranged        to    meet      some      friends             there

               at        1pm     (1300).            The      course    is    about     4 miles      from      my      home,       and       my

                   route       there          takes     me    past    Hillsborough          Football         Ground.             Knowing          that

                   the    FA    Cup       Semi      Final      was    being     played      at    the    ground        on    that          day    I

                   set    off       early,         in   case    of    traffic      congestion           in   the      vicinity,             leaving

                   home    about          11.45am         (1145).       I drove         alone     in m y     c a r,    and       was

                   surprised             to    find     very    little       activity       near    the      ground         as    I       passed.

                   My    route       was,      front M a i in       Bridge    along      Dykes     Lane      down      Wynyard             Foad,

                   left    towards             Leppings        Lane    traffic         lights,     up    Halifax        Road          -    passing

                   along       L e p > p in g s    Lane,      and    past    the   ground        entrance       at     that       point.              I
                                                                                                                                F AGE
                                                                                                                                S43

passed       there        about     11. 3 0 a m     (1150)          and    saw        very     few      football

supporters           and     traffic       was      lig h t.         1 saw           that    the P o l i c e       ha d    blocked

off    the     side        roads    to    protect         residents'                 parking,        and      I saw,       I think,

about    50      policemen          in t h a t      area.

Having       time      in h a n d    before         meeting          my     friends,           I stopped           at     the

"Si c e y " on S i c e y A v e n u e to p a s s t i m e u n t i l                      1' m e t     theirs.      1 went           into

th e   pu b a n d      ordered       a half         pint       of    la g e r,        and    sat     down       in the         bar

loung.

1 sa t    just        to    the    right     of     the       main     entrance.               There       were

approximately               fifteen        people        in    the     pub.           The     r o o m has       'bays*         around

its    circumference               and     I sat     at       th e    end       of    one     of    the       ' b a y s ’ nearest

th e   entrance,            with    my     back     to     the       next       'bay*.            Sitting       b e h i n d me w e r e

three     men,        who    were     a 1 ready       there          when       1 arrived.

After     a     few m i n u t e s     I became           aware        of       their       conversation.                  1 cannot

now     remember           the    exact     words,         but       1 gathered             first        of    all     that       they

were     football           supporters,             intending             to    go    to    the     semi-final            at

Hillsborough.

As     I went        to    sit    down     1 had      noticed             that       these        three       me n were         as

foil   o w e   :-

1.     Mid      thirties,          black      or     dark      brown           hair,        cut    slightly          l o ng e r       than

normal,         with       a dark     moustache.               He     was       wearing           black       leather          hip

length         coat,       dark    trousers.

2.     Mid      twenties,           light     sandy        hair,          cut    very        short,       but     not      a    crew

cut,     clean        shaven,       wearing          red      sweater,           crew        neck       and a     pink         shirt

collar         worn       outside,        l i ght    grey       trousers.

3.     Mid      twenties,           hair     light       brown        and       cut    ear        l e ngth,     wearing           a

tweed        sports        jacket.         I cannot           describe           this        m a n as w e l l        as    the

others         as    he    sat     farthest         away      from        me.

At     I listened           to     this    conversation,                  1 heard           this     older       man      (n o . 1)

talking         to    the    others,         s a y i n g that         JUwy       should           not    worry       about        not

          unfairly         blamed      for    this    course     of   events.

          On      the    day   after    the    Hillsborough           tragedy,     I discussed          with       a   golfing

            friend,                            what    I   had    heard    in    the   pub   on    the    p r e v i o u s d a y.

            He    suggested      I tell       the    Police      about    it,   but    I did      not    do   so

            immediately.

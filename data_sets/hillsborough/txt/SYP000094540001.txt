I commenced               d u t y at       the      Midland          Station             at     10 a m      (1000).

At     approximately                 11.20 am            (1120)       the         s am e      day and          date,        together           with

Police        Constable              2413      WHALEY,             I boarded             a double           decked          public       service

vehicle           containing             Nottingham Forest                        fans        and     travelled             with      sa m e    to

t he    Hillsborough                 Football            Ground.

On     r o ut e    to     the      ground          I observed             that       a     number        of     public           houses        in

the     Penistone             Road       area       were        crowded           with        football          fans        of    both     te a ms .

On arrival              at    th e      ground          there       was      no    reception             by     police           officers           and

following              the    advice          of    a senior           officer,               the     f a ns    were        allowed        to

alight        from        the      public          service          vehicle          and        disperse            outside        the     ground.

I then        returned             with       the       public:      service             vehicle         to     th e    Midland          Railway

Station           where       on a r r i v a l          at    approximately                   1.10pm        (1310)          more      fans      were

collected              and    conveyed             to    the       football          ground.

At     approximately                 2.15pm         (1415)          the      same        day and         date,         1 accompanied

At     3.04       pm    (1504)          the    same          day an d        da te,        I was       instructed                together

with      the      rest       of     the      serial          to    make      mv/wa^            to    the      perimeter           track        m

As     I did       so     I observed               that       the    game         'tfas i             ogress          and    I sa w

numerous           people          on    the       pitch        behind        the        goal.

On     reaching           the      terrace          X saw          people         in the         crowded            pens     who      were

obviously              in g r e a t      distress             and    I also          saw        people         wh o    appeared

lifeless.

It a p p e a r e d        to me         that       pressure          was      being           applied          to     the    people       at        the

People        in the          crowd were                screaming            to    get        out     and      I saw        people

                     the      terrace.

                     As a        result             I approached             a senior            officer        and      requested          that       pressure

                     be     released                by    removing          people          at   the    rsy&r pf         the    st an d .

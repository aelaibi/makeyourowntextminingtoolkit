Dear Sir,

Rei Your Report on Football

I refer to the above and in particular paragraph 54
thereof.

I assume that you would concur that this contains a
clear reference to myself.

I can advise you that I was greatly dismayed to read the
aforementioned paragraph, together with considerable anger
and not a little incredulity.

You have proceeded to publish a personal indictment, without
having the common decency or indeed the good sense to try and
ascertain the facts. No contact has been made with me prior
to stating that as a matter of fact I "extended a V.I.P. welcome
to home coming "Supporters" convicted of misbehaviour whilst
attending a match in Greece."

I would therefore like to know on what basis you have made
this statement.

Yours faithfully,




D.J. Sharpe   -    — ------

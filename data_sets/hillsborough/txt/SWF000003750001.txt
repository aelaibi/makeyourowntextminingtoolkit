Dear Sirs



We thank you for your letter of 21st July 1989 and note your
interest. Please note that we act for Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club in this matter.

As you may be aware, the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
Police has agreed with the Steering Committee, representing
the Claimants forming the Hillsborough Group, to pay damages,
without admission of liability, to Claimants whether or not
they form part of the Group, subject to any remoteness of
damage issues in nervous shock cases.    The Plaintiffs in the
test actions selected by the Steering Committee have now
discontinued their actions against our clients.

Accordingly, we would ask you to write to               |of the
Municipal Mutual Insurance Company Limited at Park House,
57/59 Well Street, Bradford, BBl FSM.     Municipal Mutual are
the Insurers for South Yorkshire Police and                  is
responsible for the co-ordination of all claims and will deal
with any queries regarding the agreement reached with the
Steering Committee.

Yours faithfully

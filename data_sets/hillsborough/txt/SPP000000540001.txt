Tel call from M. Burgess to say that 17th November would be best date for him. He
also suggested that we should perhaps meet before hand if the meeting was not too
early.

After I had telephoned Mr. Bone (see below) I phoned back and left a message on the
answer phone to say that I had made the arrangement for 11 am on 17th November at
the Judges offices.

I telephoned Mr. Bone and said that 17th November was the best date for Mr. Burgess
and convenient for me too. He said that it was the best date for them too. I asked him
to send me the copy statement which was not enclosed with the letter.

We had a general conversation about Hillsborough. Mr. Bone mentioned interalia that
they had met with members of the families and how strong the feelings still were. He
also thought how sad it all was. I also formed the impression that he was reassuring
me that there was nothing much to fear from meeting with the judge but that they
would record the meeting as was their normal practice.


I telephoned Mr. Dorries and arranged to go to Sheffield on 10th November. I asked
him to make to arrange for the transcripts to be available.

All conversations took place on 29th October 1997 after my return home from work.

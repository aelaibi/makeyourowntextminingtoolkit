I think       that a number            of things       c o n t r i b ut e d to these         people dying and

being     i njured a mo n g s t        them,   I w o u ld say there /(ere not e no ug h police

in a nd a r o u n d the g r o u n d , a total             lack of s t e w a r d s , also too m an y

people were a l l o w e d to go             into too small            a/i area.

I left the g ro un d at a bout 3 . 4 5 p m o f my own accord.

Two    things      I witnessed which              I w ou ld say was a criTfiina 1 o ff ence were

one L i v e r pool        supporter       going    up to a p o l i c em a n and' pushey him a nd

 cr ea me d at him,          ’ I t ’s all your f a u l t ’ .

 »lso I saw a )~iverpool                supp or te r    trying     to get out of the gate                    from

 «en 3 onto the            pitch this was a fter              the w or st       had ended,         a p ol i ce m an

mshed       him back        in the supp or te r         tried to get o u t / a g a i n a nd this time

the    po l i c e m a n   punched the sup po rt er            in the stom/ch and he fell                     back

into     the terraces,            I have to say there was                r\o/crush at this time the

s u p p o r t e r was     p robably just trying              to get    onto the           pitch to      look for

someone       he had       lost.

I think       that e v e r y b o d y    involved the Police,              St Johns ambu la nc e,                 the

s u p p o r t e r s agre e v e r y b o d y did e v e ry t hi n g   they      could to help the               injured

people,       b u y by the time they knew what was                       going         on it was      too    late,     I

t hink    ev er yo ne was         dead.

There     was a total         lack of o r g a n i s a t i o n a n d      information,             if the P ol ic e

h a d n ’t of got a cr o s s        the    pitch t # stop the oppos/ng                     fans    coming

tog et he r     this t ra g e d y w o ul d have been even wor^e.                        There w o u l d n ’t have

been a n y t rouble          or fear of any            pitch    i nv a si o n       if the N o t t i n g h a m

Supporters         had been told what was                going     on,    they w o ul d n ' t        have    been

              I c a n ’t blame the P o l i c e , from w here                 they were        they co u l d n ’t hjt've seen

              the      people on the floor at the front of the terraces,                                  they d/d what

              t he y    could w he n they        realise d what was h appening,                     but   I thi/nk the

              total      lack of o r g a n i s a t i o n   by e ve r yo n e      c o n c er n ed   caused tpis       disaster.

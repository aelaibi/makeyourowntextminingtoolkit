1   .   I ANTHONY JAMES EDWARDS will say:             I was born on 5.9.55.


2.      I work as an ambulance man on day work.            I joined SYMAS in
        September 1988.     I started part time and was promoted to day
        work on 6th March 1989.           I had previously been in the
        ambulance service in 1973 in Liverpool             and had received
        qualified status.       I had done further training which lead to
        me being     admitted as a Fellow of          the Ambulance Service
        Institute.       This    is   a qualification      above   the   normal
        standard but it is not a paramedics course although it is an
        introduction to it.       I left the service in 1982 and went to
        Sheffield Polytechnic to do social studies.                I worked in
        adult education until I rejoined the service.


3.      On Thursday and Friday I worked a shift of 0800 hours to
        1630 hours.


4.      On Saturday I was to work from 0900 hours to 1730 hours.              I
        was with                  who is a qualified ambulance man and
        was acting as driver.


5.      The first I remember about the Hillsborough incident is when
        we were taking a patient to the Northern General Hospital.
        We heard control telling a crew from Rotherham to go to the
        gym at Hillsborough where they would be met by a station
        officer.     I thought that it would be some form of a fight
        going on.     Our radio was on the day frequency which I think




                                             I (p I
     is channel         We stayed on the channel all the way through
     the   day.    We    did      change     to     ERC


6.   It was about 1510 to 1515 hours when we were on our way to
     the Northern General       Hospital.      We    arrived   at Northern
     General about 5 minutes later.         There were various messages
     coming over the radio but I was concentrating on the patient
     in the ambulance.     We took the patient into the hospital and
     it was sometime before 1530 hours when we got back to the
     ambulance and started to clean up.        We then gave the call to
     control that we were clear.      I made the call on channel
     Control then told us to go to Hillsborough gym entrance
     where we would be met by an ambulance officer.             We did not
     know which side the gym entrance was on and I was going to
     use the radio to try and find out where the entrance was.
     We went down to the traffic island on Herries Road which is
     about one and a half miles away.               Control    then gave a
     message to all mobiles.      They repeated that it was for all
     mobiles   and said that     they were     to    proceed   to the gym
     entrance at Hillsborough as they had notification of some
     fatalities.   I think this was around 1530 hours.          We arrived
     at the ground at about 1532 hours.           There were no problems
     in approaching the ground until we reached the junction of
     Herries Road,      South and Penistone Road.         There were two
     ambulances in front of us and a police officer was directing
     us to park behind them.       A short time later, probably no
     more than a minute we were moved into the entrance while the
next ambulance was sent to the further gate.                   I saw Trevor
Dale standing outside the first entrance and pointing for us
to go into it.        The police officer shouted to us that if we
went to the second entrance then we would be able to get out
via the first entrance.           Dale said no and that he wanted us
to go into the first entrance.               We did so.      We were met by
Mr.Hopkins           the   Assistant Chief Ambulance                 Officer.
Mr.Higgins was also there.              Higgins told us to drive up
behind an ambulance which was already parked and almost at
the same time Hopkins told us to go on to the field.                        At
this   stage    there      were      rows    of   police     with   vans   and
stretchers coming out of the entrance on to the pitch.                      It
was clear that there were dead bodies on at least two of the
stretchers.     I would say the time was about 1535 hours.


We were stopped by a police officer at the entrance to the
corridor to         the pitch.       The officerat the front of the
ambulance said that we could                not get through.        Spectators
were shouting at us about a body on a stretcher.                    We stopped
and Hopkins came up to the ambulance and opened the door.                    I
said that the police officer said that we could not go
through and         he replied       that he wanted     us    on    the pitch
immediately.        He said that there were casualties at the far
end of the ground and he needed us on the pitch and that we
were not to stop for anyone until we got to the far end of
the ground.         He told us to put our two tones on and go
through.       We    did   as   we    were     told   and    went   past   the
             policemen.      It was slow progress getting on to the pitch but
             we certainly did not get stuck.          On the pitch we saw five to
             six boards being used as stretchers with bodies thereon
             being carried by fans.        We drove past them while they were
             screaming      at us to   stop.      The St.John's       ambulance was
             leaving the pitch as we came through the entrance.                      It
             waited until we were out of the way before going off the
             pitch.    We were the only ambulance on the pitch by this
             stage.    We drove up to the 18 yard box in front of the west
             stand.    There were people everywhere.          My driver was looking
             for an officer but we could not find one anywhere.                   There
             were fans bashing on the ambulance wanting us to stop and
             help their friends.       We were approached by a woman and she
             shouted       through   the   window      and    said   that   she    had
             resuscitated a casualty.          I got out of the vehicle with a
             bag, mask and airways, and went to a body which was lying in
             front of the goal in the 18 yard area.              Someone was giving
             mouth to mouth resuscitation.            I noticed the colour of the
             patient and was doubtful whether the patient had in fact
             been revived.     All the time there were people shouting at me
             for oxygen and all I could remember shouting was "one at a
             time."      I knelt down over       a male casualty and         someone
             deliberately kicked me in the back and said "what about my
9r    4ooi/<f daughter."    I continued to look after the boy on the floor.
Vu5    ^     i decided that we needed to move him.               I told the people
             around me to pick him up and I shouted to someone to bring a
             girl that I had also briefly seen.              I would say it was now




                                                  I
about 1540 hours.         I looked for my driver and he had driven
over to the other side of the goal towards the corner flag.
We carried the bodies over to the ambulance and I was being
followed by people carrying other bodies.                 When I got to the
ambulance I saw that someone had already opened the back
doors.      I asked a police officer to stay with me to look
after me after I was kicked.              We put the young boy on the
left hand side and the girl on the right hand side and
someone else put another body on the floor down the middle.
Then someone tried to get another person into the ambulance.
I shouted to the policeman to take the person off and he did
so.


When I turned round again the ambulance was packed with
people and so I asked the police to clear the ambulance.
The doors were closed but I could hear people kicking the
back doors and wanting attention.                 In the ambulance there
were     now   three     bodies,     a   nurse,     two    policemen,     two
spectators, my driver and me.               One of the spectators was
trying    to    revive     the young      boy.      The    nurse    was   from
Nottingham.      She had been a spectator who had volunteered to
help during the chaos on the pitch.              She was using a bag and
mask correctly.         The other spectator was holding the head of
the girl.      I told                    to get going.             put on the
lights and horns and drove off the pitch.                   I have no idea
what time it was by now.           I assume that the man on the floor
was dead.      I tended to the girl and showed how to do mouth
     to mouth resuscitation while       the   spectator did cardiac
     compressions.      I was very upset by this stage.     I cannot
     remember anything about getting out of the ground and I do
     not know what time it was.        I remember nothing of the
     journey up to the Northern General Hospital.


9.   We took the three bodies into casualty and I assisted the
     doctor for a few minutes.     We then loaded trolleys back on
     to the ambulance.     I asked the spectator nurse to come back
     with us and she agreed.     I cannot remember any instructions
     as to what we were to do next.      We drove back down to the
     ground and I could hear conversations on the radio to do
     with Hillsborough but I was not really taking them in.


     There were no problems in the approach to the ground, with
     police cars everywhere.       This time we went    through the
     second entrance.    There were a couple of ambulances ahead of
     us.    I also saw a West Yorkshire ambulance.   I said to ____
             that I would report to an officer to see what wanted
     to be done.     I went to an ambulance officer in the yard
     although I do not know his name.     He said that ___________
     was to stay with his vehicle and that I was to help as much
     as I could.     I went back to the ambulance to tell        to
     stay with his vehicle but discovered that he had gone.       I
     went to the next ambulance and helped myself to a first aid
     box.   Just then a casualty on a trolley was brought up.    He
     appeared asthmatic and semi-conscious.       I put him on the
      second     ambulance.   Then   the    attendant   on   the    second
      ambulance,              [ arrived    with another casualty.     Once
      they were loaded, that ambulance set off to the hospital.


11.   I then met another officer whom I did not know.         He told me
      to help some of the casualties out and pointed towards the
      gym.   I did not realise before this that the casualties were
      in the gym.     I went into the gym and met Station Officer
      Higgins.     He said that I was to assist priorities.         I then
      helped with trolleys and directed arriving ambulance men to
      priority casualties.    Each time I loaded a priority onto a
      trolley I went back to the senior officer in the yard to
      tell him what I had done and asked for more instructions.
      He would then tell me to go looking for priorities again.


12 . At one stage I offered to be a runner because there appeared

      to be no communication system between the officers at the
      ground as the radios were not working.      Within a short space
      of time we did not need trolleys and were onto the walking
      wounded.     By this time I felt exhausted and explained to
      Station Officer Higgins that I had been kicked.        He told me
      that I had to go to casualty.        I did not want to.      He said
      that there was a vehicle going to Hallamshire Hospital and
      said that I should go with it.


13.   I was at the Hallamshire for about 20 minutes.
      then arrived with some doctors who were needed at casualty.




                                       1&-7
      it was quite by accident that we met up at the Hallamshire.


14. The control officer on the radio told us to have a drink at
      the Hallamshire.         We did so and we took two transfers to
      King Edward Hospital.       We finished at King Edwards at about
      1900 and then control told us that we were finished.                        We
      went back to the station, cleaned the ambulance and went off
      shift.


15.   I was not aware that there was any Hillsborough plan or of
      the role that the gym was the play in it.               I did not realise
      that     the   gym was    the   casualty     clearing        centre    or   the
      temporary mortuary until I was told by one of the officers.
      I was aware of the major incident plan prior to this.

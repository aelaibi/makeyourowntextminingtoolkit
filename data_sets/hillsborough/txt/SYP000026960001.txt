Date:   17   April 19 8 9        Our Ref.                      Your Ref.

Mr J W Smith, CBE, JP, DL,
Chairman,
Liverpool Football Club
Anfield Road,
Liverpool 4

R E : Hltll&borough

Dear Mr Smith,

In view of the tragic events that were witnessed on Saturday I feel compelled to
write to you, not, onl^ as a Kop Season Ticket holder who was present in the Leppings
Lane terracing f r & 1.00pm onwards, but also as a qualified Engineer and proprietor
of the above business which, aside from dealing with motor accidents etc., also deals
with personal injury claims and their causation.

I am stating below the events at Hillsborough as witnessed by myself and a friend in
the hope that it could assist Liverpool Football Club and all families concerned to
establish, without doubt, the reasons for such unnecessary loss of life of our fellow
supporters and friends.

Time                  Description                                                        ~....
10.00am               Left Prescot by car for Sheffield using the following route.    M62 -
                      M6 South, M56 - M 6 3 Junction 13, then A560 to just past Hyde, then
                      A57 (Glossop signs) direct to Sheffield.


11.15am               Parked car near Holme Lane, Sheffield 6 and slowly made way to ground
                      via Middlewood Road/Leppings Lane.


12.00pm               Walked round complete stadium in search of a Public House, the only
                      one found open was the "Park Hotel" on the Penistone Road (Nottingham
                      Forest end).  This Hotel was full of Nottingham Forest supporters so
                      we made our way back to Leppings Lane via Bradford Road/Middlewood
                      Road and bought programmes.


12.55pm               Entered outer gate and turnstile "B" at Leppings Lane where our tickets
                      were handed in and our stubs returned.  We were then ordered by Police,
                      across turnstiles A-B-C-D, to empty our pockets and were then searched
                      and admitted to the terracing.


1.05pm                Walked onto terracing under West Stand (tunnel in centre) no Police at
 .           A-     -.'..this point in the ground. I would say there were about 50 people on
                       the terracing at this stage, most sitting on steps or lying down, both
                      wings of Leppings Lane empty.
        2.00pm         A lot more people have now come in, but have entered through the tunnel
                       behind the goal and under the West Stand.  It is beginning to look
                       very crowded behind the goal.


        2.10pm         We moved further to   the right away from the goal area (towards South
                       stand) after having   gone off terracing and behind West Stand for a
                       drink and something   to eat.  Looked at the turnstiles and a large
                       queue had developed   outside.


        2.20pm         We were now standing near to the Police box in which we could see the
                       Closed Circuit Television Monitor pictures through the open door.


        2.40pm         I looked over to the centre area behind the goal and pointed out to
                       my friend that it seemed overcrowded for that time in the afternoon
                       considering there was a vast amount of space around us and even to the
                       right side of the dividing fence which runs down from the upper seat­
                       ing area (West Stand) to the perimeter fencing.


        2.56pm         Liverpool come onto the pitch, there is activity within the Police box
                       tg( oiif right.
                       Tliere are no Police positioned at the tunnel under West Stand.


        3.00pm         Announcements, which are only just audible, are made over the P.A.
                       system, presumably to the people still not in the ground saying they
                       will all be admitted and to stop pushing.


        3.02pm         About 150 people come running round to where we are standing, one of
                       them turns to us and says they have just opened the gates and shows
                       us his complete ticket - shouts can be heard from behind the goal area
                       and a feeling of unease develops.  Police pushing people back.


        3.08pm         Match is stopped - people on pitch, more people still coming in to
                       where we are - it is now full - still more come in.


    Opinion
    I have watched football matches since 1969 and have been in some frightening situations
    both inside and outside grounds.  This, however, was the worst because no positive
    action was taken by the Police until they had allowed an irreversible situation to
    arise.

    I saw no Police on the Leppings Lane terraces, only on the running track and on the
    balcony of the West Stand, they did not seem to think there was anything wrong, yet
    presumably the Closed Circuit Television would cover the Leppings Lane end?  If it
    did, why did the Police not notice, as we did, that the terracing was filling up
    unevenly? Was there no communication between the Police Closed Circuit Television
    Operators and the Police outside the ground?  Finally, why were the two large gates to
    the tunnel under the West Stand not closed or Policed in such a way that the incoming
    supporters would have been directed to both sides of the Leppings Lane end and not the
    middle?

    I would like to be of further help if you so require.

    Yours sincerely,

                                                                                                ■ v'

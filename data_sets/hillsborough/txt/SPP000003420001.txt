Dear Chris,

                                    Re: Hillsborough

I decided to draft a fullish reply to Ms Addlington’s letter of 8th September and then to
contact you to discuss the matter. Unfortunately you had by then gone on holiday and
I decided to let Michael see the draft and the questions. Michael’s instant reaction
even before he had seen any of the documents was that it would be better if I did not
get involved and he has confirmed this now by his letter of 1st October 1999 a copy of
which I enclose.

Having considered the matter further I do not think that my initial attempt is suitable
though it has the advantage of clarifying my thinking to an extent. I would like to
discuss the matter with you as soon as you return from your holiday (which I hope has
been a good one) so that an appropriate response can be made.

I have already had one reminder from Ms. Addlington and have merely acknowledged
the correspondence and said I was still considering the position as to whether I would
respond.

Please phone me as soon as you are back.


Yours sincerely,


S. L. Popper.

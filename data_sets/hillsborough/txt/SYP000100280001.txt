POLICE CONSTABLE 3186



RING FARM, CUDWORTH, BARNSLEY



On    Saturday    15    April        1989,     my    tour     of    duty    was    7*30       am     x   9*00     pm.

Commencement      of duty at Ring Farm Stables,                      Barnsley.           Prepare         horse    for

football    duties      at     8.30    am.          Depart    by    horse    box    to       Niagara      stables.

Briefing at Niagara Club House by Inspector Hand-Davis                                   and Superintendent

Marsh at 10.Op am.           11.30 am parade for duty on horseback.                           11.45 am all 29

horses parade for duty briefing by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, after

which I then commenced patrol with full 29 mounted contingent to rear of

South Stand of the Hillsborough                      Football Ground where              we     were given our

respective duties by Inspector Davis.                        I then proceeded with my supervisor,

Police   Sergeant       1764 Thomas,          Police      Sergeant Smith of Merseyside,                        Police

Constable      1696     Stanbridge        and       Police     Constable         1300    Grunhill         also        of

Mersyside.       Being one horse short (original number being 6 ).                                 All 5 riders

then rode to the Leppings Lane Reception area for the Liverpool fans.                                            This

area of the Leppings             Lane     side       and road in front           of theturnstile           area

inclusive to the Catchbar Lane traffic lights was our patrol area for the

next 3 hours.          We stopped in this area and were again briefed by Police

Sergeant     1764 Thomas        as     to our        duties    and to familiarise                  the Merseyside

officers with the ticket system.                       That is the appropriate coloured ticket

for    entry     to    gates    A,    B      and     C.      The5    of     us    then       moved       off     on    a

familiarisation tour of the immediate area for the benefit of the Merseyside
officers.      At this time there were no supporters of note around, and the

turnstiles were open.        We completed the tour of the area and returned to the

Leppings Lane turnstile area.

Due to the fact that horses are worked in pairs normally, and that I didn't

have a partner, Police Sergeant Thomas advised me to work on my own paying

attention to Leppings Lane           and Catchbar Lane vicinity.                 The horse I was

riding,     'DANUM' , is    a young    horse       only    having been      in   the department    6

months, and I felt that crowds later in the day may become too much for him

to contend with, so my position on the approach to the reception area would

be a better duty to work.           Police Sergeant Thomas agreed with this enabling

the more experienced horses to work directly inside the busy turnstile area.

Police Sergeant Thomas and Police Sergeant Smith remained together at the

turnstiles, Police Constable Grunhill and Police Constable Stanbridge went

off in a pair and again toured the area.

I then patrolled the          area alone for              approximately 15 minutes then returned

to stand with the two Sergeants              and          the two Merseyside officers whohad by

this time also returned.            We remained in this position for sometime.                    No

problems      arose with    the approaching fans,           the usual assistance           was given

directing them to their correct entrance gate number, many fans seemed to be

looking     at the    'gangway    letter'     on their       tickets   and    not   the    turnstile

entrance letter.

As   time     passed and    the     number    of approaching         fans    increased,     all were

directed      to theturnstiles, we each            shouted to them instructing             them that

those with tickets to go into the ground and those without tickets to move

back out of the way          and not to obstruct the reception area.                      That is the

area   from    the   blue    iron     gates to the        footpath   of Leppings     Lane.       This
                                                       -    3    -




situation      went     on   and    worked       satisfactorily               for   about   approximately      one

hour.    The     atmosphere        was    good    humoured               without problems.          However,    I

noticed that a number of fans were carrying many cans of beer and 2 litre

bottles of lager/beer.              I saw a foot Inspector, Inspector Sykes, taking the

beer from a number of fans, but due to the ever increasing numbers, this

task became impossible.              I noticed a general aroma of beer coming from the

crowds of fans in general.                  It appeared to me that they were affected by

alcohol consumption and becoming more hostile.                                The combination of drink and

sunny    day seemed to taking effect.                           I continually advised          fans that they

would    not get      into the ground drunk, many ignored me and                              I was not in a

position to do much about it.                     Many were             standing around       obstructing the

footpath approach to the reception area, in particular in front of a sweet

shop     to    Vere   Road,    also       at     the       corner        of    Leppings     Lane    bridge.      I

continually advised fans that they would not get into the ground drunk.                                          I

made a number of sweeps of the footpaths to clear them from in front of the

shop to the first road junction (Vere Road) but it was like walking through

water,    as I moved         away,       the crowd closed in behind me.                       Due to a radio

message I became aware that a Special Train had arrived and the fans arrival

was imminent.         The arrival area of the fans was heavily congested between

Vere Road and the shop also a considerable number of approaching fans all

the way along Leppings Lane.                   I asked Sergeant Thomas if we could sweep the

area together in order to clear the footpath approach.                                      After a couple of

minutes       this we    did   just prior to the arrival of sight of train escort.

When the escort was some 30 yards away, we made a further 2 full sweeps of

the     area    successfully       moving      all         the       supporters     towards   the    turnstiles.

Police Sergeant Thomas then went with these supporters further towards the
terrace     'C' gate turnstile area.           I stayed on the roadway channelling the

arrival of train escort fans into the reception area, ensuring traffic was

still able to pass through on the road behind me.                 Some 500 fans were in the

train    escort    but     easily    asmany more     fans     had been collected along the

approach route.          Their arrival at the turnstile area would be approximately

2.20 pm.         When dealing with this arrival I noticed that many hundreds of

fans were arriving from the Middlewood Road direction over the Leppings Lane

bridge,     I estimate nearly 1,000 fans at this time.                      It was as if we had

suddenly become swamped.             The bridge was becoming heavily congested.                As the

horses    on the      train escort,      being led by    Inspector Davis,           went    into the

"terrace C Gate turnstile area", I noticed that Policewoman 156 Main of the

Nottingham       Mounted    Branch    had become   separated     from her          partner,    Police

Constable Scott.          My other four mounted officers were also within the crowd

in the      terrace   turnstiles      area.    I therefore joined with Policewoman 156

Main.     At this time the road was becoming blocked with fans from the bridge

up to Catchbar Lane interrupting the flow of traffic, and pavements becoming

blocked with Liverpool supporters who I understood to be non-ticket holders.

I assumed they were non-ticket holders, as they made no attempt to approach

the turnstiles.          Some of them stated they were waiting to meet their 'mates'

coming      in   private     cars.      The   majority   of    these    people       were     also   in

possession of a can of beer.

A   fight    was    taking    place      outside agas    showroom      at    the    crossroads       of

Catchbar Lane and Leppings Lane andfoot officers                 summoned our assistance in

detaining some youths.              By this time the fans apparently numbered thousands

the     road was almost       impassable,     so myself and Police Constable                156 Main

briefly joined two other mounted officers, who I don't know, and attempted
to keep the fans on the footpaths but this was almost impossible.                                    A further

disturbance of fighting occurred on the bridge where we assisted in their

dispersal, again traffic was brought to a halt.                              Two fans were detained by

foot   officers.         We       again retained        the    flow of traffic.             What had a few

minutes    earlier      seemed        to be       a carnival kind of atmosphere,                   was   rapidly

becoming      electric        and    very     hostile        with    evil    looks    together      with    vile

obscene comments coming from the passing fans objecting to our presence.

At    approximately       2.45       pm,    an    assistance         call   was    made    from    my mounted

colleagues for any mounted assistance to the Leppings Lane turnstiles.                                        At

this point I was positioned at the corner of the Bridge, approximately 15 to

20 yards away from the C Gate Terrace turnstiles.                             I saw that the whole area

from the turnstiles outwards was a solid block of people stretching out into

Leppings Lane.          The whole area seemed to be blocked with no movement through

the    turnstiles.            I     saw    many    fans      climbing       over    the    walls    above    the

turnstiles into the ground.                   I saw Inspector H Davis who was nearest to me

completely      surrounded           by    the     crowd,      his    horse       having   difficulties       in

standing due to the weights of people pushing around him.                                    I saw my other

colleagues     at the turnstiles also surrounded tightly packed by supporters

pushing    their   horses           backwards.         It was       a frightening sight,            a crowd of

thousands     frantically pushing forwards which seemed to be easily knocking

half a ton of horse off its feet.

Inspector Davis beckoned for myself and Police Constable 156 Main to join

him,    but   as   we    tried       to do        so   the    crowd were      pushing      so     tightly   they

physically prevented our access into the crowd by purposely pushing at the

horses chests.          I then noticed that a Police Land Rover had arrived and the

driver wished to get the vehicle                       into the crowd in order to appeal to the
crowd over the loud speaker system.             We again tried to   get our horses into

the crowd appealing to people to stop pushing             and allow the vehicle in, but

out attempts were hopeless.          It appeared to me that this crowd had made a

determined     and   concerted effort      to   prevent   any    Police     control of    the

situation along      with a definite intention to force          entry into the ground.

The crowd were at a complete standstill refusing to move and it was not safe

to force the "bottle neck situation".             Because of the noise of the crowd,

the loud speaker announcements had no effect.             I continually shouted to the

fans to stop pushing forwards as people were being crushed at the front, few

took notice - others pushed even more.              I could see that the situation at

the front of the turnstiles was at danger level - that there would be fatal

injuries     if the pressure     of the crowd was not released,           the only way of

doing this was to release pressure at the front.

All of a sudden this happened after having heard shouts "open the gates".                   I

never   saw which gates      had been opened,       only the extreme right metal iron

gates   being shut some      10 yards in front of the turnstiles of the C Gate

area.   A gap then appeared in the crowd in front of the Land Rover                where I

finally managed      to ride my     horse through and joinedInspector Davis and the

other   mounted officers.        We were then instructed to form a cordon of horses

nose    to    tail   acrossthe    entire   length    of   the   reception       area     which

effectively     stopped any further access to the whole entrance area.                   This

then gave opportunity for the fans already at the front              of the turnstile to

get through safely without pushing.             Even once the cordon was       formed many

fans tried to get through the horses by slapping them on the head and flanks

and pulling on the reins.         It was a very hostile situation, we each did our

best to calm the fans.         I was under the impression that a delayed kick off
was being requested over the radio.                  This I shouted to the fans that the

game was going to be delayed 30 minutes.                  This seemed to calm many fans, but

then a large cheer was heard from inside the ground which I assumed the

match was underway.           The    fans became      frantic again pushing violently and

shouting obscene remarks, furious at being delayed further.

I was     positioned   at     this    time    in    front    of the Land Rover         with    Police

Sergeant    Smith   to my right        and another Merseyside Officer                on a chestnut

horse to my left.       The cordon was broken a couple of horses behind me due to

the resulting crowd pressure and a large group surged through the gap.                             We

regained control of the situation, then faced the crowd and allowed them to

filter    through    steadily       between   the    horses.       The   atmosphere     had    calmed

somewhat though I continually requested that they stopped pushing as they

were only causing injury to their own fans.                   Very few took notice.           A radio

message was then received of a possible pitch invasion, a group of mounted

officers were detailed by Inspector                 Davis     for this   and moved off to the

Penistone Road entrance             to the pitch.         Another group of mounted officers

dispersed the remaining crowd of youths on the bridge area - who I assumed

to   be    the   non-ticket    holders.        I    was     then   detailed    to    Penistone   Road

together     with   other   Merseyside        and   Nottingham      officers    to    standby.     On

reaching Penistone Road, as a result of radio messages, I heard of the vast

number of fatalities inside the ground from the West Stand.

On receipt of announcement of match abandoned, I was instructed by Inspector

Davis to resume patrol of Penistone Road Area Coach Parks, etc,                          in company

with Police Constable 156 Main.                Approximate time being 4.30 pm.                Some 10

minutes later radio call requesting assistance in Hillsborough Park, fight

taking place.        Attended by myself,            Police Constable 156, Police Constable

2472 Wheatcroft and 1498 Swain.                  Saw approximately 20 youths throwing glass

bottles, cans and 4 foot lengths of wood towards to Panda patrol officers.

Youths were dispersed and detained by van crew.                            Further report of fighting

in Middlewood Road, Hillsborough Park.                           All area searched, no trace.          Normal

patrol resumed until ordered to stand down from control - time not known.

OBSERVATIONS

This record is made of a sort of moving picture.                              I started duty as stated,

but the following times are approximate, as during the whole period I made

little      reference        to my    watch,    especially after the              arrival     of the train

escort at 2.20 pm.

Hundreds of fans were seen to be drinking out of beer cans.                                   Many of them

seemed to be well affected by drink certainly within the                                  last 30 minutes

before commencement of the match.

Although I have previously not worked on Mounted Duties on a semi-final at

the       ground before,       I have,       however,       worked many large crowd 1st Division

games       at   this      ground    in my    9 years            of mounted    service.       I have    never

experienced such a hostile crowd, nor a crowd of such capacity arriving at

the       ground      so   late.      The    general    demeanour         of   many    fans   can   only   be

described        as     extremely     hostile    and    full        of hate    of the Police Force          in

general.           I    have   also    never    noticed           the   process   of   fans    through     the

turnstiles to be so slow.

I must        stress          that    the       gates    opened           allows       fans       into    the    North       Stand

not     the    Leppings             Lane    terrace.




The     gates       were       only       open    for a       very        short    time         - seconds        not       minutes.




The     people       that       had       come    in w e r e     very       abusive            saying     they       should       have

been     opened          a    lot    sooner.           Many    were        in the       wrong          section       and    were

asking        to    be       transfered.



1 then        got    second          information           that       there       was      a    pitch     invasion          and    we

were     to    go    to       the    perimeter          t ra c k .




We    made     our       way    from       the L e p p i n g s       Lane    end       via      the     uncovered          seats       in

the     South Stand             to    the       perimeter        track.           As    we      were     going       down    the

gangway        to    the       p i t c h we      received a           great       d ea l       of a b u s e    from    the    crowd.

I'm     not      su r e       which       fans       were    in t h i s         section.               A1though          I refer            to we

I was       not       sure      who       I was       w i th .



Al l    serials           were       mixed          into    one     at      this       po i n t .




Once      on     the      track          edge       I heard        the      command,           'Stop         the    match!'             (3 . 0 5 p m )

( 15 0 5) .          There      were          already       a number            of     Police          on    the    pitch          e dg e

behind          the    goal.             Fans       were    climbing            over        the     fence         helped          by P o l i c e .

I went          to a s s i s t .          There       were       people         crushed           against          the       fence.          They

were      on     eye-level               with       myself       which       would          not     normally            be    the       case.        I

later       found         this       was       because       they        were        stood        on    other       bodies.               People

were      starting             to    turn       blue       and     I could           se e    some       were       dead already.




I tried          to    help         people          over    the     top      of      the     fence          but    the       small        spikes

on     top made           this       difficult.              There          were       people          trampling             on    heads       to

get     out.          I tried            to    pull    people          from       the       exit       doors       in    the       fence.

People          were      trapped             and    the    force        behind         them made             this       very        difficult

especially             as      some       were       injured.




By     t h is    t i me       fans       had    been       pulled        ou t     and were             lying       injured           on     the

fringe          of    the      pitch          being    given        first         aid       or m o u t h      to m o u t h .




                                     fence          were    no w h e r e        near        big     enough.             I then assisted

other      Police             and    fans       in a c t u a l l y       ripping            part       of    the    wire          mesh      fence

d own.          Everybody            was       running       about          in a da;;e at               this       time       and       1 c a n ’t

There      was        a stream            of    bodies       coming          from       the       terrace          both       conscious

and     unconscious.                     I then       tried       to     assist         in m o u t h         to    mouth          and     heart

had    been       moved       there        was      a    pile     of    shoes.




After       the     pitch and              terrace        were       cleared           there       was        a    sort        of    lim bo .          I

A number          of L i v e r p o o l       fans        were     shouting             abuse       at    the        Officers            on      the

some     fans      on    the      pitch.           A     few were trying                 to       g o a d us        by    calling          us

cannot       be     certain          of     this.         I grabbed              some     middle         aged            man    who     tried

90   FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
     Further to minute 88 of 2 November 1990, the Authority gave further
     consideration to its previous decision not to provide financial support to
     the six officers at the Coroner's inquests in connection with the
     Hillsborough disaster. The Clerk and Financial Officer submitted new
     information received from the solicitors acting for Chief Superintendent
     Duckenfield together with a note of a pre-inquest review held by the
     Coroner on 30 October 1990.
     The legal representatives of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and the
     Superintendents Association and the Police Federation made submissions to
     the Authority.
     RESOLVED - That the decision of the Authority on 2 November (Minute 88) be
     re-affirmed and if events at the Corner's Inquests show that such
     assistance should be granted the Authority consider the applications
     retrospectively.

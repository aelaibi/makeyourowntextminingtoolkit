               I am a single man and I live at the above address^with my girlfriend.

               years and I have travelled to numerous home and away games.

               On Friday,             14th April 1989 (140489) I went to the ^nfield ground and

               purchased a ticket for the FA cup semi-final between Liverpool and

               Nottingham Forest.                   The ticket cost me £12 (TWELVE POUND) and

               it was for the West Stand.• -

                        had hired a car for the journey to Hillsborough.

         We travelled to Sheffield without any problems and we arrived in

         Sheffield at about 11.15 am.

                        parked the car near to what looked like a police compound

         for police cars.

         Near to where we left the car was a cafe which we went into and

         played pool.       Inside the cafe were^^Sther Liverpool supporters, and

         whilst I was in the cafe 1 swapped m>^Jt>rRet first for the North Stand

         We left the cafe at about midday and arrived at the ground at about
A fc S c O 1215pm (1215).    On arrival at the ground we stayed around the Leppings

         Lane area going to the chip shop.          We finally sat on a wall opposite

         the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground.           At about 2.30pm <1430)

         more people had started to gather at the ground entrance and at this

         time I swapped my ticket again for the terraces.            I can* t say how many

         people were actually outside the turnstiles trying to get in but it

         was worse trying to get in than at Anfield.           At the time of going

         tjhrouqh the turnstiles I could see a policeman on each of the

         turnstiles and also two policemen on horses, but I could not see any

         match stewards.      Once we got through the turnstiles we all went and

         stood at the entrance of the tunnel facing towards the turnstiles and

         the gate.
                                        <^JULr\CKJuO t^
         I saw people coming over t,ne top of the turnstile's and the pfeA i ce

         were opening the gate and throwing them back out again.               On the third

         occasion that the gate was opened about 100 people got into the

         ground before the gate could be closed.          The four of us then went

         down the tunnel to the terraces because the match was due to start.

         We had no problem getting down the tunnel but when we got to the

         terraces I could see that the terraces were packed.            At the end of the

         tunnel we went into the right ha ad ^A iijdl e / aa f the terraces.
                                       hapfl                                   We all then

         went to the front of the terraces, and I would say that I was about

six people away from the fencing behind the goal.

 I noticed when something was wrong when I saw that a girl in front of

me was in trouble, and I saw a policeman who was standing in front of

us the other side of the fence,      I shouted to him to get her out, but"

the girl said that she would be alright.        It was at this point that

              asked me if I was alright I told him I d idn't feel too good

so all four of us tried to get out but we couldn’t turn around to get

out we were penned in with other people, and the crush started to get

heavier and heavier and I started having problems breathing.          At this

 time my feet were off the floor and I could only see my mate

          He was trying to hold on to me because he was slipping down

 to the floor he was having problems breathing.       I could not see my

other mates but I could hear them talking y ' I could hear that they

were pani eking.      I could see one polijy^man standi ng by the gate to

  he terraces we shouted for him to open the gate.       The gate was

and about ^T>^eople^w^i^g//^et out and then the gate was closed by

 other poli'eemen.

« I could see about 15 people by me who to me 1 could see were dying but

there was nothing I could do to help them.         At one point

 I became unconcious and when I regained eonciousness I was lyi ng

down with other people lying around m e .                 helped me out of

the bodies I was facing towards the West Stand which meant I had

turned around.       I then ran up the terrace and out through the tunnel

and once outside the tunnel I col lapsed breathing for air.       I waited

with       for         and       to join us, we waited for about twenty

minutes and           came running up the tunnel, he asked us where            was

and we told him that he was alright that he had gotten to the pitch.             I

 could see also/iee that thtre were about 30~4CL^olicemen in front of

the turnstiles but njyre of them came over to p *rTp I don't think they

 realised what was going on.      We then went with       to get into the
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 S347

         West Stand so that we could see that         was alright but the four

         policemen wouldn’t let us in there.

         We then went back to the area by the tunnel and I could see people

         being carried and dragged out of the tunnel.

         Myself and         left the ground to go to the car and an the

         way a woman let us into her house, she let us use the phone to phone

         Liverpool,    but we couldn’t get through.

         We then went to the car but            and   w a s n ’t there so we went

         back to the ground.     On the way back to the ground we met               We

         tried to find         at the ground but we couldn’t find him.     We

         decided to go back to the car again and we found     ^     waiting there.

         We all got into the car and made our way back to Liverpool.

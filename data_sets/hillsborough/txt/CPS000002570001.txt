     RE:     HILLSBORO UG H TRAGEDY

      1      I understand from George Croston that you have asked him through Penny that he
              complete his latest review by tomorrow.

     2       George is working flat out in any event to complete his further review as quickly as
             possible. He is aware the Director requires the further information before she can
             make a decision.

     3       However as things stand it is unlikely that he will have finished and be in a position
             to submit a briefing note by tomorrow.

     4       As the Director stated in the video conference, she wishes to ensure that if, or more
             likely when, someone comes to look at the file in the future, it would be obvious that
             no stone was left unturned and the reasoning behind any decision will be clearly set
             out.

     5       As part of this process, Mr. Croston has asked for certain additional information from
             the police. Not all of what he requires has yet been supplied.

     6       Furthermore, we have been receiving a steady amount of correspondence from the
              Hillsborough Family Support Group, making certain requests and raising certain
             points. Where they have made assertions, they have been asked to back this up.

     7       We have today received a further note from the HFSG drawing attention to certain
             passages in the transcripts of the Inquest Evidence which they claim support their
             contention concerning the quality of the videos shown to the Inquest and to the
             availability of certain video evidence generally.

     8       In accordance with the Director’s requirements, we shall have to check this out.

     9       Also as part of this process, Mr. Croston has requested the police to supply a full list
              of all the material made available to the Taylor Enquiry. That list is still awaited.


     MMS/250.97
24/04 '97    16:40     S                             CPS 4th floor                                     @002




     10      Certain assertions have been made to Mr. Croston by the Coroner concerning the
             availability of the enquiry material to the Inquest, namely that it was all made
             available and was kept in an adjacent room for reference if required. Mr. Croston
             awaits written confirmation of this.

     11      Again having regard to the Director’s concern, we must have confirmation in writing
             of any such assertions made.

     12      In this context, it should also be borne in mind that the Coroner has informed
              M r.Croston that there is a full set of video tapes of the Inquest.

     13      It has now been ascertained that the Police have a set of these video tapes. They are
              making copies of the relevant parts and will be supplying these to us in due course.

     14      Having regard to the above outstanding enquiries and the Director’s primary concern
              that the decision when made is upon all material which might possibly be relevant and
              that the CPS should be able to demonstrate beyond all doubt on the face of the
              documents that every avenue which may in any way have a bearing upon the concerns
              of the HFSG has been explored to the very end, it is most unlikely that we shall be
              in a position to give the definitive answer which the Director requires by tomorrow.

     15      I do not need to state that this matter is being given the utmost priority and that we
              are desirous of bringing it to a conclusion at the earliest opportunity. However,
              bearing in mind how long this matter has in one form or another dragged on (by
              which I mean the continuing concerns of HFSG and others generally). I agree
              entirely with the Director’s sentiments that it is better that we should take a little
              longer to reach a decision in order to ensure that everything has been done by us
              which possibly could be done.

           Further to my letter earlier today. I enclose a copy of a letter received from Mr

           comments the CPS may have. Once we have an agreed text. I would envisage
           the Attorney General using it for similar letters we have from David Alton MP
           and Ms Diana Maddock MP. You may wish to consider using it as the basis
           of a reply from the Director to those MPs who write to her. Any such letters
           will of course be confined to CPS issues but the line needs to be consistent
           with what the Attorney General is saying.

          Dennis Skinner Esq MP
          House of Commons
          LONDON SW1AOAA

              January 1997




          Thank you for your letter of 16 January 1997 enclosing a letter you have
          received from Mr P Hammond, Secretary of the Hillsborough Family Support
          Group, of                                               ¥ou invited my comments
          with particular reference to (11).


          I have the deepest sympathy for the families involved in the tragic events which
          took place at Hillsborough and fully understand the concerns raised by the
          recent programme. The Home Secretary, when he spoke in the adjournment
          debate on this topic on 17 December made the point that any decisions which
          have to be taken must be on the basis of consideration of all the relevant facts
          and underlying evidence, rather than simply on the basis of the television
          programme itself. He said that in particular the Home Office would consider
          whether there is any new evidence, and if so. whether that evidence is of such
          significance that had it been put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner,
          either the outcome of the Taylor enquiry or the verdict of the jury would have
          been different.


         My main role in the events u/hirh

         I have a further interest in this matter because of my statutory duty to

         the Director has also asked to be kept infomied of the enquiries being made
         by the Home Office so that she may consider, in the light thereof, whether any
         further action may be required on her part. You will recall that the issue of
         criminal liability was very fully considered at an early stage on the basis of the
        evidence disclosed by the Taylor Report and the investigation undertaken by
        the West Midlands police.

    Liverpool City Council, at an extraordinary meeting held on 19th December 1996, have already
    pledged their unanimous support to the families in our campaign. With the assistance of the City
    Council, the campaign is now being taken out across the country where it is our intention to seek
    the support of local authorities in ail areas of Britain in response to the massive public disquiet
    which has emanated from the television programme ( the "Daily Mirror", for example, has
    received a huge response to the petition it launched in December, on behalf of the families,
    supporting the call for a new inquest into the Disaster.) The response to the programme dearly
    indicates this is a matter of public intrest and should be dealt with accordingly.


    The Bereaved families of Hillsborough will forever be in debt to writer Jimmy McGovern and to
    Granada Television for bringing the tale of our fight for justice into the homes and consciences of
    the British people. However, in some ways the story told on television could not truly reflect the
    scale of what we have been made to endure by having the absolute grief of losing our loved ones
    compounded by what can only be described as the biggest farce and cover up in British legal
     history. As if this was not enough of a burden, the families, despite the unequivocal findings of the
    Taylor inquiry, have also had to fight to counter a concerted and seemingly intentional campaign
     by certain public and media figures to scar the reputation and memories of our loved ones by
     blaming them, and their fellow supporters, for causing the Disaster.


    The " Hillsborough " television programme seems at last to have washed away the cartload of ties
     about the Disaster which have stood as a barrier to the reaching of a fair and just conclusion
    about the needless deaths of 96 people. On behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group I
    would now urge you to help us go one step further and establish as a matter of public record for
    al! time the truth of what did happen on that dreadful day of 15th April 1989. Only if that can be
    done may the bereaved families be able to put our loved ones finally to rest.


    Yours faithfully

          HILLSBOROUGH

          We spoke yesterday afternoon about the Parliamentary correspondence the
          CPS has received, based on the letter circulated by the Hillsborough Family
          Support Group to all Members of Parliament. We agreed that this would need
          careful and co-ordinated handling.

          The Home Office and LSLO have each received extensive correspondence from
          families affected by the Hillsborough disaster which have hitherto focused
          either on demands for a fresh public inquiry or the reopening of the inquest,
          of both. Our line has been to draw on what the Home Secretary said in the
          House of Commons on 17 December 1996 when responding to an adjournment
          debate. He made the point that any decisions which have to be taken must be
          on the basis of consideration of all the relevant facts and underlying evidence,
          rather than simply on the basis of the television programme itself. He also
          said that in particular the Home Office would consider whether there is any
          new evidence, and if so, whether that evidence is of such significance that had
          it been put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome of the
          Taylor Inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

          I enclose a specimen of a typical letter which we have written. We do not, at
          present, consider that anything in the programme materially affects the
          applications which the Attorney General has already considered under Section
          13 of the Crimes Act 1988, but have in place arrangements so that we are
          informed of any new evidence which can then be considered.




          SW /2201/4
The correspondence from HFSG opens a new angle on this by calling on the
DPP to request a further criminal investigation. Since we spoke, I have been
in touch with Paul Pugh in the Police Policy Directorate, who informs me that
the South Yorkshire Police have undertaken to report to the Home Secretary
by the end of January on the issues raised by the programme. That will, in
particular, include clarification about the point whether the film from the video
camera trained on the central enclosure was available to the Taylor Inquiry.
I enclose, for each of reference, a copy of Paul Pugh’s letter of 20 December
 1996 to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire.

You may feel that it would also be appropriate for the CPS to adopt a similar
stance indicating that it will consider whether any further action may be
appropriate on its part once the results of the enquiries by the Home Office are
to hand. That would not, of course, preclude the CPS from asking for further
or wider enquiries at that stage. As to co-ordination, Paul Pugh thought there
would be no difficulty in making the results of the South Yorkshire enquiries
available to the CPS and LSLO. We felt that, assuming the report is received
in early February, we should look to a meeting between ourselves, the Home
Office and CPS in mid-February. Whilst each Department must form its own
judgment in relation to the discharge of its own duties, it is equally important
that there is a coherent and co-ordinated response.

I shall be revising our model letter to take account of the additional points
made in the HFSG circular and will fax that to you as soon as possible.

HILLSBOROUGH

As  you will be aware,      following the Granada programme,
Hillsborough, a number of representations were made to the Home
Secretary calling on him to reopen the public inquiry into the
disaster. Whilst the Home Secretary emphasised that he would not
take a decision to reopen the inquiry lightly and would need to
be convinced that it would be in the public interest to do so,
he, nonetheless, made a commitment in the House of Commons
carefully to consider the issues raised.

In coming to his decision the Home Secretary is particularly
anxious to establish whether any new evidence has emerged. I
would therefore be grateful for your views on this matter in
relation to the ten points raised by the programme which I
attach. It would also be helpful if we could have clarification
on the point about whether the film from the video camera trained
on the central enclosure was available to the Taylor inquiry. The
programme makers have specifically alleged that the Taylor
inquiry was told that the camera was not working, when this was
not the case; I would be grateful for your comments on this
particular point. I understand that the film is available and it
would be helpful if we could receive a copy and of any transcript
of the film which the Taylor inquiry may have received.

Whilst the Home Secretary does not have the power to reopen the
inquest - that is a matter for the High Court on the advice of
the Attorney General - the relatives have expressed continuing
anger that the Coroner imposed a 3.15pm cut off point after which
he would not take any evidence. Whether this was the correct
course might have a bearing on the Home Secretary's decision. T
would also be grateful therefore to receive any relevant
information you might have on this matter. I understand that the
issues will be investigated by the Complaints and Discipline
Department who have already indicated to us that they could
provide a full report by the end of January.

                       IHE. HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER;

                        TEN UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS


ONE

Why was Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield put in charge of a major semi-ftnal
only 21 days before the game, when he was relatively inexperienced at poticing
football matches?

TW O

Why were there no barriers or cordons to filter the crowd and prevent a buitd up
outside the Leppings Lane end of the ground if, as the fans insist, there were the
previous year?

THREE

Why was the game not delayed, as a number of police officers thought it should have
been, when it became obvious that it would not be possible to get all the Liverpool
fans safety into the ground before the 3pm kick-off^

FOUR

Why didn’t police recognise overcrowding on the Leppings Lane terrace when eye
witnesses, including football commentator John Motsort, were aware of the problems
fifteen minutes before kick-off?

FIVE

Why wasn’t the runnel leading to the central pens closed when they became full, the
procedure adopted at the previous year’s semi-final?

 SIX

 Why did Chief Superintendent Duckenfield mistead the Secretary of the FA by telling
 him that fans had forced open Gate C, when the officer knew he had given the order
 for it to be opened?

 SEVEN

 Why did it take half an hour after the first crushing began to pull down the 10 foot
 spiked fence which trapped the fans, and why were the gates which led on to the pitch
 too small to be effective in an emergency evacuation?
                                                                                          P. 4   4
              37    It-32 HO F2 DIVISION 0171 273 2703
12 Jh M




          EIG H T

          Why was no public address announcement made - either informing the fans as to what
          was happening, asking for their help or for any medical personnel at the ground to
          help - until 3.30pm?

          NINE

          Why, when 42 ambulances reached the ground, did more not get on to the pitch where
          the dying and severely injured were in urgent need of trained medical help?

          TEN

          Why did only 14 of those who died get to hospital?
Mr and Mrs K Clark




17 January 1997




Dear Mr and Mrs Clark

The Attorney General has asked me to thank you for your letter of 9 January
and to reply. He has the deepest sympathy for yourself and all the families
involved in the tragic events which took place at Hillsborough and fully
understands the concerns raised by the recent programme. Your letter
suggested re-examination of the circumstances although you did not indicate
whether you had in mind a further public inquiry or the seeking of an order for
a fresh inquest.

In considering the question insofar as the inquest is concerned the Attorney
General has in mind the points made in the House of Commons in a debate on
this topic on 17 December and what the Home Secretary said in response. He
made the point that any decisions which have to be taken must be on the
basis of consideration of all the relevant facts and underlying evidence rather
than simply on the basis of the television programme itself. He said that in
particular the Home Office would consider whether there is any new evidence,
and if so, whether that evidence is of such significance that had it been put
before Lord Taylor or before the Coroner, either the outcome of the Taylor
Enquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

The main role of the Attorney General in the events which have followed the
Hillsborough disaster has arisen from his responsibilities under Section 13 of
the Coroners Act 1988. He has previously considered several applications for
consent to the making of an application to the High Court for an order
directing the holding of a fresh inquest. In each case he concluded that the
matters put forward did not establish that there was a realistic prospect of the
High Court granting such an order. Indeed, very similar issues have been
canvassed in unsuccessful judicial review applications.
There does not appear to be anything in the programme which materially
affects the applications which the Attorney General has already considered.
Officials here are however in touch with the Home Office to ensure that the
Attorney General is informed of any new evidence which may emerge and is
relevant to his responsibilities under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988.

At present, and while the Attorney awaits the views of the Home Secretary,
there is nothing that can be added to what has already been said by him in the
House. The Attorney will have close regard to any points the Home Office may
put to him as to the desirability of any further inquest. In addition, any
application based upon further evidence would be considered carefully in the
usual way but as I have indicated, the programme is not of itself evidence.

Yours sincerely

      RE:    T H E "HILLSBO ROU GH DISASTER"


       1.    I have been contacted by Ms Sue McDougall, Home Office (tel 273-2621) who
             requires some comment from the CPS regarding the Hillsborough football stadium
             disaster. I re-call that Michael Kennedy, when on Police Complaints Division, was
             allocated the matter; I am not sure who now has responsibility for it.

       2.    On 5 December 1996 a documentary programme was broadcast which purported to
             raise new evidence/issues about the matter. The families of the victims are pressing
             for a re-opening of the inquest with a view to obtaining an "unlawful killing" verdict.
             In response to the programme the Home Secretary undertook to Parliament to re-visit
             the matter. Sue McDougall is doing the work on this.

       3.    Her initial inquiry, which I have dealt with, was about when (if ever) we re-review
             cases we have previously decided not to prosecute. I read to her (and fax’d her a
             copy) of the Code, para. 10 "Re-starting a prosecution". She was interested to know
             how significant an inquest verdict was to our review of cases. I indicated that they
             were not conclusive/decisive: we have to look at the evidence. I mentioned that there
             have been ‘death in police custody’ cases which resulted in unlawful killing inquest
             verdicts but no prosecution.

                        TEN UNRESOLVED p y ESTfONS


ONE

Why was Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield put in charge of a major semi-final
only 21 days before the game, when he was relatively inexperienced at policing
football matches?

TW O

Why were there no barriers or cordons to filter the crowd and prevent a build up
outside the Leppings Lane end of the ground if, as the fans insist, there were the
previous year?

THREE

Why was the game not delayed, as a number of police officers thought it should have
been, when it became obvious that it would not be possible to get all the Liverpool
fans safety into the ground before the 3pm kick-off*

FOUR

Why didn’t police recognise overcrowding on the Leppings Lane terrace when eye
witnesses, including football commentator John Motson, were aware of the problems
fifteen minutes before kick-off?

FIVE

Why w asn't the tunnel leading to the central pens closed when they became full, the
procedure adopted at the previous year’s semi-final?

SIX

Why did Chief Superintendent Duckenfield mislead che Secretary of the F a by celling
him that fans had forced open Gate C, when the officer knew he had given the order
for it to be opened?

SEVEN

Why did it take half an hour after the first crushing began to pull down the 10 foot
spiked fence which trapped the fans, and why were the gates which led on to the pitch
too small to be effective in an emergency evacuation?

EIGH T

Why was no public address announcement made - either informing the fans as to what
was happening, asking for their help or for any medical personnel at the ground to
help - until 3.30pm?

NINE

Why, when 42 ambulances reached the ground, did more not get on to the pitch where
the dying and severely injured were in urgent need of trained medical help?

 TEN

 Why did only 14 of those who died get to hospital?

     RE:      HILLSBOROUGH


     Thank you for your letter of the 23rd January 1997 and enclosures which we received by fax
     yesterday and through the post this morning. Your observations and the specimen letter will
     be most useful to us.

     We are preparing a briefing for the Director and once she has replied to David Alton MP,
     I will let you have a copy of her letter for your information. We shall then also write to the
     various private correspondents in similar terms.

  Subject of course to any instructions I receive from the Director, I agree, as we discussed
  earlier that it would be better for us at the moment to await the results of the enquiries
  instigated by the Home Office. I can confirm that it would be of great assistance to us if we
  could meet with the Home Office and yourselves once this information is available.

  I look forward to receiving your revised model letter in due course.

1        BACKGROUND

          1.1    In early December 1996, Granada TV screened a drama-documentary
                 programme concerning the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. It has since been
                 said by the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG) in a letter of the 4th
                 March 1997 that the pre-production research for the programme and its
                 subsequent airing has brought to light fresh evidence and/or new witnesses
                 proving that suppression of evidence, perjury and conspiracy to pervert the
                 course of justice featured in the legal process that followed the disaster. In
                 addition letters have been received from the families of some of the deceased
                 requesting re-examination of the circumstances of the tragic events. As a
                 result of the above, internal correspondence has been generated between the
                 South Yorkshire Police, the Home Office, the Legal Secretariat to the Law
                 Officers (LSLO) and the CPS. A letter of 23/1/97 from Stephen Wooler of
                 the LSLO to Peter Pearson at Central Casework, York stated that at present
                 there was nothing in the television programme that materially affects the
                 applications (for consent to apply to a High Court Judge for an order directing
                 the hold of a fresh inquest) which the Attorney General had already
                 considered. In each of those cases it was concluded that there was not a
                 realistic prospect of the high Court granting such an order. In addition the
                 television programme itself was not evidence.

         1.2     On the 4th March 1997, Ms Anne Adlington, a solicitor representing the
                 HFSG wrote to the Director enclosing a bundle of documents and counsel’s
                 opinion. A fax was then received from Trevor Hicks, the chairman of the
                 HFSG, with his copy letter making allegations of the suppression of evidence
                 etc. as noted above. It was supported by a draft statement. Both this
                 statement and counsel’s opinion contained representations as to what should
                 happen now on the basis of the ‘new evidence’. A request was made for a
                 meeting with a senior CPS lawyer. The correspondence was acknowledged
                 by the Director’s office stating that a substantive reply would be provided
                 when the contents of the reports had been considered.

         1.3     The LSLO had considered it to be important that while each of the various
                 Government Departments must form their own judgement in relation to the
                 discharge of their own duties, it was equally important that there was a co­
                 herent and co-ordinated response to the representations made. Accordingly
                 on the 10th March 1997 a meeting was held at the Home Office with
                 representatives of their Police Policy Directorate (PPD), of the LSLO and of
                 CPS Central Casework. It was decided that each of the three groups should
                 report back to the PPD having conducted separate reviews of the allegations
                 made by Mr. Trevor Hicks and Alun Jones QC.

         1.4     On the 13th March 1997 the reviewing lawyer had a full day’s conference

                                                3
                 with Chief Superintendent Lowe and D.C. Greenaway of South Yorkshire
                 Police at their offices in Sheffield. Original video tapes exhibited to the
                 Taylor enquiry and to the Coroner’s Hearing were viewed and access was
                 made to the transcripts of those hearings and to original witness statements.

          1.5    On the 1st April 1997 the Daily Mirror printed a report on Hillsborough. It
                 included an erroneous comment that the CPS had said "the nature and
                 volume" of the new evidence had forced it to re-open the enquiry into the
                 crush that killed the 95 Liverpool fans. The nature of this report was indeed
                 much of the earlier correspondence from the HFSG being made public.

          1.6    On the same day South Yorkshire Police issued a statement in response to the
                 press report to the effect that there was no new evidence.

          1.7    On the 7th April, a letter from Miss Adlington drew CPS Central Casework
                 attention to points made in the police statement and the HFSG rebuttal of
                 them. A reply was made to the effect that a fall response could not be given
                 within 14 days of the previous acknowledgement from the CPS, but the matter
                 was receiving immediate consideration.

2        NEW EVIDENCE

         2.1     The new evidence is said to be:-

                 2.1.1   A video tape of footage from the scoreboard camera, known as camera
                         5, of the Leppings Lane Terraces area where the deaths occurred.

                 2.1.2 An affidavit (dated 25th November 1996) and statement (dated 11th
                       May 1989) of a Roger Houldsworth, the engineer responsible for the
                       design and maintenance of the Club and Police CCTV systems in
                       operation at Hillsborough Stadium. Exhibited to the affidavit are
                       comments on 13 points concerning the police evidence to the Taylor
                       enquiry and to the Coroner’s Inquest.

                 2.1.3   The statement of a Doctor Walker who volunteered his services at the
                         Northern General Hospital where many of the crush victims were
                         taken. He was involved in the resuscitation of the injured.

         2.2     This ‘new evidence’ will be considered in detail in parts 6 to 8 of this report.

3        ALLEGATIONS

         These are divided into two parts, those concerning the video evidence and those of
         the medical evidence. They have been made by Trevor Hicks, Alun Jones QC and
         Roger Houldsworth and will be considered in that order.


         Video Evidence -

         T revor Hicks says that:

         3.1     P .C .’s Ryan and Bichard perjured themselves in giving evidence of the
                 footage from camera 5 and the extent to which that camera could be used to
                 view the Leppings Lane terraces.

         3.2     The person who edited the inquest exhibit C278, known as the ‘compilation
                 video’, must have been aware of the extensive footage from camera 5 but this
                 footage was not produced despite several requests from the Inquest Jury.

         3.3     Had the footage been produced and shown to the Jury it would have totally
                 changed their view of what the police could see.

         Alun Jones QC says th at:-

         3.4     Video Tapes were deliberately suppressed and a number of officers committed
                 perjury.

         3.5     The evidence of Mr. Houldsworth was also deliberately suppressed.

         3.6     The HFSG have acquired from Yorkshire Television tapes which appear to be
                 those, or copies of those, taken away or stolen immediately after the disaster.

         3.7     A tape (containing footage from camera 5) indicates that police officers were
                 lying and that pictures of all relevant areas of the ground were clear, detailed
                 and uninterrupted, contrary to the police evidence referred to by Mr.
                 Houldsworth in his affidavit of November 1996. Events in the relevant area
                 (Leppings Lane Terraces) may not, for various reasons, have been recorded
                 on tape between 14.30 and 15.00 hours, but they were clearly visible on the
                 monitors to those on duty at the time.

         3.8     The Coroner had said that the assessment of the Terraces "may be the single
                 most important factor" or a "very important factor" which the Jury have to
                 weigh. The above evidence was not available in 1993 and yet it touched the
                 core issue before 15.15 hours, the cut off time. It would have been of crucial
                 significance to the High Court in 1993 as well as the Jury in 1991.

         Roger Houldsworth says that:

         3.9     At 0800 hrs. on the day of the disaster he had given all the cameras a final
                 check. There had been a problem with the score-board camera involving
                 flaring (picture white-out) due to an electrical fault when the score-board came
                 into use. There was no problem with the quality of the picture. By the time
                 he had finished his check, everything was working OK. P.C. Ryan came in
                 during this check and he would have shown both him and P.S. Goddard that
                 the cameras were working when he had finished. His 13 comments on the
                 police evidence are as follows:-

                 3.9.1   P.C. Ryan (who was in charge of telephones and public address system
                         in the police control box) says in his evidence to the Taylor Enquiry
                         re camera 5 that there was an apparent fault with it, the picture was
                         very distorted and was never satisfactory as far as he could recall, it
                         was not as clear as you would hope the picture to be and it was the
                         quality of that picture which was the problem.

                 RH:     The quality of the picture was never a problem, the flaring was fixed
                         by disconnecting the earth during the morning.


                 3.9.2 PS Goddard (who was in charge of the radios in the policecontrol
                       box) says in his evidence to the Taylor Enquiry that it was not possible
                       to tell from the control box that the pens three and four (the central
                       pens where the injuries occurred) were full and that at no stage before
                       he saw people climbing over the pens did he notice any over-crowding.

                 RH:     He was able to see what the police could see on their monitors and he
                         specifically remembers that when the order was given to open the gates
                         he could see pens three and four were full to the point of over­
                         crowding.


                 3.9.3 P.S. Goddard gave evidence of a blind spot down at the front of the
                       fencing whereby the first two rows of the Terrace were obstructed and
                       although you could see figures you would not be able to pick them out
                       individually.

                 RH:     Based on his knowledge of the control box the evidence did not make
                         any sense to him.


                 3.9.4 P.C. Bichard in his evidence to the Taylor Enquiry claimed, just like
                       P.C. Ryan, that there was a problem with the score-board camera
                       over-looking the Terraces (camera 5). He said that there had been
                       difficulty with that camera over a number of weeks; when the system
                       was switched on the picture would go white. It was thought to be a
MMS/246.97.V02
                                                7
                         problem with the electrical supply to the camera. On the day it was
                         not up to the mark but was a lot better than it had been. "We were
                         getting pictures, that is the best way of describing it." At the inquest
                         P.C. Bichard said that camera 5 had been faulty and you were getting
                         what was called flare, that is, a reflection of light and coloured objects
                         whereby the picture was lost. He went on to say that the camera was
                         not being used as much as it normally would be because of the sub­
                         standard picture. It was inadequate.

                 RH:     While P.C. Bichard gave an accurate description of what the problem
                         had been the engineer disagreed that the camera was not up to the
                         mark. As far as he was concerned the camera was working perfectly
                         after he had fixed it during the morning.


                 3.9.5   At the Inquest, P.C. Bichard gave his opinion that it was not possible
                         to get what he would call a "view" of the centre pens from any of the
                         cameras and agreed with a comment that it was not possible to zoom
                         in so that one could clearly identify a given individual and clearly see
                         facial features.

                 RH:     He considers that it is possible to pick out facial features with the
                         camera and says that this is borne out by the evidence of the families
                         and lawyers who went to the ground. He does agree that it would be
                         more difficult to pick out facial features while events are happening
                         but considers that this was not the specific question that PC Bichard
                         was asked and responded to.

                 3.9.6 P.C. Bichard in evidence to the Taylor enquiry said that because of the
                       position and angle of camera 5 it gave a false impression about the
                       crowd that was there. The picture created was a bit of an illusion
                       about the crowd that was in there. The position was that it was
                       difficult to assess that the pens would be getting over-crowded.

                 RH:     He did not consider that the above explanation made any sense at all.
                         He considers that there was a perceptive depth which would give an
                         indication of density and disagreed that it was difficult to assess that
                         the pens were getting over-crowded from the view of camera 5.


                 3.9.7 Again in his evidence to the Taylor enquiry P.C. Bichard said that
                       whilst the colour camera (camera 2) provided a better angled view of
                       the terraces it did not provide a close up picture as camera 5. The
                       zoom facility of the colour camera was not good enough to see
                       whether or not people were being crushed against the perimeter
                       fencing in pens 3 and 4. While the view enabled you to see the fence
                       you could not get a close up of the people there, that is, at best 30 or
                       40 heads and shoulders. At the inquest the officer said that the zoom

                         magnification of the colour camera was insufficient to create
                         identification.

                 RH:    He considers that the magnification of the colour camera, which was
                        designed for identification purposes was reasonable. He says that the
                        evidence of P.C. Bichard was contradictory and not altogether truthful.
                        You could certainly identify individuals with it as well as
                        distinguishing their clothing. A shot could give you six or seven heads
                        and shoulders depending on the crowd density.


                 3.9.8 During the Taylor enquiry P.C. Bichard describes the camera looking
                       down on Leppings Lane (camera 1) by saying "when you are using
                       your zoom facility the picture you are getting at the extreme is a rather
                       large and general one".

                 RH:    The camera had been replaced 6 months earlier and was so good that
                        a car number plate could be picked out at the end of Leppings Lane.


                 3.9.9 At the Taylor enquiry P.C. Bichard admitted that there was a video of
                       the situation on the west terraces, (Leppings Lane Terraces) from
                       about 14.30. The officer also claimed that of the two video recordings
                       that were made, one expired at just after 15.00. The mode of
                       operation of the other tape was altered inadvertently between 14.30
                       and 15.00 when the officer believed that his knee caught an operating
                       button changing the recording from continuous to time lapse (that is
                       two frames per second rather than the normal continuously moving
                       picture). At the inquest he said that he could offer no explanation of
                       why there was no video material available from camera 5 before
                       15.02. He admitted that it would have been recording before then.

                 RH:    He says that no pictures from camera 5 were ever made available to
                        the enquiry or to the Inquest. He considers that the buttons on the
                        video machines are so tiny that it is unlikely that the officer could have
                        knocked one with his knee and more importantly says that it is actually
                        impossible to flick a switch and go into time lapse mode as P.C.
                        Bichard claims, when the machine is already recording.


                 3.9.10 Later during the Inquest P.C. Bichard says that the video pictures of
                        the Leppings Lane Terraces that were shown to the Jury were greatly
                        enhanced. He agreed with the Coroner that the image seen by the Jury
                        was infinitely clearer. He also said that the pictures which the court
                        had seen running on a time lapse system were not running at the same
                        speed as they would have been seen on the monitor.

•
                     RH:   He disagrees with P.C. Bichard’s evidence in that the information
                           obtained from watching the 14" monitors in the Police Control Room
                           was exactly the same as that seen on a larger screen in Court. He also
                           says that the pictures shown to the Court were taken from Camera 5,
                           the allegedly faulty camera, and showed the Leppings Lane Terraces.
                           He states that you will only get a time and date imprinting on the
                           recording if things are recorded at normal speed.


                     3.9.11 Also at the Inquest, P.C. Bichard says that camera 3 (a camera with
                            the maximum zoom facility) was not trained onto the Leppings Lane
                            Terraces because of an incident at the other end. The camera would
                            not have been good enough to enable identification of individuals at the
                            front of the Terraces as it would give an overall picture only.

                     RH: The camera was extremely powerful and it would have been able to
                         give a very clear picture of the Leppings Lane Terraces. The Officer
                         contradicts himself about which location this camera was focused
                         upon.


                     3.9.12 P.C. Bichard told the Jury that the reason the pictures from camera 3
                            when it was re-trained onto the Leppings Lane Terraces did not
                            become part of the recording was as follows: "the system operated
                            where by 2.30 I should have replaced both tapes. Because of what
                            was happening on Leppings Lane I didn’t replace those tapes and
                            eventually it ran out after 3.00. The camera was used but it was not
                            taping".

                     RH:   He considers it very unusual for the police to have needed to have
                            replaced both tapes at 2.30. It would suggest that they had been
                            recording everything in real time since 11.30.


                     3.9.13 The evidence of Chief Inspector McRobbie (who was an observer in
                            the police control box) is that he was impressed by the zoom facilities
                            of camera 5. It was used to pick out someone directly beneath the
                            control box who had dropped his trousers. He says that the definition
                            was quite reasonable.

                     RH:   He says that this appears to be the same camera that P.C. Ryan
                           described as "never satisfactory". The Chief Inspector is directly
                           contradicting the evidence of his colleagues and goes on to say to the
                           Taylor enquiry that you could see quite clearly that Pen 3 was full but
                           that Pen 2 (one of the side pens) had got space.

         M edical Evidence

         3.10    Alun Jones QC says that in February 1997 the evidence of a Dr. Ed Walker
                 came to light (the doctor had been put in touch with the HFSG as a result of
                 the Granada broadcast and met Mr. and Mrs. P. Hammond). This new
                 material discloses that Philip Hammond Junior had sinus rhythm and cardiac
                 output after his arrival at the hospital. The Doctor’s evidence shows serious
                 criticism of the reaction to the disaster and that other victims were alive. It
                 conflicts with the evidence of Dr. Slater. Dr. Walker was not called at the
                 Inquest.

         3.11    In his opinion, Alun Jones goes on to say "it is difficult to exaggerate the
                 significance of the concealment of Dr. Walker’s evidence. At page 10 of the
                 Divisional Court’s Judgement, November 1993, the Court pointed to the
                 Coroner’s reason for the 3.15 cut off. In all cases, it was said, the evidence
                 disclosed the same pattern, of a rapid unconsciousness leading to rapid death.
                 Dr. Walker expressly disagrees, especially with Dr. Slater. He states that a
                 revealing remark was made by a senior hospital physician who said that
                 almost immediately his department was flooded with large numbers of acutely
                 ill patients requiring urgent resuscitation. However the whole inquest,
                 spanning over 90 days, was structured by the Coroner on an utterly different
                 factual assumption".

         3.12    The reviewing lawyer considers that the above opinion is intimating, as with
                 the video evidence, the suppression of material facts, namely that at least one
                 of the deceased (Philip Hammond) died after 15.15 and that this would have
                 affected the decisions made at the Taylor Enquiry, Coroner’s Hearings and
                 Judicial Review.

         3.13    In general Alun Jones considers that "one of the most striking aspects of this
                 history is the way in which the evidence presented to the Inquest was evidence
                 which tended to exculpate the South Yorkshire Authorities and the police from
                 blame. Very serious questions arise as to the process by which evidence was
                 selected by the West Midlands Police who assisted the Coroner".

4        H FSG REPRESENTATIONS

         4.1     The material provided to the CPS by the HFSG in support of their allegation
                 is composed of 8 volumes of papers and three video tapes. The index is
                 attached at Appendix 1. It has been fully considered during this review and
                 a copy can be made for the Director if required.

         4.2     The Crown Prosecution Service has been formally requested by Trevor
                 Hicks, Chairman of the HFSG, to examine the evidence and to initiate a full
                 and urgent criminal investigation into these matters. He states that all that has
                 ever been sought is a proper and even handed investigation into the events that
                 cost the lives of their loved ones. It is his belief that the footage from camera
                 5 between 12.00 and 15.23 hrs. has never been included in any police
                 compilation and/or other tapes that he had seen. In addition the footage
                 totally supported the position of Mr. Houldsworth.

         4.3     Alun Jones’ conclusions are that these new pieces of evidence called for a full
                 police enquiry or public enquiry, that exhibits such as the tapes must be
                 secured and subjected to Forensic Analysis by some independent body with
                 powers to investigate and compel the production of evidence, and that
                 witnesses must be identified.

         4.4     Following the South Yorkshire Police Statement of the 1st April 1997 in
                 response to the Daily Mirror report on Hillsborough, the HFSG issued their
                 own response on the 8th April. Full details of these rebuttals and counter­
                 rebuttals are contained within the relevant review section of this report.

JU D ICIA L REVIEW

5.1   The skeleton argument presented to the Divisional Court in the application for
      Judicial Review to quash the Inquest Verdicts of Accidental Death was
      concerned with the following main points:-

      5.1.1   In deciding the statutory question ‘how’ the Coroner breached the
              Coroner’s rules re the procedure to be followed in taking evidence.

      5.1.2 Because the Coroner imposed a cut-off time of 15.15, evidence in the
            possession of the Coroner and the police that four of the deceased were
            alive for a considerable time after sustaining injuries in the crush, was
            not adduced to the main inquest. There was a systematic failure by the
            Coroner to address the statutory questions of ‘who’, ‘when’, ‘where’
            and ‘how’. The Coroner had an apparent desire to establish rapid
            death. The imposition of this cut-off point was to prevent any further
            enquiry into the individual circumstances of the 95 deaths. Relevant
            witnesses were not called to give their controversial evidence.

      5.1.3   The Coroner was wrong to leave only the conclusions of unlawful
              killing, accidental death or an open verdict to the jury. He mis­
              directed the jury upon the elements of the offence of manslaughter.

5.2   The Divisional Court’s judgement was given on the 5th November 1993. The
      applicant’s abandonment of the point concerning the breach of the Coroner’s
      rules was accepted by the Court. They found that the Coroner had cut off the
      evidence at a reasonable and sustainable point bearing in mind the exhaustive
      public enquiry which had already been conducted by Taylor L. J. It was also
      a compassionate point from the aspect of the victim’s relatives. There was a
      sensible cut off point based on the plain and virtually unchallenged evidence
      of the pathologists as to when the deceased would have died. There was
      overwhelming medical evidence that death occurred by 15.15. The court were
      far from concluding that the Coroner wrongly exercised his discretion as to
      whom he should call to give evidence.

5.3   The Court’s conclusions were that the inquisition was correctly completed, the
      Coroner’s direction to the Jury was impeccable, and there was no good reason
      for ordering a new inquest. In fact the court queried the purpose of a fresh
      inquest. Criticism of the police had been firmly levelled by the Taylor Report
      and the police had admitted fault and paid compensation. It was doubted that
      more would be learned from the further examination of the last minutes of the
      lives of the deceased. It was accepted that the families were pursuing the
      matter because of their deep instinct to know the circumstances in which their
      relatives died but the objective view and considering the interest of all
      involved was that this was not a case for ordering fresh inquests.

5.4   The Court stated that the essential complaint made against the Coroner was
      that having introduced evidence from the various pathologists into the causes
                 and probable time-scale of the deaths, he proceeded to limit or exclude
                 evidence from the main inquest which might have led the Jury to form a
                 different conclusion. In fact the Coroner led further evidence that might have
                 persuaded pathologists to form different conclusions than those previously
                 expressed, as well as exploring in the presence of the Jury      an alternative
                 factual basis for the pathologists’ conclusions.

         5.5     It was said that there was clear evidence that bodily functions may continue
                 and give a semblance of life when the prior occurrence of brain death renders
                 the existence of life unlikely, if not impossible. The overwhelming burden of
                 evidence was that there was no prolongation of life beyond the period of about
                 10 minutes from the occurrence of the injury which lead to asphyxia.

6         REV IEW OF ALLEGATIONS: VIDEO EVIDENCE

          6.1     The allegations and comments made by Trevor Hicks, Alun Jones QC and
                  Roger Houldsworth are overlapping, but the only ‘new’ evidence comes from
                  the last named. The others take inferences from and make representations
                  about that particular evidence as well as evidence already heard at either the
                  Taylor Enquiry or the Coroner’s Hearing. In essence they are saying that
                  because the Jury or the Divisional Court did not have the benefit of Mr.
                  Houldsworth’s evidence nor of hearing argument on the proper inferences to
                  be made based on that evidence, there should be a full investigation leading
                  to a re-opening of the inquests or enquiry. They are also saying that the ‘new
                  evidence’ supports the allegation of the suppression of video evidence by the
                  police.

          6.2     On the 13th March 1997 I held a full day’s conference with Chief
                  Superintendent Lowe of South Yorkshire Police at his Sheffield office. I was
                  able to view original video tapes exhibited to the Taylor Enquiry and also
                  those shown at the Coroner’s Hearing. I had access to the transcripts of those
                  hearings and original witness statements which had not been exhibited but
                  were unused material. This report is concerned with 4 video tapes; TB/1 and
                  TB/2 which were exhibited to the Taylor Enquiry, the Coroner’s Exhibit C539
                  and the video recording that was generally known as the ‘compilation tape’.
                  TB/1 and TB/2 were the original tapes taken from the two police video
                  recorders in their control room above the Leppings Lane Terraces. There
                  were 5 television screens showing views from the 5 roving cameras fixed at
                  high points on the stands and directed both inside and outside the ground.
                  There was also a master screen which flicked in rotation from one camera
                  view to another and which made one of the two video recordings. A further
                  screen was connected to the second video recorder which could be switched
                  between the five main cameras as required by the operator. P.C. Bichard was
                  tasked with the operation of the video recorders as directed by his superior
                  officers. The tapes could record in two ways, that of continuous movement
                  or normal play, and of time-lapse where a different still frame was shown
                  every half second. This latter procedure gave a rather jerky sequence of
                  pictures but allowed for the longer use of any particular tape.

          6.3     At the end of the day the video tapes from the two recorders were secured and
                  eventually featured as evidence obtained during the police investigation of the
                  disaster.

          6.4     The Exhibit List produced for the Taylor Enquiry has document number 109
                  described as containing recordings from 5 separate locations at regular
                  intervals and that the material is of relevance. A copy of 109 shows it to be
                  a VHS video tape reference TB/1. TB being the initials of P.C. Bichard, the
                  video operator. Document 110 is described as a two part film of various
                  locations also containing relevant material. A copy of 110 shows it to be two
                  VHS video tapes reference TB/2 parts 1 and 2. See Appendices 2 and 3.

             6.5     TB/1 and 2 are described in detail in the video schedule prepared for the
                     Taylor Enquiry. (Appendix 4). TB/1 switches between the various police
                     cameras at intervals of 1 minute between the times 13.02 and 14.02.
                     However there are no views from camera 5 overlooking Leppings Lane
                     Terraces. The video recording TB/1 then appears to be under manual
                     operation and only shows the camera 5 viewpoint for a total of approximately
                     5 minutes between the times 14.59 to 15.04.

             6.6     TB/2 is switching between four of the police cameras, including camera 5, at
                     approximately 20 second intervals. It starts at 11.59 and ends just before
                     15.35. A new schedule prepared for me by the West Yorkshire Police
                     showed that the views from camera 5 feature on 41 occasions up until 15.00.
                     (Appendix 5). The final part of this tape from 15.03 until the end is the
                     camera 5 view of the fence behind the goal area where fans can be seen
                     climbing over onto the pitch, followed by some footage from a camera across
                     the pitch.

             6.7     I am informed by Dr. Stefan Popper, the Coroner for the Hillsborough
                     Inquests, that all the exhibits prepared for the Taylor Enquiry were made
                     available to the legal representatives at the Inquest. The police say that
                     material required for each day was placed in a side room to the hearings. The
                     rest of the Unused Material, including Taylor Enquiry documents were kept
                     at a local police station (Nechells Green), where access was given to any
                     legal representatives that required it. Much of this material was unused at the
                     Inquest including Exhibits TB/1 and 2. A ‘compilation’ (Taylor Enquiry
                     Document 142) was edited from the footage made available by the police, club
                     and media. That particular video included little of TB/1 and 2 as much more
                     striking coverage of events was obtained from the other sources. None of the
                     TB/2 footage from camera 5 after 15.04 was shown on it. This compilation
                     was also seen by the Jury (Inquest Reference C278). See Appendix 6.

             6.8     During the hearing on the 13th March 1991, the Coroner said that the Jury
                     had twice asked about the video evidence of the Terraces. He stated that the
                     videos had been looked at and there was actually next to nothing on them
                     because not everything was recorded; there was a tiny bit on the compilation
                     tape, with another little bit which started at 15.03 and went on for a few
                     minutes. He said that it had been clipped and will be shown to the Jury but
                     was of poor quality and he did not think it would help very much.

             6.9     On the 15th March, Exhibit C539 was shown to the Jury. It was produced by
                     a P.S. Killoch who said that he had taken a short sequence from one of the
                     South Yorkshire Police videos showing scenes of the Leppings Lane pens, that
                     is, the West Stand. The sequence, most of which was in time-lapse, began
                     at 15.02. After the video was shown to the hearing, it was identified as being
                     C539 and P.S. Killoch stated that the original identification was TB/1, being
                     the West Midlands Police reference. No comment was made by any person
                     as to the quality of this specific footage.

         Reviewing Lawyers Comments

         6.10    The original police video tapes exhibited to the Taylor Enquiry as TB/1 and
                 TB/2 are still in existence and are in the hands of the West Yorkshire Police.
                 Two original master copies of C539, that were taken from the master copy of
                 TB/2, are also with the West Yorkshire Police. One of these was produced
                 by P.S. Killoch to the Coroner’s Hearing and was shown to the Jury. My
                 assessment of this particular footage is that whilst it is reasonably clear, the
                 position and angle of the view from the camera makes any assessment of
                 overcrowding in the centre pens to be difficult if not impossible. If the
                 camera had been panned or its angle of view increased then more might have
                 been seen in those crucial minutes after 15.03.

         6.11    As TB/1 and 2 were available to the Taylor Enquiry, it cannot be said that
                 they were suppressed. All of the enquiry exhibits were known to legal teams
                 involved at the Inquest. I have seen copies of correspondence between the
                 police and other organisations (Hillsborough Steering Committee and Borough
                 of Sefton) concerning video footage. This shows that access was granted at
                 Nechells Green Police station during May to August 1989 to the interested
                 parties (including Mr. Trevor Hicks) to view video evidence in police hands.
                 A police incident room message (see Appendix 7) dated 24/5/89 is a note of
                 a telephone conversation between an Inspector Layton and a D .C .I. Tope to
                 the effect that solicitors acting for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club had
                 been given permission to view video footage referred to as TB2/A/Part 4.
                 This is the footage of the Leppings Lane Terraces between 15.03 and 15.25
                 and the evidence alleged to have been suppressed. I am also satisfied that this
                 particular recording was therefore available for the purpose of the Inquest.I
                 am satisfied that while TB/1 and 2 were not themselves shown to the Jury, the
                 ‘compilation ’ and C539 videos were.

         6 .12   C539 covers most of the camera 5 footage between 15.03 and 15.25 and was
                 shown to the Jury during the evidence of P.S. Killoch. However it can be
                 seen that the officer makes a mistake when he describes the exhibit as having
                 the original identification of TB/1. My viewing confirms that the material
                 contained within C539 comes from Exhibit TB/2 and agrees with the relevant
                 schedule (Appendix 4).

         6.13    The HFSG have provided a copy tape to the CPS which is said to be the one
                 shown to the Inquest Jury. It is in fact what appears to be a re-recording of
                 C539 that is of poor quality as accepted by Alun Jones QC in his opinion. I
                 am satisfied that the Jury saw the best copy available, that is, one of the two
                 original tapes taken from the master TB/2. This particular tape was referred
                 to by the Coroner as follows (transcript of 13th March 1990):-

                 "I do not think it is worth starting before lunch, but there is just one thing
                 which the Jury have mentioned to me. In fact they have mentioned it twice,
                 and that is what about the video evidence at the terraces. I have the videos
                 looked at and there is actually next to nothing on the videos because of

MMS/246.97.V02
                                                17
                 course, not everything was recorded. That does not mean to say they were
                 not possibly scenes but there is, I understand, a little tiny bit which is actually
                 in the compilation which you have seen. There is another little bit which
                 starts at 15.03 and goes on for a few minutes. What we have done is that we
                 have clipped it, if that is the right word, and we will show it to you, but it is
                 a very poor quality and I do not think it is going to help us very much. As
                 far as I can tell there isn’t much recorded. Does that help?"

         6.14    On the 15th March, prior to the C539 footage being shown to the Jury, the
                 Coroner said:-

                 "We are going to press on today, but what I want to do is you will remember
                 you were asking about the video, and I think we will show this video now of
                 the scene as far as we have got it at Leppings Lane. In fact, it was, of
                 course, taken by Mr. Bichard so it is a convenient time to actually look at it,
                 but I am going to get Mr. Killoch who has actually selected the piece out that
                 we need to describe it."

         6.15    The relevant parts of the transcript are exhibited at Appendix 8, with the
                 Exhibit list at Appendix 9.

         6.16    I have ascertained that the Coroner had authorised the recording by video tape
                  of all the main inquest proceedings. There are 186 tapes in all. The cameras
                 view point (from a higher level gallery) shows the Coroner, Jury, witness
                  stand and lawyers benches as well as the bottom part of the large video
                 screen. From the relevant tape I can confirm that C539 was shown in its
                 entirety and at one stage early in the viewing the Coroner remarks "I think we
                 can recognise him", presumably with reference to some un-named person on
                 the terraces. This remark is not noted in the transcript.

         6.17    The points I note from the above are that:

                 •      C539 was a 13 minute excerpt of camera 5 ’s view of the Leppings
                        Lane pens and was shown to the Inquest Jury.C539 was taken from
                        police video TB/2 (not TB/1 as stated by P.S. Killoch).

                 •     P.C. Bichard and other officers gave evidence of their perception that
                        monitor pictures from camera 5 were not of good quality, and that
                        they therefore disregarded them, especially as their attention prior to
                        15.03 was focused on the obvious danger area at the entrance gates.

                 •     The Coroner told the Jury that having had the videos (presumably
                        TB/1 and TB/2) looked at, a little bit starting at 15.03 and going on
                        for a few minutes (to 15.25) had been clipped and it would be shown
                        to them. He said that this tape was of very poor quality and would not
                        help very much.

                 •     The ‘new evidence’ from Mr. Houldsworth is that from his perception
MMS/246.97.V02
                                                18
•
                            the tape was of good quality and overcrowding in the pens could be
                            clearly seen. He therefore strongly disagrees with the police evidence
                            concerning the use of camera 5.

             6.18    On the 1st April 1997, South Yorkshire Police released a press statement
                     following a report in that mornings Daily M irror paper. They stated that the
                     tape from a CCTV camera showing the terraces had never been missing and
                     was made available to both the Taylor Enquiry and the Inquest. The
                     confusion over missing tapes seemed to arise from the fact that two tapes
                     recorded at the ground on the Club’s own CCTV system had gone missing
                     from a locked room. Neither tape was relevant to the enquiry.

             6.19    The HFSG response of the 7th April to us was that footage from camera 5 did
                     go missing and therefore could not be shown to the Inquest Jury. They said
                     that P.C . Bichard in his evidence confirmed that shots from camera 5 had
                     been recorded prior to 15.02 and he could not explain why relevant footage
                     could not be found. The HFSG also showed concern as to their understanding
                     that South Yorkshire Police were in a position to ‘select’ evidence for
                     admission to either the Taylor Enquiry or the Inquest, rather than the West
                     Midlands police who were the investigators. They make the point that the
                     South Yorkshire Police have changed tack in accepting that camera 5 was
                     indeed in working order, but that this is contrary to the evidence of P.C .s
                     Bichard and Ryan and P.S. Goddard who all disparaged the capability of that
                     camera. The camera could pan, tilt and zoom and produce pictures of
                     sufficient quality and detail to identify facial features. They considered the
                     police are now alleging that it was the quality of the transmission via the
                     monitors rather than the camera which was the problem. As regards the
                     stolen tapes, while the HFSG accept that they showed nothing of probative
                     value, the fact is that they were taken from a locked cupboard in an alarmed
                     and locked room with a massive police presence at the ground over-night.
                     The security could not have been breached by a stranger. The South
                     Yorkshire Police cannot dismiss the matter so lightly as clearly the thief
                     thought he/she was stealing something of value. We are then asked to take
                     these comments into account before coming to a decision.

7        REPO RT: VIDEO EVIDENCE

         Allegations m ade by T revor Hicks

         7.1     (Refer to 3.1) It cannot be proved to the required standard that P.C .s Bichard
                 and Ryan gave false evidence. Their perception of the camera 5 footage was
                 based on the monitor picture within the police control room not on a viewing
                 of any video recording. They consider that as the pictures were of poor
                 quality they would therefore disregard them. P.C . Bichard stated in his
                 evidence to the Inquest that the pictures on the large screen there were clearer
                 than on the control room monitor. This would support the proposition that
                 regardless of any previous fault on the camera there was a lack of picture
                 quality due to a monitor problem. Even so the Coroner considered that C539
                 was not of good quality (as opposed to Mr. Houldsworth’s different perception
                 of the quality). The tape was shown to the Jury and they, having also heard
                 the evidence of the police officers were able to make up their own minds as
                 to what the police in the control room could see of the events unfolding both
                 at the turnstile and gates, and on the terraces. Mr. Houldsworth’s evidence
                 in 1996 is that he could clearly see on the Club CCTV monitor that the pens
                 were full to over-crowding when the gate was opened leading to the fatal
                 crushing. His evidence from 1989 is not so precise, only that a dangerous
                 situation was developing. Here he says that it was not for two to three
                 minutes after going down onto the pitch and viewing the pens that he realised
                 the true situation and that there was not a pitch invasion. His later evidence
                 is therefore at variance with his early perceptions and may well have been
                 contaminated by subsequent events.

                 Findings: Any accusations of perjury or perverting the course of justice
                 based on a witness perception differing from that of the police officers, and
                 already considered by the Jury will not pass the evidential test.

         7.2     (Refer to 3.2). I accept that the editor of the ‘compilation video’ had access
                 to TB/1 and 2 as well as to all the many other tapes available. The Coroner
                 also accepts that C539 was a clipped part of another tape (TB/2). He said that
                 the Jury had twice mentioned video evidence of the terraces. Because of that
                 he had had the videos looked at and C539 was then prepared. It was of poor
                 quality and he did not think it would help very much.

                 Findings: The Jury’s request for footage of the terraces was actioned by the
                 Coroner in what he obviously considered to be a satisfactory way. The
                 appropriate inference must be that TB/1 and 2 were looked at and that the
                 footage from Camera 5 prior to 14.30 was not considered to be of sufficient
                 relevance. There was no footage from that camera between 14.24 and 14.58,
                 the crucial time period where over-crowding began to occur. C 539 tape was
                 an edited version of TB/2 showing the pens between 15.03 and 15.16.

         7.3     (Refer to 3.3) The Jury viewed some of the relevant Camera 5 footage
                 between 15.03 and 15.16 and they came to their verdicts having considered
MMS/246.97.V02
                                               20
                 all the evidence put before them.


                 Findings: That the Jury did not see the last 9 x/2 minutes of the camera 5
                 footage on TB/2 would not, in my opinion, have affected their overall
                 judgement and the decisions that they came to.

                 Allegations m ade by Alun Jones QC:-

         7.4     (Refer to 3.4) I have obtained copies of the Exhibit List to the Taylor
                 Enquiry showing that TB/1 and 2 were properly exhibited together with a
                 schedule breaking down the footage into details of camera locations, timings,
                 and a description of the scene shown. These tapes were available to the legal
                 representatives of the HFSG. Part of them was contained within the
                 ‘compilation video’. South Yorkshire Police have reported to me that all the
                 Taylor Enquiry material was available for the Inquest Hearings. A room in
                 the Inquest Building was set aside for original documents and all those exhibits
                 needed on a day to day basis. The remainder of the Exhibit material was kept
                 at the local police station and made available to the Coroner, lawyers and
                 certain of the families for viewing. I am awaiting a statement from a senior
                 officer concerned with those arrangements to confirm the police report.
                 However the previously mentioned correspondence (para 6.10) corroborates
                 that report. The Coroner, Dr. Popper, has also confirmed to me that all
                 Taylor Enquiry material was available.

                 Findings: I consider that there is no evidence to show that video tapes were
                 ever suppressed by the police or others. Counsel for the HFSG is obviously
                 confused as to which tapes went missing or were stolen. The two tapes that
                 were taken from the Club CCTV room were never recovered, but the police
                 video tapes have never been missing. I see no merit in the HFSG intimation
                 that the police are in some way responsible for the theft of the two club tapes.
                 There is no evidence that this theft is of any relevance to the present review.

         7.5     (Refer to 3.5). Mr. Houldsworth has provided a copy of his statement made
                 on the 16th May 1989. He says how he re-designed and improved the
                 ground’s CCTV system, both for Club and Police use. He describes the 20
                 Club and 7 police monitors, 2 of the last being connected to video recorders.
                 He rectified a fault on one of the police cameras by re-adjusting the iris
                 controls. By 14.45 on the day he was able to see the build up of supporters
                 outside the turnstiles but while some stands were full the West Stand
                 (Leppings Lane Terraces) was only two thirds full. He commented to others
                 in the Club CCTV box that the kick off should be delayed to enable people
                 to get into the ground. Some time later he heard a radio request from a senior
                 police officer that a gate be opened in order to prevent deaths. A gate was
                 opened and a huge number of fans flooded the area. From the numbers
                 displayed on a monitor he realised that a dangerous situation was being
                 created. He went down to the pitch as the referee stopped the match. He saw
                 fans climbing over the West Stand fence and thought that there was a pitch

                                               21
                 invasion. It was only after he watched for 2 to 3 minutes that he realised
                 what was really occurring. Later that afternoon he ejected the VCR tapes in
                 the club CCTV room (leaving them in the machines in the eject position) and
                 later locked the VCR cupboard and set the room’s alarm system. However
                 he did not specifically recall if all the tapes were still with each machine at
                 that time. He then asked a security guard (not police) to ensure that no one
                 entered the CCTV room. The next morning the room was still locked with
                 the alarm operative. He discovered that two tapes were missing, one from a
                 camera overlooking gates 9 to 16 and the other from an inactive VCR.

                 Findings: Mr. Houldsworth’s evidence concerns background material of the
                 CCTV workings and of a brief view of his perceptions. Other witnesses gave
                 similar evidence. The West Midlands Police Hillsborough Enquiry Master
                 Index shows that his statement was included within the investigation and was
                 therefore presented to the Taylor Enquiry. That he was not called to give live
                 evidence does not surprise me. I find no evidence of the deliberate
                 suppression of his statement nor of any police involvement with the two
                 missing tapes.

         7.6     (Refer to 3.6) The HFSG tapes are copies of those provided by the police to
                 Yorkshire Television at their request.

                 Findings: There is no evidence that the tapes TB/1 and 2 were ever involved
                 in a theft or had been improperly taken away.

         7.7      (Refer to 3.7) It would be well nigh impossible to prosecute a case involving
                 allegations of police lying (and therefore the perverting of the course of
                 justice) based on the different perception of one witness (Mr Houldsworth)
                 who did not view the actual police monitor showing the Leppings Lane
                 Terraces at the relevant times.

                 Findings: There is insufficient evidence to support the allegation.

         7.8     (Refer to 3.8) The TB/2 tapes were available in 1991 and 1993.

                 Findings: The tapes do not have the significance attributed to them by Alun
                 Jones.

         Allegations m ade by Roger H ouldsw orth:-

         7.9     (Refer to 3.9.1 to 13) Most of his comments have been addressed in the
                 previous paragraphs where Trevor Hicks and Alun Jones QC tender their
                 version of the inferences to be taken from his ‘new evidence’. Roger
                 Houldsworth considers that Camera 5 was working properly and the evidence
                 of police officers, is, as he has put it, "not altogether truthful". He identifies
                 contradictions in the evidence of P.C. Bichard and generally denigrates the
                 perceptions of the police officers as to the capabilities of the camera. The
                 thrust of these comments as picked out by Mr. Hicks and Alun Jones QC must

MMS/246.97.V02
                                                22
•
                      Jones QC must be that these perceptions (and also the alleged loss of tapes)
                      are told as deliberate lies in order to cover up the gross negligence of the
                      police in the control room in not noticing the crush in the pens at an earlier
                      stage.

              7.10    Particular comment is made by him (at paragraph 3.9.9) that P.C. Bichard
                      was asked why there was no video material for Camera 5 before 15.02, and
                      that the officer could offer no explanation although he said that there would
                      have been a recording. As P.C. Bichard was not involved in exhibit
                      production I accept that he could not have had any explanation as to
                      unsupported allegations, re matters not under his control or within his
                      knowledge.

              7.11    Mr Houldsworth goes on (paragraph 3.9.10) that there is only a time and date
                      imprinting on a recording if it is made at the normal speed. He is thus stating
                      that with a time-lapse mode there is no such imprint. This expert opinion of
                      his is patently false as the time-lapse recording between 15.03 and 15.25
                      clearly shows the time and date imprint.

              7.12    He says (at paragraph 3.9.13) that a Chief Inspector’s evidence contradicts
                      that of P.C. Ryan as to how satisfactory Camera 5 was. However the Chief
                      Inspector’s view from the Camera was a close up from a very short distance
                      while Camera 5 was focused at the far end of the pens between 15.03 and
                      15.25. As Mr. Houldsworth admits (see para 3.9.5) it would be difficult to
                      pick out facial features while events are happening.

                      Findings: Mr. Houldsworth’s evidence and comments are generally a matter
                      of his perception versus that of the police officers. I do not consider that it
                      any way comes close to the sufficiency required for obtaining a realistic
                      prospect of conviction on the criminal allegations. The police have fully
                      admitted civil liability and an extension of their negligence into the realms of
                      criminal misconduct by way of an alleged cover up operation is not tenable
                      on the evidence available.

8        REVIEW OF MEDICAL EVIDENCE

         8.1     While any application by the HFSG for a re-opening of the Inquest based on
                 new medical evidence is within the province of the Home Office, Alun Jones
                 QC does allege at paragraph 11 of his opinion that Dr. W alker’s evidence was
                 concealed. In which case there must be consideration of that evidence going
                 towards the offence of Perverting the Course of Justice. The HFSG
                 intimation must be of a Conspiracy to Pervert the Court of Justice by the two
                 police forces involved, the West Midlands and South Yorkshire Police, and
                 also by the Coroner if it can be shown that he knew of the evidence of Dr.
                 Walker.

         8.2     Dr. W alker’s evidence:   The HFSG have produced         in their Annex F the
                 following documents :-

                 8.2.1   Dr. W alker’s undated statements (which are not in the Criminal Justice
                         Act format) re the events at Hillsborough.

                 8.2.2 A letter of the 3rd May 1989 from a Hospital Consultant (Mr.
                       Wardrope) describing how Dr. Walker (a Senior House Officer in
                       Anaesthetics) was instrumental in bringing speedy treatment and
                       resuscitation to patients on the 15th April 1989.

                 8.2.3 A standard form letter of the 15th June 1989 from the same consultant
                       to (presumably) Dr. Walker warning him that he may be asked to give
                       a statement to the police for the benefit of the Coroner.

                 8.2.4 A letter of the 3rd May 1989 thanking Dr. Walker for his report and
                       the work he did.

                 8.2.5 A letter of the 8th February 1997 from Dr. Walker to that consultant
                       stating that Mr. Philip Hammond (junior) was the first victim that he
                       attempted to resuscitate. He asks why he was not contacted by the
                       police to provide an official statement or to appear at the inquest. He
                       confirms his statement made to the consultant in that Philip Hammond
                       had sinus rhythm and cardiac output which was obviously at odds with
                       Dr. Slater’s evidence.

                 8.2.6 Dr. W alker’s letter of the 13th February 1997 to the British Medical
                       Journal asking for contact to be made with other Doctors who were
                       involved on the day but not asked to provide statements.

         8.3     The question for consideration is whether or not the alleged omission in not
                 taking his statement was done with criminal intent so as to suppress his
                 evidence because, for example, it would have embarrassed the police or led
                 to a different verdict from the Jury.

         8.4     The Judicial Review of the Medical Evidence found that the pathologists who
MMS/246.97.V02
                                               24
                 were Drs. Gumpert, Dr. Slater and Professor Usher, were as one in that once
                 a victim’s chest was fixed (when crushing occurs) then irrecoverable brain
                 damage will ensue in 4 to 6 minutes. The court’s conclusions have been
                 noted above.

          8.5    Dr. W alker’s statement begins with his description of how he came to
                 volunteer his services to the Northern General Hospital when he hears of
                 problems at Hillsborough Stadium. On arrival at the Hospital he went to the
                 Casualty Department to be told that a paediatric cardiac arrest was coming in.
                 The first child received was in cardio-respiratory standstill and he with others
                 instigated routine cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. There was evidence of gross
                 inhalation of stomach contents and as far as he could recall sinus rhythm and
                 cardiac output was established, although the boy’s pupils were fixed and
                 dilated. He believed that the boy had since died. A second child arrived in
                 cardio-pulmonary arrest during resuscitation of the first patient. Similar
                 measures were carried out and this child was also brought back into sinus
                 rhythm with a good output though he again had fixed dilated pupils throughout
                 and has since died. Dr. Walker then continues in the statement with details
                 of other victims that he dealt with and which are not relevant for the purposes
                 of this review. The statement does not give patient names.

                 Findings:

         8.6     I do not consider that Dr. Walker’s observations as made in his personal
                 statement of 1989 and the letters of 1987 comprise such vital new evidence as
                 to show that the life of Philip Hammond continued after the cut off period of
                 15.15.

         8.7     Dr. Walker contends that he was not asked to make a statement by the police
                 (whether it be the West Midlands or West Yorkshire (sic) police as he states
                 in two different letters). However the police file which I have seen contains
                 Dr. Walker’s original manuscript statement of the 20th July 1989 as obtained
                 by the West Midlands Police Force. Each page is signed by him and
                 witnessed by two other persons. It is somewhat different to his undated
                 personal statement which is said to have been made in 1989. In the police
                 statement he says that he attended to the first casualty to arrive, a boy he
                 knows only as ‘Lee’ and who he believed was declared brain dead in the
                 Intensive Care Unit two days later. This patient was in cardio-pulmonary
                 arrest with fixed dilated pupils. The heart had stopped beating but the medical
                 team managed to re-establish normal rhythm. While the boy was being
                 treated the second victim arrived also in cardio-pulmonary arrest. This boy
                 was also established in a normal sinus heart rhythm but again the pupils were
                 fixed and dilated throughout and it is believed that the boy has since died.
                 The description given by Dr. Walker of the second boy fits that of the victim
                 Philip Hammond.

         8.8     The Doctor’s evidence concerning these first two victims shows that both
                 arrived without apparent signs of life. Although a normal heart rhythm was
MMS/246.97.V02
                                               25
•
                     established it could not be sustained and the two boys eventually died. I
                     understand that Lee’s bodily functions were maintained for two days as he was
                     to be an organ donor.

             8.9     However, the doctor’s letter of 8th February 1997 to Mr. Wardrope says that
                     Philip Hammond was the first victim that he attempted to resuscitate. That
                     recollection is presumably based on the undated 1989 personal statement.
                     Here he describes the establishment of sinus rhythm and cardiac output in the
                     first two victims he treated (no names are given) and that both had fixed and
                     dilated pupils throughout and subsequently were believed to have died.

             8.10    A police action message dated 2nd April 1990 shows that an officer was
                     directed to contact Dr. Walker and warn him that he may be required to
                     attend the Inquest. The Doctor’s contact telephone number was to be
                     obtained. There is a manuscript note of a telephone number on this message.
                     The result of the above action is noted that the doctor was not required.

             8.11 The statement of Mr. James Wardrope (a consultant in Accident and
                   Emergency Medicine at the Northern General Hospital) dated 6th June 1989
                   gives details of various Hillsborough patients as contained within the medical
                   records in his possession and the post mortem evidence provided by the
                   Coroner. The paragraph concerning Philip Hammond is as follows:-

                     "There is no definite documentary evidence in the medical notes that Mr.
                     Hammond received resuscitation, but the post mortem states that there were
                     three ECG electrodes attached to his chest. I would interpret this as being
                     probable he did enter the resuscitation room of the Northern General Hospital,
                     but a cardiac tracing showed no cardiac activity and in view of the large
                     number of patients present at the time, resuscitation attempts were not taken
                     any further".

             8.12 His comments concerning a Lee Nichol are as follows:-

                     "This young boy was brought in as a cardiac-arrest. Resuscitation resulted in
                     return of normal cardiac output, but he did not breathe on his own. He was
                     therefore transferred to the General Intensive Care Unit and I believe he died
                     on the Intensive Care Unit three days later".

             8.13    Later in the statement Mr. Wardrope says that no patient admitted in the state
                     of cardiac arrest had survived.

             8.14    In his evidence to the Coroner’s Hearing, this consultant confirmed that there
                     was no documentary evidence as to what had happened with Philip Hammond
                     apart from the post-mortem report concerning the electrode marks. He was
                     asked to give his best guess as to how that may have happened and replied:-

                     "In the initial part of the incident I was sending people who came in with a
                     cardiac arrest, patients undergoing mouth to mouth resuscitation and external
    MMS/246.97.V02
                                                   26
                 cardiac massage, I sent to the resuscitation room initially to see whether they
                 could have a chance of being brought round to start the heart going. The fact
                 that the only post-mortem evidence were three ECG electrodes, I think
                 possibly he was sent to the resuscitation room but the ECG showed no cardiac
                 activity, and because of the great pressure on the resuscitation beds at that
                 time he would be sent to the m ortuary."

         8.15    A P.C . Taylor who was at the football ground gave evidence that he
                 approached a youth who was identified as Philip Hammond and who was lying
                 on the ground and appeared to be unconscious. He took the boy to an
                 ambulance and attempted to revive him with the assistance of others. Heart
                 massage was performed and they were able to re-start the heart and feel a
                 pulse. However it is said by the officer that later at the hospital, the doctor
                 could not detect signs of life after 20 minutes of resuscitation.

         8.16    The West Midlands Police report for the coroner concerning the death of
                 Philip Hammond contains further evidence. A statement from a Dr. Doore
                 refers to a body number 93 which is the deceased reference number for Philip
                 Hammond. She says that this body was one of 11 casualties that she
                 examined on being brought into the hospital. In total she examined 11
                 casualties that day, found no signs of life in any, and in her opinion all were
                 dead on arrival at the hospital. In a later statement she confirms that one of
                 the persons she examined was Philip Hammond. Dr. David Slater conducted
                 the autopsy of Philip Hammond and his conclusions were that the injuries
                 were consistent with a severe intensive blunt compression of the chest
                 especially on the right side.

         8.17    Based on the above findings I consider that there has been no suppression of
                 medical evidence by either the police or other persons as alleged by Alun
                 Jones. I agree that Dr. Walker’s evidence conflicts with that of Dr. Slater,
                 however it also conflicts with that of every other witness who has made a
                 statement concerning Philip Hammond. Alun Jones states that it is difficult
                 to exaggerate the significance of the concealment of Dr. Walker’s evidence,
                 a remark that I find to be completely misguided when the overall evidence is
                 considered. That this evidence tended to exculpate the South Yorkshire
                 authorities and the police from blame may well be because there was no
                 evidence to inculpate those organisations. I cannot accept the intimation that
                 there was misconduct in the selections by the West Midlands Police of the
                 evidence to put before the Coroner.

         8.18    Consideration should be given to allowing either Dr. Slater or Professor Usher
                 to comment on what Dr. Walker has now said.

          9.1    There are no grounds for the Crown Prosecution Service to recommend to the
                 Home Office that there should be further investigation of criminal allegations
                 against the police or other persons.

          9.2    Alun Jones QC has requested the meeting with a senior lawyer of the CPS to
                 allow him to expand upon his advice. I note the Chief Crown Prosecutor’s
                 initial reaction is to refuse based on the fact that there are only powers to
                 invite the police to investigate the matter further. I appreciate the difficulties
                 which the HFSG has where the allegations of criminal conduct are made
                 against the police forces involved in the Hillsborough Investigation. My
                 overall view is that no new material has been put before us. It would be
                 politic to explain any reasons for our decision to the HFSG or at least to their
                 legal representatives. However, perhaps this should be done by the officers
                 of the Police Policy Directorate at the Home Office following consultation as
                 to the handling of the reporting of any decisions made in this matter.

                         JOINT OPINION



Introduction
1.   On 15th April 1989 the worst disaster in British football
history occurred inside the Hillsborough Stadium at Sheffield

where Liverpool were playing Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup

semi-final. 95 people died and over 400 were injured as a

result of gross overcrowding and crushing in the two pens

immediately behind the goal at the western (Leppings Lane) end

of the ground.
      We are instructed to advise whether there exists

sufficient evidence to justify bringing criminal proceedings

against any of the organisations or individuals concerned.



2.   We have been provided with the Interim Report of the
Inquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor published in August 1989
("the Taylor Report") and the report to the Director of Public
Prosecutions of the criminal investigation carried out by the

West Midlands Police ("the West Midlands Report").


3.    Our views were sought at an early stage on the scope of

the investigation and the format of the report, and the
material which has been placed before us is very extensive. In

addition to the reports mentioned, we have been provided with

the bulk of the documentation placed before Lord Justice

Taylor's Inquiry, the full transcript of the evidence given at

the Inquiry, and a large quantity of visual evidence in the

form of photographs and video film.


                                1
     We have also visited Hillsborough stadium and have had

the opportunity of seeing for ourselves the physical
characteristics of the ground which played such an important

part in the disaster.


4.   Throughout our consideration of this case we have kept

constantly in mind the appalling scale of the tragedy for the

bereaved and those injured, some of whom suffered devastating

psychological injuries from which they are unlikely to
recover. We have borne in mind, too, the strong feelings of
anger and bitterness which the disaster has provoked within

the Liverpool community and elsewhere, and the important role

in the pursuit of justice which criminal proceedings are

perceived to have by those aggrieved.


5.   In the light of the prominent part played by the South

Yorkshire Police in the disaster, we have reminded ourselves

in particular that police officers are in no different
category to others in a criminal investigation. We should say

that we are fully satisfied that that has been the approach of

the West Midlands Police, who have conducted a meticulous
investigation in which no stone has been left unturned.



6.   Given the serious nature of the criminal liability under

consideration, however, it is essential that the available

material should be examined in an entirely dispassionate

manner. This we have tried to do.




                                2
%
    The facts
    7.    A notable feature of the disaster is the absence of

    conflict of fact as to what happened at Hillsborough. This
    consistency of evidence was remarked on by the Taylor Inquiry

    (see the Taylor Report para 113). Further, the criminal
    investigation, for all its thoroughness, has not significantly

    added to or contradicted Lord Justice Taylor's findings. In

    our judgment, therefore, the Taylor analysis of the facts is
    3 3   firm a base as any from which to approach the question of

    criminal liability and where necessary we shall make reference

    in this Opinion to the Report and its Appendices.



    Summary
    8.     At 2.52 pm on 15th April 1989 one of the exit gates at the

    Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough Stadium was opened on
    the instruction of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, the

    Commander responsible for policing the match. The purpose was

    to relieve unprecedented overcrowding and crushing at the

     turnstiles caused by a build up of supporters arriving after

     2.30 pm for the semi-final due to kick off at 3 pm. In the

     ensuing 5 minutes, some 2,000 supporters passed through the

     gate and entered the tunnel under the West stand giving access

     to the central pens of the terrace. Those pens were already
     overfull because of the physical layout of the terrace and the
     uncontrolled way in which supporters were allowed to enter

     them. Gross overcrowding and crushing occurred. Moreover, the

     intense pressure exerted by the additional influx caused the

     collapse of a crush barrier situated near the front of pen 3.


                                      3
Supporters were hurled down into the front of the pen and

crushed up against the low wall and the perimeter wire fence
above it. Many died from suffocation and crushing injuries;

some were trampled on. The crushing was not immediately

recognised, partly because those trampled upon were not
visible behind the wall, partly because police operational
orders prohibited officers on the perimeter track from opening

the perimeter gates without permission from a senior officer,

and partly because the crushing and distress was not expected.

The response of the police was therefore slow. Even when the

nature and extent of the emergency was appreciated and the
perimeter gates were opened, the small number of gates and the

height of the fence itself made rescue and evacuation a

hopelessly difficult task.
      The build up outside the ground which led to the opening

of the exit gate was due to the layout, numbers, designation

and marking of the turnstile entrances at the Leppings Lane

 end, and to a loss of police control of the crowd as
 supporters became desperate to get in before the kick-off.



 9.   It will be clear from the above summary that the disaster

 had three separate causative elements which need to be

 examined: the layout of the ground; the opening of the exit

 gate; and the build up outside the ground.
The lavout of the ground

10.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ("the Club") was formed

in 1867 and moved to the Hillsborough ground in 1899. In the

90 years that elapsed before the disaster it was successfully

used for numerous sporting events, including FA Cup semi­

finals, international matches and 3 World Cup matches. Very

large crowds were accommodated, the record being over 72,000

in 1934. Significant changes were made to the layout of the

ground over the years and these need to be understood.



11.   The present South stand was built in 1913, the Spion Kop

(at the Eastern end) was added in 1914, and the West stand was

built in 1965. Before then the Leppings Lane end was entirely

terraced. Until fairly recently, not only were there no

perimeter fences between the terraces and the pitch, there

were relatively few crush barriers on the terraces themselves.

The plan at Appendix 4 to the Taylor Report shows the

arrangement of the barriers at the Leppings Lane end.



12.   Before 1979 there were continuous barriers along the
front, with two intermittent rows of barriers behind (coloured

black on the plan). There were no "radial" barriers, that is

fences running at right angles to the crush barriers from back

to front of the terrace so as to form pens. The perimeter

fences were installed in 1977 as a response to the hooliganism

and pitch invasions of the 1970s.




                                5
13.   In 1978 Dr Eastwood, a highly experienced civil and
structural engineer and a principal of the firm of Eastwood
and Partners who had been advising the Club on minor matters

since the 1950s, was formally retained to act on the Club's

behalf in its dealings with the local authority, then the

South Yorkshire County Council, but which later became the

Sheffield City Council ("the Council"). The Safety of Sports
Ground Act 1975 had recently been passed and it was necessary

for the Club to take expert advice if it was to receive a
Safety Certificate under the Act from the Council. Dr Eastwood

advised that further barriers should be installed in order to

comply with the Home Office "Green Guide" then in force and

the additional barriers shown and marked blue on the plan at

Appendix 4 were installed in 1979.


14.   The Council set up an Officer Working Party consisting of

representatives of the police, the fire services, and the

Council's building surveyors' division and legal and

administration department and, as a result of inspections and

consultations with the Club and Dr Eastwood, a Safety

Certificate was issued for the ground in 1979.



15.   In 1981, on the occasion of the semi-final between

Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers, a serious

crushing incident at the Leppings Lane end led to further

changes to the layout of the terrace. Late arrivals who surged

 forward when a goal was scored at the Kop end caused the

 crushing of several supporters at the front of the terrace.


                                6
There were injuries but no deaths. This incident, the further

significance of which will be returned to, prompted the police

to suggest that it had been caused by the sideways movement,

of supporters to positions behind the goal, and that the

installation of radial fences would prevent such movement as

well as providing segregation of supporters of opposing teams

who could thus be accommodated on the same terrace.



16.   The police view was accepted by the Club and the Officer

Working Party, and the two radial fences shown pale green in
Appendix 4 were installed in 1981. The terrace was thereby

divided into three pens, with neither forward nor sideways

movement by supporters being possible once a pen became full.

The fences had gates at the top end to be locked once the pens

had filled up.


17.   Further changes to the layout in 1985 and 1986 resulted

in the addition of two more radial fences, the consequential

removal of some posts and rails, and the removal of a barrier
at the top of the terrace near the entrance tunnel, Barrier

144. The result of the addition of the central radial fence

was to divide the pen immediately behind the goal into the two

pens 3 and 4. These were to be the scene of the disaster in

April 1989.


18.   All these changes were discussed between the police, the

Club and Dr Eastwood, and the Officer Working Party approved

the removal of Barrier 144 in August 1986, by which time Mr


                                7
Bownes had become the Licensing Officer responsible for the

Safety Certificate on behalf of the Council.


19.   Alterations to the turnstiles and concourse of the
                                            I   I
Leppings Lane entrance were also made at this time in the

interests of segregation. To this end Dr Eastwood had

suggested a plan for separate access to the North stand, to
each end of the West stand, and to each of the three central

pens by means of separate banks of turnstiles. This plan was
not adopted for financial reasons, but it seems that separate

entrances would have enabled the numbers of supporters

entering each of the pens to be monitored by mechanical or
computerised counting at the turnstiles. As it was, there was

no numerical monitoring or other means of limiting the numbers

of supporters entering the penned areas, including the popular

pens 3 and 4 immediately behind the goal.



20.   The effect was that these areas were likely to attract

more than their proper share of the 10,100 supporters allowed

into the Leppings Lane end under the Safety Certificate and

there was no physical way of preventing this. All had to be
left to visual monitoring by the police and the Club stewards

as the supporters took their places inside the ground.



21.   The police had requested the removal of Barrier 144 in

pen 3 for two reasons: first, to assist the flow of supporters

into the pens and, secondly, to assist evacuation through the

tunnel in an emergency. Unhappily, as later events showed, the


                                8
first purpose was all too successfully achieved. A further

consequence, however, unappreciated at the time, was to

increase the capacity of pen 3.


22.    The Safety Certificate should have been amended to take

account of these changes, which the Club notified to the

Council in accordance with its statutory obligations. Equally

importantly, it should have contained maximum figures for

individual pens.


23.    The Certificate was not amended and maximum figures were

not inserted partly because Mr Bownes, as Chief Licensing
Officer responsible for 32 other licensing systems, was

overworked, and partly because Dr Eastwood thought that the

maximum stated capacity for the Leppings Lane end need not be
altered providing the police could ensure even distribution of

the supporters throughout the terrace by leaving the radial

gates open. The Taylor Report found that the insertion of
 proper maximum figures into the Safety Certificate might have

 prompted the Club and the police to find some way of limiting

 the numbers entering pens 3 and 4. One way would have been the

 adoption of Dr Eastwood's plan for separate turnstile

 entrances mentioned above.


 24.    The Taylor Report concluded that the fact that the Safety

 Certificate was not amended and individual pen capacities not

 reviewed could not be laid solely at Dr Eastwood's door. The

 Council was ultimately responsible for the Certificate.


                                  9
25.   Entry to pens 3 and 4 was via the tunnel running from

the concourse area behind turnstiles A-G, underneath the West

stand and out into the terrace (see Appendices 1 and 3 to the

Taylor Report). The effect of the changes to the layout of the

Leppings Lane terrace, all of which were purportedly licensed
under the Safety Certificate, was that the only means of

controlling the numbers entering those pens was by cordoning

off the tunnel access.


26.   Moreover, it was the policy of the police at semi-finals

(but not at League matches) to allow free movement of
supporters between pens prior to the kick off, when the radial

gates would be closed and locked. Unless steps were taken to

control the numbers entering the tunnel access, therefore,

pens 3 and 4 were liable to become grossly overcrowded at all

times. The police had accepted de facto responsibility for
monitoring the pens and their policy of "letting the fans find

their own level", was severely criticised in the Taylor Report

(see paras 172 to 183).


The opening of the exit gate

27.   As already stated, the exit gate (Gate C) was opened at
2.52 pm on the day of the disaster following an instruction

from Mr Duckenfield. Gate C is situated almost immediately

opposite the tunnel (see Appendix 1 to the Taylor Report) and

no steps had been taken to cordon off the tunnel or to divert

the influx away to the sides of the West stand. The result was


                               10
                           ilk           a in




that the supporters effectively had nowhere to go but the

already overcrowded pens 3 and 4.


28.   As the supporters entered the tunnel some were swept off

their feet, accelerated by a 1 in 6 downward gradient in the
tunnel itself. A huge crush built up in pens 3 and 4 and some

supporters tried to escape on to the pitch. Others climbed
over the radial fences to the side pens where, ironically,

there was still plenty of room. Later some began to be hauled

up out of the pens to safety in the West stand.


29.    The match kicked off just before 3 pm. The evidence

before the Taylor Inquiry satisfied that tribunal that it was

the near goal for Liverpool at 3.04 pm that caused a powerful

surge forward in pen 3, the force of which caused a crush

barrier at the front of the pen, barrier 124A, to collapse.

This in turn hurled supporters down against the wall and to
their deaths, putting yet more pressure on those already

suffocating at the perimeter wire at the front. The collapse

of this barrier appears to have been a major factor in the

deaths, since there were far fewer deaths in pen 4 where no

barrier collapsed.


30.   The Taylor Report found that a further contributory cause

of the collapse of barrier 124A was the removal of barrier 144

in 1986 already referred to. The absence of the latter

barrier, in the exceptional conditions prevailing, meant that

the supporters met "no retarding structure as they emerged from


                                 11
the tunnel into pen 3, and that there was unbroken diagonal
pressure from the mouth of the tunnel down to barrier 124A.

Further, as the plan at Appendix 4 to the Taylor Report shows,

barrier 124A was vulnerable to downward pressure as a result

of the removal of the barrier immediately above it - one of
the alterations consequential to the installation of the two

additional radial fences. The Taylor Report's conclusions are

supported on this point by the evidence of Inspector Bullas

(see para 234) and by a concession made by Dr Eastwood.



31.   The Taylor Report's findings on the timing of the
collapse of barrier 124A and its probable cause and effects

are supported by the BBC video tape and the evidence of the

supporters near to the barrier itself. They are reinforced by

the probability that, had the barrier collapsed earlier, the

police on the track would have appreciated that this

catastrophe had occurred and would have taken rescue action

much earlier.



32.   We have viewed the evidence and we are impressed by it.

With respect, we share the opinion of the Taylor Report that

this is what occurred. The collapse of barrier 124A was, of
course, a major factor in the causation of the deaths.



33.   The Taylor Report also found, on the basis of expert

evidence which is before us, that barrier 124A, although

corroded, had been tested by Dr Eastwood in July 1988 and had

passed the loading tests specified in the Green Guide.


                               12
Although the corrosion played a part in the collapse, the

effective cause, the Report found, was the excessive and

unanticipated pressure to which it was exposed at the time of

the forward surge mentioned above. The Green Guide made no

specific reference to testing for corrosion as a cause of

deterioration.



34.   The crushing in pens 3 and 4 was not recognised either by

the police officers in the control box in the South West

corner of the ground (see Appendix 1), or by the officers
detailed to the perimeter track, for several minutes after the

first signs of distress appeared, resulting in time being lost

before rescue efforts began. It is plain also, from our

reading of the statements, that the crushing and distress was

not recognised by nearby civilians, by many (but not all) of

the broadcasters and press, nor by stewards of the Club.
Having seen the video evidence, we can readily understand how

this situation arose. The truth is that no-one was expecting

to happen what in fact happened.



35.   There was no effective leadership until the arrival of

Chief Superintendent Nesbit just after 3pm and it was not

until 3.06pm that Mr Duckenfield appreciated that there had
been a major disaster rather than the pitch invasion that he

had assumed. The ambulance service was called at 3.06pm but no

request for cutting gear or the fire brigade was made until

3.13pm. The Taylor Report concluded, however, that it is




                               13
unlikely (although possible) that these services could have

saved lives had they been called promptly. We agree.



36.   The evacuation of the supporters and those injured was

achieved mainly through the perimeter gates. These were not

designed as exits and those to pens 3 and 4 were narrower than

provided by the Green guide. The Taylor report concluded,

however, that even if their width had complied with the Green

Guide, the gates would have been wholly inadequate to relieve

the pressure and release spectators swiftly. The Guide was

silent as to any recommended number of such gates and it is

clear that their use for large scale evacuation was not

intended or anticipated.



37.   The opening of gate C, which precipitated the disaster,

was made necessary by the massive build up of supporters at
the Leppings Lane turnstiles between 2.30 and 2.50 pm. The

perimeter gates to the ground (see Appendix 1) were open from

the outset, and severe congestion and crushing developed at

the turnstiles, the number and capacity of which were

inadequate to cope in time with the large numbers. The

crushing worsened as kick-off time approached and supporters

realised they would be late into the ground. The police lost

control of the crowd and the crush became unmanageable and
dangerous, with many fearing for their lives. The kick-off was

not postponed because it had been agreed with the Club that

this course would only be taken if there was a major cause of

delay such as an accident on the motorway or fog. Mr


                               14
Duckenfield gave inconsistent evidence to the Inquiry about

his decision on this point and the Report concluded that the

kick-off could and should have been postponed.


38.   The request to open gate C was made by Superintendent
Marshall, the Commander in Leppings Lane, who told Mr

Duckenfield by radio that someone would be killed if the gate

was not opened. There is a very considerable body of evidence

to show that Mr Marshall's view was correct and that Mr
Duckenfield had no alternative but to agree to the opening of

the gate.


39.   However, neither Mr Duckenfield nor any other police

officer took any steps to deal with the consequences of the

opening of the gate. In particular, the tunnel was not closed
off. This action, which had been taken in 1988 by serial

police officers apparently on their own initiative, could and
should have been carried out by a small number of police

forming a cordon and directing supporters to the unfilled wing

pens. Mr Duckenfield did order police serials to go to the

concourse to monitor an influx when another gate, gate A, was

opened a little earlier, because he feared a pitch invasion

from the North stand where there was no perimeter fence.



40.   The Taylor Report concluded that Mr Duckenfield's failure

to give a similar order on the opening of gate C was "a

blunder of the first magnitude". Plainly, this error was the

immediate, or proximate, cause of the crushing in pens 3 and 4


                               15
and the pressure which led to the collapse of the barrier in

pen 3.


41.   But it was not of course the sole cause. In addition to

the layout characteristics of the terrace described earlier,

the other main cause was the build up outside the ground which

led to the need to open the gate. This itself was due to a

combination of factors to which reference must now be made.



The build   up   outside the around
42.   The first factor contributing to the build up outside the

ground was the layout of the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the

narrowness of the neck or forecourt at the bend in the Lane

itself where, coming from the North, it turns to the South-
West and crosses the river (see Appendix 1). Not only were the

turnstiles not in a straight line, affording adequate space

for the formation of orderly queues, therefore, but the

waiting area itself was extremely confined. Next, there was

the designation and marking of the turnstiles, with the 10,100

ticket-holders for the West terrace all being required to
enter through turnstiles A-G at entrance "B", although the

three blocks of turnstiles serving the Leppings Lane entrance
were confusingly lettered "A,C,B". In addition, the colour

coding on the turnstile walls was too low to be seen through a

crowd. The Taylor Report found these to be factors

contributing to the delay in the turnstile operation.




                                  16
                                                                  I




43.   However, the turnstile operation itself was slow because

there were only seven turnstiles to admit the 10,100 ticket-

holders, an average of 1450 through each. This is to be
compared with the 60 turnstiles at the Penistone Road end

which served 29,800, a little under 500 per stile. The Green

Guide provided that in general no more than 750 could be

admitted in one hour. The Club, taking into account that it

was an all-ticket match with no cash passing, reckoned this

could be increased to 1000 per hour. However, as Lord Justice

Taylor observed, even at this higher rate it would have taken

almost 1h hours to admit all those with terrace tickets; at

750 per hour it would have taken 2 hours. The Taylor Report

concluded that the police and the Club should have foreseen

that the turnstiles and the waiting area would be under strain

to admit all the Liverpool supporters in time.


44.   Many supporters arrived after 2.30 pm, the request on the

ticket being simply "to take up position 15 minutes befpre

kick off". Some arrived without tickets and tried to get in by

paying cash, others by trying to go over or under the paddle
of the turnstile or by sliding through with a ticket-holder.

All these activities slowed the admission rate and contributed

to the frustration of the crowd as kick-off approached.



45.    There is no question on the evidence that many of the

supporters had been drinking and some were abusive as a
result. Probably few offered violence and the Taylor Report

acquitted the majority of being affected by drink, finding


                                17
that some police had overestimated this factor in their

evidence. Having read the relevant statements, it seems to us
that drink and unruliness of the supporters certainly

contributed to the pushing from the back and was a factor in
making supporters less amenable to police requests to move

back. In some cases, too, drunk supporters tried to force

themselves in at the turnstiles, causing fighting with other

supporters and scuffles with the police trying to prevent

their entry. This minority contributed to the loss of control

of the crowd by police in our view.



46.   Nevertheless, the main factor in this loss of control was

a failure of police strategy in not planning properly for the

crush likely to be caused by a large concentration of arrivals
from 2.30 pm onwards, and in failing to stem the flow of

supporters or filter them towards the turnstiles from some

position outside the perimeter gates. Such action had been

successfully carried out in 1988, as numerous witnesses have

confirmed. The Taylor Report concluded that a combination of

controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off would probably
haver obviated the need to open the gate.



Apportionment of responsibility

47.   The layout of the ground as it stood on the day of the

disaster was the responsibility of four organisations, and
some of the individuals acting on their behalf, namely the

Club, Eastwood and Partners, the Council and the police.

However, none of them foresaw that the progressive alterations


                               18
#
    made to the ground from about 1977 onwards in the interests of
    safety and good order would come to constitute, in effect, a
    death trap for supporters entering pens 3 and 4. This was

    principally because no-one foresaw that up to 2000 supporters
    would be allowed to enter these pens at a time when they were

    already overcrowded, and when spreading out to the side to

    absorb the extra numbers would be impossible. Plainly, no-one
    foresaw any circumstances akin to the opening of gate C, nor

    the unprecedented crushing outside the ground which made that

    action necessary on the day of the disaster. That said, all

    four organisations share some responsibility for the lack of

    safe maximum capacities, the lack of controlled entry to the

    pens and the absence of any proper system of monitoring, as

    they must for the departures from the Green Guide and the

    inadequacy of the Safety Certificate. The police must take the

    main responsibility for the policy of letting the fans find

    their own level although, as the lengthy exploration of the

    borders of their duties at the Inquiry demonstrates, the Club

    must share some responsibility for the way in which supporters
    were allowed to fill the pens at semi-final matches.



    48.   It may be argued that the 1981 crushing incident already

    mentioned ought to have alerted the police and the Club to the

    dangers of admitting large numbers of supporters via the

    tunnel access to the West terrace, where they were capable of

    being crushed against the perimeter fence, and that knowledge

    of this incident increased the responsibility on the police

    and the Club for affording safe access to the West terrace. We


                                  19
*

    consider that this is not so, because the response of the

    police in 1981, accepted by the other parties involved, was to

    instal the radial fences with the aim of preventing the

    inwards movement of supporters to the area behind the goal,
    and until the disaster it was assumed that this was a correct

    response. Whether it was correct or not, the incident in our

    view has no direct bearing on the disaster eight years later
    and does not add to the potential criminal responsibility of
    the police and the Club.



    49.   The opening of gate C was the responsibility of Mr

    Duckenfield and, as already noted, his decision was correct in
    the circumstances. However, the failure to give any order to
    accommodate the influx was a serious error which must in our

    view be Mr Duckenfield's responsibility and his alone. Mr

    Duckenfield had been promoted to Chief Superintendent of F
    Division only three weeks before the match, and it is

    reasonable to ask whether he was competent to take charge of a

    match of this importance. However, there is no evidence to
    suggest that those responsible for his promotion so erred in

    appointing him as to share responsibility for errors made by
    him on the day.



    50.   The fact that the tunnel was cordoned off in 1988 by a

    handful of junior police officers apparently on their own
    initiative - an action that almost certainly would have

    averted the disaster a year later - is one of the most

    unfortunate aspects of the case, and at first sight the


                                   20
operational organisation of the police might seem responsible
for failing to incorporate this tactic in its match planning.

However, Mr Duckenfield's dispatch of a serial to deal with

the opening of gate A demonstrates to our mind that it was

within his power to accommodate the opening of gate C, and the

blame for his not doing so cannot in our view be laid
elsewhere.



51. The build up outside the ground was again the

responsibility of the four organisations identified above.

Given the restrictions of space attendant on the geography of

Leppings Lane itself, the layout of the turnstiles and their
numbers, designation and marking was primarily a matter for

the police and the Club. But the Council was also partly

responsible for ensuring that there was safe ingress to the
ground (see Chapter 5 of the Green Guide).



52.   Allowing for the policing difficulties to which the

layout and slow admission rate of the turnstiles gave rise,

the loss of police control, and in particular the failure to

follow the filtering tactics employed in 1988, was solely a

police responsibility. The responsibility was, however, a

collective one and cannot be attributed to any individual
officer.


Criminal Offences




                               21
                                                                     I


#
    53.   We turn to consider whether any criminal offence is

    disclosed against any of the organisations or individuals

    identified or referred to above.



    (1) Manslaughter

    54. The police authority, the Club and the Council are in law
    all corporations of one kind or another (see Halsbury's Laws

    of England, 4th ed, Vol 9 at paras 1201-3) so an important

    first question is whether a corporation can be indicted for

    manslaughter.



    55.   This question was considered at length by Professor J.C.
    Smith in relation to the shipping company's liability for the

    sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in an Opinion dated

    25th November 1987. We have had the advantage of seeing that

    Opinion, which concluded that the company in that case could

    be properly indicted for manslaughter by gross negligence or

    recklessness, assuming it could be proved that one or more of

    the directing minds of the company caused the deaths, and did

    so with the fault required by the definition of manslaughter.

    In due course proceedings were begun against the company and
    others and on 5th June 1990 Turner J, sitting at the Central

    Criminal Court, dismissed a motion to quash the indictment

    against the company, holding that both on the authorities and
    on principle a corporation is capable of committing

    manslaughter. We have seen a note of the Reserved Judgment,

    which includes a full consideration of the authorities, and in

    our respectful view it represents a correct view of the law.


                                   22
56.   We accordingly advise that each of the corporations

mentioned above could properly be indicted for manslaughter if

it could be proved that one or more of the directing minds of

the corporation concerned committed manslaughter as that
offence is currently defined.


(2) Definition of manslaughter

57.   Involuntary manslaughter is committed when a person

causes the death of another either (1) intending to do an act

which, whether he knows it or not, is unlawful and dangerous
in that it is likely to cause direct personal injury ("an

unlawful and dangerous act"), or (2) intending to do an act

which creates an obvious and serious risk of causing personal
injury (a) not giving thought to the possibility of such risk,

or (b) having recognised that there was some risk involved,

nonetheless going on to take it ("recklessness" as defined by
Lord Diplock In R v Lawrence [1982] AC 510).



58.   To amount to manslaughter a person's conduct need not be

the only cause of the death, but it must be a substantial

cause in that it contributed significantly to the result.

Whether it did so contribute is generally a question of fact
for the jury: Paqett (1983) 76 Cr App Rep 279, 287-91.



59.   It may also be that manslaughter is committed if the
person causing the death intends to do an act, or omits to do

an act where there is a duty to do so, being grossly negligent


                                23
#
    whether death or serious personal injury results ("gross

    negligence"): see eg Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, 6th ed

    (1988) at p 345. The law is at present uncertain whether gross

    negligence still exists as a separate head of liability, two

    recent authorities having held that the earlier cases where

    manslaughter is defined in terms of negligence should not be

    followed and that Lord Diplock's test should be applied
    universally.



    60.   In Seymour (1983) 76 Cr App Rep 211, Watkins LJ, giving

    the judgment of the Court of Appeal in a reckless driving
    case, said:

          "...we are of the view that it is no longer necessary or

          helpful to make reference to compensation and negligence.

          The Lawrence direction on recklessness is comprehensive

          and of general application to all offences, including

          manslaughter involving the driving of motor vehicles

          recklessly and should be given to juries without in any

          way being diluted. Whether a driver at the material time

          was conscious of the risk he was running or gave no

          thought to its existence, is a matter which affects

          punishment for which purposes the judge will have to

          decide, if he can, giving the benefit of doubt to the

          convicted person, in which state of mind that person had
          driven at the material time."

1
    61.   In Kong Cheuk Kwan v R (1985) 82 Cr App Rep 18 Lord

1
    Roskill, giving the opinion of the Privy council, said at p
    25:
1         "Their Lordships are of the view that the present state

          of the relevant law in England and Wales... is clear. The
]
          model direction suggested in Lawrence and held in Seymour

          equally applicable to cases of motor manslaughter
1
          requires, first, that the vehicle was in fact being
I         driven in such a manner as to create an obvious and

          serious risk of causing physical injury to another and
1
          secondly that the defendant so drove either without
          having given any thought to the possibility of there
j
          being such a risk or having recognised that there was

1         such a risk nevertheless took it.

               In principle their Lordships see no reason why a
1
          comparable direction should not have been given in the

          present case as regards that part of the case which
1
          concerned the alleged navigation of the Flying Goldfinch

1         by Kong and indeed as regards the alleged navigation of

          the Flying Flamingo by the other two defendants. Did
I         their respective acts of navigation create an obvious and

          serious risk of causing physical damage to some other
]
          ship and thus to other persons who might have been

1         travelling in the area of the collision at the material

          time? If so did any of the defendants... so navigate
I         either without having given any thought to the


I         possibility of that risk or, while recognising that the
          risk existed, take that risk?"

                                   25

I
1
At p 26, Lord Roskill said:
      "Their Lordships... respectively agree with the comment
      made by Watkins LJ... in Seymour."



62.   However, as pointed out by Smith and Hogan (6th ed (1988)

at p 353), while the clear implication from Kona Cheuk Kwan is

that there is no longer any separate test of gross negligence
in manslaughter, it may be that the courts would not be

prepared to exclude it altogether in an appropriate case. Some

support for this view is found in Goodfellow (1986) 83 Cr App

Rep 23, where Lord Lane LCJ said that the question in Kong
Cheuk Kwan was whether the defendant was "guilty of

recklessness (or gross negligence)".



63.   We consider it right in the circumstances of Hillsborough

to approach the evidence on the basis that the gross

negligence test is sufficient to establish the offence of
manslaughter and we propose to advise accordingly.



(3) Neglect bv police

64.   When gross negligence or manslaughter by neglect is

alleged against the police, however, authority indicates a

more detailed test of liability. In R v West London Coroner's

Court, ex p Gray [1988] QB 467, allegations were made against

police following the death of a man while in police custody
concerning the use of force against him and failure to summon

an ambulance promptly when he became unconscious. The

coroner's directions to the jury as to unlawful killing were


                               26
quashed by the Divisional Court, which held that a coroner
directing a jury on manslaughter comprising unlawful killing

alleged to have occurred because of neglect by police was

required to direct them as follows:
      (1) that they had to be satisfied of four ingredients,
      namely (a) that the police were under a duty to have

      regard to the health and welfare of the deceased, (b)
      that in the circumstances there was a failure to do what

      should have been done for the health and welfare of the

      deceased, (c) that the failure amounted to a substantial

      cause of death, and (d) that the failure amounted to

      recklessness;

      (2) that the test of 11recklessness11 was whether a police
      officer, having regard to his duty, was indifferent to an

      obvious and serious risk to the health and welfare of the

      deceased or, recognising that risk to be present,

      deliberately chose to run it by doing nothing about it;

      (3) that a failure to appreciate that there was such a

      risk was not by itself sufficient to amount to
      recklessness; and

      (4) that the jury could only return a verdict of unlawful

      killing if they could attribute the unlawful conduct to a
      single police officer.



65.   Plainly those directions are those to be given in any

criminal prosecution of a police officer where omission to act

is alleged to have caused death. In our view they have a




                               27
1



I
    direct bearing on our consideration of the evidence in this

]   case.


1   (4) Culpable misfeasance
    66.     We turn next to consider the common law offence of
1
    culpable misfeasance or misconduct in public office. We are
    satisfied that this offence exists, and that it is committed
1
    where a public officer, such as a police officer, wilfully

1   neglects to perform a duty which he is bound to perform by

    common law or statute. But the neglect has to be wilful, not
1
    merely inadvertent, and must be culpable in the sense that it

    is without reasonable excuse or justification. The element of
1
    culpability is not restricted to corruption or dishonesty,

]   however, but must be of such a degree that the misconduct is

    calculated to injure the public interest: R v Dvtham [1979] 2

    QB 722.

]
    67.     Even if the words "likely to" are substituted for

j   "calculated" in this definition, as we think they might be, it

    is clear that this little known offence is a difficult one to
]   prove to the satisfaction of a jury.


1
    Evidence to support manslaughter

1
    68.     We consider in turn the possible liability of (i) the

    Club, (ii) Eastwood and Partners, (iii) the Council and (iv)
I   the police. It will be convenient to consider the evidence


I   first against the four organisations, and secondly in relation



I                                    28

]
I                                                                            t



        m



            to the individuals who acted on behalf of the organisations

            concerned.



            (i ) The Club
            69.   The Club1s responsibility for the crushing and deaths

            lies in its responsibility for (1) the layout of the inside of

            the ground as a result of the alterations to the West terrace

            and (2) the layout, number, designation and marking of the

            turnstiles in Leppings Lane. Whilst, on our factual analysis

            of the disaster, these two factors might be regarded as
            substantial causes of the deaths in that they contributed

            significantly to the result, it is clear not only that they
            were not the sole causes, or even the major causes, but that

            the Club1s actions and omissions only partly contributed to

            them. As already observed (see para 47 above), the layout of
            the ground was the responsibility of the four organisations

            and in varying degrees. The Club not only relied on its own

            consultant engineer Dr Eastwood, but it responded to the

            suggestions and advice of the police in important respects.

            The Council played its part.


            70.   For the purposes of the criminal law, where it is

            axiomatic that a case against each defendant must be given

            totally separate consideration, we consider that there is no

            sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case that the

            Club caused the deaths.




                                           29




    ■
#
    71.   In case we are wrong in that conclusion, we have

    considered whether the requisite intention for manslaughter

    could be proved against the Club. It seems to us, however,
    that the evidence does not begin to show either recklessness

    or gross negligence on its part.


    72.   It follows that there is in our view no sufficient
    evidence to support a charge of manslaughter against either

    the Club or any of its officials.



    (ii) Eastwood and Partners

    73.   Since Dr Eastwood was the principal of the firm, it is

    his actions and omissions alone that fall to be considered. As

    consultant to the Club he too was responsible for the layout

    of the inside of the ground and the layout and operation of
    the turnstiles. However, his advice formed part only of the

    sequence of events that led to the structural condition of the

    ground as it was immediately before the disaster and by no

    rational yardstick could his advice be said to have caused the

    deaths. There are two further factors in his case, moreover.

    First, his advice in relation to the forming of separate

    turnstile entrances to the North stand, each end of the West

    stand and each of the central plans, not acted on for

    financial reasons, would if adopted have led to numerical

    monitoring of the central pens, and might well have led to the

    insertion of maximum figures for those pens in compliance with

    the Safety Certificate. Second, so far as the Safety




                                   30
Certificate is concerned, this was the ultimate responsibility

of the Council.


74.   There is no evidence that Dr Eastwood caused the deaths.

Nor is there any evidence that he was either reckless or
grossly negligent. We have no hesitation, therefore, in

concluding that there is no evidence to support a charge of

manslaughter against Dr Eastwood or indeed against Eastwood
and Partners.



(iii) The Council

75.   The Council bears responsibility for the Safety

Certificate, which should have been amended to provide for the

alterations and for the insertion of maximum figures for the

pens. The Council was also responsible for ensuring compliance

with the Green Guide in the respects detailed above, as well

as in some other respects. There were departures from the
Green Guide, some more important then others. Of course, it

does not follow that the disaster would not have happened even

if the Safety Certificate had been amended, since compliance

depended on the Club and Dr Eastwood. In common with the Club

and Dr Eastwood, however, the Council's errors only partly

contributed to the ground conditions identified above as

causes of the deaths and on any view were too remote to amount

to a prima facie case of manslaughter. There is no evidence of
recklessness or gross negligence on their part.




                               31
76.   There is accordingly no evidence to support a charge of
manslaughter against Mr Bownes.



77.    It is unnecessary to consider the liability of the

Sheffield District Council for the errors of its predecessor,

the South Yorkshire County Council, though we would assume

such liability to have been inherited on the reorganisation.


(iv) The police

78.   The main responsibility for the disaster at Hillsborough

rests on the police in the respects identified above and

clearly set out in the Taylor Report. As an organisation they

were partly responsible for the layout of the inside of the

ground. They were responsible for the policy, heavily
criticised in the Taylor Report, whereby supporters were left

"to find their own level" and not monitored as they entered

the pens in semi-final matches. They were also partly

responsible for the Leppings Lane turnstiles and, together

with the Club, should have foreseen the difficulties of

admission of such large numbers. There was a serious failure
of policing in Leppings Lane, due in part to a failure to

follow filtering tactics used effectively in 1988.



79.   These errors too, however, can only be viewed as part of

a complex sequence of events, many of which were outside the

control of the police. The layout of the ground, both inside

and out, was the main responsibility of the Club as advised by

Dr Eastwood, with the Council and the Officer Working Party


                               32
superintending the alterations to the West terrace. Likewise,

the contents of the Safety Certificate were not the main
responsibility of the police. The difficulties inherent in the

policing of Leppings Lane, which were partly geographical, and

the arrival of supporters in very large numbers after 2.30 pm

were not and could not be under police control. Finally, the

unruly behaviour of a minority of them, although no doubt

foreseeable, created added difficulties.


80.   Once responsibility for the failure to postpone the kick-

off and to cordon off the access tunnel is confined to Mr

Duckenfield, as we consider it should be (see para 48 above),

the conclusion becomes inescapable in our view that the police
as an organisation cannot be said to have caused the deaths by

their strategy and operational errors.



81.   We have examined the structure of the police command,

both on the day of the disaster itself and in previous years.

We have considered the operational orders for 1988 and 1989
and police practice at Hillsborough, inside and outside the

ground, as detailed in the Taylor Report. We have also

considered the interviews of Mr Marshall and Mr Murray.
However, there seems to us to be no evidence that in making

what were undoubtedly errors of judgment and practice, the

police organisation, or any individual within it, acted

recklessly or in a grossly negligent manner either on the day
of the disaster or beforehand.




                                 33
82.   We accordingly find no basis on which to advise a charge

of corporate manslaughter against any directing mind within
the police organisation.



Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

83.   Mr Duckenfield was heavily criticised in the Taylor

Report for failing to cordon off the access tunnel, and his

decision not to postpone the kick-off was regarded as a bad

error of judgment. We think both of these criticisms are

entirely justified. Moreover, as the operational commander of

the match, he was ultimately responsible for the policing both

within and outside the ground. He was personally slow to
recognise the crushing or signs of distress in the central

pens which were going on before his eyes. He failed to notice
the gross imbalance of filling between those pens and the
outer wings which the video shows so clearly. His

preoccupation with the possibility of a pitch invasion caused

him to delay putting the Major Disaster Plan into operation.



84.   Yet Mr Duckenfield had under his command officers with

considerable experience of policing the match and the ground

who also made operational errors or failed to react as they

should have done. It is unnecessary to set out here the chain

of police command; suffice it to say that in the senior
positions were officers who had successfully policed

Hillsborough in previous years, particularly in 1988, when the

operation was regarded as successful. Under them were other

experienced inspectors and sector commanders. If the
#
    operational orders or police intelligence was inadequate, as

    seems likely, it was not the fault of Mr Duckenfield who

    inherited a ready made match plan compiled by others and tried

    to follow it. The slowness of his response to the disaster,

    while much to be regretted, was doubtless due in part to his

    lack of experience of this particular match.


    85.   Mr Duckenfield, who declined to be interviewed for the

    purposes of the criminal investigation, would no doubt argue

    that none of these errors caused the deaths because of the

    interposition of the many other factors already rehearsed. It

    seems to us that that argument would be likely to succeed in
    relation to many of the criticisms. However, there is a case

    to be made in our view that his failure both to postpone the
    kick-off and to take no action to close the tunnel after the

    opening of gate C was a substantial cause of the deaths, in

    that it significantly contributed to the crowd pressure which

    led to the crushing and the collapse of barrier 124A.



    86.   If that is so, it is necessary to consider whether there

    is evidence that Mr Duckenfield, when failing so to act, had

    the requisite intention to support a charge of manslaughter.



    87.   Clearly there was no unlawful and dangerous act on his
    part or intended by him which would found the first head of

    liability in involuntary manslaughter. But in failing to

    postpone the kick-off, or to order the closure of the tunnel

    after the opening of gate C, or both, did he intend an act


                                   35
which created an obvious and serious risk of causing personal

injury, either not giving thought to the possibility of such

risk, or having recognised that there was some risk involved,
nonetheless go on to take it?



88.     We consider that there are difficulties in proving that
he intended to do an act which created an obvious and serious
risk of causing personal injury. In the first place there was

no "act" as such, but an omission or omissions to act which

contributed to a rapidly developing state of affairs ending in

serious risk of injury. But was it an obvious risk at the

time? We think not. The complexity of the disaster as now

known to those who have analysed it in hindsight demonstrates

that there must be grave doubt as to whether the omissions

created a risk which was obvious to anyone at the time. The

considerations here are, of course, wholly different from the

driving cases or the collision at sea in the Kona Cheuk Kwan
case.



89.     We conclude, therefore, that there is insufficient

evidence on which to found a charge of recklessness against Mr

Duckenfield. Nor is there evidence that he was grossly

negligent in failing to act as mentioned above. We bear in

mind particularly the judgment of the Divisional Court in the

West London Coroner's Court case the requirements of which are
not in our view satisfied.
# •

      90.   It follows, and we have come to the clear conclusion,

      that there is no evidence that Mr Duckenfield was wilfully
      neglectful of his duty or was culpable so as to have committed

      the offence of culpable misfeasance.


      91.   We conclude that there is no sufficient evidence of any

      criminal offence having been committed by Mr Duckenfield.



      Police Constables Smith and Illingworth

      92.   We note the complaints made against these two officers

      who were stationed on the perimeter track at gates 3 and 4
      respectively and we have considered the interviews of both.

      There is conflicting evidence in the case of each as to how he

      reacted and when each gate was opened (see the West Midlands

      Report Part VII at pp 252 to 259) and in the case of Smith

      there is substantial doubt as to whether he pushed spectators,

      including the complainant Hendry and an unidentified boy, back
      into the crowd and if so when, ie whether before or after he

      had appreciated the true nature of the disaster.



      93.   There is no evidence before us that either of these

      officers was guilty of manslaughter or culpable misfeasance,

      and we advise that the allegations made against them be
      investigated further and if appropriate pursued in
      disciplinary proceedings.




                                     37
I   94.   The balance of allegations against the other officers

I   mentioned in the West Midlands Report must likewise be a

    matter for disciplinary proceedings.
I
I   95.   We therefore find no sufficent evidence to support
    criminal proceedings of any kind against those persons

I   mentioned in the West Midlands Report whom we have not found

    it necessary to identify in this Opinion.

                                  RE: HILLSBOROUGH


1        ISSUES

         1.1   I have been asked to review the Hillsborough Family Support Group letter of
               4th March 1997 and the attached Counsel’s Opinion with supporting
               documents. The letter requests the Director to convene a meeting with the
               above group and their legal representatives (Alun Jones QC and Ann
               Adlington, Solicitor) to discuss their ‘new’ evidence and the legal advice
               based upon it.

         1.2   A meeting was held at the Home Office on the 10th March 1997 with
               representative of their Operational Policing Policy Division, of the Legal        A
               Secretariat to the Law Officers ancFCPS Central Casework. It was decided          x
               that each of the three groups should report back to the OPPD having
               conducted separate reviews of the allegations made by Mr. Trevor Hicks and
               Alun Jones QC.

         1.3   Our Chief Crown Prosecutor, Dru Sharpling, has asked that she be given an
               indication of the likely time-scale for consideration of the papers by the 17th
               March 1997.

         1.4   On the 13th March 1997 I held a full days conference with Chief
                Superintendent Lowe and DC Greenaway of South Yorkshire Police at their
               offices in Sheffield. I was able to view original video tapes exhibited to the
               Taylor Enquiry and to the Coroner’s Hearing. I had access to the transcripts
               of those hearings and original witness statements.

2        BACKGROUND

         2.1   A copy of the Background Note concerning the Hillsborough Disaster and
               prepared for the then Attorney General in 1990 is attached (Appendix 1). It
                sets out the facts of the incident together with a precis of the CPS decision
               prior to the conclusion of the Coroner’s Hearings.

         2.2   The CPS Central Casework Briefing Note of 29th January 1997 (author Peter
                Pearson) gives the detail of the events up to that date (Appendix 2).

3        ALLEGATIONS

         3.1   The HFSG letter enclosed a further letter and a draft statement from Mr.
                Trevor Hicks, the opinion of Alun Jones QC and their Annexes A to G
                (comprising 7 volumes and 3 video tapes).

         3.2   The Director has been asked to examine the material and the key issues which
                are said to be involved, that is, fresh evidence proving suppression of
                evidence, Peijury and a Conspiracy to Pervert the Course of Justice in the

MMS/150.97
               legal process following the disaster.

         3.3   Mr. Hicks states that he has viewed certain video material provided to him
               from Yorkshire Television Archives (which had been supplied by South
               Yorkshire Police originally). He says that the videos clearly show that the
               scoreboard camera (No. 5) was working so that it could pan, tilt, zoom and
               show a picture clear enough to identify individuals. The clarity of the image
               was more than satisfactory and showed that therefore P.Cs Ryan and Bichard
               perjured themselves when giving evidence at the inquiry and inquest.

         3.4   He believes that the editor of the ‘Compilation Video’ shown to the Jury must
               have known of the existence of the extensive footage from Camera 5, and that
               this footage was not produced despite several requests from the Jury. This
               was the suppression of critical evidence that would have totally changed the
               Jury’s view of what the police could see.

         3.5   The Opinion of Alun Jones QC sets out the skeleton argument presented at the
               Divisional Court in 1993 at the application for Judicial Review of the Inquest
               Verdicts. The relevant points for the purpose of my report are those at 2.1
               and 2.2 concerning the 15.15 evidential cut-off point and exclusion of
               evidence that was said to indicate the later time at which many of the victims
               died.

         3.6   The Divisional Court rejected all the grounds put forward (and in fact stated
               that the overwhelming burden of evidence was that there was no prolongation
               of life beyond the period of about 10 minutes from the occurrence of the
               injury which led to asphyxia, and that there was clear evidence that bodily
               functions may continue and give a semblance of life when the prior occurrence
               of brain death renders the existence of life unlikely, if not impossible).

         3.7   However the Opinion states that the HFSG have a deep conviction that the
               legal system failed them and that they have been deceived about the
               circumstances of the deaths.

         3.8 ) Attached to it is the affidavit of a Roger Houldsworth, the engineer who
            / repaired and maintained the football ground’s camera equipment on the day.
        ~~     His evidence is that Camera 5 specifically gave clear pictures of the Leppings
               Lane Terraces where the deaths occurred. If this evidence is correct then it
               is said that the video tapes and Houldsworth’s evidence were deliberately
               suppressed and that officers therefore committed perjury (concerning the use
               which they could make of pictures from Camera 5). The point is made that
               Camera 5 pictures were visible on the police monitor between 14.30 and
                15.00 (although no video recording of them was taken).

         3.9   Alun Jones describes a video shown to him that depicts very badly duplicated
               and blurred pictures of individuals escaping from the stricken pens shortly
               after 15.00, and in which it is not possible to identify individuals. He has
               been told that this is the tape that was shown to the Jury. I agree with him

MMS/150.97
       that it appears to be a copy at several generations removed from the original
       video tape (Exhibit TB/2 to the Taylor Enquiry), but one that presents only
       the events after 15.00.

3.10   He says that a central issue at the inquest would be whether or not the police
       could and did notice the pressure on the Leppings Lane pens before 15.00.
       The evidence from the police (including P .C /s Ryan and Bichard) was that
       none of them noticed problems in the pens until 15.00. He believes that the
       existence of the evidence would have been of crucial significance to both the
       Divisional Court and the Inquest Jury.

3.11 j The Opinion then considers the evidence of a Dr. Walker which came to light
     / in February 1997. The Doctor’s letter of the 8 th February and the 13th
    y February 1997 state that he was voluntarily involved ii> resuscitation efforts
       of many of the Hillsborough victims who arrived at the Northern General
       Hospital. He says that the boy Philip Hammond was the first victim to arrive
       at the hospital and the first one that he attempted to resuscitate. He goes on
       to query of a senior hospital consultant why he was not contacted by the West
       Midlands Police to provide an official statement nor asked to appear at the
       Inquest. He states that in his statement (of 1989) he said that Philip had sinus
       rhythm and cardiac output which was at odds with the evidence given by a
       Dr. Slater to the Inquest. This undated statement describes the arrival of the
       first child in cardio-respiratory standstill and the instigation of routine cardio­
       pulmonary resuscitation. He continues that as far as he could recall sinus
       rhythm and (unidentified word) output were established at one stage although
       the boy’s pupils were fixed and dilated throughout. He believes that the boy
       has since died. He then gives detail of a second child arriving, also in a state
       of cardio-pulmonary arrest. Similar measures were carried out and this child
       was also brought back into sinus rhythm with a good output, though again
       with fixed dilated pupils throughout and subsequent death. This statement
       does not give patient names.

3.12   Alun Jones says that Dr. Walker’s statement shows serious criticisms of the
       reaction to the disaster, and that other victims were alive. Dr. Walker was
       asked by a consultant, Mr. Wardrope, to stand by to make a statement to the
       West Midlands Police. Dr. Walker was not called at the Inquest. Counsel
       considers that it would be difficult to exaggerate the significance of the
       concealment of Dr. Walker’s evidence which especially disagrees with that of
       Dr. Slater (where the evidence discloses the same pattern of rapid
       unconsciousness of victims leading to rapid death).

3.13   The conclusion of the Opinion is that these new pieces of evidence call for a
       full Police Enquiry or Public Enquiry, that Exhibit Tapes should be secured
       and subjected to Forensic Analysis and witnesses must be identified.

VIDEO EVIDENCE

4.1    The allegations are of Perjury by P.Cy Ryan and Bichard who were attending
               to the radio communications and camera monitors, of a Perverting the Course
               of Justice by way of suppression of vital video evidence of the crushing in the
               Leppings Lane Terraces and of Houldsworth’s evidence.

         4.2   P.C. Bichard’s evidence to the Taylor enquiry details the problems that had
               occurred with Camera 5 (the camera which gave the best view of the terraces)
               involving a loss of picture due to an electrical fault. He said that on the day
               the quality of the picture had improved but was still not up to the mark. He
               agreed that control facilities, for example, zoom, were fully available, but that
               because of the cameras position and angle of view there was a false
               impression created of the crowd and a difficulty in assessing overcrowding.
               It was said that the camera was not used as much as it normally would be
               because of these substandard pictures. There was some discussion about the
               accidental knocking of the video recorder control so that a particular recording
               ended earlier than it should have done. He told the Coroner that his
               recollection was that camera 5 was not really being used, just left in position.
               He first realised that there was anything untoward when people were seen
               climbing over the fence, but thought it was a pitch invasion. It would not
               have been sound judgement to make a decision on overcrowding based on the
               monitor. Because of what had been happening on Leppings Lane he did not
               get the chance to view the terraces until after 15.00

         4.3   P.C. Ryan’s evidence to the enquiry was similar to that of his colleague. The
               (monitor) picture was said to be very distorted and Houldsworth had worked
               on the equipment for some considerable time. As far as the officer recalled
               the picture was never satisfactory and it was its quality that was the problem.


         4.4   P.S. Goddard, another officer in the control box, said in evidence that it was
               not possible to tell that the pens were full from the control box. Nothing
               unusual was seen until people were seen climbing over the pens fence at about
               15.00

         4.5   Roger Houldsworth 1989 statement includes his perception of the crowd at
               Leppings Lane turnstiles seen from club CCTV end room monitors of the
               views taken from both the club and the police camera systems. He describes
               the pressure building up at the outside gates and turnstiles, the initial opening
               of Gate C and later the radio conversations regarding the likelihood of persons
               dying if a gate is not then opened. He saw the gate opened and a huge
               number of fans flooding in. Believing that a dangerous situation was being
               created he went down to the pitch. As the match was being stopped by the
               referee, he believed that a pitch invasion was in progress. It was not for two
               or three minutes before he surmised the correct situation that of crushing.

         4.6   His 1996 rebuttals of the police evidence concerning Camera 5 are:-

               •       Having checked Camera 5 and repaired the electrical fault it was
                       working correctly.

MMS/150.97
               •      He would have shown Ryan and Goddard that the cameras were
                      working correctly.

               •      The quality of Camera 5 ’s picture was never a problem (although he
                      admits that there was ‘flaring’ or whiteout of the picture).

               •      When watching the view from the police cameras he could clearly see
                      that the pens were full to the point of over-crowding when the order
                      was given to open the gates.

               •      Camera 5 was working perfectly.

               •      Facial features can be identified from the Camera 5 pictures except
                      while events are happening.

               •      P.C. Bichard’s assessment of camera angle and crowd density does not
                      make sense.

               •      He disagrees that it was difficult to assess that the pens were getting
                      over-crowded.

               •      It is highly unlikely that P.C. Bichard could have knocked the video
                      buttons and impossible that a switch could be flicked as claimed.

               •      Houldsworth makes further comments on police evidence concerning
                      their operation of other cameras in the system.

         4.7   There is no evidence to support the allegation that video evidence has been
                suppressed, only the belief of Mr. Hicks as to what was seen by the Jury.

5        REVIEW OF VIDEO EVIDENCE

         5.1   I have viewed the Taylor Enquiry Exhibits TB/1 and TB/2 and the Coroner’s
                Exhibit C 539.

         5.2   The latter is a large part of Exhibit TB/2, Part 4 which is a recording from
                Camera 5 between 15.03 and 15.25 of the front of the pens on the Leppings
               Lane Terraces. There are two original master copies of C 539 (taken from
                master copy of TB/2) and while they are reasonably clear the position and
                angle in my opinion makes any assessment of over-crowding to be difficult if
               not impossible. If the camera had been panned or its width of view increased
               then more might have been seen in those crucial minutes after 15.03.

         5.3   As TB/1 and 2 were available to the Taylor Enquiry, it cannot be said that
               they were suppressed. All of the enquiry exhibits were known to the legal
               teams involved in the inquest. I am satisfied that while TB/1 and 2 were not
               themselves shown to the Jury, the ‘compilation video’ and C 539 video were.
               The compilation included elements of both TB/1 and 2 tapes as well as the

MMS/150.97
                more colourful and harrowing media film.

         5.4    C 539 covers most of the Camera 5 footage between 15.03 and 15.25 and was
                shown to the Jury during the evidence of P.S. Killoch. A copy of the relevant
                part of the Inquest Transcript is attached (Appendix 3). However it can be
                seen that the officer makes a mistake when he describes the Exhibit as having
                the original identification of TB/1. My viewing confirms that it comes from
                the Exhibit TB/2 and agrees with the relevant schedule (Appendix 4).

         5.5    The video evidence has not been suppressed and I am satisfied that Alun
                Jones’ instructions about a poor quality copy of C 539 being shown to the
                Jury are incorrect. No mention is made in the transcript of any failing in that
                video, and the original copy held by the police is of a satisfactory quality.

         5.6    The HFSG case therefore depends on the perception of the value of any
                Camera 5 pictures whether seen on the monitor or as recorded by video
                taping. Houldsworth has one point of view based on his observations of all
                the monitors seen in the club CCTV room). His evidence in 1996 is that he
                could clearly see that the pens were full to overcrowding when the gate was
                opened leading to the fatal crushing. In 1989 his evidence is not so precise,
                only that a dangerous situation was developing. Here he says that it was not
                for two to three minutes after going down onto the pitch and viewing the pens
                that he realised there was not a pitch invasion. His later evidence is therefore
                at variance with his perceptions in 1989 and may well have been contaminated
                by later events.

         5.7    The HFSG would say that the control room police officers must have realised
                that crushing in the pens would occur just after 15.00 because there was a
                monitor able to show the camera view of those pens. Because this evidence
                of the ‘police view’ was deliberately not shown to the Jury then there was a
                Perverting of the Course of Justice and the Jury and Divisional Court would
                have come to a different verdict if it had been shown.

         5.8    My conclusion is that as the Jury did see Exhibit C 539 tape then they were
                able to assess what the police officers perceptions were said to be as against
                the Camera 5 pictures. There is no evidence to rebut the police account that
                they were concerned with a serious incident at the turnstiles and disregarded
                what they thought of as poor quality pictures from Camera 5. The Jury were
                able to compare the police account and the relevant video pictures and still
                come to a verdict of Accidental Death.

         5.9    I consider that the new allegations made concerning videos and what the
                officers must or should have perceived is not supported by evidence of
                sufficient quality to even pass the civil standard of proof.

6        M EDICAL EVIDENCE

         6 .1   While any application by the HFSG for a re-opening of the Inquest based on

MMS/150.97
      new Medical Evidence is within the province of the Home Office rather than
      the Crown Prosecution Service, Alun Jones QC does allege at paragraph 11
      of his Opinion that Dr. W alker’s evidence was concealed. In which case there
      must be a consideration of any evidence going towards the offence of
      perverting the course of justice. It is said that very serious questions arise as
      to the process by which evidence was selected by the West Midlands Police
      who assisted the Coroner. Alun Jones considered that one of the most striking
      aspects of the history of the case was the way in which the evidence presented
      at the Inquest was evidence which tended to exculpate the South Yorkshire
      authorities and the police from blame. The intimation must be of a conspiracy
      to pervert the course of justice between at the very least the two police forces.
      Following the conclusions of the Divisional Court in the Judicial Review of
      the Coroner’s Hearings it would be difficult for further allegations to be made
      against the Coroner without sufficient supporting evidence. That only leaves
      the two police forces as possible offenders.

6.2   Dr. W alker’s evidence which is contained within Annex ‘F ’ of the HFSG
      papers has been described previously         In essence he is saying that
      Hillsborough victims arrived at the Hospital, where he had volunteered to do
      emergency duty, in a state of cardiac and respiratory arrest. Because the
      hearts of a number of these persons were re-started, although they
      subsequently died, the intimation must be that for the purposes of the Inquest,
      death occurred after 15.15.

6.3   The question for me to consider is whether or not the alleged omission in
      taking a statement from him was done with the intent to suppress that evidence
      because it would have embarrassed the police and/or led to a different verdict
      from the Jury.

REVIEW OF M EDICAL EVIDENCE

7.1   The Judicial Review of the Medical Evidence found that Drs. Gumpert and
      Slater and Professor Usher were as one in that once a victim’s chest was fixed
      (when crushing occurs) then irrecoverable brain damage will ensue in 4- 6
      minutes. It was submitted before the Divisional Court that the Coroner
      wrongly refused to call evidence of the two doctors because that evidence fell
      after the cut-off point. This evidence also concerned alleged signs of life in
      victims after 15.15. The court stated that this other evidence would not have
      made the slightest difference to the result if it had been given at the Inquest.
      They commented on the plain and virtually unchallenged evidence of the
      pathologist. That new evidence would not have caused the Coroner to change
      his cut-off point. There was clear evidence that bodily functions may continue
      and may give a semblance of life when the prior occurrence of brain death
      renders the existence of life unlikely if not impossible.

7.2   The court held that the inquisition was correctly completed and that there was
      no good reason for ordering a new inquest or for merely quashing the existing
      verdicts. The purpose of fresh inquests was queried. If it was to get a verdict
               criticising the police, then such criticism had already been firmly levelled by
               the Taylor Report. The police had admitted fault and paid compensation.
               Further there was no evidence to justify criticism of the emergency services.
               The words of Turner J at page 42 of the Court Transcript shows the detail in
               which the Coroner led evidence that might have persuaded pathologists to
               form different conclusions from those expressed at the preliminary inquests.

        7.3    I do not consider that Dr. Walker’s observations as made in his personal
               statement of 1989 and the letters of 1997 comprise such vital new evidence as
               to show that the life of Philip Hammond continued after the cut off period of
               15.15.

        7.4    Dr. Walker contends that he was not asked to make a statement by the police
               (whether it be the West Midlands or West Yorkshire Police as he states in two
               different letters). However the police file which I have seen contains Dr.
               W alker’s manuscript statement of the 20th July 1989 as obtained by the West
               Midlands Police. Each page is signed by him and witnessed by two other
               persons. It is somewhat different to his undated personal statement which is
               said to have been made in 1989. In the police statement he says that he
               attended to the first casualty to arrive, a boy he knows only as "Lee", and
               who he believed was declared brain dead in the Intensive Care Unit two days
               later. The patient was in cardio-pulmonary arrest with fixed dilated pupils.
               The heart had stopped beating but the medical team managed to re-establish
               normal rhythm. While the boy was being treated the second victim arrived
               also in cardio-pulmonary arrest. This boy was also established in a normal
               sinus heart rhythm but again the pupils were fixed and dilated throughout and
               it is believed that the boy has since died. The description given by Dr.
               Walker of this second boy fits that of the victim Philip Hammond.

         7.5   The Doctor’s evidence concerning these first two victims shows that both
               arrived without signs of life apparent. Although a normal heart rhythm was
               established it could not be sustained and the two boys eventually died. I
               understand that Lee’s bodily functions were maintained for two days as he was
               to be an organ donor.

         7.6   However, the Doctor’s letter of 8/2/97 to Mr. Wardrope says that Philip
               Hammond was the first victim that he attempted to resuscitate and that
               recollection is presumably based on the undated 1989 personal statement.
               Here he describes the establishment of sinus rhythum and cardiac output in the
               first two victims he treated (no names are given) and that both had fixed and
               dilated pupils throughout and subsequently were believed to have died. The
               HFSGT Annex F concerning his evidence is attached at Appendix 5. This
               includes the part of Mr. Wardropes evidence that applies to Philip Hammond
               where his interpretation of the Medical Notes is that a cardiac tracing at the
               time showed no cardiac activity, and a typed copy of Dr.W alker’s police
               statement.

      ISSUE

1.1   What action should this Department take in the light of the
      transmission of the Hillsborough drama/documentary on the
      5 December 1996, and subsequent correspondence.

2.    ACTION REQUIRED

2.1   Present position to be established with the South Yorkshire
      Police and all other interested parties.

2.2   A response is required to an enquiry raised by David Alton
      MP on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

3.    TIMING

3.1   Response to David Alton is required by   31 January 1997

4.    BACKGROUND

4.1   The Hillsborough Disaster was and       still remains  an
      unparalleled occurrence of our time and led not only to a
      fundamental re-appraisal  of safety at public events, but
      has since resulted in precedents being set in the Civil
      Courts as to what might constitute post traumatic stress.

4.2   For a detailed understanding of what then followed the
      original background note prepared for the then Attorney
      General together with its accompanying annexes remains
      valid. (Appendix I)

4.3   At the conclusion of the re-commenced inquest verdicts of
      accidental death were returned on all the victims.

4.4   The proceedings at the Coroner's Court were challenged by
      way of Judicial Review. The Divisional Court however found
      nothing upon which they felt that they could question the
      actions of that Court.

4.5   On Thursday 5 December 1996 the independent television
      network screened a drama/documentary based on the disaster
      written and produced by one Jimmy McGovern.

4.6   The screening of this programme and in particular certain
      parts of its content has resulted in eight of the deceased
      families writing both to this Department and in some cases
      to either the Home Secretary, the Attorney General or both
      asking that both the original inquest be set aside and that
      a new criminal investigation be commenced in the light of
      the new evidence disclosed in the programme. In addition it
      would appear that the Hillsborough Family Support Group has
      also written to every member of Parliament generally, and
      in particular to David Alton MP. who has forwarded a copy
      of the same to the Director.
4.7     On the 17 December 1996 the Home Secretary was required to
        respond in the House to an Adjournment Debate specifically
        on this matter. A transcript of what then took place is
        attached. (Appendix II)

4.8     Following on from this debate the Home Secretary wrote to
        the Chief Constable for South Yorkshire Police asking him
        to express a view on certain issues that have been raised
        by the programme and requesting answers to 10 specific
        questions. A copy of this letter has been obtained via LSLO
        and is attached. (Appendix III)

4.9     A copy of the programme has been obtained and this has been
        viewed by this office. Contact has also been established
        with the South Yorkshire Police Officers who are dealing
        with this matter and they have been invited to attend these
        offices during the week commencing 27 January 1997, so that
        we can be briefed as to what the current position i s .

5.    KEY   CONSIDERATIONS

5.1   The three   crucial    questions that   fall   to be   considered
       are:-

5.1.1       Has any "new" evidence come to light arising from the
             screening of the TV programme ?

5.1.2       Does this evidence support the view that one or more
             Police Officers may have committed perjury at the
             Coroners Court; and

5.1.3       Is there now sufficient doubt for the Attorney General
             to be asked    once more to consider exercising his
            powers under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 to
             require a fresh inquest to be held.

6.      RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1     At present this Department has insufficient evidence upon
        which any substantive decision can be made.

6.2     Once the Chief Constable has reported to the Home Secretary
        it is recommended that a meeting is held between this
        Department, the Home Office and the LSLO (as LSLO propose)
        so that it can be established, 1) whether or not a further
        enquiry is to commence and if so 2) in what form and 3) to
        agree how any further enquiries either from the HFSG,
        relatives of the deceased or the media generally will be
        handled so as to avoid any possibility of confusion between
        us.

6.3     A detailed reply either to David Alton MP or the families
        would therefore seem inappropriate at this stage. It is
        therefore recommended that any present response draws upon
        both the existing letter that has been sent previously by
        the Law Officers on behalf of the Attorney General, a copy
        of which is attached,(Appendix IV) together with their
        amended version created in the light of the additional
      points that have been made in the HFSG circular,    sight of
      which is awaited.

7.    CONCLUSION

7.1   That until such time    that this Department   is satisfied
      whether a further criminal investigation is    justified or
      not, that no action    is taken from which     it could   be
      misconstrued that this Department either has   or intends to
      re-open the Hillsborough Enquiry.

      of 4th March have been fully considered. I regret this means that we shall no longer be able

      matter is receiving our immediate consideration.




      Yours sincerely,

ISSUE

1.1     What action should this department take following the approach made by the
        Hillsborough Family Support Group and their legal representatives in their
        correspondence of 4th March 1997.

ACTION REQUIRED

2.1     A decision should be made taking into consideration the CPS Central
        Casework Report and its appendices of the 20th March 1997 (Appendix 1 to
        this briefing note).

2.2     A co-ordinated approach is required by the various legal departments involved
        in reviewing the HSFG representations.

TIM IN G

3.1     A substantive answer should be given to the HSFG as soon as possible.

BACKGROUND

4.1     The background is fully set out in Appendices 1 and 2 to the attached Central
        Casework Report.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS

5.1     The Central Casework briefing note of 29th January 1997 mentioned three
        crucial questions that fall to be considered :-

5.2     Has any "new" evidence come to light arising from the TV screening of the
        Hillsborough Drama/Documentary on the 5th December 1996.

5.3     Does this evidence support the view that one or more police officers may have
        committed perjury at the Coroner’s Court or otherwise attempted to obstruct
        the course of justice.

5.4     Is there now sufficient doubt for the Attorney General to be asked once more
        to consider exercising his powers under Section 13 of the Coroner’s Act 1988
        to require a fresh inquest to be held.

RECOM M ENDATIONS

6.1     That the Central Casework Report of the 20th March 1997 attached at
        Appendix 1 be adopted.
V




                 6.2    The evidence put forward by the HFSG concerns two separate aspects of the
                        Hillsborough disaster enquiry, that is, alleged suppression of video evidence
                        which would go towards proving criminal misconduct by police officers and
                        the suppression of medical evidence that would show grounds for the re­
                        opening of inquests based on a later cut off point for the death of the victims.

                 6.3    On the first point there has been no suppression of any video evidence and the
                        inquest jury were able to consider the relevant videos and compare them with
                        the observations made by police during the giving of their evidence under
                        oath. The ju ry ’s verdict was therefore made after all the relevant material
                        was put before them. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that police
                        officers committed perjury at the Coroner’s Court or were involved in
                        Perverting the Course of Justice.

                 6.4    On the second point, the credibility of the medical witness put forward by the
                        HFSG is greatly weakened by the mistakes and discrepancies in the evidence
                        that doctor would put forward. Similar evidence was considered by the
                        Divisional Court during judicial review of the Coroner’s Hearings and was
                        found to have little merit.

                 6.5    There are no grounds for asking the Attorney General to consider exercising
                        his powers under Section 13 of the Coroner’s Act 1988 in requiring a fresh
                        inquest to be held.

                 6 .6   It is understood that both the Police Policy Directorate at the Home Office and
                         the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers have come to the same conclusion.

    7            CONCLUSION

                 7.1    That a co-ordinated approach should be taken by the various departments
                        involved as to how the HFSG representations should be actioned.

          HILLSBOROUGH

          I attended a meeting at the Home Office earlier this week at which Peter
          Pearson was present. All aspects of the Hillsborough issue were discussed.

          I have since reported to the Attorney General. His present position is that
          none of the material put forward following the ITV drama documentaiy touches
          on the issues based in the applications which he has already considered under
          Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988. He has received no further such
          applications but, should he do so, they would be carefully considered in the
          usual way.
          It was clear from what Peter Pearson said that the CPS consider it unlikely that
          their consideration of the further material will lead to the conclusion that there
          should be any further criminal investigation along the lines suggested by the
          Hillsborough Families Support Group. The purpose of this letter is to point up
          the interest of the Attorney General in that issue also and ask that he be
          informed once the CPS has reached a considered view so that he has an
          opportunity to comment before any announcement is made.

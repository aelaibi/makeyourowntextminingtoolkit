Liverpool           supporters           who      ha d    become          abusive       when       not     allowed        into          the

pub.        They     quietened           down and             asked       where     else         they    could      get       a

dri n k .      We    told      them      the      best        way was       to m a k e       their       way    down      to       the

ground,        but     I must        a d d at      this        t ime      selected          people       who    were      suitable

were    allowed           entry      into        the     public        house.          We    then       returned         to       our

p o s i t i o n at     th e    Station.

We    then     received a            radio        message           for    our     serial         to a t t e n d    at    a

Supermarket            on a       side      road       about        400    yards       from       our     position.               The

general        message         was    ’P r o b l e m s        with     supporters            ~    drinking         on    the

streets’,            Along        with      15 oth e r         officers          and     a Sherpa          van a t t e n d e d .

All     quiet       on a r r i v a l ,      but    a     l arge      amount        of L i v e r p o o l      supporters             in

the     excess       of     150    sat      on    the     grass        banking         outside          shops      drinking

from     the    cans,         they were           noisy,        but       caused       no    real       problems.             We    then

returned        to     our     p o s i t i o n at        the    Station.            Whilst         walking         down       the

r o ad w i t h PC C a m m o c k ,           we    were        approached           by a g r o u p         of L i v e r p o o l

supporters           three        adults         one     of w h i c h w a s        wearing         a Glasgow            Rangers

shir t.        With       t h e m was       one     smal l      boy.        T he y were           carrying         a fold          up

stoo l.        We    advised         t h e m t h at       they       would       probably          not     be a l l o w e d        in

with     this       stool.         They      said        they       had    only      taken        this     to    the     game       so

the     little        lad     could       see     onto        the    pitch,        and      they agree d           to take          it

back     to    their        motor      vehicle.

By     this    time       I saw       la rge      numbers           of L i v e r p o o l     supporters            making          the ir

way     down    the       main     road,         carrying           packs     of     beer a n d         lager.          T h e y were

 very       boisterous         shouting           and     singing.

 I noticed          one     youth        in p a r t i c u l a r      about        18-19 years             about     5 * 9 U tall,

 heavily       b u ilt      wearing         Union        Jack       snorts,        was      singing         louder       than

 anyone       around        him.       He     definitely              appeared         worse        tor     dr inn.       His
mates        a p p e a r e d , to         be    telling         him       to    keep       quiet.           They     then     moved       on

down       the m a i n           road.

I then          heard          a message           over        the    r a d io       ’A s s i s t a n c e     required        outside

Public          House,           Neaps         End,      PC    having          problems’.

Not      knowing              any areas           of S h e f f i e l d         I asked          PC C a m m o c k     was     it    close       by

he     informed             me      it w a s n ’t.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y           2.00       pm the        train          carrying          the     supporters           arrived.

On     leaving              station        arrangements               made          to    hold     them       together        outside

the      public             house      (name       not        known).           The       supporters           all    age     grou ps,

both       sexes,             were     v e r y w ell          behaved.              No    singing        or    chanting,           no

evidence               of     drink,       made        their        way    from          off    the P l a t f o r m    down        the

step s.               We w e r e     then       joined         by    two       mounted          officers,          I believe            from

South Yorkshire.

The      supporters                 were       held      for    approximately                   5 minutes          in the         small

triangular                  area     outside           the     public          house.

.T. n o t i c e d        that       two       m e n at    the       rear       of    the       supporters          were      carrying          tea

urns.           We       were       then       instructed            to    escort          the     supporters           to    the

football               ground.            This     was        contrary          to       the    order       and also         it was

rather           unusual            considering               the    supporters                were    so     quiet     a n d well

We     escorted               the    supporters               down    the       main       road,       arriving         outside          the

Leppings               Lane      entrance           at    a p p r o x i m a t e 1y 2 . 1 5         pm.        No   problems

experienced                     with      the     supporters              from       leaving          the     station        to    a r r i v i ?iy

outside               the     ground.

They        then made               their        way     to    the    queues             that     were      forming        outside        the

turnstile                area,       outside           Leppings            Lane.

     allocated,                 I was        then instructed                   by I n s p e c t o r     Ellis       to    move

     had       been      produced           but       I myself          never        saw a n y        forged     tickets,

     2910,        2969,         1679,       451       and    myself           were    patrolling area                    of    pavement                on

     the       bridge        generally            moving           supporters            along.          We    spoke          to    one

      elderly man               (grey       hair,       wearing           a    l i ght      brown Crombie                jacket          aged

     about        65-70),         numerous             supporters              approached             him a s k i n g         him    for

      ' s p ares',           I said         to    him       " What       do    they      mean      by s p a r e s ' .          He    said

      'They're           asking        me    if       I'm    selling           tickets'.               In fact       several

      supporters             asked       this         elderly        man       for    spares,           evidently             they       had

      travelled without                     tickets.

 There       seemed         a general                complaint           from Liverpool                    supporters              of    the

 entering            at    the    turnstiles.

 One      middle          aged    Liverpool              supporter              came          up to me       and       mentioned             in

 pointed         oyl       that       they       d o n ’t a r r i v e         all        at    the    same       time.

 The      tijre now a b o u t              2,50       pm,        I was        surprised              to    see    a    l a rge        amount            of

 sfcyftrters              climbing          onto       the w all          above           the    turnstiles,                 I mentioned

Othis      to PC          Cammock,          and also             t hat    they           seemed       to w a i t       several           seconds

 before         jumping          off       the       wall    into        the     ground ,

 A Police            Officer          I believe             an    Inspector               then appea red               on    the        wall      the

 climbing            ceased       but       he was          lifting           sma ll          children       from          the     developing

 c r u s h to        safety.

 Again myself               a n d PC        Cammock          went        to     give          what    assistance             we- could,

 and      I myself          could          feel       the    force        of     the          crowd a n d        I withdrew              further

 back      towards          the       road.

 I seemed            to    recollect             earlier, h e a r i n g              a    radio       message          requesting

 but      I saw       the    buses          were       s t ill     moving            through          the    crowd,          forcing             them

 Lane.          I also       f elt         in    relation          to     the        entrance             outside          Leppings         Lane

On    this     occasion          we    kept      the         crowds        b ack    outside          the m e t a l             railings

and    gates       to a l l o w . m y s e l f        and      other        officers           to    carry           out       searches

etc.        Also       there     seemed         to      be a g e n e r a l         lack       of    information                    coming

from    within          the      ground       from       ground           control        via the             radio        or       the

public       address          system,         either          giving        information              to       us,        or

information             and      requests         e t c . , to t h e            crowd.

The m o od        of    the      crowd       by t his         ti me       was    growing           more       volatile              but       no

evidence          of    violence         towards             us,     but    they were              continuing                 to    push.            A

Land    Rover          containing            a P.C.          w h i c h was       parked        to    the          extreme           left       o-f

the    turnstile          area         began       to    edge        in s l o w l y      in a n a t t e m p t             to       slow       d ow n

the    movement          of      the    crowd.           He     then       had     to    stop       because              of    the       sheer

weight       of    numbers.             He    then       left        the    position            in the             cab a n d        standing

on    the    step was            shouting          loudly           for    the     supporters                to     stop       p u shing,

but    the     c r ow d a p p e a r e d       not       to    hear        this?     or    take          no    notice.

Inspector          Ellis         then appeare d               with        a megaphone/hailer                        and       began       to

shout       ’L i v e r p o o l    supporters?                please        stop     pu s h i n g "       this         was      repeated

several        times.

At    this     stage       I didn't           see       anything           to    indicate           the       impending

disaster          even     though        there          was     a    large       crowd        but       this        is    usual          for
                                                                                                                                                             i

It w o u l d      be a b o u t     t his      t ime       I heard          over     my     personal                r a di o    somebody

making       reference            to a       ’c a t a s t r o p h e * .     I had        no     i dea w h o s e           voice          or

Control,          it    seemed         strange.

I was       then a p p r o a c h e d         by a n o t h e r        Liverpool           sj/fspo r t e r who              produced a

but    I i / k s still           surprised             to     see    it     open.

I p w i nted           out this             to     the      enquiring           Liverpool           supporter and               he

smarted         to w a l k         over.

At    this      time        I heard           from       other       officers           that    the       g ame      had    been

delayed         unt il       3.13        pm.        I told ap p ro ac hi ng                  supporters           'Don't            rush,

loud      ch eer       or        roar       likened           to a goal           scoring       chance.              A group         of

supporters             close--by s a i d               'What's        t hat       then*,       I rep l i e d :        ’C o u l d      be    the

usually         come        out     ten m in ut es             before        start.           One    Liverpool             supporter

made      a    comment           t hat      the     start       had       not     been       delayed and             that       I was

lying.          There        were        sti ll        odd     supporters             asking        for    spare       tickets.

I saw PC          Rose       having           problems          with        one      youth,     apparently             he       didn't

I then         saw     that       the       large        blue       g ate    t h at     had    been       opened       earlier             was

message         something              to     the      effect        'All       serials        or    personnel             o nto      the

emergency            code        'Mr,       Meadows           urgently          r e q u i r e d at     the      Police          Room.*

I then         ran     through a              large         b lue    g ate      to    the     extreme        right         of       the

turnstile            area.          I ran t h r o u g h             into     the      area     behind        the      Leppings             Lane

stand         then     to    the       right        towards          the     rear       of    the    Control          Box.           To    my

left      I could           see     terracing               (extreme         r i g ht    hand       cor n e r     of L e p p i n g s

L a ne)       seemed        to    be     plenty          of    room.         I could          see    no    players          on       the

pitch,         but     I couldn't                see     any    fighting.

I then         eventually              made        my w a y     o nto       the      pitch     via a g a n g w a y          in the

see    large         numbers           of     officers          on the          pitch and           standing          on    the

REPORT
STATEMENT OF ALAN ANDREW RAMSDEN PC 2547

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE, ROTHERHAM.


At 8.30 a.m.,   on Saturday 15th April 1989,   I commenced

duty at Main Street Police Station,    Rotherham,   along with

the rest of the serial.     We left Main Street at approximately

9.10 a.m. arriving at Hillsborough Football Ground, where w

attended at the North stand where we received briefing at

10.00 a.m.    for the duties involved in the F.A.   Cup Semi-final

Liverpool V Nottingham Forest.     The briefing was given by

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and a Superintendent

Murray and D.S.    Charlesworth Crime Intelligence.

My duty for that day was attached to serial 37 in charge of

the serial was Inspector Ellis, and the serial Sergeant was

PS 2822 Kennedy.

Our duty was to meet arriving Liverpool supporters on one train

at Wadsley Bridge Railway Station at approximately 2.00 p.m. then

stand-by duty after meal.     After the briefing we left the North

stand and with other officers from Rotherham made our way

to the rear of the gymnasium where all three serials from

Rotherham had a short briefing given by Inspector Ellis.

After this we made our way on foot up to Wadsley Bridge      'Station'

we arrived at approximately 11.15 a.m.      It was very quiet

no sign of any supporters or of anything amounting to football

supporters.     Most of my serial including myself went up the steps

onto the platform,    after about 5 minutes we were requested to

leave the platform by I believe a Chief Inspector from South

Yorkshire Police.       The reason given was that it was Railway propert

We were instructed to await the arrival of the fans at the bottom

of the steps.      There would be two serials at the bottom of
                              - 2 -



the steps.     The others serial Sergeant was PS 1829 France

the third serial from Rotherham was carrying out supervision

of arriving Mini buses from Liverpool, at the side of the

Railway public house.        The Sergeant   in charge of this serial

was DS 182 Tissington.

While stood at the bottom of the steps we saw one or two

football coaches travel down the main road towards Hillsborough

all seemed orderly.

The Public House directly adjacent to the Railway station name

not known had all it's windows boarded up.           A short time later

with PC 260 Shipman, we were instructed to go over to speak

to DS 182 Tissington.        Also present was the Landlord of the

Railway Hotel a                       He expressed concern about

supporters who wanted to go in the          'pub.'   He requested Police

attendance to supervise but there were no problems existing at

this time and told him we would return if required to do so.

We went back to the bottom of the steps, present at this time

parked in a car some 100 yards up from our position was a

British Transport Police vehicle containing            a Police

Sergeant     1682 or 1672.    He informed me that only four - five

of his officers would be travelling with the Liverpool supporters

on the train and he believed there would be a total of some

450 travelling supporters from Liverpool.            There would also be

one dog man from British Transport Police, to meet the arriving

train.

By this time several small groups of Liverpool supporters were

making their way down towards the ground.            Groups of all ages

both sexes,     good natured, well behaved,      no problems at all.

It would be about this time we were requested by the Landlord

of the Railway public house to attend at his premises along

with PS Kennedy and PC 2910 Cammock we were requested to

have   'words' with several Liverpool supporters who had become

abusive when not allowed into the pub.       They quietened down

and asked where else they could get a drink.       We told them the

best w ay was to make their way down to the ground, but I must

add at this time selected people who were suitable were allowed

entry into the public house.       We then returned to our position

at the Station.

We then received a radio message for our serial to attend

at a Supermarket on a side road about 400 yards from our position.

The general message was    'Problems with supporters - drinking on

the streets'.     Along with 15 other officers and a Sherpa van

attended.    All quiet on arrival,    but a large amount of Liverpool

supporters in the excess of 150 sat on the grass banking outside

shops drinking from the cans, they were noisy,      but caused no

real problems.     We then returned to our position at the Station.

Whilst walking down the road with PC Cammock, we were approached

by a group of Liverpool supporters three adults one of which was

wearing a Glasgow Rangers shirt.       With them was one small boy.

They were carrying a fold up stool.       We advised them that they

would probably not be allowed in with this stool.       They said

they had only take this to the games so the little lad could

see onto the pitch, and they agreed to take it back to

their motor vehicle.

By this time I saw large numbers of Liverpool supporters making

 their way down the main road,     carrying packs of beer and lager.

 They were very boisterous shouting and singing.
                         - 4 -



I noticed one youth in particular about 18 - 19 years about

5'9" tall, heavily built wearing Union Jack shorts, was singing

louder than anyone around him.      He definitely appeared worse

for drink.    His mates appeared to be telling    him to keep   quiet.

They then moved on down the main road.

I then heard a message over the radio      'Assistance required outside

Public House, Neeps End, PC having problems'.

Not knowing any areas of Sheffield I asked PC Cammock was

it close by he informed me it wasn't.

At approximately 2.00 p.m.,      the train carrying the supporters

arrived.     On leaving station arrangements made to hold them

together outside the public house      ( name not known).   The supporters

all age groups both sexes, very well behaved.       No singing or

chanting, no evidence of drink, made their way from off the

Platform down the steps.     We were then joined by two mounted

officers,    I believe from South Yorkshire.

The supporters were held for approximately 5 minutes in          the

small triangular area outside the public house.

I noticed that two men at the rear of the supporters were

carrying tea urns.     We were then instructed to escort the

supporters to the football ground.       This was contrary to the

order and also it was rather unusual considering the supporters

were so quiet and well behaved.

We escorted the supporters down the main road, arriving

outside the Leppings Lane entrance at approximately 2.15 p.m.

No problems experienced with the supporters,      from leaving

 the station to arriving outside the ground.

 They then made their way to the queues that were forming outside

 the turnstile area,    outside Leppings Lane.
                           - 5 -



Already there was a large amount of supporters outside the ground

but this was not unusual considering it was a Semi-final.                I

was approached by several supporters at different times and

asked a question       'We live in Derbyshire purchased tickets at

Nottingham Forest, but would like to stand with Liverpool

supporters'.        I advised them that they must stand in areas

to where the tickets are allocated.            I was then instructed by

Inspector Ellis to move supporters standing on pavements across

the road from Leppings Lane,          instructing them that if

they had a ticket to make their way into the ground if no

ticket to go home.

We were receiving feed back that tickets were being sold

outside a pub end of Leppings Lane           (name not known), and also

that forged tickets had been produced but I myself never saw

any forged tickets.
       2P te l                                            .          c
 2910, .26-9^, 1679,    451, and myself were patrolling area or

 pavement on the bridge generally moving supporters along.

 We spoke to one elderly man          (grey h a i r ,wearing a light brown

 Crombie jacket aged about 65-70) numerous supporters approached

 him asking him for       'spares'.     I said to him   'What do they

 mean by spares.'        He said   'They're asking me if I'm selling

 tickets.'        In fact several supporters asked this elderly man for

 spares, evidently they had travelled without tickets.

 By this time approximately 2.35 p.m. the numbers of people

 outside the turnstiles were growing.            What seems strange they

 didn't appear to be any Policemen in the immediate vicinity

 of the turnstiles, to creat a small sterile area between the

 queueing supporters and the actual turnstile.             There was no definite

  queues.    With 2910 we went amongst this crowd outside the

  turnstiles to assist in forming some kind of order.              The numerous

  times we were asked by Liverpool supporters            'Which is the North

  Stand'         'Which is the Leppings Lane standing area.'
                          - 6 -



•Which is the West Stand?'        and      'Which is the South Stand?'

There didn't appear to be any clear signs to instruct the fans

where to go.    At this time I saw outside the Leppings Lane

entrances Superintendent Marshall,          and a Chief Inspector

(name not known to me).

At this point PC Cammock and myself moved out of the crowd

to assist a man pushing a wheelchair, who requested assistance

to get through the crowd into the North Stand.

We escorted him over to PC Rose, and PC Morton,          and they

took over.     I believe they managed to get him into the

ground.

There seemed a general complaint from Liverpool supporters

of the size of the crowds gathering and the slowness in being

dealt with entering at the turnstiles.

One middle aged Liverpool supporter came up to me and mentioned

in relation to the crowd gathering that they had the same

attendance every other week at Liverpool and manage much better.

 In reply to this I pointed out that they don't arrive all at

the same time.

 The time now about 2.50 p.m.           I was surprised to see a

 large amount of supporters climbing onto the wall above the

 turnstiles.    I mentioned this to PC Cammock,        and also that

 they seemed to wait several seconds before          jumping off the wall

 into the ground.

 A Police Officer I believe an Inspector then appeared on the

 wall the climbing ceased but he was lifting small children

 from the developing crush to safety.

 Again myself and PC Cairanock went to give what assistance we

 could, and I myself could feel the force of the crowd and

 I withdrew further back towards the road.
                           - 7 -



I seemed to recollect earlier hearing a radio message requesting

Public transport to be stopped from travelling along Leppings Lane

but I saw the buses were still moving through the crowd, forcing

them over   towards the turnstiles in the bottleneck area outside

Leppings Lane.     I also felt in relation to the entrance outside

Leppings Lane end that there should have been some sort of

semi-sterile area. We that is Rotherham officers had this

particular duty for the F.A. Cup Semi final in 1987 which was

played between Leeds United and Coventry C i t y .

On this occasion we kept the crowds back outside the metal

railings and gates to allow myself and other officers to carry

out searches,    etc.   Also there seemed to be a general lack of

information coming from within the ground from ground control

via the radio or the public address system,     either giving

information to us, or information and requests etc., to the

crowd.

The mood of the crowd by this time was growing more volatile

but no evidence of violence towards us, but they were continuing

to push.    A Land Rover containing a P.C. which was parked to

the extreme left of the turnstile area began to edge in slowly

in an attempt to slow down the movement of the crowd.      He then

had to stop because of the sheer weight of numbers.      He then

 left the position in the cab and standing on the step was

 shouting loudly for the supporters to stop pushing, but the

 crowd appeared not to hear this, or take no notice.

 Inspector Ellis then appeared with a megaphone/hailer and

 began to shout    'Liverpool supporters, please stop pushing'     this

 was   repeated several times.
                                                                            2> h*f~

                        - 8 -



At this stage I didn't see anything to indicate the impending

disaster even though there was a large crowd but this is usual

for big games.

It would be about this time I heard over my personal radio

somebody making reference       to a 'Catastropfce' .    I had no    idea

whose voice or whose call       sign it was.    We were still receiving

nothing from Match control,      it seemed strange.

I was then approached by another Liverpool supporters who

produced a ticket to me and enquired the location of the

North stand.     I indicated the general direction of the North

stand and saw that a large double blue gate to the extreme

left of the turnstile area open, about          3 - 4ft.   People were

not rushing in it seemed as if someone was checking tickets

and using this as an extra turnstile,          but I was still surpirsed

to see it open.

I pointed out this to the enquiring Liverpool supporter and

he started to wal k over.

At this time I heard from other officers that the game had

been delayed until     3.15 p.m.    I told approaching supporters

 'Don't rush, the start now delayed'           The time about now 3.00 p.m.

 I then heard a loud cheer or roar likened to a goal scoring

 chance.    A group of supporters close-by said         'What's that then'

 I replied:    'Could be the teams coming out.'         I checked my watch

 thinking     that's unusual, they usually come out ten minutes

 before start.     One Liverpool supporter made a comment that

 the start had not been delayed and that I was lying.               There

 were still odd supporters asking for spare tickets.

 I saw PC Rose having problems with one youth, apparently he

 didn't have a ticket and was just making a general nuisance of

 himself.
                        - 9 -



I then saw that the large blue gate that had been opened

earlier was now closed.      Then about eight minutes past three

I received a radio message someing to the effect        'All serials

or personnel onto the p i t c h . '   No reason or further order

was given or did we hear the emergency code Mr Meadows

urgently required at the Police room.

I then ran through a large blue gate to the extreme right

of the turnstile area.       I ran through into the area behind

the Leppings Lane stand then to the right towards the rear

of the Control Box.      To my left    I could see terracing   (extreme

right hand corner of Leppings Lane)        seemed to be plenty of room.

I could see no players on the pitch, but I couldn't see any

fighting.

I then eventually made my way onto the pitch via a gangway

in the outside seating area of the South stand.         From this

position I could see large numbers of officers on the pitch

and standing on the fencing behind the Leppings Lane goal.

I saw several supporters running on the pitch.          I asked a

 steward what had happened, he replied:        'Fans on the pitch a

 bit of trouble.'     He didn't seem really concerned.

 Following other officers I went        immediately to the fencing

 behind a goal.     I could't see any officer who appeared to be

 taking control.     I joined other officers at the fencing urging

 supporters to push back,       at the same time waving.    At the

 same time I heard over the public address system          'Will you please

 move off the pitch.'

 I can recall whilst running over the pitch to the area behind

 the goal I met a young lad from                      that's where I live,

 A lad called                    he shouted then came over to me

  'It's terrible in there, people are dying people are dead.'
I continued to run to the fence and what I saw I'll never

forget.

Young fans faces pressed against the fencing, pleading to be

rescued, but we couldn't get to them because of the wire

railings.

I saw four or five bodies    just piling up on each other.       It somehow

reminded me of    'Belson victims',   faces blue and they were being

trod on.    It was complete and utter turmoil.     One thing that

struck me on reaching the fence was the strong smell of

alcohol coming from the area behind that goal.       By this

time the officers in the left hand pen passing the dead and

injured through to us on the perimeter track.       One Liverpool

supporter a big heavy lad holding his chest.       He was in danger

of being trod on by the other supporters.       I pulled him away

from the perimeter track.     He was conscious he appeared to

be Okay.    I placed him in the recovery position and shouted over

to another couple of Liverpool supporters      'stand by him'.

I went to another casualty who appeared to have a severe leg

injury.     He was lying near the goal posts again in danger of

being trod on.     He was another large lad    I shouted to young

               to assist to take him away to safety,     over towards

the South stand.     I saw several fatalities lying in the

goal area with jersey's or coats over their faces.

All around Policemen working on injured giving resuscitation.

Also man y Policeman and Police women crying.      A Liverpool

supporter lying in the goal area, he appeared to be semi conscious

I forced my Brook airway into his mouth but he appeared to

force it out with his tongue,     clearing the airway.     I found a

St. Johns Ambulanceman who was carrying a bottle of Oxygen I

put the tube into the y o u t h s ’s mouth he appeared to come round.

     I placed him in the recovery position,      reassured him, and

     he told me his name was            but he couldn't remember

     his Surname or where he came from in Liverpool.

     Several other Liverpool    fans came over to him and they said

     they would stay with him.

     By this time the St. Johns Ambulance vehicle came round the

     perimeter of the pitch we began moving people, hoarding,

     photgraphy equipment, off the perimeter to allow the ambulance

     through,   to give what assistance they could.

     People were    being put on hoardings used as stretches,      and

     taken across to the gymnasium.       I remember helping to put

     a young girl onto onto one of these hoardings there was two

     or three young girls at one end of the hoarding attempting

     to lift or carry.    I went to their assistance and quite

     unknowingly they let go and left me with the weight of the

     hoarding and the body, and I subsequently injured my back.

     No real pain felt at this time.       Everybody seemed to be in

     a state of shock.    I was never made aware that there had

     been any breakdown in radio transmissions but the general

      radio transmissions on the       day were poor.

     My overall observations of        the disaster will take many, many

      years to come to terms with.      One thing that has knored

      at me was feeling so useless,     people were crying for help and

      we could do nothing.     As part of my normal duty I work

      the Police Control at Millmoor,      and fully appreciate the

      problems of working a football      match control.   But one thing

      has concerned me, was that       the pure location of the Control Box

      at Hillsborough overlooks the area where the tragedy took

      place .

Were not the officers appreciative of the developing

situation?   What was the feed back from the officers working

the perimeter of the pitch?          Couldn't they not see the

developing crush on the terraces?

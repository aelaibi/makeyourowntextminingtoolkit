              arriving approximately                 11.05am         ( 11 C/5) .     At    that          time L i v erpool        fans

              arriving,         many wit h       packs       of beer - lager.                 Remained           in that a r e a

b e t w e e n the    two     roads above.            As time went           by the volume              of s pectators

arriving       grew,       many a s k i n g    for    d i rections        to Public Houses and                 it was

apparent       to me that a large               number        of them did not have                 tickets       for

the match.           I must      have     been a s k e d at         least 50 -- 60 times                if I had

any    spare      tickets.



There were groups             of fans walking              up and.       down Leppings Ln asking

others      for         tickets,      this went       on for       the time of my arrival                at   the

point     until      just     before      kick-off.           I saw seveal           instances          of

spect a t o r s     purchasing        tickets        I think 25 was             the asking         price.



The m ood      of the fans a r r i v i n g was              generally happy/boisterous/singing,

obviously         looking       forw a r d    to the match,,           I did not        see any bad

beh a v i o u r as such but as               time    got    nearer       kick-off       there were           still

m a n y ask i ng for t ickets .



F rom about 2pm            (1400)     I was with PE> 1561 R E Y N O L D S standing                       in front       of

private      garage area al m o s t            opposite E s k d a l e        Rd just after              I think

B i c k e r t o n Rd.      This was      a result          of a    complaint         from an e l d e r l y       couple

who were washing              their     car    in the garage area                regarding        fans       using     the

garages      as a toilet.



From    that      point we       could        see down L e p p i n g s Ln to the bottom at                     the

r o undabout             at P e n i s t o n e Rd,    during       that time there was a                continuous

s t r e a m of fans arriving,                causing       problems       for    traffic       on the        road,     one

fan was      spoken to by PS R E Y N O L D S               for d e l i b e r a t e l y w a l k i n g    on the    road

 n front       of a bus.           The moo d was           g e n e r a l l y good natured and

 nthuslastic.              There    se e m e d to be no           let up of numbers a r r i v i n g a n d

a bout 2 . 5 0 p m      (1450)       I made     the    point       to PS R E Y N O L D S that           there was

way    could they get            into    the    ground for kick-off,                  and for          them to do so
                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                 S2653

the     kick-off would            have    to be delayed.              About      3pm    (1500)      I heard           on PS

REYNOLDS'S        radio      that    there was a large                crowd at the            t u rnsti les and

a p p arent    trouble       there.


                                                                            N 70^2- /
As a result          together       w ith PS R E Y N O L D S , PC B R A D L E Y amd PC S E V E R N we

went     d i r ectly to the         turnstile        area,      large       riuitibe/ of      persons        there,      1

saw some       climbing         up over     the wall          into    the    graamd and man y of them

r u nriin g u p and        climbing       over    the    t u r n s t i l e s t/iemse 1 v e s .      T h e t im e t h e n

w o u l d be about 3 . 0 3 p m       just after          the main'si^urlk of them had                     been    let    in

through the gate w h i c h had been opened.                            Not      knowing at that             time      that

the gate       had      been opened        I prevented seveal               youths      from     climbing             over

the     turnstiles         and m ov e d others          to the       other     side     of the gates             in

front     of the turnstiles.                R em a i n e d   there and several                ’fans"       leaving

the     ground then         informed me          that    there were          serious       problems          inside,

one d e s c r i b e d     it as    being worse          than    the H e y s e 1 disaster.



Many     people      leaving       the    ground     now and the            general      attitude          now was       of

a n g e r and sheer         ha t r e d towards       the Police,            man y t h r e a t e n i n g    officers

and     calling      us murderers,          the mai n wer            very    hostile       towards         us,    so

muc h    so that        I was a f r a i d for my own and               other       officers safety.                   Many

of them were            in tears.



About 3.2 0 p m         I was     in d e sperate        need of the          toilet,
                                                                         into the          so    I went
                                                                       \
ground and wa l k e d down the side of the N or t h S t a n d to the toilet,

there were        large      numbers       leaving       the s tand by them,               while       in the

toilet     (alone)         I was    subjected        to a barrage            of threats          and a buse           from

about 30 men,             3 or 4 told them to                leave me alone as             it was         not my

fault,     if they had not               done    this    I feel       sure     that     I would        have      been

as saulted.          On    leaving       the toilet          I walked around            the     back      of the West

S t a n d trying        to find a way on to the                 playing        area,     but     not      know i n g    the
                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                  S2653

             ground       could not      get on.      Unable    to    get on to the pitch            I    then had       to

             return outside            the   ground and join          other    officers       there.      Ambulances

             and fire         tenders were      arriving       now and a steady           continuous        stream of

             people         leaving    the   ground and the abuse and treats                      continued.      Some

             coming       up and asking me where           the       nearest    pub was.           I remained     there

             until      we were       stood down and a sked           to   regroup     in the N orth Stand.

             Fr o m   there       I wa l k e d w i t h my serial      to C l a y w h e e 1s for    food   and

             su b s e q u e n t   transport    back    to Doncaster.

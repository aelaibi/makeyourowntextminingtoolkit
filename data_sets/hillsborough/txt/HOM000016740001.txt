You wrote to the Home Secretary on 28 April 1989 enclosing one
from Mr          about the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Miss
Bannister, in her letter of 5 May 1989, mentioned that your
letter and your constituent's had been forwarded to me as the
Secretary to the Inquiry.

I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice Taylor who has
noted it.

    letter of 28 April with which you enclosed this one from your
    constituent, M   r  o   f

        As you know, an Inquiry has been set up under the
    Chairmanship of Lord Justice Taylor to examine the events at
    Hillsborough and to make recommendations.  I have therefore
    passed on your letter and a copy of your constituent's to
    Mr R Whalley, the Secretary to the Inquiry, who can be contacted
    at this address, in order that the Inquiry may take account of
    Mr         suggestions.

Dear Douglas




Mr                                                    Warrington




I enclose a letter f r o m the above constituent concerning the
Hillsborough disaster.

You will see that Mr              states that clubs should be allowed
to admit their own m e m b e r s only, that first and second teams should
play on alternate Saturdays and that all standing room should be
converted to seating.
I should welcome your comments on the matters raised by Mr
and please return his letter with your reply.




Yours




Doug Hoyle

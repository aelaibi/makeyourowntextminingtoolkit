I would            like       to a s k        the    question about                 the    p ol i c e .      W h e n we     were     up by

the       mortuary,,              the      first     body      that     I wa s       carrying            I estimated             it wa s     of

the       first         six.         But      when     I actually           got      into       the      mortuary         I sa w a b o u t

twenty            other       dead         bodies.         This      s h o c k e d me.

After         I had          to    drag       the    dead      body     into        the m o r t u a r y a n d        lay     it    down,,

it       to o k    about          f iv e   minutes.            I went       outside          and      s aw a b o u t      fifty     or

sixty         policemen              j u st    standing          around.            One    or      two y o u n g     poli ce me n were

crying            and       upset.            It a n n o y e d me       that        they were            j u st    standing        around

and       not      helping           to     recover        the    bodies.

I did         not       see a n y o n e        committing            offences            inside       the     ground       or     drinking

caused            by    lack       of      police      supervisffiri o ut s 1 de                the      ground.          Th e    crowd

               ( 0 10 58 9)          in   relation            to    the      Hillsborough               Disaster,             I stated        in    it     I

              attended               on   1 3 th M a y        1989      (1 5 0 5 8 9 ) ,     this       of   course           wa s    an    error     and

              After         the       disaster           on     the     p i t c h at       about        4.50pm           (1650)       I went       into Mr

              w as       interviewed            by        the      television           for       the    5pm       (1700)        News,       that

               probably              the BSC,           in fact         on     thinking           about      i t    j.   *m   positive.            I hs


               interview              however           was     shown        on b o t h      channels,             also       in the        r oo m at- the

ihe    theme       of    the      i n t e r v i e w w as        about       the      opening        of       the    gates    by      the

turnstiles,             just     to      the     left,      outside          the       ground.




In    relation          to m y      comments          i n the         or igirta 1 statemeril,                  I made       ref e r a n c e

to a P o l i c e        o f ficer        stood       on    the    perimeter             track,          by    the    perimeter

gate,     which         I am     now a w a r e        is    g a te     3.       I would         describe            h i m as a

uniform        officer         with a helmet                on.        He    was       I would          say a white          m ale,

aged     between 23-30                years.          I would          say      he     had     been      there       for    s om e    time

by the     expression               on    his       face.        The      lad w h o      was      pushed           back    into      the

crowd     by    the      officer,             was    a well       built         white        m a l e,    wearing          jeans      and

trainers,          2 3 yrs.           I ’m a l m o s t      s ur e     when       he    fell      back        into    the    pen he

h ad a    coat      on.         X lost         sight       of    t hi s     man      because        of my          predicament.




I cannot        be a c t u a l l y        positive          if    t ha t     lad got          out       alive,       I would         put

his    chances          of    getting          out at       this       t im e     as a b o u t      30%.




On    thinking          about       the       incident          I feel       the       Officer          should       have    helped

this     kid,      but       I can u n d e r s t a n d          his    actions,          as     when         they were       climbing

out    over     the      fe n ce ,       he    obv i o u s l y    thought            there      was      pitch       invasion         and

t h a t ’s w h y    he       shut     the      gates,       he    obviously             d i d n ’t k n o w w h a t         was

happening          inside        the      pen.

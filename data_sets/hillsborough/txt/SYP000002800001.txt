w ith Mick Eu st is          from my       section.           For Phase        1 we   pat ro ll ed    in pairs

in P e n i s t o n e Rd.       We als o      had to        patrol    B u r t on St and B o ro u gh R d .

It was a good 20 m in u te s walk                  to our      points       down P e n i st o n Rd.          We

p a tr ol le d on the mai n          road and spoke            to a garage        owner who had          cars on

his    forecourt.



A fter about. a n hour             the    fans    started to ar ri ve           by car and on foot.

 The B a r r a c k 8 and       ’The R o s e ’ public houses              began to fill          up with

customers.           After      about      40 minutes.             The   drinkers       began to build up

outside     the      pubs a nd drink         on the        pubs    pavements.           We noticed that a

large R o tw ei le r        dog was       on guard at the Rose Public House a nd a large

gr ou p of s upporters             were a ga in on the            pavement.



At this      time     the    fans were       just     drinking and shouting.                    A fter a

further      h alf-hour PS T h o m p s o n then told us between                       150-200 youths              had

g a t h e r e d outside      the    pub.         On our arrival          2_other      o f f i c e r s were

there.          I believe       they were         from D o n c a s t e r .      This made 4 PCs and one

Sergeant        he told us the            landlady      had    refused to close the               pub.

Glasses     and b o t t l e s were         e verywhere        on the     pavement.          The    pub itself

must     have    c on tained at          least    150 people.            The    people    inside      began to

shout     thro u gh the w i nd o ws and the a t mo s p h e r e               began to be hostile.



The S e r g e a nt    had one       personal       radio b e tw ee n 5 of us.               It crossed my

m ind that       if trouble         erup t ed we w ou ld          be powerless        to stop      it.        A

glass     bottle was         then    thrown towards            us just missing           the group of us.

A bout    15 m i n ut es     later a young           lad    ran up to say that about                 10 youths

were     smashing      the     pub inside.            Sgt.     Thompson        called for

r e i n f o r c e m e nt s and the dog men a r r i v e d minu te s              later.       The     pub was

then     empt i ed and the          landlady was           o r de r ed to    clean the glass a n d

bottles     up.       The yo ut hs who           star te d the trouble            had    left     earlier.
                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                       S280A

The     pub was         then e m pt ie d and     closed.



The     fans were          still      pouring down the        road       and we then stood on the

o pp o s i t e    side     of the      road.    A great       deal       of the fans were drinking

too much.               Some were      even sat       near traffic         lights with glasses          of

beer     lined up.



We    then were          told to get       to the      ground     fighting     had started.            We    ran

d own P e n i s t o n Rd towa rd s         the football          ground.       A transit      that was

passing          stop p e d and we      jumped     in the      back      of the van.



On arrival          at the gr ou nd we had             to wait while          the a mb ul a nc e s    came out

of the           ground.         It was     then we were told that there                had     been

casualt i e s .



A ft e r wait i n g       for a bout      ten minutes we went              into the ground an d were

t old to form a c o r d o n .              We faced the N o rt h S t a nd and the s pe ct at or s

w ere    shouting at the              police.



T h e y were       comp le te ly      o v er wr ou gh t and    could not      be    calmed down.            To my

right a group              of a bout     6 or 7 began f ig ht in g         each other.        We held

fast and then              the fans      began to jump over              the stand as they w an t ed to

help.             The y    began to s mash the a d v e r t i s e m e n t s     up at the        side or edge

of the           pitch.         The    cordon    then d is b an d ed and an officer             sent us to

the     corner      of the S p i o n H o p .



At this          time    the a t mo s p h e r e was   electric        it was almost as        if the

police were             going   to be attacked.               Pe op le    running    round trying       to

find     relatives         or   loved ones.           As the      remains     of our serial          went    to

the     corner      of the Kop a press            camera ma n was           taking    photographs       of the
                                                                                                                  PAGE        4
                                                                                                                  S280A

                 dead a n d X n j u r e d .      The     fans were    ready to       rip him to shreds.            He was

                 told to         put hi s'"came ra away.           He was    then s ur ro un de d by fans a nd they

                 b eg a n shouting,         s we aring and spitting at            him.      Some of the fans        ran

                 up a n d kicked him.



                 His   press arm bands were               taken off a nd he was           ordered of^^/the     pitch.

                 He was more          c oncerned w it h his        camera equ ip me nt and had to be frog

                 marched          off the     pitch.       After    this an officer         then sent PC Eustis

                 and myself         to the    gymnasium,      this was to take            charge   of a body.        On

                 e n t er i ng    the g ym n as i um    I saw all    the    bodies    laid out on the floor

                 w h i ch was a very t r au ma ti c         sight    indeed.



                 I was a l l o c a te d     body number 3 a Gen            18 was    completed and       property of

/V h 4 * -       the   body       checked./      This was a male 25-3Q~~years old dressed                    in a b l u e -
             "
                 white       top and/Jeans.             He had black       hair and      green^^fyes.      He had

                 heavy       growth on his       face.       He had green eyes.



                 S ce n es    of C r i m e then took a p ho to gr ap h of the             d e c e a s e d and this was

                 then ha n de d to the Sc en es            of Crime-         At   this    time the gym was

                 s c r e e n e d off.       It was      then a wait    for the       relatives     to   come to

                 ident if y their         loved ones.



                 E a c h officer's        name was       called out and he then went to the                relatives

                 or fr ie nd for         i dentification.           After    this    the body was       returned    back

                 be hi nd    the screens.



                 Af te r about        7 or 8 hours        half of the       people    had been     identified.           At

                 4.30am       <0430)    my body        number 3 had not been          identified.         I remained

                 t hr o ug h the      night   taking a short         drink    outside.
                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                    S280A

    *        The      relatives           could be h eard across            the other   side of the       gymnasium.

             After      it became a pp ar e nt          that    the    rest w ou ld     not be   ident if ie d that

             Sunday,        the    body was      then t r a n s po r te d to the M e d ico Medical          Centre.

             The      body was       then handed over           to them wit h the          relevant    documents.

             I was      led to believe           that    I w ould      be    called back a gain for

             i d e n t i f i c a t io n    purposes.      This was          not   correct as the officer who was

             at the       centre          took over    that    task.



             I then was           t r a n s po r te d to B a r n sl e y DHQ a rr iv i ng    the re at 5 . 3 0 a m    (053Q)

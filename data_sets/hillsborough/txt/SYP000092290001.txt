                I am a single          girl    and   I live at the above address wit h my                                 parents and

                brother

                1' am a supporter         of Liverpool          football       club and for the                   past three            (3)

                seasons     I have held a season ticket                     for the Kop at Anfield.

                On S a t u r d ay   15th April       1989     (150489)      Liverpool              were   to    play N o t t i n g h a m

                Forrest     in the      semi    final       of the FA Cup          competition.                This       game was to

                take    place at       the H i l l s bo r o ug h stad i u m in Sheffield,                      I jo u r n e y e d by

                taxi    from my home          to and from Anfield,             to get my ticket                  for       this   game.

                I paid £6 for a ticket               for     the Leppings          Lane    terracim                This was         to

                be the end for the Liverpool                   supporters          on tl>at day.

                I had visited this             ground twice        before      t i y t l /wlay, and        in fact           had been

                to the FA Cup Semi             F i na 1 there,     in 1            (JifGy^S ) jtrfie n a >Ja in Live r p o o 1

    behind the goal at the Leppings Lane                                 end of the ground.                    I had used

    the tunnel         to    reach the terracing                      that year.           I had a r r i v e d early for

    the game.          G r a d u al l y    the         terracing       began    to fill          up and    I was       being

    jostled about a bit.                     I hate           being    pushed about           in the      crowds?       I like

    to stand without              being        shoved around.                1 had been on the                 terracing

    from about         1.30     pm    (1330)            and about 2 .30         pm    (1430)       as the       terrace       kept

    filling      up wit h fans,              I left           this    part   of the        terracing,          using    the

    tunnel     and going          into a side area,                    between- the West S tand and the

    south stand.             I w at c h e d the m atch                in "198S (000088)            from this       position

    on a Sun s p a n        travel        coach there,               which   left at 8 am              (0800)    to travel

    to Sheffield.             Our     coach t r a velled directly                     to S h e f f i e l d without

    stopping        the traffic was                    very heavy^-fifnd our          coach was          subject       to

    lengthy delays            on a moto rwa^f                         to the traffic             the    coach arri v e d        in

    expected to arrive.                   The          coach dropped us off on the Halifax Road                               in

    Sheff i e 1d .      Prior        to gat t i ng off the               coach the Police                came on the

    coach and che c k e d p a s s e n g e                                    rs naci t x c^sis           lor    che game

                 and/             both had £6 terrace                    tickets          for the L e p p i n q s Lane

    terracing.                                          and    I set off       to walk        to the      football          ground.

    On the way we were                passing a supermarket,                     a Lea's          shop    it may have

    been and we tried to go                       inside        to buy something              to eat and drink.                 The

    staff     refused to a llow us                      into this       shop a m o u n t e d       policeman       came

    along     the    road and a sked us                   politely       to leave and walk                to the football

    ground.         The streets were                    busy quite a.lot             of    people were around.

    People were          sitting          down having a drink.                   There was             no trouble.

    Everyone was            in a good mood.                    It was a very good atmosphere.                          There

was    lots of       policemen          :m the area.                     It was a nice                      bright            sunny day.                      I

was    roasting       hot.        All    I had on was a Liverpool                                  Candy             top,          red

in colour,       a                jacket,             and either            jeans          or tracksuit                       bottoms,            I

c a n ’t remember which.                     I was              sweating        in the heat.

I arrived outside

It- was a bit         crowded,          but no more                   than usual .                 I was            not       crushed.                I

j oined an orderly queue and went                                   in through a turnstile                                handing            over

my ticket.           There were          both Police and stewards                                   by the turnstiles.

programme       I went       to the          ladies              toilet,        that       is s i t uated                 near       the West

Stand.        I left                   and                      telling     them       I would see                      them after             the

match.        I knew they          intended                 to stand behind the goal,                                   but due          to my

experience       the    previous year,                          1' had decided             I was        not- going                  back      to

that    location this year.

I next went          into    the area known as                         pen 2.          I stood               right at               the front

with my left side             d i r ectly against                      the metal            fencing,                 w h i c h s e parated

pen 2,       from pen number 3.                           I had     plenty of room                  ypf this              part       of the

terracing.           I took       up my position                     in pen n i ^ m i x f r a b o u t                              2 =30

pm    <1430).        I could see that at the                             back the           central                 pens       number 3 and

4 were       busy,    but    there was                room at          the front,            however,                   this        quickly

f illed up with         people.

I remember       the teams             coming              out and the game                 getting                 underway,                  WeiS

wa t ching     the game as             it started just as                        it started out                                the       corner

of my way 1 was aware                   of    people               climbing       the fens^e o                      x     T    ,    c    h    .           A

man behind me was yel ling at                               them to get           down.            As        I tried x a w artr h

the match,       I found it more                      difficult            to see          clearly as more and more

people were          climbing          the    perimeter                fence.          The area at the front                                  of

the    terrace       to my    left was                    now    packed with           people,

1 remember       hearing a little                          lad screaming.                  I had seen some young                               kids
                                                                                                            PAGE                   4
                                                                                                            S3653

at    the front     of    pen 3 before       the kick         off,         1 think    the   screams of

“Get    off m e „ Get off m e " were             from one of these young                lads as they

were    being    forced     into the       fence.        I don't          know what    these      lads          looked

like    they were about 6 years              old.

I could hear a lot of screaming                    from the fans             in the    pens to my               left.

I could see       into the        pen,    but not too well.                 I could see      the       people             in

pen 3,    being     crushed against          the     fence     that        separated    that      pen from

the one    I was       standing     in.     A little way             back    I remember an old

fella with very white              hair,    he wore a beige mac and was                     being

crushed against           this    fence.     He was       facing m e , ana he had one arm over

the fence.        His     face was very          pale.      He was         gasping    for   breath.

This man was        pulled out of the             crowd by two             lads on this fence and

lifted    into    pen number 2.            I saw that as             they plucked       this m a n out of

the    crowd his       coat almost        came    completely          off.     It took a good 5 or 6

minutes    to free        this man from the            crowd.        .As the man was         on top of the

fence    he was     pale and       limp.     I think        he was         still    breathing.             This man

was    carried out the gate              of pen 2 onto the                pitch.

As    I watc h e d the horror        unfolding         I became           very anxious      for       the safety

o f my b r o t h e r              and our    friend                       The game was      stopped and

the    players    left the        field.

I could see a lot of              people    on the ground             right at the front               of       pen 3.

I thought       that     these    people must        be dead.             1 could    see the      faces          of        ^

the    people were        blue.

At    the front     I remember       two men, more            or     less ,at the      fence      in pen 3,
                                             1— ■ 1                                                     —                      -
separating       that     pen from       pen 2.      Both were            on their    backs.          The       first
                                                                      /
one and the second both had black and h ly d faces,                                 they had their               eyes

closed.     Bot h      looked about 20             years o l / f .

barrier      in that    pen that      I could see was a man                      lying on his back.                 He

was    in his early to mid 20* s wearing                   blue jeans,              wit h a g a i n a grey

wool    jumper.      I believe       he had dark hair.                 He did not wear a coat or

jacket.       He also had facial            injuries?       his face was a b s o l u t e l y            purple

a nd   it a p p e a r e d to me    that    it had been          crushed.            I think     his eyes were

open?    his m ou t h was     closed.

I never      saw the barrier         break       in pen 3?       but         I could     clearly see          it so

the    people moved out of the terracing.                       As the           crowds    cleared?      I could

see two men       in pen 4?        both wearing what a p p e a r e d to be                   leather

jackets.       They were      lying       down    in that       pen.          I saw that      they had their

faces    covered     I believed       these men must also                     be dead,

I could see bodies          sca t t e r e d everywhere?            many of these were                 covered

up.     I had stayed       in my original           position         in per. 2,           I was     by now

upset and was        crying as       I had been since              the trouble            started.

It was then that          I got talking           to a fella         1 told him           I. couldn't         find

my brother.        This man        took me to a steward and                      I was a l l o w e d onto          the

pitch through the gate.

I had a wander about              in the    goal area?          looking          for            and            .     A

Policeman      came up to me asking who                  I was,         I told him          I was     looking

1. remember      during    the     crowd    crust               climbed out of pen 3 into my

me very anxious         for my brothers            safety.         I met                  o u t s i d e the

ground?      I was with                         I returned to the coaches with
                                                                                                        P AGE       8
                                                                                                        S 3635

         stayed outside wit h a qirS.                    I know a*              from L i v e r p o d l , she

was    looking      for her        friend,                                   1 iater    found out

            had been        injured at the match.

Once    back at the         coach        I spoke    to our    bus steward and           I left the bus

to phone my home            from houses,           but    I couldn't as all         the telephone

lines were jammed.                 I returned to the          coach,        I was still      upset and

crying.        E v e nt ua ll y            then             came to our        coach.                 told me

          :o u 1d n •t find                        Our    coach wa i t e d for what         seemed      like

ages.     Two     lads from our            coach were missing,          I u n d e r s t a n d that      this

was    the two TRAYNGR             brothers.        They had sat upstairs              on the bus on the

way to S h e f f i e l d and        I had sat       downstairs       behind the        driver     I had

never met the TRAY N G R                brothers and       I don't    know the       lads.

The T R A Y N O R S were      reported missing             to the    police      at what a p p e a r e d to

be a church hall.                 There was a priest          there and        people      coming     round

with drinks and sandwiches.

After about an hour,                our    bus    left    for Liverpool,           1 got    toB i r k e n h e a d

about 9.30        pm   (2130)       and    left the       coach.

         had phoned my             parents       home    from Sheffield.

I got home about            11     pm    <2300)    that    night,

I never     lost any        property           that day,

I wasn't       injured      that        day.

Two    girls    I know      Inge        SHA H and M a r i o n M c C A B E both died at        that      game.

I used to see them on                   the Kop at Anfield,          aver    the past      couple       of

years.      I did not see               them on 15.4,89       (150489),        I am a white          female

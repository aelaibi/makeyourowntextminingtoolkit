POLICE CONSTABLE 3150 CAROLINE MARION MARSH - MAIN STREET
POLICE STATION, ROTHERHAM.


REPORT RE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
   ?


At 8.00 am, Saturday,          15th April 1989 , I commenced duty at Main

Street Police S t a t i o n , Rotherham.    At this t i m e , I was in full

Police uniform forming part of Serial 40 which was under the

supervision of Police Sergeant C l o k e , with members of our

Serial who were under the direct supervision and control of

Inspector Meek who m we were to meet at the Hillsborough

Football G r o u n d .



A short time l a t e r , together with other o f f i c e r s , we were

conveyed via a force coach to Hillsborough Football G r o u n d .        On

arrival at the Stadium, we all assembled in the North Stand of

the ground where we received a pre-match briefing regarding the

F.A. Cup Semi-Final between Liverpool and Nottingham F o r e s t .



On conclusion of this briefing all m e m b e r s .of our

Serial made their way to phase one of our d u t i e s , that being to

position ourselves on Claywheels Lane/Halifax R o a d .          Our duties

consisted of meeting arriving coaches of Liverpool F a n s ,

directing them to park along the length of Halifax Road and

Claywheels L a n e .     Tickets were then to be checked and supporters

searched for offensive w e a p o n s .



At this stage only one or two coaches had a r r i v e d .       It was

approximately 11.30 a m , when our Serial attended Halifax Road

for the expected arrival of large numbers of coaches containing

Liverpool S u p p o rt er s.
                               -   2   -




Together with PC 3311 Baker,   I was instructed     to take the

registered numbers of the arriving coaches.



Only a few Liverpool coaches had arrived up until about

2.00 pm, as we spent our time chatting to the coach drivers.

Fans descending these coaches had been searched and although

they were in high spirits, they were all well behaved.        Many

went off in search of local public houses.        Numerous private

vans and cars containing fans were arriving and these parked in

nearby side streets.    Many of the occupants had already been

drinking.



At approximately 2.15 pm, there was a constant flow of coaches

arriving on Halifax Road and these were directed to park down

the length of that road.



During the time of their arrival, great numbers of fans were

hurriedly making their way down to the football ground, far

more than were descending   the coaches.      Many of these fans were

carrying cans of beer and   lager, some of them several at a time.

There were   a large number of fans who were unsteady on their

feet, appearing to be fairly drunk.        I remember one youth being

so drunk that he could hardly walk in a straight line.        I

commented that he would have to do a lot better than that if he

hoped to get in the ground.    One of his friends replied,        "He's

doing his best love."
                                                -   3   -




As each coach arrived, almost in consecutive order, groups of

fans assembled to ask if any of the fans on the coaches had

spare tickets.               They were nearly always told no.              Despite the

large numbers of fans                   'swarming' down towards the ground, the

majority were in good spirits and appeared well behaved.



Once the majority of fans had cleared the area, our Serial

assembled to a 'Funeral Directors' on Halifax Road.                           It was at

that point that I was able to see that on both sides of the

road, pavements, verges and gardens were littered with what

seemed to be hundreds of empty beer and lager cans and bottles.



At approximately 3.00 pm, we made our way down towards

Claywheels Lane for refreshments.                           Upon reaching the junction

of Claywheels               Lane and Halifax Road, we met with other officers

and Detective               Inspector Charles.              Detective Inspector Charles

was in possession of a radio and was in the process of

communicating with ground control.                           There appeared to be a

request for assistance at the ground.                            Under the direction of

Detective Inspector Charles, several serials/part serials,

organised themselves and we made our way to the Leppings Lane

end of the ground.                  Approximately five to ten minutes later we

assembled at the junction of Leppings Lane/Vere Road in

serials.           We remained there several minutes and following-wfeartr"                    t vi

                                -   4   -




There were large numbers of football fans crowded round the

entrance way to the Leppings Lane end, the majority of whom. •

were abusive and agitated.     Upon running into the Leppings Lane

entrance, we were greeted by hostile fans who were shouting

abuse at us demanding to know where we had been and why            it had

taken us so long to get to them.            Some of the fans were injured

clutching their chests, some blood stained.           Ahead of me, I

could see several people laid on the floor at the entrance to a

tunnel which gives access to the terraces.            Some people were

bent over them attempting to give them the kiss of life.               There

was an air of great panic and confusion and my immediate

impression was that fighting had broken out on the terraces.

However, I was unable to reconcile this thought with the sight

of persons having to be resuscitated.



The tunnel leading down to the terraces was very congested,

people were pushing and shoving each other in and out of the

tunnel.   There seemed to be many injured people, some actually

lying in the tunnel itself.     I could hear screaming and

shouting, many people were hysterical.           On getting into the left

hand section of terracing (as you descend the tunnel)           I could

see that people had fallen forwards upon one another and were

pinned up against the wire fences.           Not being fully aware of

what had actually happened together with other officers,           I

began pulling people up.     Many were badly injured, holding

their chests and being unable to breathe.           Several times I

rushed injured people up to the top of the tunnel at the

Leppings Lane entrance where I thought I had seen an ambulance.
                                                                        <8^1*

                                -    5   -




The sheer number of injured people was overwhelming, some were

obviously severely injured or dying.           A large number of fans

were angry and hostile towards us blaming us for what had

happened.     Others were attempting to help us, blaming their own

'hot heads' for what had happened.           A large number of fans

refused to leave the section of terracing stating they'd come

to see the match, this was despite pleas from myself and

others.     Some fans appeared too shocked to do anything,

seemingly frozen with fear.



It was obvious that people just couldn't get out of this

section of terrace because of the sheer numbers and the high

wire fences.     I remember helping one man to the top of the

tunnel who appeared seriously injured.           He was clutching his

chest, could not breath and was doubled up in pain.           I had to

leave him propped up against a wall at the top of the tunnel,

leaving him in the arms of a fan who promised to stay with him

so that I could help others.        I am unable to recall what he

looked like.



I returned to the terraces where people were still pushing and

shoving, and at that point, with others, tried to clear a

gangway for officers rushing the dead and injured up through

the tunnel.    Officers and fans alike were frantically trying to

rip the wire fencing behind the goal with their bare hands in

order to let people out.
                                                                             Qai<

                                -   6   -




After a short while an Inspector pulled me towards either a

gate or hole in the fencing and I went out onto the pitch.

In front of me were lines of bodies, at least forty in all.

Some were being resuscitated by Police Officers and fans alike,

others lay motionless.



A short distance away from the goal were two men who were laid

o u t , one on his front and the other on his back.Someone

shouted that it was too late for the man lying on his front as

his chest appeared to be completely crushed, so I started to

give the kiss of life to the man lying on his back.               He was

about 20 - 25 years of age, with fair hair, a moustache and

wearing what I think was a beige coloured shirt and jeans.                 His

eyes were glazed over, there was frothy mucus around his nose

and he had turned blue.   Although there were no obvious signs

of life and despite the fact that I suspected he was possibly

dead, I attempted to revive him.            I was joined by PC 3311 Baker

who assisted me and then I was assisted by a civilian woman who

also rendered heart massage.



During our efforts, another young man joined us, apparently a

friend of this man.   He called him "Gazzer" and thought his

friend was going to be ok.     We tried again and again to revive

him without gain when I told the man it was           'too l a t e 1,   He was

distraught and pleaded with me to keep on trying.              We assured

him we'd done as much as we could and after comforting him, I

left him with the body in order to help other people.
                               -   7   -




It was a scene of chaos, panic and fear, especially when the

extent of what had happened began to dawn upon people.



At one stage, together with fans, I assisted with the

collection of advertising boards which were used as makeshift

stretchers pending the   arrival of ambulances.



Throughout this time, the mood of the Stadium was one of     panic

and fear.   Fans were hysterical, it was obvious that many

thousands of people in   the other stands weren't aware of what

was happening and were   jeering the Liverpool fans.   I genuinely

feared that the fans would riot, angry because of what had

happened, angry with us as Police Officer and angry with rival

fans.



I remember a call for doctors being made over the address

system and after ambulances arrived, PC Baker and I attempted

to console distraught fans and calm those who wanted to vent

their anger out on us.   One St Johns Ambulance Officer broke

down and wept for rtiinutes on my shoulder.   At one stage I was

ordered to prevent further fans from climbing through the holes

in the fencing out on the pitch behind the goal.     Many of these

fans were deeply distressed, searching for their loved ones.

We were unable to prevent them from doing this out of sheer

sympathy.
                                                               Qp< z
                              -   8   -




Until the fans were addressed by Kenny Daglish, they remained

agitated.   They then slowly began to leave the ground.



As PC Baker and I had been separated from our Serial, we joined

Detective Sergeant Tissington and his Serial on the pitch.



I am unable to recall seeing any stewards at the ground but was

aware of people handing out cups of water to people on the

pitch at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.



Not having a radio, I was unaware of any radio transmissions

that took place during the incident.



After what seemed like hours, under the supervision of Chief

Superintendent Nesbit, we gently ushered the few remaining fans

from the ground. The bereaved and lost remained.



We then returned to the North Stand where we later received a

debriefing.

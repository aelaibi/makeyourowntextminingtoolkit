LIVERPOOL


fhe latest version of the Liverpool programme looks like this. You will see that I now
suggest we stay until the Wednesday - this is because some extra people have surfaced who
say they would like a personal meeting with you.

We now have 14 such possible meetings, as against 9 on the last version of this programme.
It would be possible to pack them all into the Monday afternoon and Tuesday sessions, but I
do not think this would work properly. The timetable below is based on everybody getting
half an hour, with appointments times at 45 minute intervals so that

        a) their half-hours are not bitten into by time spent getting people in and out of the
           room;

        b) we can take a bit longer with particular people if need be without delaying our
           next caller; and

        c) we can have a short break between interviews.


Sunday 5 October

1605 train from Euston arrives Watford Junction at 1621 - reaches Liverpool Lime Street at
1903. There are other Liverpool trains leaving Euston, and stopping at Watford, at 0905 and
1105 - can I assume that the 1621 is bestfo r you?

Travel to Judge’s Lodgings by official car - there is accommodation for you and Graham (the
Home Office Press Officer and I - as well as Mike Ward, one of Paul Pugh’s staff whom I am
bringing along to help out on the Monday - will be in a hotel).

Monday 6 October

0830     -     car to Merseyside Maritime Museum, Albert Dock. Met by me and
               Press officer.

0930     -     press ‘photo-opportunity’ - we issue a press statement on your behalf. One
               possibility is fo r you to read this out to camera - is that acceptable?
               This would not be a press conference and you would not answer questions.

1000     -     opening session in the lecture theatre - up to perhaps 150 people
               present, mainly family but including Hillsborough ‘experts’ from
               Professor Scraton’s project. You (or I, or both) open the proceedings
               briefly with an account of what your Hillsborough task is all about -
               then people have their say. No press. Goes on till 12.00 or 12.30.
               All recorded by stenographers. We should discuss how we handle this
               session.

1300     -     lunch (with Chief Constable? - if so travel by car - only a couple of
                minutes away).

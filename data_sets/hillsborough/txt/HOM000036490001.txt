Home Secretary


HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY


Issue

%ou asked whether you should meet informally Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, who is
carrying out the Hillsborough Scrutiny.

Timing

2.         Routine.

Summary

3.      You met Lord Justice Stuart-Smith before the Scrutiny was announced, so he
is aware of your personal commitment to the exercise. He has received a large
volume of written material which he has begun to consider, but he has yet to hear
oral representations. He will be receiving such representations when he visits
Liverpool and Sheffield during the course of October. At this stage, therefore, we do
not think that there is much for him to discuss with you, beyond the mechanics of the
exercise, which we know are proceeding satisfactorily. I doubt that there is a need
for a meeting at present. I will ensure, however, through the Secretary, Chris Bone,
that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is aware that you would be happy to meet him
informally at any point, perhaps after he has received oral representations. It is
possible, however, that the judge might prefer not to meet until he has formed a
clearer view about what his conclusions might be.

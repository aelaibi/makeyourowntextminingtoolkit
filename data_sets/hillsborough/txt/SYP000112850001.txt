END   OF   REPORT
1 an. Police Sergeant 721 John Leonard Hill at the present time attached to the
Somth Yorkshire Police Bog Section based at Niagara Sheffield#
At 8.00am on Saturday 15th April,1989 » I commenced duty at Niagara along with other
members of the B@g Sectioa.At 9 ,15am a briefing of all dog handlerstsome from West
Yorkshire Constabulary and Nottingham Constabulary took place at Niagara of which
was conducted by Superintendent Marsh and Inspector Phenix.After the briefing I
deployed nine handlers to cover various points in the City centre,the main areas
being near t@ and at the Midland Railway Station.Special trains were to arrive at
the station carrying football,supporters the main bulk of which were supporters of
Nottingham Forest* At'this time-1, was accompanied by PC 2^1 Barnett of the
Nottingham Constabulary and although I was designated for Gity Centre Supervisory
              .»y main area of' duty, was at the Midland Statioa along with other; Bog..
Handler® and uniformed officers from various Divisions within the force* .
My duties at the Midland Station consisted of the supervision of supporters who were
-aiwlieliig ©m.Special and Service trains and being loaded on to- buses and.conveyed .
t® Hillsborough football ground* These supporters were in good humour and di4 not
present any major problems at this tiae.lt was noticable however that supporters who
were arriving on the later trains had been consuming alcohol of a larger degree than
 the earlier arrivals# In connection with my duties in the city centre I attended the
 following incidents occuring in that area.
12,45pm       Supporters fighting in Snig Hill    -   Youths dispersed.
    1,20pm    Fighting,Surrey Public House Nolfoik Street - Youths escorted from premises.
    1,25pm    Fighting in Castlegate - Anrests made - youths dispersed*
    1*^5p®    Disturbance Hen Chickens   - persons escorted from premises.
    1 .50pm   Disturbance Roebuck PH Charles Street - persons escorted from the premises

Bearing in mind the problems we have had in the past re supporters in licenced
premises it was again noticable that these persons were allowed entry into same
by the landlords.
At approximately 3*05pm Operations Room asked for any dog handler to attend Gate 0
at the ground where it was said that problem were arising, I attended at the ground
from Rutland Road at the same time requesting West Bar to notify handlers taking
meal at that location to attend also,
3.10pm         Arrived at the ground where I saw a number of dog handlers on the ramp
               (between the North Stand and the spion cop) with their respective dogs, I
               spoke to Sgt Dent who informed me he was awaiting instructions from ground
               control,I saw that there were a large ammount of supporters on the playing
               area a large number of which were showing hostilities towards Nottingham
               Forest supporters on the spion cop.Also on the playing area were a large
          *    number of police officers, I then made contact with Chief Inspector Beal
               Who requested the dogs to be placed out of sight,I informed Sgt Dent of
               this instruction and I requested the handlers to return to and stay with
               their vehicles in Penistone Road, I then returned to the playing area
               and assisted other officers and supporters in carrying injured persons
               M an area directly outside the gymnasium at the rear of the North Stand,
j S . f e p a ' t h e n returned to my vehicle in Penistone Road and with other dog handlers
                I went into Leppings Lane to assist other officers who had reported a
                build up of supporters in that area. (1^73/1362/2699/5228 ¥1/1333/209^ WY
              The supporters were very abusive towards police officers,and by reason
j             of their calmness' another large incident was averted.
              At this location I was approached by several supporters who informed me that
              CBS many supporters without a ticket had entered the ground by paying
              stewards on the gates £10 upwards at the Leppings Lane turnstiles. I was
              unable to obtain the details of persons offering this information. I was
              also informed by PC 3336 Giblin (Bog Section) that she had also been told
              of this practice by steward* os the gatei,
3,50pm        All dog handlers in Leppings lane at this time was directed to law'Bros ^
               forecourt by Insp Phenix for standby duties*

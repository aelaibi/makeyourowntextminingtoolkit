 Dear Mr. Bolton,

 Hillsborough      inquiry: implementation   of the   interim    report   -   twerton    park, bath.


 Your letter of the 6th December 1989 has already been acknowledged by the Council's
 Solicitor, but I have been asked to explain more fully how the County Council arrived
 at the capacity in respect of Twerton Park, Bath, and to that end I have enclosed
 herewith some working sheets for your perusal.

It will be observed that at a packing density of 54 persons per 10 sq. metres,
the capacity at Twerton Park is 16,418, if the capacity of the terraced areas
was reduced to comply with the 15% reduction recommended in the Taylor Report
then the capacity of the ground would be 14,047. However you will observe that the
present capacity of the stadium^including 658 seats in the grandstand is only
9,813, which is a lesser capacity than would normally trigger a requirement for
the stadium to be designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.

As you will be aware Bristol Rovers Football Club moved to Twerton Park some three
years ago, and at that time a capacity of little in excess of 4,000 was placed upon the
stadium. A programme of works was instigated and on the completion of certain
requirements the capacity of the ground was increased. Only quite recently the Bath
End(Area 'M') was open for the First time and'Jwas,. allowed'to accommodate 769
spectators. But for the Taylor Report, the-.Authority would allow 905 spectators
in that area, but as the increase in capacity at the stadium for that area post­
dated Taylor, it was reduced by the 15% recommended in the Report.

It is also important to note that on page 8 of the attached Appendix you will see
that the highest packing capacity is 40.6 persons per 10 sq. metres and in standing
spectatorsareas is as little as 27.7. It will also be noticed that some areas have
been allowed a nil capacity for reasons which are set out in the Appendix.

I think I should give you one example of the care which has been used in arriving
at the capacity permitted in various parts of this stadium by drawing your attention
to areas 'J ', 'K', and 'M'. The exit in area 'K ', known as Innox Park exit- is
wide enough to take the total capacity of the popular terrace as a normal exit. Our
observations at the stadium have shown that this particular exit has not in the past
been favoured by spectators, and because ofi that, we have come to the conclusion that
as the spectators use other exits for their own convenience at the end of each
match, this will place a constraint on the areas 'J', 'K ', and 'M'. In the light
of that assessment, we have not been prepared to increase the popular terrace
capacity.  I think it fair to point out that if one were taking account only of the
Green Guide and its constraints the popular terrace capacity may well have been
increased, but because of the local knowledge my Inspectors have, and because they
attend almost every match at Twerton Park to observe the habits and behaviours of the
spectators, we went beyond the restrictions of the Green Code.
                                                                       ...conta
    Observation at matches enables the Inspectorate to come to that sort of
    conclusion, and this Authority believes that this must be an essential
    part of enforcing a Safety Certificate at the stadium. Local knowledge and
    regular observation when grounds are actually in use is an extremely
    important part of the consideration of the certificate itself and
    subsequent enforcement.

    You will also be aware that this Authority has decided not to implement
    the findings of the Taylor Report in respect of gates in perimeter
    fences. We believe that this is a very important issue,and we are concerned,
    having made careful studies of our stadia and the behaviour of the crowds.,
    that whilst no doubt Lord Justice Taylor is justified in his remarks about
    some stadia, we do not believe that to be the case at Twerton Park where both
    this Authority and the Police Authority are deeply concerned with safety
    and crowd control matters.

  May I point out however that when Lord Justice Taylor's report is finally
  issued this County Council would obviously take on board his
, recommendations.
J
 I think^ you will understand that the requirements of a certificate in respect of
 safety issues must reflect the observations of the police who are part of the
Technical Team in this Authority.     It is for that reason and after much
discussion that we reached the conclusion that as segregation of home and
visiting supporters was important, we had to take the necessary steps. Unlike
many stadia in the country, we do not insist on perimeter fences on all areas
but only on area 'G ' which lent itself to the control of visiting spectators
through separate entrances and to getting them away from the ground
afterwards with the minimum of mingling with home supporters. Coaches go right
into the car park and park immediately adjacent to the turnstiles for area 'G'.
We were therefore able to take the view that as perimeter fences are not a desirable
feature of stadia they can be reduced to a minimum by using them along the front
of area 'G| only. This would have the effect of preventing visiting spectators
from invading the pitch, and if the home spectators were to invade the pitch at
least that would not give rise to a confrontation situation between opposing
spectators, simply because the home spectators cannot penetrate the perimeter
fences and the visiting spectators cannot get out of the area 'G ' in those
circumstances.    I should point out that the area 'G ' has gates on to the pitch
which are stewarded on each and every occasion by personnel in possession of a key
and should any emergency arise they can immediately unlock those gates. This ■.    ’
requirement of the Safety Certificate is regularly checked by officers from this
department, because should there be a need for a gate to be unlocked, it may be
immediate.    and therefore the stewards are required to be in their positions
20 minutes before the commencement of the match and until     the final whistle.

Finally I think I should point out that this is a stadium where the County Council
has put in an enormous effort through its Technical Team, which I chair, to bring
the capacity to its present level by requiring an immense amount of work to be done
and I think you will understand the reluctance of Members of the County Council     ’
to decrease the capacity as that itself brings its own problems when;a club
are being successful.

Yours sincerely,




B. W. BECKETT,
COUNTY TRADING STANDARDS OFFICER.

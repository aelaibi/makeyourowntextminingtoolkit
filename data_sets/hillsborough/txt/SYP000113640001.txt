fans    and       the       Nottingham                   fans,         also       unaware        of    how    serious           the

incident          was       were          shouting             and      taunting           the      Liverpool           fans.

Because          of    the       supporters                   on    the      pitch        someone,          I don* t       know        who,

decided          that       officers              form         a    line         across       the     pitch       along        the     halfway

line    to       keep       the       supporters                   apart.          At     this      time     1 was        still        not

aware       of    the       severity              of         the    incident.              I thought          a    fence        had

collapsed             with       a    resulting                pitch              yntf ’ n n 'a n d   was     still        expecting             the

game    to       continue.                 It     wJ«rprrf u n t i 1 t h e                Ambulances          came        onto       the      pitch

and    the       supporters                started             tearing            up    advertising           hoardings              to    use      as

Chief       Inspector                Beal       then          instructed               several        officers,           including

for       drink,              some          of    them       were        very        drunk     and       could       hardly          stand.           With

this       year.

The       vast           m a j o r i t y .are           decent           and     w e 1 l__jxehavea            but    as    on    previous

problems™                     On       the       previous           occasion           Liverpool              attended          in    January          I

arrested                 a    very          drunken          supporter               who    had    found        his       way    into       the

Sheffield                    end,,

In    conclusion                       I feel          that      this         semi-final           was        not    as    well       organised

as    on        previous                occasions.                  There        appeared          to     be    a    lot    of       officers

doing           nothing,                as       wa    were      on      th e    t r a c k , and         could       have       been     better

employed.                     1 have             found       out      that       manpower          was        reduced       by       10“
                                                                                                                                       /., t h i s

obviously                    had       an    effect.            And       a lso       s everal         public        houses          near    to       the

ground           were          open          and       serving           up     to    kick     off       time,       surely          tney    should

have       been              advised             to    close        or    serve        only       to     regulars.

On    a    previous                    occasion             this      season          when    Sheffield             Wednesday            played

Manchester                    united             in    a League           game        I was       again        working          perimeter

track           when          in       company          with        PC    2289        Green       we     informed          control          of    a

build           up       of    Manchester                   United        supporters              on     the    Kop       with       Sheffield

supporters.                        with          PC    Green        I went           out    onto       Fenistone           Road       and    there

w e re     no        o f f i ce r s w o rk                     on     turnstiles             and       Manchester           suppportes                were

building                 up    outside                the    ground.             We    informed           control          on    several

occasions                    but       nothing          was      done.           When      Manchester               scored       the

inevitable                    happened                the    Manchester               contingent              started       to       celebrate
and       a    f i ght     toa k      p 1 a c:a w h e n      several             people        were       arrested.              It    does

not       appear          that       any     lessons         were        learnt          from       this,       clearly          manpower

shortage             at    the       Hop     end      was    responsible                 for       this    problem.

I also          feel       that       more       details          could          have     been       passed       over       the       public

address          system          to       late      supporters              ana        Police       to    keep    supporters                cairn

and       in f o r m e d «

In    conclusion                it    would         appear        that          the     Liverpool          supporters             for

whatever             reason          arrived          much       later          than     the       Nottingham          fans       and       they

appeared             to    ai1       congregate             in    the       centre        section          of    the    Leppings             Lane

Prom          what     1 saw         after       tne    game        it      was        obvious       that       numerous          Liverpool

supporters                were       the     worse      for       drink,           from       past       experience          I know          that

at    a       NORMAL       match          those       people        would          not    nave       gained       entry          but       would

have          been    either          arrested          or       refused           entry,

X know          that       speaking            to     other       officers              who    were       on    turnstile             duty

that          they    had       to    allow         people        into          th e    ground       who       normally          would       not

have          gained       entry.            I was      told        of      4    officers           covering       5    turnstiles

and       that       to    take       2    officers          away        to      arrest        someone          would       have

s eve r e l y        depleted             t h e s i r e n g I In.

My    previous             comments            regarding            the         Manchester           Uni tea      match          1 believe

are       'relevant         to       this      game.             Obviously             Liverpool           supporters             had

bought          tickets          for       the      Nottingham              end,        I genuinely             feel    that          if    the

match          had    progressed               as     normal        we      would        have       had    severe       problems             with

fighting             e t c »,        The     segregation               on       the     "Kop”       is    not    very       good       and    it

would          nave       taken       many       more       officers             than     were       deployed          to    have          done

it    successfully,

1    honestly             feel       that      the     general           standard             of    organisation             at       this

match          was    not       as    good       as    1 have          previously              experienced.                 As    I have

stated          there       appeared             to    be    too       many        officers          doin g, n o t h i n g ,          whilst

o thers         were       obviously             rushed          off     the i r feet.

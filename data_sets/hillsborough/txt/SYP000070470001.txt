          line    some     fans       shouted             "Murderers,               bastasrds,              yes             y o u ’re a l r i g h t                      here

          majority       of     fans       were       orderly           not     shouting             or a n y t h i n g .

          After    the     majority             of    fans        had     left       one L i v e r p o o l                   fa n          came up             to m e

?>        He   stated      he        had        r e l a t i o n s in the         crowd and               he     d i d n ’t k n o w if                          they

          were    dead     or a l i v e .         I told         h i m to w a i t              where           he w a s                and          Iwould               find

          out.     I went        to S e r g e a n t            WHITLAM who            i n f o r m e d me w h a t                        the         telephone

          number       was.      I wrote             it    down       on a      piece          of       pap e r            and         handed            it         to    the

          were    safe and well.

          After    all     the       supporters                had    left we         returned                to           the N o r t h             Stand where

          we w e r e    spoken        to    by       supervisory Officers,                           after                 which              I returned                  to

             by a n o t h e r      officer.          I am     unabI§/to         identify            th is     o f f i c e r.         We    both

             carried        her     through        the     q ^ te / h e r e    there        was    a    line      of    officers

             her     through        the     chain.         I then     turned my a t t e n t i o n               to a n o t h e r

serial      and we were               orde r e d    into the       ground.

As we      entered the              ground through the                entrance       between the N o r t h Stand

an d the spion kop                   I was      unaware     of what          was happening, .tout saw              to my

left, the N o t t i n g h a m Forest                players       n u m bered 6    and 3 leaving           the    pitch

a n d others        going          down the        tunnel.

On    looking       to. the Le ppi n g s . Lane             end of the ground               1 saw a large          crowd

of spectators             on the          pitch.      I thought         at that time that                there    had

been a pitch            invasion.

We had w a l k e d . o n to           the field w h i c h then became a trot and then                             we ran

as a serial              to the        crowd.

It was      only         on reaching            the goal    area that          I   realised        that a serious

incident        had. taken            place.        1 saw a large man o b viously                   dead    crushed

against       the      perimeter           fence.         I saw that         fans were ail          crushed

together and            people were asking                  for    help.

The actual          sequence            of events         that    f o l lowed are      not       clear    in my mind

I stood on the                 fencing       shouting        to fans        to move    sack,,      it did not          have

any effect,              in fact a group                  of about      four       fans were      swearing             back at

■Tie an d g e s t i c u l a t i n g       with their        hands      the    *V ' sign.          1 was    shouting

to them and telling                     them that -peo pi e were              getting       hurt at       the     rant.

It had no effect.                     I remember          pulling at         least    two    people       over    the

fence      but these were                 not    really     injured ones.             They had o b viously

cl amber eel over           the       trapped       people at         the    front.

I went      to Gate 3 and with                     other    officers         pulled bodies          through.           .1.

remained at that                   gate    for     some    time.       Ihe gateway was             small    and    it

was    difficult          to       pull    people     through.          I thought at             that    time    that

the    pitch s u r r o u n d and             the entrance          through the gate were on the                        same

level.        It was        only after             some time       that      I realised that             in tact we

had a pile of bodies..

 One man      in parti c u l a r was             very heavy,        he appea r e d dead and         took

 several      officers        to    pul 1 =him o u t „

 At sorne stags         I reached through                 the gate .as' I cqu 1 d see a boy face

 clown but with no one on top of him.                              The   boy as     1 recall .had jeans

 and a belt and was                light     c o l o u r e d hair.       I took hold of the            lads belt

 and was able         to    lift him. myself with one                    hand and     pass    him .backwards.

 I do not      recall       how or why but. I remember walking with a body on a

 s tretcher      to the m ak es h i f t           area between the North Stand.                   The       body

 was   of a male.           I also a s s isted w i t h taking                tne body of a w o m a n             :i.n

 jeans who was          face       clown,    to that area.

 At several       points         during      that    period        1 felt unable        to breath myself

 and had to stop what                  I was doing,,          At    some    point    I did    remove my

 tunic and       lost my 'Police tie.

 I saw a y outh on the. pitch who was                         in some       distress,     he told me             that

 his   chest was        hurting,,           He a p pe ar ed    in shock,,          He also    told me        that

 he was a s t hm a t i c an d uxd            not have m e d i c a t i o n with nirri.

 I tried to walk            calmly with the y o u t h to the North S t a n d area and

. handed him to a m bu la nc e              staff.

 I did a p p r o a c h a number             of    people    on the        pitch and a sked       them       if     Lney

 were alright.             The m a j o r i t y     stated     they were       looking     for either,

 appeared      to have        no    effect.

 The   only time        during       the     incident       that     1 was aware        of being       ordered

 to do anything            was     by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit who was at               gate 3

 a n d was    shouting        "Get t he m out" and             he himself was           pulling w ith us.

 Later   that     day      I was     part        of the    line     of Officers       across     the    pitch.

I reported on duty at Rawmarsh Police Station at 8am on Saturday 15th April 1989*
At that time I was in full Police uniform, consisting of a Tunic as opposed to the
Police issue anorak.
I was part of Serial 56 under the command of Inspector Newey and we travelled from
Rawmarsh Police Station to the Hillsborough Football Ground by force coach.

The briefing took place seated in the North Stand and the evacuation procedure
explained. The individual duties were explained by Inspector Newey.

We were deployed as a serial at Rawson Spring Road at 11.15am that date. I took up
my position to direct the Nottingham Forest contingent to suitable parking places
on the Industrial estate.

The fans that I saw were good natured, a large proportion of which appeared to have
been drinking.

We were to have taken a meal on commencement of the match at 3p® and at that time
our serial were standing at the corner of Penistone Road and Herries Road outside the
Charlie Browns shop. At that time Inspector Newey was monitoring the police radio
and told us of some form of trouble in the ground.
At approximately 3.05pm that date a Superintendent approached our serial and
we were ordered into the ground.
As we entered the ground throughthe entrancebetween the North Stand and the spion kop
I was unaware of what was happening^ but saw to my left the Nottingham Forest players
numbered 6 and 3 leaving the pitch and others going down the tunnel.
On looking to the the Leppingslane end of the ground I saw a large crowd of
spectators on the pitch. I thought at that time that there had been a pitch invasion.

We had walked onto the field which then became a trot and then we ran as a serial to
the crowd.
It was only on reaching the goal area that I realised that a serious incident had
taken place. I saw a large man obviously dead crushed against the perimeter fence.
I saw that fans were all crushed together and people were asking for help.
The actual sequence of events that followed are not clear in my mind but my recollection
is as follows.
I stood on the fencing shouting to fans to move back, it did not have any effect,
infact a group of about four fans were swearing back at me and gesticulating with their
hands the 'V' sign.    I was  shouting to them and telling them that people were getting
hurt at the front.    It had  no effect.I remember pulling at least two people over the
fence but these were not the really injured ones. They had obviously clambered over
the trapped people at the front.
I went to Gate 3 and with other officers pulled bodies through. I remained at that
gate for some time. The gateway was small and it was difficult to pull people through.
I thought at that time that the pitch surround and the entrance through the gate were
on the same level.    It was  only aftersome time that I realised that infact we had a
pile of bodies.
One man in particular was very heavy, he appeared dead and took several officers to
pull him out.
At some stage I reached through the gate as I could see a boy face down but with noene
on top of him. The boy as I recall had jeans and a belt and was light coloured hair.
I took hold of the lads belt and was able to lift him myself with one hand and pass
him backwards.
    JOHN ROBERT HUMPHRIES:
t

    I do not recall how or why but I remember walking with a    body ona stretcher to the
    makeshift area between the North Stand. The body wasof a male.    I also assisted
    with taking the body of a woman in jeans who was face down, to that area.
    At several points during that period I felt unable to breath myself and had to
    stop what I was doing. At some point I did remove my tunic and lost my Police tie.

    I saw a youth on the pitch who was in some distress, he told me that his chest was
    hurting. He appeared in shock. He also told me that he was asthmatic and did not
    have medication with him.
    I tried to walk calmly with the youth to the North Stand area and handed him to
    ambulance staff.

    I did approach a number of people on the pitch and asked them if they were alright.
    The majority stated they were looking for either friends or relatives. I did ask
    them to keep off the pitch if possible as they would only get asked again by other
    Officers. It appeared to have no affect.
    The only time during the incident that I was aware of being ordered to do anything
    was by Chief Superintendent Besbit who was at gate 3 and was shouting "Get them out'1
    and he himself was pulling with us.

    Later that day I was part of the line of Officers across the pitch.
    I am unable to say to whom I passed the dead bodies other than to say they were all p
    passed backwards onto the pitch.

    At it.30pm that date I returned with my serialto Rawson Spring Road   to assist in
    the safe passage of Nottingham Forest fans.

    That duty complete we returned to Claywheels Lane and then to Rawmarsh.   I went off
    duty at 8pm.

    The incident at Hillsborough has left me with a general feeling of guilt in that I
    feel that more should have been done - What I do not know.




    I have been on duty at FA Cup Semi-finals at Hillsborough in the past but not
    inside the ground.

the    bar and-I         thought       tt^at, "it was        just a surge           forward .of supporters.

I then saw S up er i n t e n d e n t GrfeenWood run onto                          the    pitch and lyjggJ^^o-'

the.                ;and it was ,.when this happened -ttyat I began to think that

it was more          than an overspill.                 Normal        pol i c y    is that       if the       referee,

needs    to be; c o ntacted a mess a g e                is relayed, to me through                      police

control an d          I in turn w ou l d contact the lines m a n nearest to me to

attr-sct the          referee's .attention.

At    this    point      the    re^er^^^^ugjTt               the   p l ^ a y e ^ ^ o f ^ but he with           his

linesm.ep stayed w ith me at                   the bottom of the tunnel.                         In the       next   few

mome n t s    all     hell     seemed to break           loose.          Hundreds         of Liverpool

supporters          had spil l e d onto          the    pitch and were a r o u n d the                  players

tunnel.        Man y were        berating        every t h i n g and everybody and had

obv i o u s l y been drinking.

I told the          referee Mr.         Lewis      to go to his dressing                   room and that             I

would    give him any news as                   I got    it and this              he did..       I was    then

e n ga g e d on keeping          Liverpool         supp o r t e r s    from going          up the       players

tunnel

I was    then       instr u c t e d    (I d o n ’t know whet h e r            this was          v e r bally    or by

radio)       to take Mr., C l o ug h and Mr.                 Dalg-leish to the             police       control

point which           I did.      There Chief S up e r i n t e n d e n t            Ducfcenfield exp l a i n e d

tu t h e m'the       seriou s n e s s      of. the s i t u a t i o n     but that he            could not make

an antiuncement to the                 crowd because           he did not want               the    rescue

services       to be h a m p er ed         in their      a p pr oa ch     to the ground.

1 returned -tjne M a n a g e r s           to the dressing             rooms and then stayed near th

players      tunnel.           At this time         the office           staff      directly at the top of

the    tunnel       were a l l o w i n g    people      to    "phone      home      from the office and                  I

was engaged          in keeping         them orderly           etc.       Many      of the suppo r t e r s were

s Mut ing- obscenities.                 At one      point BBC TV were                   going    to do an

in t erview with G r ah am K e l ly              in the tunnel            but a b a n d o n e d     it because of

the    un ruly b e h aviour           of the Liverpool             s u pporters          near    the   tunnel.           -

         Duties at Hillsborough semi final Saturday 15th April 1989*

         I was Serial 1 Sergeant that is in charge of all Constables on the perimiter
         track around the ground. Ify specific duty was to stay in the vicinity of
         the players tunnell and to indicate to my officers when to stand and face
         the crowd once play had commenced.
         I took up my position as did the rest of the serial at 11.0am and nothing
         untoward occurred. Went with serial for hot meal at at 1.0pm and all returned
         to duties at 1.20pm*
         At 2.^1pm P.C. 81^ Finnegan walked up to me and made a comment "where are
         all the scousers". I looked aroiund the ground and noticed that the Spion
         Kop and South Stand appeared to be full of Notts Forest supporters. She
         North Stand opposite me and the Leppings lane end were not full although
         of course there were plenty in. In particular there appeared to be lots of
         room on the 'wing terraces' of Leppings lane. I think I recall seeing spaces in
         both the Leppings lane and North Stands.
         The game commenced on time and shortly after I noticed that       supporters at
         the Leppings lane were what I thought to be spilling onto the trapk at the back o
         the goal. Peter Bearsley had just hit the bar and I thought that it was just
         a surge forward of supporters.
         I then saw Superintendent Greenwood run onto the pitchand speak to the
         referee and it was when this happened that I began to think that it was more
         than an overspill. Normal policy is that if the referee needs to be contacted
         a message is relayed to me through police control and I in turn would contact
         the linesman nearest to me to attract the referees attention.
         At this point the referee brought the players off but he with his linesman
         stayed with me at the bottom of the tunnell. In the next few moments all hell
         seemed to break loose Hundreds of Liverpool supporters had spilled onto the pitch
         and were around the players tunnell. Kfeny were berating everything and everybody
         and had obviously been drinking.
         I told the referee Mr Lewis to go to his dressing room and that I would give
         him any news as I got it and this he did. I was then engaged on keeping
         Liverpool supporters from going up the pHeyers tunnell.
         I was then instructed (I don't know whether this was verbally or by redio)
         to take Mr Clough and Mr Dalgleish to the police control point which I did.
         There Chief Superintendent Duckenfield explained to them the seriousness of
         the situation but that he could not make an announcemrnt to the crowd because
         he did not want the resuce services to be hampered in their approach to the
         ground.
         I returned the Managers to the dressing rooms and then stayed near the players
         tunnell. At thd time the Office staff directly at the top of the tunell were
         allowing people to phone home from the office and I was engaged in keeping
         them orderly etc. Many of the supporters were shouting obsceneties* At one
         point BBC TV were going to do an interview with Graham Kelly in the tunnell
         but abandoned it because of the unruly behaviour of the Liverpool supporters
         near the tunell.
         I then went to the North Stand at about 5«i*0p® for de-brief and left the ground
         at about 7.0pm.

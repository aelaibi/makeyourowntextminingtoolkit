the entrance,         as we had tickets for the terraces.                            We stuck t o g ether

a nd    joined the      crowd for the standing                terrace        turnstiles.        I have      not

where     to go. At first           the three of us d r i f t e d w ith the                 crowd    into the

The mass         of t h g ^ ^ r o ^ d ^ ^ J u s t    seemed to enter        the tunnel.            I wen t w i t h

the    crows^i          did not       see a n y Police          or s t e w a r d s a r o u n d the e n t rance to

the    tunnel.        Once     inside       the tunnel,          I found myself          on the       left side of

it.    I was being irtfshed along                     the tunnel       by the      crowd.The time was                     now

a bout       I S O O f r ^ T I w a l k e d along       the tunnel,       but found I

could^fot move from side to side.                             There was     no way       I could have turned

a r o u n d or tried to get out again.                        I was forced a long the tunnel                         towards

the    central        pens d i r e c t l y behind the goal mouth.



At    the end of the tunnel                   I found myself           going      in to& fn    4 on the              left

of the tunnel             e 5<it. The       central        pens were     jus^amass            of    people.          The

players were a l r e a d y            on the         pitch,    but    I coal'd not see anything.                      I

found my s e l f        being      pushed to the f r o n t ^ a n d over to the                  left.

As soon as          I got      into P e n 4 a m a n was              shouting,       that a w o m a n was

c o l l a p s e d on the floor,             was asking for            people      to go back.         T his was

i m possible as the              pressure           from behind was just too great.                     I felt

f r i g h t e n e d An d a n n o y e d both at the same time.                     F r i g h t e n e d because         I was ,

A n n o y e d because        I was      not going to see a n y of the m a t c h due to the

crowd        in the     centre       pens.     Due to the         pressure        I was m o v i n g     t owards           the

front        of the     pen inch by inch.                 My hands a n d arm s were up on my                     chest.

I could not move a n y of my                limbs.   I had d i f f i c u l t y b r e athing     now,    and

felt    very hot.

It felt as         I m o v e d forwa r d s w ith the     crowd down the terrace               steps,

that    I was treading          or standing      on bodies       of people beneath my feet.                         I

could not see the bodies as                  I edged forwards,        the crowd pressure was

all a r o u n d me.     People were         climbing over the barriers             out of       pens

a r o u n d me,    I still     could not move P o l i c e were at the front fence,

pulling     people out.         Fan s were kicking at the             wire fences        in front to

try an d free         the   injured fans at the front.

The    front gate was open               in the fence and      people were       being       pul l e d out

the game      had     been s t o p p e d by now.

The    pressure       an d the    crush seemed to ease by             now. I m a n a g e d    to get        to

the front         fence.    B o d i e s were still     under my/f'eet but         I could not see

them,    w i t h the    crowd.      On reaching the j^i^ont f e n c e,        I m a n a g e d to crawl

out                                                            i it by the fans.             I was    now on

the                                                              looked very       pale an d         ill.       I

went                                                           mfort.     I did not feel             ill at

this time,         I just    felt    numb and shocked by the sequence of events.                            I

had the over w h e l m i n g      desire to get out of the stadium as soon as

possible.

I stayed with                 who was       injured.    We met    up w ith              a n d the three

of us    left the gr o u n d together at about                1600hrs.     The Po l i c e      did

r eceive a lot of a b u s e          from the fans on the terraces at the time of

the disaster.          The P o l i c e   did their     besJt^at the time,        but a p p e a r e d to

A   lot of Policemenr'llid m a r c h onto the              pitch at the time and stood

across     the    centre.

I left the pitch via the N o r t h S t a n d area.                I did not see a n y alcohol

c o n s u m e d by fans     inside the ground.          I did not witness a n y criminal

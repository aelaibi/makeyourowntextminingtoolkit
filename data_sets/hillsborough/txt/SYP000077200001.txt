                We      arrived       in S h e f f i e l d at       about      1300       hours.      The       c o a c h was     parked        in

                a    coach     park       n ear   to a B a s s        Brewery        ne ar    to   the     ground.           I d o n ’t k n o w

                the       exact     nam e    of   the     road.        I recalled            seeing      some Po lice           Officers

                and Stewards              directing           the   fans     to    the     ground.

I walked           to    the    ground.          I am    quite       f a m i l i a r j/ith the            lay out          of    the

ground        itself       and    therefore            had    no    problem/in              finding       my    entrance.                 I

was     in    possession          of a £ 6 L e p p i n g s         Ln      standing         area     tic k e t ,      which          I

had     purchased          through        the S u p p o r t e r s */Club .




O n my ar ri v a l         at    the    g r o u n d , I had         no     problems          in g o i n g      through          th

turnstiles.               There     were      very      little       numbers           of    fans    about       at    t h/s         time

as    it was        fairly       early.          I believe          it m a y      have       been about          1 3 3 y h o u rs.




Prior        to    going       through      the     turnstiles,             I was       physically             sea r ch ed/by

Police        Officers.           Once      I had       entered          the     ground and          between          th

concourse           and    the    tunnel,         I was       again        searched          by a P o l i c e      O/fficer

The     crowd       was    still       l i ght    in    number       and        everything          was     normally            for       a

Saturday           match.




I made        my    way    to    the    tunnel         area.        As     is    u s ual     I always          /ike    to       be

behind        the       goal    area.     I did        not    see a n y         directional          sii/rts o n c e        in the

concourse           but    then a g a i n        being       familiar           with    the     grouTid,        I d v a n ’t n e e d

to    look        for    any and       again      if    there       ha d    of    been any          I would/have                gone

in the        tunnel       anyway.          I had       free       passageway           through          the/tunnel             aryd at

the     base       of    the    tunnel      I turned          left       i nto    what       I know       i m w as     pe^i

four.         I took       up    p o s i t i o n at     the    back        of    the    pen     underneath a               sign          of

s ome    sort.           I wasn't       very      happy with             t hat    position          so                and myself

made     our       way    down    the    middle.             There       was     no    problems          with    the       crowd

whatsoever.



We    got     to    the m i d d l e     but      c o u l d n ’t see        very well          so a g a i n m a d e         our / n a y

down     to       the    very    fron t .        The    time       then     would       have     b e e n a b o u t 141]

                    There       was    a greater          amount        of     people       here.            The    pressure          seem     to    be

                    building          up.     I recollect              being       pushed        r i g h t u p / 4 g a i nst       the      perimeter

                    fence       and    being       squashed.            I called           to a P o l i / e        Officer         to    open       the

                    gate.        I was       r i ght     n ext    to    the       gate.       I only'’ h a d         to     put m y      right       hand

                    out    and    t h a t ’s h o w       close     I was./                       was     on m y      left




                    I was       experiencing             pains / n        my      chest,      so    I really           s h o u t e d at      the

                    Officer       to    open       the    gat^> to        let me          out.      He       shouted        to   someone        else

                    and    the    gate       was    opeiv&d       in f act         I don't         know       if    it w a s     ever       locked.




                    When    it    came       open      1 went      out       of    it a n d g r a b b e d          hold     of               once      I

                    was    out    and       looked       back.         I saw       t hat    there        w\r e people             l y ing    against

                    the    fence.           I recollect           seeing          a young        lad     pressed against                 the    fence

                    He    was    about       two    or     three       metres       away      from       the       ga\e          I held

                    I was       wearing       a /air        of    bl ue      denim        jeans/        the    d ark      blue     type,       and a

                                 sweater,




                    We w ere      moved       f ro m     the     fence       and    therefore            unab\e        to a s s i s t       this     young

                    lad    in a n y way.            I ’d s a y     he was          about     ten        or    eleven^ y e a r s         of age.

                    We    were    told       to    sit    down     by     the      S t e w a r d s , so w e s a t           o\^thebillboards

             At    about     1630      hou r s ,   we    eventually     left     t\/e    ground    to m a k e   our    way

             back     to   the     coach.          I did    not   suffer    a n y major      injuries     as    a   result     of

             rny e x p e r i e n c e   but   did     have    slight    bruysing         to m y   chest   for    a   couple

             of    days.

                At/p910 (0910)        1 left West Bar Police Station and made my way to the

                Midland Railway Station arriving                     0930   (0930).

                Sector    14 together with othery^ectors formed a cordon at the Railway

                ^Station for the Liverpool |ans travelling by train to go straight from

                the trains onto the aWsfiting buses.                   Each passenger         paid £.1 for the

                return journey to Hillsborough.                  Each bus, when         Pull was accompanied

                by two Police Officers.              My Sector      (14)    remained at the Midland

                Railway Station until the last bus to leave for Hillsborough at about

                1425 (1425).
                                                                               PAGE        E

During my stay at the Railway Station I saw no trouble by any fans.

At 1425 (1425)     I left the station to travel by bus with the last few

fans for Hillsborough.         At 145Q (145Q)   I arrived by bus at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground.                        y
At this time 1 saw a very large crowd of f              around the Leppings Lane

end of the ground.         Several fans were aycerripting to enter the ground

by climbing up over the walls and irt^n gates.              I saw several    people

being sick in the roadway outside Leppings Lane.               It was a very rowdy

situation and a lot of pushing was taking place towards the gates of

the football ground.

My sector     (14) was instructed to make our way to the gym inside the

g ro un d.   UJe were to act as a standby reserve support unit.

At about     1455 (1455)    I was in the gym at Hillsborough the       intention

being to remain there and have our meal at about              1545 (1545).

At 15Q4 (15Q4) all officers were called out of the gym for what                 I

believed to be a public order situation at the Leppings Lane end of

the ground.

Together with other officers I made my way quickly from the gym to the

perimeter track of the ground.         I noticed that the Football          game was

in progress.      As I walked quickly along the perimeter track towards

the Leppings Lane end of the ground I could seje a large number of                  Pans
                                             /    - - %                             ...



on the pitch itself around the goal at t h a ^ end of the ground.

I also saw many more fans climbing over/the          perimeter fence behind the

L eppings Lane end goal from the terr/ces onto the pitch.              I made my

way straight towards behind the goal at the Leppings Lane end.                  I

arrived at this position at about        1506 (1506).        I saw many police

officers standing on the advertising        boards which were against the

perimeter fence behind the goal,        these officers were helping fans over

the fence from the terraces onto the pitch.          This perimeter fence

would be about     12-15 foot high.     I joined these officers       in assisting
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 S3696

the fans over the fence onto the pitch.            I msriced that in my opinion

the crowd on the terraces at the Leppingj/Lane end was far too packed.

There appeared to be far too many f a n y on these ter ra ces .

I quickly noticed that a large number of fans at the front of the

terrace were crushed up agaipst jme          perimeter f e n c e .    It was visibly

obvious that many of these faffs were seriously injured or even dead.

I saw many fans motionless and their faces had turned a pale blue

colour.     At this time the fans were still        climbing over the fence onto

the pitch.

This seemed the only way to thin out the crowd on the terrace before

it was at all     possible for any Police Officers to get onto the

terraces.     The crowd was so tightly packed that they could not move

back to the rear of the terrace.          During fchis time a lot of verbal

abuse was being showered upon the Police for not getting the injured

and dead out of the terraces quickly Enough, but there was just no
                                    .„      ^  if-.*■          ----
way that we could get onto the terraces before the crowd had been

thinned out.      I noticed a small gate      in the perimeter fence just to my

right hand side,     had been opened and fans were escaping onto the pitch

through this small gate.        Only one person at a time could get through

this gate.     After what seemed like a few minutes 1 noticed that a

number of Police Officers had managed to get onto the terrace and

force back a section of the crowd just a few yards.                  This   revealed a

large number of fans laid on the terrace,           many laid on top of one

another.     At this stage the Police formed a h u m a n / h a n n e l      leading

from the terrace onto the pitch.          I was part of/this human channel,

positioned immediately at the gate entrance./ I do not know how many

bodies we managed to get out in thks— way-^'but it must have been three

or four dozen.      The majority of people that I assisted with during

this time were either dead or seriously injured.

When the majority of the injured fans had been moved onto the pitch,                     I
                                                                                      PAGE     '

           the gym

             ter my third visit 1 remained in the vicinity of the gym, where a

           large number of injured fans were     laid immediately outside the gym.             I

           At about   1645 (1645)   1 received instructions that all West Bar

           officers were to make their way back to the Midland R a i 1way Station.

           It was about this time that 1 learnt that t h e ^ f ^ t b a l 1 match had been

           abandoned much earlier and that fans were now making their way home.

           Together with another West Bar officer      1 made my way back through the

           city to the Midland Railway Station.

           At the Railway Station we escorted the Liverpool        fans from the buses

           onto the trains.    From the Railway station we made our way back to

           West Bar Police Station for a de-br i ef i n g .   2000 hrs    (2000)   off duty.

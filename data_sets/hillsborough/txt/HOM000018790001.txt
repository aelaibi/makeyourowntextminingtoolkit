HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


Thank you for your letter of 23rd May.


I do not consider it would be appropriate for me to make a written
statement for your Inquiry as except for The Championships at
Wimbledon the crowds watching our sport are not of material size
when compared to the number attending a football match. The
Wimbledon Championships are in fact organised by the All England
Club through their Chief Executive, Mr. C.J. Gorringe.


Yours sincerely,




JCUJ/SMW/1

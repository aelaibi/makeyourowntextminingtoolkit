Bear Sirs,

T . m m g n RESUMED INQUESTS - HILLSBOROUGH,


Further to my letter of the 14th of March Ref:- HILEj^SOL/l
I now enclose the text of the summary in respect of the deceased
listed on the attached schedule.

It will immediately be obvious that the summary has been prepared
as a concise and factual report. In places it refers to the
deceased by number or without designation of title.

I am very anxious to try and ensure that the disclosure of
this summary should not either cause offence or unnecessarily
upset family members. I am conscious that there may be some who
may find the style rather too cool.

Whilst it is of course a matter for you, I would be grateful
if you. would very carefully consider how and when to disclose
the summary to your clients in order to try and avoid unnecessary
upset or distress.

 I should mention that it is the intention that at the hearing,
 the contente of the summary will be presented to the Inquest
 in as sympathetic a way as it is possible to do so in the
 circumstances.

 I would be grateful if you would please acknowledge receipt of
 this letter with enclosures by Fax to Det, Superintendent S.
 Beechey, West Midlands Police, Nechells Green Police Station,
 Fowler Street, Birmingham. B7 5DA Fax No.              immediately
 upon receipt

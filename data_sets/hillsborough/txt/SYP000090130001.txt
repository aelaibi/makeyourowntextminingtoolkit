                and drove      down    in the mini        bus    towards    the ground.     At about £.1 7         pin

                (1417)    we   parked the mini         bus on a garage -forecourt about 400 yards

                from the Leppings Lane             entrance       to the ground.

                All    thirteen of us wa lk ed down to the                 ground together,       we had no

                police escort         or directions,        but we knew where we were going.                   The re

                was a continual          stream of     people walking         towards    the ground.        I saw

                policemen on the          route we took towards             the ground,    they seemed

                to be mainly engaged             in traffic       control,

              There were quite a number of police

                stewards outside          the turnstiles.

                There were       police    by the entrances           to the turnstiles      searching         people

                at    random as they entered the ground.

                After    going    through a turnstile and handing my ticket                      into the

                turnstile      operator a number           of our group waited around             in the are a of

                the    entrance to the          tunnel,   whilst members         of our group got food and

                prog ramrnes.

                I never saw any signs             of u n a u t h o r i s e d entry to the ground,       I never saw

                any gates open other than the turnstile                      gates.

                Of our group everyone             had tickets        for the Leppings Lane terraces

                except                          and                               who had tickets        for    the

               I never saw any              policemen or stewards             in the area of the               entrance       to

               the     tunnel.        I never saw any signs to direct                   people      onto       the terraces

               or any persons to give directions,                        at that     time    I thought          the only

               entrance        to the       terraces was        through the jfcunnel w hi ch             ran under         the

               to be in the mid 7 0 ss.                  1 can remember        thinking      to myself          that    the

               was     getting       squashed tighter and tighter.                   I can remember whilst

               standing        in this       position        I put my    1egxf o rwar ds and up against a crush

               barrier        just    in front       of me to try ^nd          push backwards            to try and         read

               my match        programme,         the    pressure      worn behind me was           too severe          to keep

               in this        position so after a s h a rA. time               I gave      up.

more         people       coming    into the terraces            through the tunnel.

At     position number              one    1    at a time 1 w ould       estimate       to be about 2 .46

pm     (1446)        I Pound that          I    was being crushed        up against          the crush

barrier            in front       of me.        I m a na g ed to duck down under             the barrier       to

move         forwards       down the terracing               to a more       comfortable       position.        I

think about               four    or five       of the group         I was with also          got    under    the

barrier.             I c a n ’t remember which other members                     of the group          came under

the     barrier with me.

Once         1 got under          the    crush barrier         I got m oved wit h the           crowd to a

position            1 have m a r k ed as number              two 2 on the separate             grid plan.

I    can only estimate                  that    I got to position two 2 at about 2 .4 8 pm

<1   4 4 5   ).    When     I gat to       position two 2 I found that                  the    crushing was

worse         than       I had been e xp er iencing            in position one          1.     I cannot

remember who was                  standing with me            in position 2.          I think        I was

starting            to    panic    by this time,            thinking    to myself       I ’ve got      to get out

of here.             In this       position at a time            I can only estimate                to be just

before            the kick off,          the movement         of the    crowd turned me a ro u nd and                I

ended up facing                  back    up the terracing            looking    up at    the West Stand.                 I

could see                          ana               up   in the West Stand,         they were amongst a

large         group of       people who were standing                  up at the front          of the West

Stand         leaning over and             looking down         into the terracing.                 I could see

the     people           in the stand above               pointing    down    into   the terraces,           they

a p p e a r e d to be shouting                 but    there was a lot of noise               from the    crowd

an d    it was           impossible       to make         out what    people were       shouting.        The    only

thing         I could hear was             people a ro u nd me shouting              "Push back"        "Push

back” .           People     couldn't          push back      it was    impossible       to move.

Whilst            in this    position very shortly after                     being   turned a ro u nd        to face

the West S tand              I looked over my               left shoulder and         I saw an old man who

was     positioned about                 ten or twelve         feet a way from the dividing                  fence

between            pen numbers          two and three.          He was about         three     feet    further

down the terraces             towards       the    pitch from the          position    I was standing

in*      I can remember         looking at this             old man and thinking             he was      in

serious       trouble,    he was          staring a h e a d , I could see he had gone                 very

pale almost          white,    I could see his teeth were                   clenched together,            he

w a s n ’t moving at all         it just          looked    if he was       concentrating         to keep

himself alive-           He was all          tensed and       rigid.        I have    no    idea what

ha ppened      to this    old m a n .        I w ould      describe him as being a white male,

age d about      sixty years          quite a tall man at             least six foot,             he had grey            y

hair which was          cut short above             his ears.        I c a n ’t remember what            style

his     hair was      combed    in.        He was    clean shaven.           I can't       remember

anything about          his    clothing,          although    I d o n ’t think he was wearing a

coat,     I could only see his               face,    head and shoulders.

Having       seen the trouble             this    aid man was      in I turned my head a ro un d to

face     the West S tand again.

I never       saw any a ct io n on the             pitch but from the          reaction of the            crowd

I knew that the          game    had kicked off,              A short time after             the game         had

kicked off,          I m a na ge d to force my way back               im   the terraces and over                to

my    left    to a     position up against                the di v i/i ng fence       of    pens three and

two.     ,| found that         I was       up agai ns t a cri^Bh barrier             in this       position         I
        l6*_ i v o
m a na ge d to climb up onto               the 1     rier as /people        on the other          side    of

the     dividing      fence who had their arms                yhrough the fence             pushed me

upwards and over          the dividing             fence    into   pen number two 2.

Once     I got over      into    pen number          t w a ^ jf found that that        pen had       plenty

of    room in it.        I sat down for a short                 time to get my breath back.

Whe n    I got up a ga in       I wa lk ed down to the front of pen number                          two and

looked       into the front          of    pen number       three.     I could see a lot of

people were          crushed up agai ns t           the    railings    of the    dividing         fence

between the two          pens,       I c a n ’t remember a ny thing about              the    people      I saw,

I cannot       say what       time    I managed to get over the fence                      into    pen number

two.      I think      it was about          one or two minutes after                the game       kicked

off,     I can't    be sure of this because                 I cannot    remember seeing a ny th in g

of the game.

1 looked up        into the West S tand a gain and               I could see

and                                  pulling       people   up into Ime West S ta nd from the

back     of pen number        three.

1 went     back up the        terraces and stood on j^ie dividing                  fence of       pens 2

and 3 I put my hands            up and               and               pulled me up into          the

West S t a n d .

Whe n    I got up into        the West S ta nd
                                                           V
                                                      I am sure that the game             had been

stopped a l t h o u gh   I w a s n ’t really looking at the pitch.

Once     I got up into        the stand               took hold of my shoulder and                pointed

down towards        the front        of    pen number three he said,             ’Look    t h e r e ’s

people dead down t h e r e . ’

I could see at the front                  of   pen number     three about      ten/feet      back from

the     perimeter    fence a clear area of terracing a boutXtwo feet wide.                                     In

front     of this    clear a rea          I could see a pile of bcyflies stacked up on

top of each other         stretching           back from the         perimeter    fence     for a

distance     of about     six feet.

This     pile of bodies         extended         to either side        of the gate in the

perimeter fence.          I     c a n ’t estimate          how far   itextended to either                side

of the gate,        as far as        I    can remember       people were       being pulled out of

the     pen through the gate              in the    perimeter    fence.

1 cannot describe         this       pile of bodies exactly other                than to say        it

looked     like a huge        rugby scrum w hi ch had           collapsed.

I can only remember              one      individual       who was   in this     pile of bodies,          as

best as     I can recall          he was        pos i t i oned in the middle       of the    pile        and

as you     look towards        the       pitch about       ten feet to the       right    hand side            of

the gate     in the fence.               The   lower half     of this body was        buried       in the

pile of bodies        the upper           half was    bent backwards at a strange angle

and facing upwards            so he was         1ooking     up towards    the West S tand where                 I

                                                                                                              S3439

was     standing.        This mans        face    looked terrible           it was blue almost

purple his eyes and his m outh were                       open,     this man had very thick black

hair w hich was quite             long at        least    shoulder        length.        I think he was

wearing a very           pale    coloured or white            crew necked short                sleeve d tee

shirt which        I think was          just     plain.     He a pp ea r ed to be about                  thirty

years     of age,       and he was        clean shaven.

I cannot       remember any other d es cr iptive                   details about any bodies                     I saw.

We stayed up in the stand for some                        time     pulling       people       up    into the

stand from the terraces                 below,     we were        stood    in the front of the West

S t an d almost     directly above              the dividing        fence between             pen numbers               two

and three.        Whilst        in the stand        I didn't        take much notice of what was

occurring       on the        pitch.      I was    looking        down    into the terraces               to    look

for my brother                   and my friends.            We event ua ll y        pulled my brother

         and        up into       the stand at some               time between 3.1 0               pm   (1310)          and

3 .20    pm (1520).

After     getting               and           up into     the stand        I left the ground to

phone home to           let    people know that we were                  okay.     I went          to a sports

shop by some traffic              lights at the end of Leppings Lane and                                phoned

home.      My mother          told me     later that       1 had phoned her at 3 .20                     pm    <1320)

A fter    phoning home          I went        back to the ground and              into    the West Stand

again.

When     I left the ground to                 phone home and        I returned       I had seen

ambulances        parked       in the are a just          outside        the Leppings Lane               entrance,

there was an amb ul an ce              sta ti on ar y by the fence           that    runs along               the

river     bank.

I ran to the shop to              phone home        so it w duld have             been a short            time

before 3 .20       pm    (1320)       whe n    I first    l/ pt    the ground.           At    that      time       I

had seen about five              or six        bodies /laid out on the floor                   by the

stati on a r y amb ul an ce       the one by /he           river f e n c e .      Some        of the bodies

had the i r shirts            pul 1ed up over       the i r h e a d s .     The only one of these

                                                                                           S3439

bodies       I could describe was a white male,                  he was wear in g a Liverpool

football       shirt and blue           denim jeans.      The football       shirt had been

pulled up and was           covering his head,           all     Ican say about him      was   that

he was a big man he had a large                 beer     belly which was      covered in black

ha i r .

Once       I had got back        into    the ground and        into the West S ta nd we

remained there         for about         ten or fift ee n minutes.         I d i d n ’t really take

muc h notice during             that    time of what     was     happening   in the ground most

of the      time   I was    sitting       down w it h my arm ar ou nd my brother                who

was    very upset.                             did say that he had seen everyone               of

our travelling         companions and they we re all               okay.

We    left the g/ound at about 3.35               pm    (1535)    of our own a cc or d and

e ve n t u a l l y a/ve ryone    of our group met up back at the van.

During      the/time     I was     in pen number        three    I was   not aware   that a crush

barrier      hed broken.




I did not       p ersonally witness any deaths as far as                   I am aware,    I did

not assist any of the              injured fans.

I did not witness anyth in g               on that day whi ch I would have           c onsidered

to be a c r imi n a 1 offence.

I cannot       think of a ny thing         further     that    I wish to add to my statement.

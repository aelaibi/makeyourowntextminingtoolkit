              I live at the address and I am a supporter of Liverpool Club of

              Football and I am a member of the London Suporters Club situated at PQ

              Box    185F London NH1 3 Q U , telephone number 01 3 6 7 5 2 6 5 .        I organised

              to get a ticket for the Semi Final of the FA Cup against.Nottingham

              Forest on the 15th of April               1989 150489.   I was successful     in getting

              a ticket for the West Stand for which I paid £12.                     I met some other

              supporters at Kings Cross Railway Station on the match day at about

              8.30am 0830.          I d o n ’t know     any others who were at the station by name,

              they are fellow members of                the supporters club.
                     c^vr
              The train left Kings Cross                for Sheffield at about 9am 0900 and arrived

              at about     11.30am 1130.        On      our arrival we crossed over a bridge at the

              Station and outside the station I saw about 20 Police Officers
                          --------------------— -----------‘           c ^yr
              ushering supporters to awaiting buses.    I got onto one of the buses
                                                                         PAGE     2
                                                                         S2334

after about    15 minutes and the bus dropped me at the ground at about

1pm 1300.     I was dropped just up the road from the Leppings Ln End and

at the ground I d i d n ’t see any queues although some people were

milling around near to the turnstiles.

I wandered around and bought some fish and chips returning to my

entrance    point at about 2pm 1400.   My entrance    point was Gangway X to

the West Stand and I had no difficulty in entering the ground.            I

d i d n ’t observe any stewards outside the ground.     I did see some Police

around although I was directed by an officer.         I w a s n ’t searched on

entering the ground and made my way to my seated area.          I did see two

stewards by the stairway to the seat.

I had no difficulty in finding my seat or the entrance to the stand.

I seated myself at about 2.03pm 1403.       My seat was situated in t h e

second row of the stand and almost directly behind the right hand post

looking from the stand towards the pitch.

I was waiting for the kick-off and up until 2 . 5 5 pm 1435 it appeared to

me to be a normal    pre-match situation.     I was looking at the

players kick about before the game and I began to notice that the

crowd below me in pen 3 was crushing;       I w a s n ’t aware that there was a

fence almost immediately below me separating        pens 3 and 4 all    I could

see was a mass of people.     These people were tightly packed but they

could still move about a bit.     Just after kick off the atmosphere

appeared to change and the people no longer had time to move,           the

space around them disappeared and more and more people pushed into the

pen.

I was now aware that there was a problem and the people at the front

of the pens had no way of getting out onto the pitch perimeter           to

relieve the pressure.     I was paying as much attention to the crowd arid

the game, which was duly stopped.      The people in the pens began to

fight for their lives desperately trying to get out.
                                                                          PAGE       3
                                          q s u w w '
                                                                          S2354

At this time the officials       in front of these pens d i d n ’t seem to be

aware of the problems and in fact people        in the front set of the stand

were shouting to open the front gate of the pens.          I c o u l dn ’t say if

these shouts were heard as the crowd was noisy anyway.

I can’t say I saw anything specific        in relation to the injuries or

deaths but I was overlooking the incident as a whole and the problem

seemed to be so difficult to deal with because of the intense            crush

and the fact that the people could not be reached because of the

fencing at the front.      The only relief that I saw was from the stand I

was   in when the persons below were being pulled up         from the pens

into the stand.     I assisted in doing this which engaged        me for about

three quarters of an hour.        I then remained in the stand as instructed

over the loudspeaker.      I then just sat down shocked by it all and

eventually left the ground at about 4.45pm 1645 when told I could do

so by a Police Officer I believe.

Although I did see several       of the deceased carried     from the stand 1

d i d n ’t witness an actual   death.   I would like to say that at the time

I entered the ground I d i d n ’t see many Police Officers but I c a n ’t say

if more arrived after my entry or not.         Also, although the crush was

intense inside pens 3 and 4 I could see room further over to the right

and left of these pens.

I just felt that the seriousness of the situation was grasped soon

enough and people,    both the fans further away and the officials,

thought   it was a pitch invasion rather      than a serious situation.

When the position was realised everything seemed to be done that             could

be done but rescue was hindered by the front fencing and the sheer

mass of people in the pens.

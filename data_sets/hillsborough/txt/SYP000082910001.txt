At    about       3.05        pm    (1505) that           date,             I wa s      stood       with       the       rest    of m y

Charlie         Brown         S h op.      We w e r e     approached                 by a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t ?          who        had

just     emerged          from      the     football              ground,          he     immediately               ordered           us     into

the    gro u n d .

AT, this        time      I had       no    idea w h a t           was       happening,              I entered             the       ground

with    the       rest     of m y        serial         together             with       POL. P S         TAYLOR         arid I n s p N E W E Y

who    were       both     in      possession            of       Police          rad i o s .        As       I approached             the

playing         area      from      the     entrance              between          the     North          Stand         and     the    Spiori

Kop,     I saw       the      players           leaving           the       pitch       and     a    lar g e       c rowd       of

spectators           on    the      pitch        around           the       Lappings           Ln    end      of    the       ground.         My

immediate          reaction was                 t hat    there          had       been     a    pitch          invasion          by    the

Liverpool          fans.           I then        ran a c r o s s            the    pitch        to       offer      my a s s i s t an c e ,

there     were       s ome      Police          officers           present           but       not       many.

As    I moved        closer         to     the    goalmouth,                 I realised              the      full       horror        of    what-

had    j ust      happened.              From     only        a    couple          of     feet       away       from       the       perimeter

fences,         I could         see      people         were       already           dead,          others         were       turning         blue

all    was      in vain.            I then        started              to    shout        to    the       s u p po r t e r s be h i n d to

move     back,       but      there        was    no m o v e m e n t .             The     rest          of m y     colleagues              were

starting          to     pull       spectators             over         the       fen c e ,       I tried           but     found          I was

too     small.         I then        went       to    g at e      nurnber             three       in the         perimeter               fe n c e ,

the     gate      was     open       but       the    exit        from           the    terrace           wa s      blocked           by      bodies

p i t c h.       This     task       was       hindered           by s o m e           of    th e      fans      already            on     the

p itch,         they were           pulling          at    us,        s o me      were       wanting           their        own       relatives

I could          then     see       that       there       appeared               to    be    plenty           of    space          to     the      let"

in the          number       two     enclosure..                 I then           shouted           to    the       spectators                to    movt

to     the      left    to     e a se     the    crush           on    the        people          at     the     fro n t .          They

did     not      move     so      I moved        over        to       this        part       of     the       ground        myself,            there

I discovered              that       there       was       a fence               running          from        front       to     back         hoi d i m

the     people         in s e c t i o n        number        three.              As    I could           do    no m o r e        at      this

stage,          I returned           to       gate    number           thr e e ,        there          'I a s s i s t e d      in the

As     I assisted            in the           removal        of       the        bodies,          1 then         realised             that         one

onto       the    pitch.            This       I continued                 to     do    until          all     of    the       bodies           had

been       removed.            This       effort          wa s    hampered most                     of    the       time       by     some         of

4.                 Th e      only        thing        I can         think           of    that      could      be    relevant          in an

way    to       this       enquiry            is    t h at     the       majority           of    the    supporters             at    the

Leppings          Ln       s id e    of       the    ground          had       been       drinking,,

On my       arrival           at     the       s ce n e ,      whilst          trying        to     shout      to    the     crowd         to

move    back,          some         of     the      supporters                were       obviously        unaware          of    what       had

h a p p e n e d , t h ey w e r e s h o u t i n g a b u s e                     a t t h e P o 1 i ce a n d           t h e t u b u 1 a r par

of    the       barrier           was      thrown         over       the       perimeter            fence      at    the

Police.          At     this        st ag e ,       I ha d      no       idea w h a t        the       barrier       was     that      had

been    thrown,             I only            became          aware       of    the       damaged        barrier        once         I was

inside          the     terrace.

5.                 My      reaction            was       to    tr y a n d           reason with           the       crowd,       but    this

was    impossible,                  the       crowd       appeared             to    be    beyond        r e ason.

6.                 I di d         handle           bodies       at       the        base     of     number      three      gate        and

inside          the    number            three       terrace.             The       bodies        I moved       from       the       base          of

the    gate       were        moved           onto       the    pitch,          there        they       were    tended          to    by       oth

sercices.              The        bodies           I helped          to m o v e          from     the    terrace        were         passed

along       a    line       of P o l i c e .             I h av e        no    idea who           the    bodies       were       passed             t

I cannot          g iv e      any        description                of    any       of    these        that    I passed          on.        At

             this      point,         everything          was    happening             very    quickly.

             7,,                 I     have       policed       several          big    matches          at    Hi lls bo ro ug hFootball

             City,        my    duties       there       entailed       the       orderly          removal          of L e e d s      supporters

             from     their          coaches       and    into    the       ground.          I had       occasion             to a r r e s t      a

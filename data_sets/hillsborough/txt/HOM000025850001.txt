Q    Di d you see m u c h e v i d e n c e of d r i n k i n g ?              A.     Not at that

     time.

#R. GOLDSACK:        What changed at that time?          A.      They were just — -     They

     They       w e r e j us t all g a t h e r i n g round, c o m i n g up my p a s s a g e w a y

     w he n it got to 2 o ' c l o c k I was r e a d y to leave, so I p h o n e d

     coy and they h i de t h e m s e l v e s but t h ey wer e not;               the y             were

     area, w h e r e v e r I c o u l d get c l o s e by.

Q.   Di d you* in fact, go                 to    a general       store       which     has    an
     off-licence facility?                      A.  I did,       yes.

Q,   On w h i c h   r o ad   is    that?         A.     I think       it     is   Southey      Green
     Road.

Q.   W h e n you w e n t     in to t hat shop, w h at was the s i t u a t i o n

     everything.

Q.   W e re   the   staff     in    that    shop      a ble   to c o p e ?        A.     No.

Q.   W hat a c t u a l l y h a p p e n e d ?  A.       Well, t h e r e was two -- one
     was o u t s i d e s e r v i n g sore f l o w e r s and the o t h e r one w as on
     the c a s h till and w h e n she r e a l i s e d w h a t wa s h a p p e n i n g

     end of the s h o p to try to see w h a t th ey w e r e do in g.                  Some
     we re p u t t i n g b o t t l e s and c an s in t h e i r p o c k e t s and u n de r
     t h e i r c o a t s and so she said -- the o t h e r lady was a l r e a d y

                                                                       J.   A.   ELLIS


     w ha t was h a p p e n i n g , they d e c i d e d that they had all                     got    to
     go out, she said, "We are t h r o w i n g e v e r y o n e out".

Q.    How w o u l d you d e s c r i b e      the c o n d i t i o n of t ha t      group      of fans?
     A.   They w e r e drunk.

Q.    And do you k n ow w h i c h t e a m they w e re s u p p o r t i n g ?               A.        No,
     I c o u l d n ' t h o n e s t l y say, no.         I d o n ' t r e m e m b e r s e e i n g any
     c o l o u r s on them.           I t h i n k t he y w er e L i v e r p o o l w i t h t h e i r
     a c c e n t but I c o u l d n ' t s w e a r to that.

Q.   This i n c i d e n t you h a v e just d e s c r i b e d in the shop, w ha t
     time w o u l d you put t ha t at?         A.        Probably about quarter
     to three, ten to thr ee , b e c a u s e I d r o p p e d my h u s b a n d off
     at h o m e first.

Q.   And how did t ha t i n c i d e n t e nd ?                  A.       Well, t h ey w e r e all
     s w e a r i n g b e c a u s e t h ey c o u l d not be s e r v e d and t hen as they

     hay w h i c h they sell a n i m a l t h i n g s j us t in the d o o r w a y and
     they just p i c k e d a big bale of hay up.                              They swo re, they

     out w i t h o u t a n y t h i n g to drink.




                                                         /At    that    time,      quarter.
                                        J.A. ELLIS


Q. Now at that time, quarter-to-3 or so, how many people were
   still in the vicinity of the shop, not in the shop, still
   heading for the ground? - A. Oh I could not say that.

Q.    Just a trickle or a lot of people? -A. Well at that area,
     which is quite a way from the ground then, I should say
     a trickle really there.

Q. At that time? - A. At that time, yes.

Q.   I think when you returned to work on the Monday morning   you
     saw the effects of a lot of drinking in that there was
     litter still all over the road? - A. Yes.


                  Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Q. Mrs. Ellis, I want to ask you about the presence of the
   Police? - A. Yes.

Q. Now you have   told the Inquiry that in the morning there were
   considerable   numbers of youths urinating and exposing them­
   selves. Did    you see many Police about at the time? - A.
   I have never   seen as many Police at a football match.

Q. So far as you were concerned there was not more than you
   have seen but quite an ample presence of Police around?
   - A. Yes.

Q. No shortage of Policemen? - A. No.

Q. And this is throughout the period that you have spoken of,
       throughout that morning that was your view? - A. I could
   not believe the amount of Police that were there.

Q. Were those Police that you saw some on positions and others
   moving about patrolling and getting the fans to move along?
   - A. Yes. No one was allowed to hang around, we noticed
   that and they were there very early as well, the Police.

Q. You have spoken of the mood and attitude of the fans. Did
   numbers of them not appear to be want to be moved along?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Putting up some resistance to the Police? - A. Well they
   seemed to be enjoying themselves.  It seemed a partyatmos­
   phere and the atmospheres are usually very nice. By
   12 o'clock I was saying to the staff:  "I wish I was going
   to the match". The atmosphere was so good.     It wasas I
   said partyfied.  It was electrifying.

Q. It was exciting? - A. It was.

Q. And this is up to about 12 o'clock you are speaking? - A.
   Yes.

                                                       J.A. ELLIS


               Q. You said in a statement you made that you were "astounded"
                  by the numbers you saw drinking? - A. I was, yes.

               Q. That would seem to suggest that you saw not simply people
                  more in drink than they usually would be but more people
                  drinking than normally.  Is that right? - A. Yes.

               Q. So that the picture that we should have is not simply of
                  people having had quite a lot to drink but considerable
                  numbers of people having had quite a lot to drink? - A. Yes.
                  When I passed the supermarket on Halifax Road and Halfords,
                  I don't know whether it is a DIY store or something there,
                  you could not see anything.  I noticed mounted Policemen
                  there but you could not see anything for people just lying
                  around and they were all drinking.

               Q. Would it be right to say there were hundreds lying around?
                  - A. Yes, I would say hundreds.

               Q. Would not be an exaggeration? - A.     No, and that I have never
                  seen before.

               Q. Those that you saw making a nuisance of themselves and
                  urinating in the areas* were they drinking and urinating
                  at the same time? - A. Yes, they were. They were very
                  proud of themselves.

               Q. And they had their arms many of them? - A. Yes, some of
                  them had.

               Q. Filled with what four packs, six packs or whatever, bottles?
                  - A. Yes.

               Q. Did you endeavour to get them to stop what they were doing
                  and move on? - A. I tried to because we could not put the
                  rubbish in the bin because the bin lidis rubber and it
                  is dented and it was just swimming in urine.   I kept saying:
                  "Would you please not do it up against my doors, would you
                  just do it in the edges of the bushes" but they were just,
                  they were just turning round and smiling at us and just
                  opening their zips. There was as many as 40 in a row at
                  one time just all laughing.

               Q.    So would this be right, they hadno regard notonly for
                    your convenience but for your reasonable requests? - A.
                    Yes.

               Q.    You have spoken of a crowd ofyouths coming intothe shop
                    that you went into? - A. Yes.

               Q. Where did they go to first of all. Where did they make
                  for? - A. The Magnet Hotel and the bus that they were on
                  I am sure was a South Yorkshire Transport bus. As I
                  approached the roundabout where the Magnet pub is, the bus
                  came to a halt. They must have shouted to him:      "Stop
                  he rev we want to get off here’
                                                ,’, so he came to a halt and

                                        J.A. ELLIS


     all these youths piled off the bus. He is not supposed to
     let them off if it is not a bus stop. They jumped over
     the wall and went to the big doors. They were banging on
     the doors but obviously they were all locked, so by this
     time then I drove round the roundabout and pulled in and
     they had crossed the road. They were urinating all up
     against the chemist's door and windows along the main road.
     I went into the shop and they followed me in.

Q.   You say that they got off the bus and went    first of all to
     the Magnet Hotel? - A. Yes.

Q.    What youare describing seems to be a sort of invasion, a
     surge of them? - A. They were going to get some drink
     wherever they got it. I don't know where they went afterwards.

Q.    They did not keep to the pavements, they climbed over the
     walls and got in the shortest cut possible? - A. Yes.

Q. When they came into the shop, where did they go to first of
   all? - A. Straight to the drinks.

Q.   And you      said that some were putting     it   into theirpockets
     or into their coats? - A. Yes.

Q.   How did they respond to the reasonable requests of the citizens
     around? - A. Foul language and then I said to the lady, they
     were very flustered, they did not know what to do, so I
     said:   "Just 'phone the Police because there is plenty in
     the area. A couple would be here in a couple of seconds", so
     then they started acted like children and saying:   "Oh telephone
     the Police, 'phone the Police" and just giving abuse out.

Q.   The crowds that you have described sitting around Halfords
     and that area, the Gateway Supermarket area, were they
     Liverpool supporters, were you able to tell? - A. I did
     not notice. There was just such a mass.   I was just so
     shocked at the amount of people lying around drinking.

Q. You came out and saw this crowd at the shop at about 10-to-3?
   - A. Yes.

Q. How far is that away from the ground, what sort of distance
   is it in walking terms? - A. Well I would say perhaps ten
   minutes,

Q. When they came out did they make for the ground or did you
   see where they went to? - A. No, I did not see.

           MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you very much, Mrs. Ellis.


                  FREDERICK JAMES ECCLESTON Called
                      Examined by MR. PHILLIPS:
                                  F.J. ECCLESTON


      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I am sorry you have had to
come back, but I am sure you understand.

      MR. PHILLIPS: What is your full name please? -
A. Frederick James Eccleston.

I think you are a Senior Nurse Manager? - A. I am indeed.

And you live in the Wirral near Liverpool? - A. That is
right.

You went to the match, did you, with your son and another
young man? - A. That is rrght.

What time did you get to the ground? - A. Approximately
approaching the Leppings Lane end 25-past-2.

What was the situation that you saw as you approached at
that time? - A. We came from the river end, across the
bridge, having parked some two miles away from the ground.
The actual approach to where you get to the turnstiles
it was not too bad at that stage.  I am aware of a bus
discharging some of its passengers, a coach. At that point
I actually spoke to a young man who works in the theatre
of the hospital that I work at so we were not crushed, we
had a quiet and pleasant conversation for a couple of
minutes.

Were you able to get to the perimeter gates of the ground?
- A. Yes quite easily, but once you got to the perimeter
gates, which were open, there was then a tremendous crush.
There is no doubt about that.




                      /Q. Were the people
                        8


                                                     F.J. ECCLESTON




Q. Were the people behind you still coming along? - A. There
   were people coming along the Leppings Lane and there were
   people behind me across t(~'~ bridge. There was no crush at
   that time.

Q. How long did it take you to get to the turnstile? - A. It
   took us a good ten minutes or more and that journey to the
   turnstiles was probably the worst I ’ve had. I mean I go to
   every Liverpool game, home and away, and we were a little
   frightened to say the least, but there was humour in the
   crowd.  For instance there were three Police Officers on
   horseback and one of the horses nudged my glasses and the
   Police Officer, we smiled at each other and he apologised
   in fact, and there were Police Officers at the side of the
   river on foot.

Q. Did you see any in the crowd itself? - A. Yes. The
   Police Officers on horseback were actually in the crowd but
   there was no orderly forms oi queues as there normally is
   at football matches these days.

Q. Which turnstiles were you going through? - A. There was
   one of four we were aiming for. There wasn't one in
   particular. We were trying to get in one of those four.

Q.   Which set of turnstiles? Would you like to look           at
     the plan?  - A. It is those four.

Q. Those over there?    -       ft. Yes.

Q. Turnstiles A to G?       -    A. That is right.

Q. Was it crushed the whole of the time that you were going
   through? -     A. From the perimeter gates to the turnstiles
   there was atremendous crush, yes,    and that spilled out
   towards the river. The other side of the bar that is shown
   there ...

Q. The railings?   - A. The railing, yes. The crowd had
   spilled - in fact at one stage we were that side of the bar
   and we had to negotiate our way underneath that to get in
   direct line with the turnstiles.

Q. Were you not able to go back and walK round the end of the
   railings?  - A. No, that had become impossible.

Q. Did you get through the turnstiles?         -     A. Yes.

Q. Straight through? -     A. Yes. The last ten yards we were
   catapulted.    My feet did not touch the ground and my son
   and companion were the same. We ended up in different
   turnstiles and in fact I had my son's ticket and he
   actually had to leap over the turnstile it was that bad,
                          9

                                                F.J. ECCLESTON




   and I then handed his ticket with mine.
Q. Yes.      A. I had never come across that before.         That last
   ten yards, as I say my feet ....

Q.   The turnstile   worked efficiently did it?     -   A. Yes   it
     did.

Q. You then find yourself in the yard behind the turnstile?
   A. Thats right.  As soon as we came through the turnstile
   my son actually was remonstrating with a steward and the
   Police Officer and the steward told him to shut up because
   other fans had done the same thing and had been forcibly
   ejected, so we obviously took notice of that.

Q. Where was this Police Officer and steward? Can you again
   look? - A. Immediately behind the turnstile, within two
   or three yards.

Q. Can you say what the time was at this point? - A.
   Approximately just before twentyto three Ishould think.

Q.   Did you know where   you were going to go? -     A. Yes because
     I had been to the    previous year's game, and it was a
     totally different    approach this time. The year before I
     arrived at ten to    three because of transport problems.

Q. I wi 11 come to that later if I may, but can you tell us
   where you had stood or sat on the previous year? - A.
   Yes. When we came to the turnstiles the previous year
   there was a line of Police Officers and stewards that
   stopped us going through the tunnel. They quite gently but
   forcefully said, "Look, this is full, you've got to go to
   the left or the right" and the previous year I had my
   daughter with me, we went to the right, and then it was
   still crushed because we were under the scoreboard and I
   saw the previous year to the left of the blue boards ....

Q. Would you like again to look at the plan there.  - A. I've
   actually got the picture of the ground which I've arrowed.

Q. It may help us if you turn round and see there. Can you
   see.  If you show us where you went to once you got inside
   this year.

          LORD JUSTICE     TAYLOR:   We are talking about this year
     now are we?

Q.         MR. PHILLIPS:      Yes.   -   A. We went straight to       the
     toilet in fact.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       That is just to the left of the
     tunnel, we know that.
                                          F.J. ECCLESTON



     MR. PHILLIPS:   Then after that where did you go to?
   A. As we came out of the toilet my son said, "Look at
this" and one of the gates was being opened and so I said
to them, "Right, follow me" and we turned to the right.

Turned to the right.  - A. It went past the open tunnel.
In fact I have a unique recollection of looking down that
tunnel and seeing daylight as we ran past, because I knew
from my previous year's experience to go to the left which
was a better vantage point and a safer vantage point.

Look at where the pointer’s going. Did you go up there
then to the right? - A. No we went the other way.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Through the gap in the wall?
A. Through the gap in the wall.

And round to the north side.        -   A. That is correct, and up
the stairs.

       MR. PHILLIPS:  And you went into that corner pen did
you?     - A. No we were high up on the left hand side.

High up on the terracing there? -          A. Do you mind if I ...

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         You go and show us.   -   A.
Exactly there.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Yes I see.

     MR. PHILLIPS:   Thank you very much.  Are you saying
the previous year you had been in fact on the opposite side
of the ground? - A. No. We had first tried to go on the
opposite side of the ground but it was very crushed so I
had looked up to that other side and I'd taken my daughter
out of the crush and gone round the way we went this year.

So what was the situation like in that part of the
terracing where you were? - A. Reasonably comfortable.
There were plenty of fans in there, more than the previous
year but it was comfortable standing there, and what amazed
me at quarter to three was that the far side, and that is
under the scoreboard and the right hand pen were half
empty.

Yes.    -   A. I was astounded to see that this year.

Were you able from where you were to see the centre pens 3
and 4? - A. Yes, very easily.

What did you see there?       -   A. Absolute jam packed at
quarter to three.
                          11


                                               F.J. ECCLESTON



Q. Did you keep an eye on that or were you looking out to the
   field as well? - A. I was looking out to the field as
   we 11.

Q. Do you remember the teams coming out on to the field?
   A. Very distinctly.

Q. And did you take any particular notice of the terraces when
   that happened? - A. No, not particularly.    I didn't take
   much notice that I'd done when I first took my place. That
   was what really astounded me.

Q. Do you remember the kick-off?         -     A. Yes.

Q. And the game starting?        -   A. Yes.

Q. During that time again I suppose you were watching the
   field were you? - A. Yea, undoubtedly.

Q.    And you remember the shot which hit the goal post? - A.
     Yes, it is the only thing I shall neverforget.  I  am
     eternally grateful that Liverpool never scored because I
     think ....

Q.   Did you notice any effect?      -   A. Yes.

Q.   Tell us about that please? - A. Whenever aside attacks
     like that, whether it is this game or any game, the crowd
     surge forward and they did on this occasion.

Q. Which crowd are you talking about now? - A. I'm talking
   about the Liverpool crowd behind the goal.

Q.   In 3 and 4?   -    A. In 3 and 4 yes.

Q.   Did you notice anything particular about that,what was
     happening there? - A. I then noticed that people were
     beginning to be passed down across the heads. Now that is
     a sign that there is problems.

Q. Did you see anything else in those pens? - A. Yes.    This
   coincided with the teams going off. The front of the pens
   were flat. Now when you're at a footballmatch you're
   looking down on a crowd. The heads bob all the time.
   There is movement.   On this occasion I noticed they were
   flat and I knew something was wrong.




                       /Q. You recall seeing the Police Officer
                                   12


                                                        F.J. ECCLESTON


Q. You recall seeing the Police Officer run on to the pitch then
   to stop the game, do you? - A . I do, indeed.

Q. And from then on did you pay particular attention to these two
   terraces? - A. Yes, you could not help but not to because the
   fans were trying to get over the fence. Some of them were
   being pushed back. Some managed to get over. One fan was
   arrested and was pleading not to put him back. You could tell
   he was pleading for something.

Q. Did you see Police Officers on the perimeter track? - A. Yes,
   we did.

Q. Did you see the gates open for pens 3 and 4? -A. There was
   one. One gate was being opened.   It was at that time that I
   turned to my son and said, "Look, they're in trouble down
   there.  I am going down because they need help".

Q. Can you say which gate it was that was open? -A. I think it
   was the one behind the goal, immediately behind the goal.

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Pen 3 or 4? - A. I don't which
     pen.

            MR. PHILLIPS:   I think that would be 4, in fact:

Q. So when did you first realise, by reference to what wasgoing
   on on the field, when did you first realise there was
   something badly wrong? -A. As the teams went off.

Q. As the teams went off? - A. As the teams went off. The Police
   Officer ran on to get the referee to stop it, and your eyes
   then moved as to why this was happening, and you concentrated
   on the area behind the goal.  That is the thing I can remember
   to this day is this flatness of the immediate crowd in front
   of the barrier that led to the pitch.

Q. So you I think then went down to the pitch, did you not? - A.
   That is right.  I knew my way from last year's experience, and
   I got a steward to take me, and he did not hesitate at all.   I
   said, "Look, you are in trouble out there.   I'm a trained
   nurse", and he took me the quickest way under the stand, and a
   Police Officer let me on the pitch.

Q. And you went to the area behind the goal in the first place?          -
   A. That is correct.

Q. And Police Officers, what were they doing at that time when
   you went down? - A. Some seemed to be standing around, but
   some were working like beavers at the gate. The one I
   remember, I am on video with him, that is the Police
   Officer without any hair, and we were literally pulling
   people by any part of their body we could grab hold of,
   their arms, their legs. They seemed to be spilling down
   in a cascade towards that gateway, and there were three
   Police Officers and I was just behind them helping them
   pull the people out. The first people that came out they

                                   13

                                                       F.J. ECCLESTON


         were just shocked.   They could hardly breathe.

    Q. Were you helping them on to the pitch after they hadcome out?
    - A. That is right, immediately on to the pitch behind the net.

    Q. The first people who came out, were they badly injured? - A.
       No.

    Q.   You then went back, I think, and helped some more people? - A.
         By the time you got the top of the pile out you then began to
         get the really injured people out who were unconscious.

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Could you help me, because the
         video does not show this very closely.  The people you were
         getting out first who you say were shocked but not badly
         injured, were they coming from behind where the people you
         eventually got out were, or were they clambering over people
         who were in a worse condition, or were they themselves right
         at the front, do you know? - A. They seemed to be just
         literally tumbling over the people who were at the front.

    Q. They were really coming from behind those who had been right
       at the front? - A. Yes, I think so.

    Q. I think you took a young man out who seemed to have some chest
       injuries? Is that right? - A. That is right.    I worked on
       him.  I can't recall how long for any of the people I actually
       worked, but he came round quite reasonably easily and quite
       well, and it was obvious he had chest injuries.   I shouted to
       him when he tried to struggle up, I said, "Lie down and I'll
       find a stretcher".   I then asked some Policemen around me who
       seemed rather dazed.   I noticed the only stretcher I could see
       was by the penalty spot, and how I saw it was that it was a
       wire mesh one and the wire stuck out, so I ran to the penalty
       spot and grabbed it. On the way back I literally ordered
       three Police Officers to help me carry this fan away. They
       just meekly obeyed me, and we half ran across the pitch.

    Q. At this time was anybody taking control of what was happening
       behind the goal? - A. I am afraid not. Many individual Police
       Officers used their initiative, and they were magnificent,
       let's have no doubts about that. Some were in the pens and
       pulling people up. There was even one trying to bend the
       grills back with his own bare hands, and there were others
       that were beginning to treat the injured at the said, but
       there were others who were just standing there.  There seemed
       to be no overall control.  I would have expected some sort of
       clearing station to be set up around the goal area, people
       using their initiative from a managerial point of view.

    Q. You did go I think with the stretcher you mentioned over to
       the St. John's Ambulance room, did you not? - A. In front of
       the gymnasium behind the stand.

    Q. What scene did you meet when you got there? - A. It was not
       too bad at that stage because a lot of people had not arrived.
       I had literally handed this injured fan over to the St. John's
3
                                  14

                                                     F.J. ECCLESTON


         Ambulance and then turned and ran back because I knew there
         were so many injured coming out to give some more help. So I
         ran across the pitch.

    Q. You then took part, I think, in the resuscitation of people
       who had been brought out of the pens? - A. That is right.

    Q.   And others were helping, of course, to do that, were they not?
         - A. Yes.  I came across a surgeon.  I tried to take over from
         him, so I actually tapped him on the head and apologised.
         Then I moved on to the next person.   There were Police
         Officers giving mouth to mouth.   There were St. John's
         Ambulance people. One of the people I worked on - it was a
         ludicrous situation, because I had to do mouth to mouth and
         chest massage on the same person, which you just cannot do,
         and then he started to vomit.

    Q. Was there any equipment available at that time? - A.
       Absolutely nothing.  I turned to the St. John's Ambulance man
       working alongside me and I said, "For God's sake, have you got
       any swabs to clear this man's mouth?", and all he could hand
       me was a dry sponge.

    Q. Can you say what time this was, approximately? - A. Yes, it
       must have been quarter-past, 20-past-3.

    Q. Were you conscious of ambulance and Firemen arriving at any
       stage? - A. An ambulance arriyed, in my statement I thought it
       was half-past-3.   In fact from subsequent knowledge it was
       about quarter-past, but it was only a St. John's Ambulance one
       which is not well equipped at all.   The Fire Brigade, I was
       becoming conscious they were around.   The fans at this time,
       they were magnificent.   They had used their initiative.  A lot
       of young men had decided - the aggression had gone from them -
       and they wanted to help. They took the hoardings, they
       carried people, they were doing mouth to mouth as they thought
       they could do, and in all this chaos they were trying so hard.

    Q. Did you get any equipment from the ambulance or the Fire
       people? - A. No.  I believe there was an oxygen cylinder
       around, but I did not see anything of that at all.

    Q. I think you then went, did not you, to the gymnasium where
       people were being taken? - A. That is right.

    Q. Were you working in the gymnasium? When did you start working
       in there? - A. It must have been well after half-past-3.   When
       I got around the back by the gymnasium it was again chaotic.
       There were people lying dead on the floor.  There were the
       injured by the St. John's Ambulance room door.  There were
       Police Officers trying to keep control.  There was only a
       small doorway to the gymnasium that was being used, and the
       dead and the living were trying to get through at the same
       time as some stage.

    Q. Were there any medical staff working there in the gymnasium? -
       A. No, the St. John's Ambulance room was busy, obviously, on
                              15

                                                 F.J. ECCLESTON


     the left outside the gymnasium, and when we got in the
     gymnasium it had been divided into two.  I realised afterwards
     half was to receive the dead and half to receive the injured.
     On the injured side there appeared, I was aware there were
     three doctors eventually, and they were treating around about
     a dozen injured people. One of the doctors turned to me and
     said, "For God's sake, have we got any drugs?".  There was no
     equipment whatsoever even in the gymnasium at that stage.

Q. Did you try to get some drugs? - A. Yes, I then ran out of the
   gymnasium and contacted some senior Police Officers who were
   in that no man's land area outside, and they immediately
   must have gone and they did find something for us within
   five minutes.  It was just three small boxes of equipment.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Do you know where they came from?
     - A. No, I don't, I am afraid.  There was no Health Authority
     sign on it.

Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   Had you tried to get any from the St.
     John's Ambulance room? - A. Yes. When the doctor asked for
     drugs I went to the St. John's Ambulance and they said, "I'm
     sorry, we don't carry that sort of equipment.  We are not
     allowed to have any drugs of any sort” .

Q. What did you do after you got back to the gymnasium? - A. I
   then helped the doctors set up 10 intravenous lines.

Q. Where did you get the equipment from? - A. They were in the
   boxes.

Q. In the boxes you had received from the Police Officers? - A.
   In the boxes we had received.  There were some forceps, some
   scissors, some swabs, some splints and there was enough
   equipment to set up 10 intravenous lines.  Then I went round
   with each doctor helping them set up the lines. We then co­
   opted individual Police Officers to actually hold the bottles
   or the packs up because we had no stands of any sort.

Q. How long were you in there doing this sort of thing? - A.
   Until about half-past-4, and by then the injured that were
   there had actually been removed.  I was aware, my attention
   was drawn to the other part of the gymnasium.    I was shocked.
   I actually, not consciously, wandered into that area, and I
   found I recognised a young girl who we had been working on at
   the side of the pitch, and stayed with her husband who was
   absolutely mortified, as you can imagine.   I could give some
   consolation, I suppose, because she was the girl that the
   surgeon was working on, so at least she had had some good
   attention from an individual point of view.

Q. Can you cast your mind back now, if you will, to the
   previous year and this year, and tell us some of the
   differences you noticed between the two events, because you
   went to both events. You say you came later on the
   previous year? - A. That is right.

Q. Was the journey to the turnstiles along Leppings Lane any
   different on the previous year? - A. Yes, the previous year,
   my daughter and I had not been allowed to get to the
   turnstileswithout the Police made sure we had a ticket.

Q.   From which direction had you come? - A. We had come from the
     other direction the previous year, from down the Leppings
     Lane....

Q. From the roundabout? - A. From the roundabout, that is right,
   because we came by coach the previous year.

Q.   How did this happen that you were checked for tickets on the
     previous year? - A. The previous year there seemed to be a lot
     more Police Officers around, and there was not the same crush,
     let us be quite honest and fair about this, there was nowhere
     near the same crush at 10-to-3 when I arrived the previous
     year.

Q. Were there simply groups or lines of Police Officers, or were
   there metal barriers or what? - A. There were lines of Police
   Officers the previous year.

Q. Across the pavement or the whole road? - A. You had to go
   down.  They channelled you off, so you had to go past them,
   and "Have you got a ticket?", was requested of you before you
   actually got anywhere near the turnstiles.

Q. Did you have to show your ticket? - A. Yes, I had it in my
   hand.

Q. Had you seen anything like that all in 1989, this year? - A.
   No.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Eccleston, about how far up
     the road from the entrance, from the perimeter gate;s, about
     show far up the road were you challenged for your ticket in
     1988? - A. I think it was round about the perimeter gates.

Q. Near the gate?    Not further up the road? - A. Not far away,
   no.

Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   Had you had a reasonable journey to
     Sheffield on both occasions? - A. Both occasions, for some
     reason or another, the M62 had road-works.  They were
     opened just a week or ten days before either game.  This
     time we had actually avoided them by going through the
     country area and Glossop.  That is the reason why we were
     late on both occasions, in fact, because we like to be at
     the ground a good hour before.

Q.   So although you arrived at 25-past-2, that was later than you
     had hoped? - A. Yes, most definitely.

Q. You have already told us in 1988 when you went through the
   turnstiles you were pointed away from thetunnel? - A.    Yes,
   most definitely.                     /Cross-Examined b y ....

Q.   The n ext t h i n g I w a n t to ask you a b o u t is the s o - c a l l e d

     that fans get on the pitch.                          W ha t was h a p p e n i n g at

     a t t e m p t to r us h out a c r o s s the field.                  They w e r e just

                                               F.J. ECCLESTON


      Q. From your vantage point, Mr. Eccleston, is there any way
         that anyone who was injured or passing out could have made
         their way up against the crush of the people that you have
         described in the pens behind the goal? - A. No way at all.

      Q. Equally when you got on to the pitch and you went behind
         the goal nets to assist in pulling people out from behind
         the fence and the gate which was now open, could you have
         seen if any bodies were being passed up the terrace again
         to go out through the tunnel and out the other side? - A.
         To be fair I could not because I was concentrating on the
         gate and the people that were cascading down on to that
         gate.

      Q. You have described the people that were coming out first,
         using your word "cascading" over the bodies that were in
         front. Do you think it is likely that anybody could have
         been taken from the front of that pen, up through that
         crowd and out through the tunnel? - A. There was no chance
         at all.

                 MR. KALLIPETIS:   Thank you very much.

      Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Well you say that. You are
           talking, as I understand it, about the stage when you and
           others, Police Officers were frantically getting people
           out.

                 As I understand it from the evidence there was a
           gradual thinning out from the pens of people who were able
           to leave. Is that right? Some being hauled up on to the
           seating area and so on? - A. When I actually started to
           work with the Police Officers I was only conscious of people
           immediately around that gate and then they were being
           pulled out by me and others and then I was beginning to
           work on them at the side of the pitch. After that I am
           not conscious of what was going on in the pens.

      Q. What   I was really asking is this:   are you   able tosayone
         way or the other whether everybody who died or who was
         in extremis, was brought out only in the pitch direction
         or may some have been taken out another way? - A. No,
         obviously from what I gleaned afterwards I realised that
         some had gone back out of the tunnel.

      Q. Some of the injured and dead? - A. Some of the injured        and
         dead had gone back out of the tunnel, sir, yes.

                 MR. KALLIPETIS:  Sir, perhaps it is my fault for
           not making it clear.  I wanted to establish a particular point
           and it is up till about 20-past-3.

      Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Up to about 20-past-3, though,
           you were not aware of anybody going out that way? - A.
           That is correct, sir, yes.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you.   I think it is
           you, Mr. Woodward.

             Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD;

Mr. Eccleston, may I ask you about 1988 please,  In 1988
you arrived at the ground at somewhat later than this
year? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

And on that occasion you were able to make your way in
considerable freedom along Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, that
is true.

There were hardly any people about, comparatively speaking?
- A. Well there was not any crush.   It was a normal sort
of football crowd going to a game on that occasion. Of
course remember everybody was hurrying at 10-to-3.   I was
amongst the late comers on that day.

And you became aware of the Police near the gates, was it?
- A. That is right, as far as I can remember.

When those gates are opened obviously there are fence, gate,
fence, gate, one can see it on the pictures? - A. That is
right, yes.

You say you were asked whether you had got a ticket? - A.
That is right, yes.

Whereabouts was the Officer that asked you? - A. I think,
as I say it is twelve months ago and I have been to a lot
of football matches, but I think it was the entrance to
the perimeter gates. They consciously wanted to make sure
we had a ticket and had a right to be there to go through to
the turnstile.

It was somewhere by the perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

Now are you just conscious of an Officer speaking to
you at that point? - A. Yes.

It is not, you are not suggesting there was a cordon of
Policemen through which every person had to pass? - A. No,
I could not honestly say that,no.

So to be fair your recollection is that 1988 when you came
to the ground you were asked by the Police Officer whether
you had got a ticket? - A. That is right, yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Can you help me as to what
you meant by "lines of Police Officers channelling you
off"? - A. As far as I can recall we were made to go in
as a queue.
What, before the perimeter gates or after? - A. Well I
am conscious it was round about the perimeter gates.
We were channelled into the turnstiles, whereas this
year it was just a milling crowd. As I say I go to so
many football matches.
                                     F.J. ECCLESTON


      MR. WOODWARD:  It is difficult, isn't it. There is
the experience; then there is the things you read and the
film you see and the trauma through which you have been?
- A. Yes. My daughter remembers this as well. She was
very conscious that we were not allowed to approach without
making sure we had our tickets in our hands.

Doing the best you can what you are saying is concerning
1988 is that by the gate you were asked whether you had
got a ticket? - A. That is correct.

And you are not suggesting there was a line of Officers
doing that to everybody? - A. No, but I think that every­
body that approached.  I cannot say there was a complete
line, you had to walk down a line of Officers, no.

I suggest there was nothing formal like a cordon set up
there? - A. No.

You would agree with that? - A. Yes.

And then you say you made your way to the turnstile but
you got into queues? ~ A. That is right, although at
 10-to-3 there was really no queue the previous year.

You are not suggesting there were lines of Policemen from
the perimeter gates between which people walked? - A. No.

There were Police about .... A. Yes, but making sure
we were going in in order towards the turnstiles.

They were directing you to ....  A. Each individual turn­
stile. You had to go to one turnstile.

Where was the Policeman that directed you, was he by the
turnstiles? - A. No, the previous year it was around the
perimeter gates where I was first directed towards.

So is this the picture that you have or the recollection
that you have, of a Policeman saying to you:  "Got your
ticket?"; you showed him the ticket and he then pointed
you off to a particular place to go? - A. Well it was so
obvious where the turnstiles were and there was not a
crush then.

Well   that is right, you see, this is the problem. You
did    not need to be directed into queues at that time?
- A.   No, but they had taken the trouble to provide
the     service, if you like, to make sure you had a ticket
and    you were going to the right place.

You did not need to be directed into queues. You could
see where to go and there were Policemen about who, is
this what you would have us understand, that those Police­
men would direct you, and did direct you, because the
turnstiles at that stage were obviously slowing people
down who wanted to get into the ground, and if there was
                                     F.J. ECCLESTON


a knot of three or four at one you would be directed to
another turnstile? - A. Yes.

And is that the picture? - A. Yes.

Can I come to when you got into the ground in 1988. You
have a recollection of there being people at the access or
entrance to the tunnel area? - A. That is correct, yes.

Now those people included stewards? - A. Yes.

Can you say how   many? - A. No, I can't, but it was certainly
enough to make    sure you must not go down that tunnel,
because at that   stage I did not know Hillsborough at all
and that is the   place I would have gone.

That would be at what time in 1988? - A. That is approximately
10-minutes-to-3.

So there were people at the entrance to the tunnel. Were
they in a line or a group? - A. A line or a group.  I cannot
really remember exactly.

You would identify the stewards by their tabards? - A. That
is right, yellow.

You say there were Policemen as well? - A. I am certain of
that, yes, there was a mixed group.

Now it may be difficult to recall, but are you saying that
there were more Policemen there than Stewards or really
more Stewards than Policemen or what? - A. It is very much
of a recollection.  I think there were perhaps more Stewards,
I think. That I would not like to be entirely certain
about.

It is very difficult but what you are saying is your
impression is of there being more Stewards and perhaps one
or two Policemen with them. Is that the picture? - A. Yes,
I think so.

And it was Stewards really who were stopping you going in?
- A. Yes, combined.

They had the authority of a Policeman there but it was the
Stewards who were stopping you going in? - A. Yes.

That is your best recollection? - A. That is indeed, yes.

Now may I ask you about 1989. The approach that you had
was over the bridge? - A. That is right.

You came from the south side and the approach over the
bridge was a perfectly normal approach? - A. Yes.

In terms of crowd and volume? - A. Yes.

                                         F.J. ECCLESTON


Q. Did you encounter any people asking for tickets? - A. No,
   I did not at all.

Q. Is it your recollection not a single person asked you for
   a ticket? - A. I don't think they did no, but to be fair
   I know people turned up without tickets.  I know that.

Q. How do you know that? - A. Because that is .... Liverpool
   are the most successful club in Europe and every away match,
   whether it is an F.A. Cup or the League you have to have
   tickets. The only place you get tickets from are actually
   in Liverpool and a lot of people turn up in the hope they
   will get spare tickets and also a lot of away games they
   actually open turnstiles when they have not sold enough
   tickets, so there may have been a thought, you know, "If
   there is room in the ground I might be able to get in and
   pay cash".

Q. But quite a lot of publicity was given before the match,
   was it not, in the Anfield Review and in the local media?
   - A. Yes.

Q."Not to come if you have not got tickets"? - A. But it still
   does not follow.  I have been to grounds this season that
   they have still opened turnstiles.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    For people to pay over the
     counter? - A. Yes.

Q. Have you ever been to a match where they have opened the
   gates and let people in without tickets or anything? - A.
   No never sir, no.

Q. So as far as you know there is no reason for non-ticket
   holders to go to a match in the expectation or hope that
   the gates might just be thrown open? - A. No, no, they
   would expect to pay if they could not get a spare ticket,
   I am absolutely certain of that.

Q.         MR. WOODWARD: These non-ticket holders if they
     can't get a ticket, they have invested in the journey,
     they will do their darnedest to get in? - A. That is a
     fair comment but I have not witnessed any other method
     bar fair means of trying to get in, put it that way.

Q. But coming along over the bridge you saw the crowd at the
   Leppings Lane entrance and you noticed a considerable amount
   of people coming along from Leppings Lane travelling in
   the opposite direction? - A. Yes, there was far more from
   that side than there was from the side I had come from.

Q. Did you see any people carrying drink? Did you see a single
   can of beer? - A. Yes, I am sure I did. Unfortunately it
   is something you get used to going to football matches.
   It is not something I condone but yes, I am afraid there
   must have been and I am sure there were, and of course

they have the cans until the very last moment before going
into the ground and then they leave them outside the ground
on the floor or anywhere.

They drink it? - A. They drink   it or just don't finish it
and drop it on the ground I am afraid.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  If it is any help to you, those
of us that went to the ground the day afterwards saw beer
cans on the ground, on the ground side of the turnstiles.

      MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you sir.

When you came to the crowd outside the gate was it,      asyou
have been asked by Mr. Hytner,   quite obvious to you    there
was a great crush inside? - A. Inside the ground?

Inside the gate? - A. Oh inside the gates, yes, I was
surprised.  I knew I had to join in but I was not anticipating
the enjoyment of having to join that throng.

So you could see it as I suppose could everybody else that
was approaching it? - A. Oh yes, there was no doubt about
that.

Well did anybody hold back? - A. Well at 25-past-2, half­
past-2 it was still quite a jovial crowd. You could with
some reasonable assumption think you could get into the
ground at that stage with your ticket.




                           /Q. And get in through that

                                              F.J. ECCLESTON



Q. And get in through that crowd with reasonable safety and
   with reasonable convenience? - A. That is right.

Q.   Given that it's a football match.   -   A. Yes.

Q. So it would be wrong to have the impression from your
   evidence that at the time that you came to the gates you
   shouldn’t have joined the crowd? - A. Well, I mean I had
   a ticket and I wanted to get in the game so I would join
   that crowd because I knew that was the only way to get in.

Q.   But you see it has been put to you it was plain as a
     pikestaff that the situation was such. Now let us look at
     that carefully.   You were going to the match. You had got
     your ticket. You saw the crowd.   It was quite crowded.
     A. Yes .

Q. Nevertheless according to your experience and judgment and,
   if I may say so, sir, your responsible attitude, you
   decided it was reasonable to advance and to go in. - A.
   That is right.

Q.   And you didn't have any qualms about going on.      -   A. No I
     didn't .

Q. We must go in and go to the turnstiles.      -   A.   That is
   right  .
Q. This would be at about what time?     -   A. I would say around
   about half past two.

Q.    So you were making your way through to theturnstiles when
     you say you were catapulted forward? - A. The last ten
     yards only.

Q. So something must have happened behind you did it? - A.
   Now that I couldn't say, but I can't imagine an enormous
   crowd joining in five minutes.  I don't know but I'm just
   using my imagination because I didn't look behind me.

Q.   You wouldn't have expected anything like that.      -   A. No.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Have you ever watched the bath
     water going out? It accelerates as it getsnearer the plug
     hole doesn't it? - A. That is right.

Q.       MR. WOODWARD:    May I ask you about the plug hole?
     Did suddenly the turnstiles allow more people to go
     through? - A. Mo.

Q. It wasn't as if there was a great relief ahead of you into
   which people ran? - A. No.
                                          F.J. ECCLESTON



This was pressure from behind?     -   A. It must have been
pressure from behind, yes.

     MR. WOODWARD:      I'm not sure, sir, how full one's bath
is at the end:

Thera was a lot of people came in behind you?       -   A. Yes.
Oh undoubtedly must have done.

And you had not been expecting that. - A. No.    I have
never experienced being actually catapulted through the tan
yards.

Did you see people barging into the crowd, getting in the
side, thrusting themselves in? - A. I wasn't aware of
people barging in.   It was very much a jostling crowd.
There was no form of order at all, some people getting
quite irate, but there was still, as I pointed out in my
own experience, there was still a little bit of humour
around at that stage.

Did you see Policemen about? - A. There were three
mounted Officers who actually we knew by face because they
are from Liverpool and experienced in handling at
Liverpool. There were also some Officers on foot too at
the side by the river.

They were making valiant efforts were they?     -   A. Yes.

To control the crowd? - A. Because if it became worse
the river must have been a danger I presume, I don't know.

So having got to the crowd at two thirty, you got through
the turnstiles at about what time? - A. I think just
before twenty to three.

Did you hear anything on the public address system, that is
the tannoy, not a landrover, round about twenty to three? -
A. Nothing at all sir, no.

Telling people to not push, telling the crowds to hold
back, nothing to that effect? - A. I wasn't aware of it,
put it that way.

Was there much noise?    -   A. Oh yes, there was a lot of
noise in this ....

Chanting, shouting ....   - A. Oh no, not so much.    There
was some chanting behind us in the Leppings Lane end, but
you concentrated on your efforts to get through those
turnstiles.  People were, you know, they were being pushed
and jostled.

Q. If there was a message at that time it didn't appear to
   have any effect? - A. No I was concentrating too much.

Q. You went into the ground and decided to take up the
   position, and took up the position which you aimed for?
   A. That is right, which is the same as last year.

Q.   That would be about two forty    five would it?          - A. Yes.

Q.   Are you sure about that?   -   A. I am yes.

Q.   Now what you told the Inquiry is that at two forty five the
     state of the pens 3 and 4 was jammed packed. - A. Yes.

Q.   No room for anybodyin there.      -   A. I wouldn't have
     thought so.

Q. And you had a good view of it did you?          -       A. Yes.

Q. Would you have a look please at the composite bundle of
   photographs, album 2. The first photographs in that bundle
   are timed, and the corrected time for the first one is two
   forty six. Do you have the photograph in front of you?
   A. Yes.

Q. Now that shows gate 4, pen 4, a little to the left of it
   one can see the fence dividing pen 4 from pen 3. Do you
   see the Scottish flag in the foreground?  - A. Yes I do.

Q.   And then one can see into pen 3, down at the front there
     behind the goal. Would you look at those pictures. You
     see one can see room round the fence, one can see
     supporters standing and turning and looking in different
     directions.   There would appear to be quite a lot of free­
     dom down at the front there, certainly in that area at that
     time, would you agree.   - A. There is some space, yes, I
     would agree.

Q. Ic is not jam packed there is it?       -   A. It would appear
   not.

Q. And anybody looking at tht might have the impression that
   there was room to come into the terrace.  - A. If you were
   standing in front of it as the photographer was, yes.

Q. Of course it depends on your viewpoint.             -     A. That is
   right.

Q. And it depends what you are looking at, but looking at the
   first, the second and the third photographs in that bundle
   showing that area - it doesn't show the whole area, but it
   shows the area down by the corner of the goal between pens
   4 and 3 and that foreground, so the photographs are

numbered DB1629, DB1630, DB1631.        Now that is at two forty
six....
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I'm sorry, I'm trying to relate
this to the schedule of times but I think the schedule of
times put in before me only relate to album 1. Is there a
schedule 2?

       MR. WOODWARD:   There is sir,    yes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   It is a couple of         sheets    is it
in all, or is there an extra one?

     MR. WOODWARD:   There is a schedule for 1, sir, and a
schedule for 2, and they are both a couple of sheets long.
(Produced)  I have handed you two in case either of your
Assessors ....

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Hava you got one more?

     MR. GLASGOW:   Sir the bundle 2 that Ihanded up to
you on Thursday of   last week we took the   libertyof writing
the correct time on the opposite page, if you've still got
it.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes indeed.

     MR. GLASGOW:   You can take it from me that those are
right, we wrote them on ourselves, so you can abandon
those.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you, so I can dispense
with those.  I think the others have not got them. (Copy
produced to Mr. Johnson)

     MR. WOODWARD:    I       understand, sir,       you will haveon
the left hand side ....

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes I've got it now, two forty
six.

     MR. WOODWARD:   That relates to the photograph on the
right and not to the back of the picture.  It relates to
the facing page.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes.

     MR. WOODWARD;   DB1629, that condition, that state,
certainly in that area, is one where you were going to want
to stand and you would have no doubts about going to stand
there, according to the state of the crowd there. - A.
From the point of view of the photograph yes, but if ....
                          33



                                                  F.J. ECCLESTON




Q. Well you seem to have some reservations. What are they?
   A. To get to there you couldn't get from the behind to
   there.   It is well packed behind.  I would never attempt to
   get anybody else into that situation just because there's a
   little bit of room at the front.   It is well packed in my
   opinion.

Q. If you look at the next photograph, DB16 30, that is a view
   taken, you can see at the top of the back there the
   entrance to the tunnel and then a further view along the
   front of those people facing the perimeter fence.   - A.
   And that is 31 is it?

Q. Thats DB1630.      -   A. 30 yes.

Q. And then D81631, all taken at about the same time,          two
   forty six.  - A. There is enough people in there,           bearing
   in mind that as soon as the gate starts the crush,          people
   push to the front, for people's comfort to last an          hour and
   a half.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Presumably, looking at 31, the
     man whose head you can't see, and whose hands are on the
     underside of the seating stands, is standing on the
     dividing fence at   the entrance to the tunnel, or the exit
     from the tunnel.   Must be mustn't it?

          MR. WOODWARD:        That seems to be the only foothold
     there sir.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  And the man to the left we can
     see on the other photograph as well must be sitting on
     some thing.

          MR. WOODWARD:        That is the wall I think sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Oh yes, that is the bit of
     brick wall that projects.

           MR.   WOODWARD:   Yes, there are two buttresses that
     come out    either side of the tunnel, and one can see those
     in 3.1 on   the right, either side.  I think they remain a
     constant    featureon most of the pictures.

          THE WITNESS:     From what the previousgentleman said I
     would expect on 29 that a steward would encourage people to
     move into that space.
Q.        MR. WOODWARD:     Yes, you would expect stewards to be
     encouraging people to come down. - A. That is right.
     And that does happen in other games.

                                                 F.J. ECCLESTON




Q. So the impression on those photographs, that sort of
   situation that you see on those photographs, is one which
   if it's going to be interfered with or directed by anybody,
   would be by saying to the people at the back, "Come down a
   bit, come forward." - A. Yes but more likely, the
   easiest to communicate with are the people in the front.
   If they fill the front in properly those automatically will
   come from the back.   You won't get communications through
   to those at the back.

Q. So the packing would be done by saying to the people at the
   front, "Come on, pack up a bit closer, there's more room."
      A. Yes.

Q. "Let those at the back have more room".      -   A. That is
   correct yes.

Q. And we know that shortly after this the cry ran up "Go
   back. Go back" because the situation changed. You, in
   your statement, describe surprise at seeing the lack of
   occupation at the wings.  - A. Yes.

Q. Did you know there were gates at the back of the terrace,
   at the top of the terrace, to give access to the wings?
   A. Yes. Well I gleaned that information later, after the
   event.

Q. You didn't know then?     -   A. I didn't know at the time, no.

Q.    According to your statement if one reads it through, would
     it be right to say that once you were in the ground and in
     your posi tion you really observed no problems or difficulty
     until the game had been in progress for about five minutes?
         A. The game stopped at six minutes past three. One
     became aware at approximately four minutes past three that
     the crowd were in trouble because they were trying to get
     over the fences.

Q. Your attention, and you were in a position to see all that
   was happening .... - A. Thats correct.

Q ..... was not really upon the state of the terraces until
    about five minutes, four minutes past three? - A. That
    is right yes.

Q. When people started to come over.      -   A. Yes.

Q. And you in fairness said that at that time the perception
   that this wasn't a pitch invasion might take some time to
   dawn on people.  - A. Oh yes.

Q. And it would be understandable that some might construe it
                      35


                                              F.J. ECCLESTON



   as that. - A. Yes, but having said that, why should I be
   the first, to dawn on me when ....

Q. No reason at all.  The evidence that you gave relates your
   attention to the problems in the terrace to a surge and
   something happening on the pitch.  - A. That is right.

Q. That was the time that the goal was nearly scored.   -   A.
   Yes .

Q. Can I ask you now about the gates? Is it your impression
   that whilst there were these crowds in the pens that the
   real disaster, the substantial problem, occurred really
   around about and close to the gates? - A. Yes, but this
   is, if I may express a personal opinion ....

Q. Yes. - A. I think if there is a way the crowd could have
   spread to the left and to the right - in other words, it is
   the side partitions that cause the trouble. They make them
   into pens.  If you have got a fencing in front of you you
   can live with that, and I can understand that, but I don't
   understand why we have to be penned in from the side
   because when the crush came you could have moved to the
   left or right. That would have saved life.

Q. It was your impression of where there were people trapped
   and caught as opposed to people being squashed, if I can
   make that distinction, down by the gates .... - A. That
   is right.

Q ..... there were people who were all entangled and then
    meshed.   - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. And is really your impression this:  that that enmeshing,
   that entangling, that confusion, was in and around the area
   of the gates?




                           /A. I think it was spread
                              36


                                                 F.J. ECCLESTON


     - A. I think it was spread out all the way along, but then I
     would think the place people would try to go to is the gates.
     If they could find any room, it is the place we all try to go
     through a door, is it not, to get out? So, yes, there may
     have been more than there was in the outer parts away from
     the gates.

Q. If I can put it this way, the concentration of disaster seemed
   to get greater towards the gate? - A. I think that is correct,
   yes.

Q. And the gates were so narrow? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q.   And there were steps up to them? - A. Yes, so Igather.

Q.   The Police, you had paid tribute to many of the Officers.  You
     described their conduct and quick thinking and presence of
     mind as magnificent? - A. That is right, certain individuals,
     they used their common sense and initiative.

Q. Would it be right also to note that as with spectators and
   others there were people who were dumbstruck? - A. Yes.

Q.   They were perplexed and bewildered? - A. Yes.

Q.   And really did not know what to do? - A. It was as though it
     had not come into their book of rules. They really had never
     seen anything like this.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Who are you talking about now? -
     A. I am talking about Police Officers.  I think, quite
     honestly, some did not know. They had not been orders about
     this sort of situation, whereas others they seemed to over­
     ride their orders and use their caring humanity side to
     realise what was happening.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   So the picture is not really one of
     Policemen just standing around wilfully not doing things, but
     many Officers perplexed? - A. Yes.  I have made the statement,
     just lacked leadership in my person opinion.

Q. Lacked direction, something to galvanise them and go? - A.
   Yes. We needed the old Sergeant with his stick walking up and
   down to as you say galvanise people into some sort of order.

Q. When they got it there were those who responded? - A. Yes.
   Well, some responded without it.

Q. Oh, yes. But there was a time, was there not, when there were
   Police Officers along the perimeter fence trying to help
   people come over? - A . Some were.

Q. Which because of their presence just could not let any more
   Officers up, so numerous were they? -A. Yes.

Q. And there were Officers who went inside to try and help? - A.
   Yes.

                                                    F.J. ECCLESTON



Q.   They entered into it? - A. Yes.

Q.   Almost regardless of the risk to themselves?    - A. Yes, that is
     a fair comment.

Q. Did you see any Officers come in from the back, from the
   tunnel? - A. No, I did not.

Q. Would it be right, just as there may have been people looking
   from the front who did not appreciate what was happening,
   there were numbers in the terrace itself further back who
   plainly did not appreciate what was happening? - A. That is
   quite possible, but I think the crush was such everybody in
   those two pens knew. But that is a general observation.

Q. Did you see any response - whether it could have been
   responded to may be a matter to be looked at - did you see any
   response to those Officers' cries on the fence to get back,
   to get back? - A. No, I was too engrossed inwhat  I was trying
   to do with individuals to note that.

Q. Thank you.

                   Cross-Examined bv MR. GLASGOW:

Q. Mr. Eccleston, could you just help us as to timing. When you
   came into the ground the first thing you did was to go to the
   toilet, I think? - A. That is correct.

Q. And as you came out and turned round you could see the
   gate behind you just being opened? - A. That is right.
   My son remarked on this and he drew my attention to i t .

Q. And anticipating what would happen when that gate was opened,
   you made your way quickly back towards it, in fact? - A. No.

Q. Well, just turn round to get this accurately.  I know you did
   not intend to go towards it but you would have had to go.... -
   A. It is that gap we came through.

Q. So you have had to take a number of steps towards the gate? -
   A. I suppose so.

Q. Before going through the wall? - A. Yes.

Q. But you were concentrating on making your way as quickly as
   you could to a place of safety in what we know as pens 5 and
   6? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see for yourself what did happen when the gates
   opened? - A. No, I did not.  I didn't hang around.

Q. You simply saw them being opened? - A. Yes.

Q. By the time you got round and up into the high area where you
   have indicated it was obvious to you that the people who were

                                                             F.J. ECCLESTON


          coming in through the gate as you turned the corner would have
          been in the ground by then? - A. Yes, because they would go
          straight down the tunnel.

     Q. It was just your help with this, Mr. Eccleston.   When you
        first came out on to the high terrace and got your bearings
        and looked down into pens 3 and 4 in the centre, the scene you
        saw there had already been joined by whoever had come down the
        tunnel from the opening gate? - A. Yes, I would imagine so.

     Q.   I wonder if we could look....

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        The first wave?

               MR. GLASGOW:   For the first time, my Lord:

     Q.   I didn't want to criticise you at all, Mr. Eccleston, because
          you are doing admirably well, but I think I could fairly tell
          you we know probably as a certainty that the gate was
          actually opened at 2.47.  If I were to tell you that I am
          sure you would accept therefore you must have in fact been
          making your way on to the terraces probably at 2.48 or 2.49?
          - A . Yes.

     Q. And that was not a criticism.  Perhaps you could help us with
        the photographs. The bundle 2 you were looking a t , could we
        look at the timing of those.  You have been perfectly properly
        and helpfully asked about the scene that is shown in the
        first three photographs. Could we look at the second
        together, which we know was taken at2.46. Just to help
        you, that is taken probably very shortly before you are
        coming out of the toilet, because it is taken not less
        than 60 seconds before the gate is opened. - A. Right.

     Q. And it would be fair to say, would it not, despite the
        climbing on the walls at the back there is room at thefront
        quite evidently for people to be turning round and free space
        to move? - A . Yes.

     Q. There is nothing you could properly call a crush against the
        fencing? - A. No.

     Q. And indeed, these first three photographs, all taken at
        approximately the same time, if we go back to photograph No. 1
        there is the young man with theScottish flag with really
        quite a lot of space all round him by gate 4? - A. That is
        correct.

     Q. That is the situation at 2.46. Would you go on to the fourth
        photograph, just 4 minutes later.   It is DB 17/14. Again, you
        can take it from me that is taken at 15.00.    In other words,
        precisely 3 o'clock.  It is right to say, is it not, that we
        there do see the solid density, the mass of people crushed
        together at the front, which is what you were describing as
        the solid, unmoving, with no bobbing heads? - A. That is
        correct.

                                                   F.J. ECCLESTON


Q. And the situation as you first saw it must have been, although
   from a different angle, that which is illustrated in this
   photograph which is taken at 3 o'clock? - A. I imagine so.

Q.   Or within a minute or so of that? - A. Yes.

Q.   And it is also fair to say that by 3 o'clock,  whether or not
     you were conscious of the precise time, at least one fan was
     climbing over the front fence - we see him in the picture -
     and the gate is open, and I accept wholly docilely and
     properly fans are being allowed out, and as we see on
     the video are being filtered along the front to be taken into
     the pens 1 and 2 at the far end. But what I wanted your help
     with, Mr. Eccleston, is, were you conscious of that scene
     going on at about 3 o'clock? - A. No, I would be concentrating
     very hard on the game at that stage.

Q.   You were not aware of it until some moments later? - A. It was
     moments later, yes, undoubtedly.

Q.   But it is now clear you never had a sight of pens 3 and 4
     before they had been hit by the impact of the first opening    of
     the gate? - A. I suppose I had not, no, if your....

Q. Assume, please, my timing is right. - A. Yes, I will, indeed.

Q. Thank you.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   By the time you got to your seat
     were the teams out? - A. No, they were not, sir.

Q. Can you give any idea how soon after you got to your seat they
   came out? - A. I thought I reached my standing position at
   quarter-to-3. Obviously it was a couple of minutes later than
   that.  The Liverpool side must have come at about 7-minutes-
   to-3.

Q. You had been in position at any rate for a minute or two? - A.
   O h , yes.

Q. Before the teams came out? - A. Yes, that is correct, sir.

Q.        MR. GLASGOW:   The other matter, Mr. Eccleston, I would
     like your help on please, is the question of the presence of
     stewards.  Did you see the yellow tops you have described down
     on the pitch perimeter mingled with the Police? - A. I think I
     saw some, yes.

Q. I simply wanted to know this. Did you - perfectly fairly -
   assume because you saw the yellow jackets, that they were
   stewards? - A. Yes.

Q. Just to clarify the point, if we look together at any of the
   later photographs, if you like, in the last section, flip
   through at your liberty, but PR 112/A, PR 21 is perhaps the
   clearest, do you see that situation? - A. Yes.

Q.   Those are the sort of men you saw wearing those yellow
     jerkins? - A. That is right, yes.

Q.   Did you or do you now appreciate they are in fact press   men? -
     A . I do now, yes.

Q. And not stewards? - A. That is right.

Q.   And you would have fairly got the impression those particular
     men wearing yellow jerkins did not do anything to help because
     they were too busy taking photographs of people? - A. Yes, I
     could easily have mistaken that, yes, but I must admit I was
     not aware both sets were wearing yellow jerkins, no.

Q.   The only other matter about the stewards I would like your
     help on, Mr. Eccleston, is you told us about the line of
     stewards and Police whom you had seen on the previous year
     across the tunnel entrance.   I remind you of the way in which
     you wrote your own statement. The statement we have been very
     helpfully given now, did you in fact write this for yourself?
     Are those your own words? - A. It is.   I wrote it on the
     Tuesday after the event as much to help myself as well as to
     put down the facts and my observations.

Q.   But it is actually your own work rather than somebody else's?
     - A. It is entirely my own work. My secretary typed it up
     the     same day for me, in fact.

Q.   If I may say so, with respect, it just shows lawyers ought to
     leave people to write  their own statements, it is so good. If
     we look at your personal observations, in your own words you
     had said as your third personal observation:

          "When we came through the turnstiles for the 1988 game we
          were met by a line of stewards and Police Officers” .

     You were asked by my learned friend, Mr. Woodward, on my left,
     whether or not what you meant to say was you saw a line of
     stewards with two or three Policemen?   Is that in fact what
     you meant to say when you wrote the words, "a line of stewards
     and Police Officers"? - A. If you were to put me on the line I
     would say there were more stewards than Police Officers.   That
     is as much as I could honestly say.

Q. You have very fairly said you have some difficulty in
   recollecting precisely what the situation was, but you are
   certain, are you, that the tunnel was closed? - A. Absolutely
   certain, because I would have been down that tunnel, because
   that is the nearest approach to getting on to the terracing.

Q. I should make clear, Mr. Eccleston, I am accepting that as
   being both accurate and truthful, of course.  The only
   criticism I have, if "criticism" is not too strong a word is
   that in fact it was substantially Policemen. Almost the
   entire line was Policemen.  But with that difference between
   my friend on my left and myself, can you help the Inquiry as
   to which of us is right, or are you saying it is really just a
                                             F.J. ECCLESTON


matter of impression? - A. It is a matter of impression,
because perhaps the yellow sticks more in my mind.  I could
not really, hand on heart, say there was more of one group
than the other.

I won't press you in that case.   Thank you for your patience
with m e .

Q.   W e r e p e o p l e s a y i n g a n y t h i n g to t h em ?     A.         As we got
     c l o s e r to the w al l p e o p l e w e r e d o i n g two          t h i n g s , I think,
     they w e r e s h o u t i n g o v er t h e i r s h o u l d e r s ,    " D o n ' t p us h

Q.        L O R D J U S T I C E T AY L O R :         They had no r a d i o s ?           A.     They
     had no r ad i o s , and I t h i n k            one of t h e m s a i d that         they    had
     no radio.

     that she w e n t in on e of the t u r n s t i l e s to my r i g ht

Q.   O n c e you w e r e t h r o u g h   the    turnstile,       did      you    see    Police
     Officers?         A.      Yes.

Q.   How   many?        A.      I would        think     about   10 -12        and   t he y   were

     s t a n d i n g ---    They w e r e all on foot and t h ey                    were standing
     ri g h t ov er to     the left, in the c o r n e r , there.                    Somewhere
     there, yes.

Q-          LORD   J U S T I C E TAY L O R :        N e ar   the    exit    gate,      yo u   mean?
     A.     Yes,   r o u n d there.

Q.        MR. G O L D S A C K :      W e r e you able to           tell    their    purpose      in
     being there?          A.      Their purpose?

Q.   Yes.     A.     They     seemed      to be      doing     nothing.

Q.   D id you s p e a k at all to t h e m ?              A.      Yes.       As I got i n to
     the t u r n s t i l e , w h e n the c r o w d s w a y e d to the left an d I
     s u d d e n l y was sort of p u s h e d i nto the t u r n s t i l e and I was

                                          A.J. PEMBERTON


Q. What did you       say? - A. Something like: "You had better
   do something,       somebody is going to be killed out there".

Q. Were you conscious of any of those Police Officers replying
   to you? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you hear what was said? - A. I think it was abuse.

Q. Do you know from which Police Officer it came? - A. No.

Q. Did you then make your way to your seat in the North Stand?
   - A. Yes, I then walked along a sort of gangway. There
   were people urinating against the right-hand side of that
   and a few fiolicemen were telling them to go to the toilets.
   They were younger. Most of the people who walked with me
   were older people and the tickets we had got were £14 tickets
   so they were   not young hooligans in the group I was with
   or in. Many people were saying things about the control
   outside the ground or lack of it.

Q. When you got to the North Stand did you meet up with the
   friend you had lost outside? - A. Yes, two friends.

Q. Did you notice anything about their condition? - A. Well
   they were in the seats and the older one, the one who
   had organised the tickets, who is about 51 years of age
   and has watched Liverpool for years was completely white,
   white faced, and sitting down.

Q. Did he explain why? - A. Yes, he said that he thought he
   was going to be killed outside the ground and that was
   the worst policing he had ever seen watching Liverpool
   anywhere.

Q.      What had your own feelings been when you were trying to
        reach the turnstiles? - A. I got frightened.  I was not
        in fear, I did not feel that I was in fear of death, but
        I was frightened.

Q. Well now if I can just move ahead for the moment, I think
   the following day you were in pain and went to the hospital?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And what in fact had happened to you? - A. Well I was told
   by the doctor in casualty that she suspected I had broken
   two ribs. I had an x-ray.

Q. At what stage had that happened? - A. Well the only thing
   that I had done that could have caused that immediately
   before was getting into the ground.

Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: This is between the perimeter
        gates and the turnstile? - A. Yes, when I was squashed
        I think against the gate of the turnstile.

q   .         MR. GOLDSACK: Now going back to when you were in the
        North Stand, at what stage did you become conscious of any

                          problems on the Leppings Lane terrace? - A. The game was
                          just about to start as I took my seat and it was quite
                          near to the, we were in somewhere like that, so I was
                          looking almost out and slightly towards the right of the
                          Leppings Lane Stand and we did notice people coming over
                          the fence very early.  I don't know what time.

                     Q. In the initial stages could you tell why they were doing
                        that? - A. No.

                     Q. When did you realise that something more serious was afoot?
                        - A. I would think about two minutes or three minutes after
                        the game had stopped.

                     Q. Was there any particular thing that made you realise it was
                        serious? - A. Well as time went on, and it is very hard
                        to be precise about when things actually did happen, but
                        one noticed people just sitting on the ground and lying
                        on the ground.

                                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I think at that stage perhaps
                          it does not matter.

                     Q.         MR. GOLDSACK: What in your view was the response to
                          the situation developing? - A. Well there seemed to be a
                          long time before anybody realised that it was a disaster
                          or a serious difficulty and a long time before anything
                          started to happen to deal with it.

                                MR. GOLDSACK:   Yes, thank you.


                                        Cross-Examined by MR. HYTNER:

                                MR. HYTNER: May I first of all, sir, take this
                          opportunity to correct a misconception in the cross-
                          examination I think that Mr. Woodward or Mr. Glasgow was
                          conducting. Could you look at Photograph DB16 29. The
                          first photograph in the bundle.  It is perfectly plain
                          when you marry that photograph to the plan that the fence
                          that runs just in the middle of the photograph where the
                          Scottish flag is, is the dividing rail between Pens 3 and 4
                          and therefore the gate that is seen up on the left-hand
                          side at the top, just to the right of the man who is
                          standing, is not near the tunnel but is in fact as I thought
                          at the time, the gate between Pens 3 and 2 and it is clear
                          that at that stage, at any rate, that gate was shut.

                                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I think you are right, identi­
                          fication of what it is must be right. How it is is not
                          so clear, perhaps.

                     Q.         MR. HYTNER: Mr. Pemberton, I am not sure you can
                          help on this because you were in the stands. Do you
                          occasionally watch from the terraces as well? - A. Yes.

                     Q. Just standing up? - A. Yes.
                                   A.J. PEMBERTON


What I really want to ask you about is your expectation
and perception of what is capacity in a standing terrace.
If somebody were to say:  "Well Mr. Pemberton seems to be
able to move his hands and seems to be able to move his
neck around therefore there must be more room in that pen",
would that be something that you would slightly resent in
relation to capacity? Is the question rather circuitous,
you look puzzled? - A. Yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Do you expect to be able to
do more than be able to move your neck and your hand? -
A. Yes.

      MR. HYTNER:  If all you could do standing up was
just to move your head around and move your hands, you would
regard the pen as a bit overcrowded, wouldn't you? - A.
Well I watch Sheffield United and we don't have that
difficulty.

      MR. HYTNER:   I will leave it at that.


              Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:

Just to make it quite clear, would you look please at
Photograph DB30 14.46, the second photograph in that
bundle. What word would you use, don't take mine or any­
body else's, what word would you use to describe that pen?
- A. Very full.

May I just ask you to consider the positions of three
groups of Police Officers when you were entering the
ground. First of all I mention them together and then ask
you about them individually. First of all the group near
the perimeter fence; secondly the group two who were near
the turnstiles and thirdly the group of ten who were inside
beyond the turnstiles.

      We have heard already, it is quite clear, that
Leppings Lane has the effect of funnelling people into the
ground. When you passed the perimeter fence would it be
fair to say that you saw a group who seemed to be doing
nothing at all to control the crowds? - A. The ones on the
Police Forces?

I am quoting from your statement which we understand was
one effectively written by you the following morning at
6 o'clock? - A. Yes.

      MR. PHILLIPS: Sir, we now have copies of the letter
which were sent in to you. They are being distributed
now along the bench of representatives.

      MR. JACKSON: Do I take it that the trauma of the
events caused you to put pen to paper at such an unusual
time? - A. Well I could not sleep and by the end of the
                                   A.J. PEMBERTON


television on Saturday I thought people were saying all
sorts of wild things and I wanted to make sure I got it
down.

You wanted to get it down straightaway? - A. I felt better
for doing that.

And if I can quote from your letter, talking about the
gates:

      "As far as I can recall there were a number
      of Policemen outside the big blue gates, some
      of whom were on horseback. They seemed to
      be doing nothing at all to control the crowds".

Is that your recollection of the Police Officers outside the
ground? - A. It is, but the crowd, apart from its numbers
there was nothing wrong with the crowd.  It was not any
sort of threat. From the back anyway it did not look any
sort of difficulty.

Your very next line is:

      "I saw no ill-humour or drunkenness of any sort
      outside the ground".

A. That is right.

Therefore applying their criminal detection talents you
would not expect the Police to be doing anything. What
about the forming of orderly queues, for instance. Was
there any attempt to do that, as you saw it? - A. There
wasn't, but again to be fair on many occasions outside
football grounds the same sort of situation does arise.

But when we go down to the gates themselves there were two
Officers, one of whom was terrified according to you? - A.
Both of them looked very frightened.

And one indeed attempted to climb a wall to give a signal?
- A. That is what he appeared to do.

Can you tell us how many feet   were his ten colleagues inside
the ground away from him when   he was trying to climb the
wall? - A. Well I think I was   at the last of the 'A* gates.
I would guess that must be 30   or 40'.

So about 30-40' away were ten of his colleagues who were
apparently doing nothing? - A. Well they were doing nothing
when I got through the turnstile.

Indeed. May I change subjects entirely and ask about your
travelling time. You are from Sheffield and you know the
area? - A. Yes.
You left home at quarter-to-2 and arrived in the ground at
minutes before 3 o'clock? - A. At ray seat about one minute
before 3 o'clock.
                                  A.J. PEMBERTON


That involved about a two mile walk? - A. Yes.


             Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Mr. Pemberton, may I ask you about the crowd and the time
that you got to Leppings Lane gates. Do you follow? - A.
Yes.

The time that you arrived to be going up to that perimeter
fence would be when? - A. I would think between 25-to-3
and 20-to-3.

Now at that point are you intending to describe seeing
a considerable quantity of people making their way in to
go to the turnstiles.  I am talking about the back, the
perimeter, the fringe as you approached it of people? -
A. At that time I saw many people standing waiting to go
through the turnstiles, yes.

Now you said I think in answer to Mr. Jackson that at that
point as you approached the perimeter fence, we understand
it, the same sort of situation that occurs at other football
matches there presented itself.  Is that right? - A. Yes.




                           /Q. And although there
                                         A.J. PEMBERTON



And although there were numbers of people there at the
perimeter, at the edge, they were not presenting any
difficulty.   I think those were your words, and they didn't
appear to be a threat to anyone, is that right? - A.
Well I can't say "anyone".   They didn't appear to be a
threat to me.

Didn't appear to you, and that is all you can say.    So you,
like they, continued on. - A. Yes.

And you joined the crowd of people inside. Now you say
there were Police on the perimeter there, on the periphery.
~ A . Y es •

Your impression at that moment and at that position was of
a normal football crowd going in towards the gates was it?
I am talicing about periphery, I'm not asking you about what
was beyond, do you see? - A. I think there were more
people than one would normally see, I would normally see,
but there was nothing exceptional about it. In fact it was
a jolly scene and it was nice to see the Police being
relaxed and the crowd being relaxed and happy and I would
have raised no complaint if anybody had asked me about my
views at that time.

No complaints?   - A. No.

And really no concern?      -   A. No.

Ordinarily at a football match when this situation occurs,
you are approaching the turnstiles, what happens? Do
people go naturally towards the entrances and line
themselves up in not formal fashion but in a reasonable
way? - A. I can only really speak about Bramall Lane.
That is the only ground I go to regularly, and I think one
of the differences there is that the turnstiles are further
apart. You don't get this great congestion of turnstiles
all very close together.

Was this the first time you had been into the Leppings Lane
entrance? - A. No.

But something that strikes you about it is the proximity of
the one turnstile gate to the next?     A. I think a lot of
turnstiles close together generate a big crowd outside.

But ordinarily do people just proceed and naturally line
themselves up or do they have to be shepherded and herded
into lines? - A. I think, it is a very different shape to
most places I have ever been to, that funnel there.  I
don't quite know how you would do it though, but I think it
would have been helpful, and indeed in other places that
I've been to, people have been required to get into queues.

What, by the Officer saying ....    -   A. Yes.

Of course by the time you got there the situation was that
there were no queues....  - A. That is right.

.... in the immediate   proximity of the turnstiles, but you
say you got to within   about four or five feet of the turn­
stiles when something   happened, is that right? - A. The
crowd got tighter and   tighter as we got nearer.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think that is why you noticed
that the two Police Officers, I think that was your
evidence.

     MR. WOODWARD:   A note that I made was that you seemed
to be saying there was no problem until about four or five
feet from the wall.  - A. Yes, I think people didn't get
fearful, people weren't starting to complain until quite
close to the turnstile walls.

So would that be right, that there was really no problem
until four or five feet from the wall? Is that your
impression, and then it got very difficult.  - A. Well the
crowd was a problem, the weight of the crowd was a problem,
but it manifested itself on those who were nearest to the
turnstile wall, or touching it.

Are you able to help us as to what time it would now be by
the turnstiles?     A. I would think it was between quarter
to and ten to when I was close to the turnstile wall.

During the time that you were outside the turnstiles,
whether close to them or by the perimeter fence, did you
hear anything come over the tannoy, over the public address
system? - A. No.

That is the tannoy that is fixed because there are speakers
at various positions.  You didn't hear anything? - * A. I
didn't hear anything at all.

And certainly if anything was requested of the crowd you
didn't notice any change in its behaviour, any holding back
or slackening of pressure? - A. No.

Are you able to say with certainty what time it was that
you came through the turnstile? - A. I would think it
must have been about just after five to.

Did you hear round about that time, or just before it, or
at any stage whilst you were approaching the turnstile,
anything from a public address from a landrover, a Police
vehicle? - A. Mo.

                                             A.J. PEMBERTON



Q.    An Officer pleading, and the plea being repeated many
     times, for people to hold, to coroe back, to pull off
     because of the crush. You didn't hear anything? - A.     No.

Q. Was it very very noisy? - A. Well the noise changed as
   you got near to the turnstile wall. People were starting
   to complain and to complain to those behind them not to
   push and to complain to the Police Officers in front to do
   something.

Q. Did those complaints, requests, to people behind not to
   push seem to have any effect? - A. No.

Q. Did you notice that from time to time turnstiles did seem
   to process people more slowly than at others? - A. No, it
   just seemed to be a long time, almost stationary.

Q. And you did notice a Policeman, there was a Policeman and a
   Policewoman, they were standing by the turnstile entrances
   having no effect on the people? - A. No.    I think they
   were - I don't remember them ever shouting any instructions
   to anybody to do anything.  I think they were like we were,
   very frightened.

Q. It was very frightening?    -   A. Yes.

Q. The Officer you say was climbing up. He appeared to be
   trying to get height to communicate something did he?
   A. Yes.

Q. To get over the heads of the crowd so he could signal to
   someone remote from him? - A. Yes, he may have known of
   the Police Officers inside or he may have been able to
   signal back to the Police ....

Q. Did you see the Police horses doing anything at any time?
   Making a line across the gates or moving through the crowd
   to try and break it apart? - A. No. When we got there
   the Police horses I think were standing in a group and I
   didn't see them move, but in fact I think to be very fair
   they couldn't have dealt with the crowd from the back very
   easily.  I think it would have made it worse at the front.

Q. You had to come through it from the side probably, you
   couldn't get to those to help those at the front by coming
   in from the back? - A. That is right.

Q. Except by perhaps giving those at the front respite by
   getting those people at the back to pull away.  - A. Yes.

Q. To give a break.    You didn't see any attempt at that?
   A. No.

Q. Did you see other Policemen in the crowd of people apart
   from the two you have described? - A. No I didn't see
   anybody moving about in the crowd.

Q. Can I ask you about whan you got in. You say you made an
   observation to a Police Officer. - A. Yes.

Q. In the statement thatyou made you said he shouted
   something back to you but you are not sure whathe said.
   Is that right? - A.     Yes.

          MR. HYTNER:   Sir there is one question I forgot to
     put, may I put it now?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Please.

                Further cross-examined by MR. HYTNER:

Q.   It was fairly obvious toyou from somethingthat happened
     after the incident that the electronic scoreboard is
     capable of passing massages as well as half-time scores.
     A."Yes.

Q. Were any messages that you saw flashed on the electronic
   scoreboard relating to crowd control or anything of that
   sort? - A. No there weren't.     In fact one of the things
   that annoyed the people who were round me very greatly, and
   distressed them, was that when people were obviously
   injured and indeed dead the electronic scoreboard continued
   to show advertisements, I think for cars and timber, and it
   never at any stage when I was there gave any indication of
   what had happened orwhat people should do,    and I think it
   could have been used for that purpose.

Q.   I am not suggesting, let me make it clear, that the
     electronic scoreboard should have been used to actually
     announce deaths oc that thera had been a -disaster, but
     really in relation to crowd control it was never used for
     the purposes of crowd control.   - A. Not only that but I
     think the tannoy was also inadequately used.

Q. Did you hear any tannoy messages in the ground? - A. Yes
   I heard two, one of which was I think something like,
   "Would those spectators on the pitch please go to the
   perimeter" and the other message was I think a message
   which was later which said, "Would those spectators in the
   Leppings Lane terrace please leave the terrace".

Q . Any tannoy messages before the disaster occurred that you
    heard? - A. No, none at all.

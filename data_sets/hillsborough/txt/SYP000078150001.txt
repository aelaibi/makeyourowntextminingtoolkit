              I am a Police Constable               in the South Yorkshire Police stationed in the

              Prosecutions Office at Police Headqu art er s, Castle Green Annexe,                       At

              9.45 am        (0945) Saturday 15 April           1989 (150489)     I commenced duty at

              the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground for the semi final football

              match between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.                       After br ief i ng in the

              N Stand at the ground I tyjok up patrol duty in a/transit van together

              with other Police Officers.               POL PS1075 HQLBROffK was in command and

              our serial was No. 5 0 /that d a y .              We were ass/gned to patro1 the N

              side of ground in the area of Halifax Rd / p X rson Cross,                    giving.

              attention to public order and licensed premises.                       We patrolled the

              area as directed and prior to the arrival                     of the train carrying

              Liverpool        fans to Wadsley Bridge railway station,                took up an

              observations           position directly above the T ravellers            Inn, Halifax Rd.
Whilst the transit was parked in the observations         position on Halifax

Rd I saw that football fans were walking towards the direction of the

football    ground in an orderly manner.      I saw several    carrying cans of

beer or lager a n d in some cases      drinking from them,     but I did not see

any obvious signs    of drukeness.      The football fans that passed me,           I

believe were from    Liverpool and     their numbers gradually increased

towards the hour of 3.00 pm (1500).         I noticed that the numbers of

coaches    carrying fans also   increased in a similar manner,      several

coach drivers of whom I saw stop to speak to foot patrol officers                  in

Halifax Rd.     In the main these coaches were moved along towards the

allotted parking area still      carrying their passengers.       However,        some

passengers were seen to alight        in Halifax Rd between our position and

Claywheels Ln before Officers moved the driver of the coach along.

At about 3.00 pm (1500)      this same date radio communications          received

from ground control     indicated that a serious     public order situation

was arising at the Leppings Ln end of the ground.          Together with

other officers in serial 50 we moved in our transit from Halifax Rd

to Lepping Ln in anticipation of being required at that lc                  on.

However,   on arrival   there I saw numerous other officers present and

ambulances arriving.     To avoid congestion ou                the Police

Transit    resumed from Leppings Ln back to Hal               .ravelling there

via Hillsborough and Penistone Rd.        Our Poli            it became

stationary in heavy traffic      in Halifax Rd on the into City lane below

the railway bridge.      Ambulance,   Fire and Police vehicles travelling

towards the ground were having difficulty getting through because of

the traffic    congestion.    By this time I realised from radio traffic

that the situation at the ground was very serious and steps should be

taken to make a clear passage for emergency vehicles.            With

approval    of the serial sergeant I left the transit and comme

direct traffic on the Halifax Rd away from the ground.            Police

THE GROUND." >On arrival at the ground in Penistoire Rd outside the

main entrance I alighted from the transit with/the other members of

the serial.      I saw that ambulances were entj^ring and leaving this

entrance and assistances was required.            Initially I commenced to help

in directing the am              ; entering and leaving the main ground

entrance,    but withi           is was directed by an Ir                to report

to Superintendent B                 the gymnasium behind t!'            Stnad.     I

did so immediately                  instructed by that Off:             -ake up

position and remain there at the door to the g y m m                     'eventing

unauthorised access.

My position was at the door on the inside of the gymnasium

which at this time was being used to bring casualties from the ground.

At this time in addition to casualties the gymnasium contained Police

Officers from PC to high rank,          doctors, ambulance     crew,   first aid

workers,    special   constable etc.       Initially the gymnasium appeared to

be a casualty area but I was later informed that there were no

casualties alive and that the gymnasium was to be considered a

mortuary with Police access only, and only officers required in the

gymnasium to be a         ted.      This direction came to me from Chief

Super i ntendent AD   who appeared to have takff'ft command inside the
                                                00
gymnasium together frfith Chief Supe r i ntendep/t MOLE. I carried out

this duty as required but found it also necessary to admit ambulance

personnel    returning bodies on stretchers from the hospitals and Police

employed civilian drivers carrying equipment and refreshments etc as

required at the gymnasium mortuary.            The position at the mortuary

gymnasium door was       constant coming and going of bodies and personnel
                                                                                PAGE

          and of all types of enquiry.    This feverish activity continued late

          into the everting and early hours.     I remained at this point with the

          exception of using the telephone inside the gym until going off duty

          at 5.30 am (Q53Q) Sunday,   16 April   1989 (160489),   following the last

          of the bodies being removed from the mortuary.

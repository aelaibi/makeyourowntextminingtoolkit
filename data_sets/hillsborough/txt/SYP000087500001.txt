           On Saturday 15 April         1989 150489             on        at West

           Having completed my tasks during the morning of that day,                      I took my

           meal and was sitting in the Community Liaison Office at West Bar.                          I

           was watching the television programme which was reporting the

           activities at the Hi 1 lsborough Football Ground shortly after the kick

           off of the match.        It became apparent to me that there was a problem

           with the crowd that could build up into a serious situation.                       The

           staff at the Community Liaison Department at D Bivision are

           res pons i ble for manning the Police Room at tpe Hal lamshi re Hospital                       in

           the event of a major         incident.     I conseqjie^Ttly informed Sergeant
                                                                          PAGE      2
                                                                          S3176

THOMAS, Police Constables                f STANIFORTH A n d ATKINSON that we

would be leaving    immediately to staff the/Casualty Bureau.          I informed

the Control Room at West Bar of my concerns and that we were going to

the hospital forthwith.

We attended at the hospital        taking with us the Casualty Bureau box

containing the necessary documentation.

On arrival at the hospital we commenced to ’set u p ’ the Bureau.              I

located the senior member of medical staff at the hospital and advised

him that he should prepare for the possibility of a large number of

casualties and he agreed to make the necessary arr angem en ts .

I cannot be specific about the time that the first casualty arrived at

the hospital but we had sufficient time to organise the Bureau,            fixing

up the room,   telephones,     documentation etc.     There was then a steady

flow of casualties arriving at the Hospital          ranging from minor to

critically injured people.         One body only came to the Hal lamshi re

Hospital and this was placed in the temporary mo rt u a r y .      The body

could not be identified and was eventually transferred to the

temporary mortuary at Hi 1lsborough accompanied by a Poli ce S e r g e a n t .

The detaiIs of a l 1 the casualties arriving at the Hospital were

obtained by members of my staff on the attached forms.            They were then

passed by telephone to the incident room at Ecclesfield,           this was a

very laborious and t ime consuming task whi ch was only relieved when

eventually some considerable time later, a Fax machine was brought to

the Hospital   by Inspector W O O D H E A D .

In addi t ion to documenting the detaiIs of casual ties and pass i ng them

to Ecclesfield,    we had the ongoing responsibility of checking on the

condition of casualties admitted to the Hospital and establishing who

had been di s charged.     The re were constant enqui r ies from relatives at

the Hospital about missing        people and from the Social Work team at the

Hospital who were collating lists of people who were not accounted for.
                                                                                 PAGE    3
                                                                                 S3176

             The operation at the Hallamshi re Hospital    ran as smoothly as could be

             expected considering the number of casualties,      relatives and members

             of the media present.      The only real problem was one of communication

             with the Ecclesfield Incident Room as many times and for long periods

             it was     impossible to contact them by phone.   This would have been a

             more serious problem had the Fax machine not been available.

                                                                       H YOUNG SIGNED

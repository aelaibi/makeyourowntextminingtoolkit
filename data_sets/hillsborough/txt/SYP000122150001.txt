           At 9.00 am         (090Q)     S at u r d a y    15 April      1989    (150489)      I commenced duty at

           H a m m e r t o n Rd Police Station.               At 9.30 am         (0930)   the same       day      I

            duties    s upervising         tunstiles               23 to 26 y ith other officers.                     The

           N o t t i n g h a m Forest    suppor              who    had been a l l o c a t e d   tickets       for this

            stand began to arrive               early and there was a steady flow through the

            turns t i l e s   from about        11.00 am          (1100).       This   increased steadily up

            until    3.00     pm (1300)       with the major i t y of Notts Forest                    fans     coming

            through these          particular         turnstiles         being    orde r l y and well        behaved.

            I saw nothing          of the     inside        of the ground until           after 3.00         pm       (1500)

            as   I was    behind these          turnstiles all            of this      time.

           At just %fter 3.00 pm                (1500)       I went      through the      rear of the south

            s tand with Sergeant TURNEpgk^ We were                        to go to the gy m n asium            to meal

            at this      time.     We w a l k e d down the           players      tunne l y S n d turned       right

along    the south s t a n d .            At    this time      I saw the game was             in progress

•and the ground a p p e a r e d to be full                 to capacity.           As    I looked towards

t-he West S t a n d I saw that the                  peo pi e on the ter races below were

s urging      forward to the f e n c e s .             In the middle          section CN & CS

p articular       behind the goal mouth                 people were          pressed to the fences

an d   climbing        over    the top,          I could see supporters                c l i m b i n g from the

terraces         into the stand above.                 I could see offi cers             trying      to

contain s u p p o r t e r s who were             on the     perimeter        track and side          lines and

mo re officers moving               .into this a rea to try and                contain supporters

from    over spilling           onto      the    pitch.    I carried on walking a r o u n d the

perimeter        track and across               the front      of the S p i o n Kop which a p p e a r e d

full    to    capacity w ith Notts Forest Supporters.

U po n arrival         at the g y m n a s i u m we were         i mmediately d i r ected back to

the .pitch.          As   I went     back       onto the     MTimeter         track     I saw that         the

game had been stopped and t h a t verpoo 1 supporters                                   had converged

a r o u n d the go^l mouth at^J /n e              West S t a n d s i d e .     I was directed to form

part    of a corddKfi in^J^ont                 of the S p i o n H o p a s Notts Forest             supporters

were    beginning         to get a g g r i v a t e d about        the game       being s u s p e n d e d and

were    surging        towards      the    fences.        At this      time    I saw a L i v e r p o o l

s u p p o r t e r run from the Liverpool                crowd on the          p i t c h y & t 'r oss the

halfway       1 ine and       into the Notts Forest               end.       H^was      shouting and

g oading      the Notts Forest             fans and gesturiCy*yg two f i n gered signs at

them.        1 was     instructed         by a S e n i o r / ^ f i c e r    to get him off the

pitch,        I a p p r o a c h him as            &QyjyuDLE¥ came up behind him and

d e t a i n e d him.      The man was abmit 30 years                   of age and wearing             a red

and white         shirt.       He   carried on shouting and swearing                        and was

obviously         drunk a s / h e / s m e l t     very strongly            of drink.

PC G Q D L E Y    took him from the               pitch arid I      was      joined by Sgt TURNER as

looked across the              pitch I saw that more Liverpool                      supporters were on

some    of   them had been                injured and               i m m e d i a t e l y went      to assist™             I went

to a young man of about                       15 years          old who was              lying      on his        back

clothes and saw a young                       girl       in a St Johns                Ambulance        uniform.            I

asked     her    to get a s t r e t c h e r              to move        the       boy.       She    never       returned            but

a man also         in a St J ohns              Uniform approached                       w ith a stretcher.                 Sgt

the    boy across          the     pitch to the side                    of the          g y m n a s i u m were     other

injured      people were             being         trea t e d by medics.

We went      d i r ectly      back w i t h          the       s t r etcher        and    saw that          there were           more

injured      in the        same area.              ,We found a n o t h e r              ma n who was          semi

gymnasiurn               e there was at              least          twenty        people       laid on the

stretcher        to go back           to the         pitch.            I overheard             conversations              at    this

time    claiming        people        had died            in the        crowd         it was       only at        this     time

that    I realised          the      severity            of    the     incident.             As    I r e t urned      to the

pitch for a third time                       I saw that             it was        cove r e d wit h         supporters           and

Police.         Hoa r d i n g s    around          the    pitch were              being       ripped up by s u p p o r t e r s

who were        carrying          them       to s t r etcher           the    injured          from the         pitch.          I

returned        to the      same a r e a with                 the    str e t c h e r     where      I saw a m a n          on the

floor     being      given        heart m a s s a g e and m o u t h                to mouth.

He was about           35 years           of age wear i n g a red an d white                           shirt an d          of

heavy build.            His       face was          blue and his              eyes       open.

He had vomit           on his        face and his               teeth were              smashed.           He a p p e a r e d

dead an d did not             respond          to    reviving.               We    placed him on the                 stretcher

and    covered       his    face.            As we       crossed the              pitch       I saw bodies           at    ti>er""

anot h e r    dozen bodies             inside.           A CID officer              called DC L P C I ^ N G          from

.Hammerton R d told one                    of us to        stay wit h the               body.     This was          done    by

an officer          who    had a s s i s t e d us,            myself       and Sgt TU R N E R       then went             back

to the       pitch.

This    time at the West S t a n d                   side      there       were     no more       injured       or    dead

on the       pitch.        I heard a Liverpool                      fan s h o uting         "you bastards,            you

towards       the    south stand.                  I saw an officer               I know from West              Bar

P o l i c e Station.            He    st a t e d    how he had been               pulling       supports        fro m the

terraces.           He said          that     one man he had               pulled        out was    dead and          that

as he tried to revive                      him L i verpool           fans     shouted,          'Murderer,          you

until     he was a s s i s t e d           by m e m b e r s    of his       serial.

I was     directed         to form          part     of a cordon acr o s s                tj>e centre      line which

I did w ith other               officers,          two     of w hom w e t^ e ^ e rfi rny original              serial       and

we thought          it best          to stay       together at             this    time.        W hile    in this

cordon a n d facing              the Liv e r p o o l          fans    several           came up to us o b v i o u s l y

in shock and very                upset,          looking       for fa m i l y and friends                who    they had

lost    in the       confusion.

T hen   there were             other       fans who        seemed         completely unconcerned                    for    the

dead and       injured.              Some     asking          why    the    game        couldn't    continue,

o thers asking w hen                 the    replay w ould            be.      I was       told all       the    gates       had

been opened and                people a s k e d       to      leave       the S t a d i u m but     for about

f i f t e e n minu t e s    the       crowds        d i d n ’t seem        to disipate.            After a bout

orde r l y and better              behaved          causing      no       problems            at all     from the

stand.         I was      originally           in on t u rnstile                  duty    there were           no    problems

at all       and all        the    fans       se e m e d well         b e h a v e d and a r r i v e d         early.            I

did      not     have a radio            but       from what          I was        told       by the S e r g e a n t s       a       lo

of Li v e r p o o l     fans were           arriving        1a t e and were               not     in the       gr o u n d       for

the start            of the      game.        As    I   wa l k e d     from       the     players       tunnel at           the

start        of the game          I saw that            the m a j o r i t y         of Liv e r p o o l     fans on          the

te r races       had    c o n verged        on the       centre         terraces          behind the           goal        mouth

with     spaces        apparent         on the wings            of these             terrace.          This      was

not i c a b l e as      the      rest    of the         ground was           full        to    capacity.

One    further         observation            I would       like        to make          is that       conc e r n i n g      the

general        public: a fter           the    event.         Although             it ma y be         irrelevant            to

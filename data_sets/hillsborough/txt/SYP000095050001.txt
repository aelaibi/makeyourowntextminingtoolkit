                 This note is r e g a rdin g the o p ini on of Lord Justic e Tayl or on the
                 p o s s i b i l i t y of m a n s l a u g h t e r charges against Chief Superin ten den t
                 Duckenfield.

                 On the a f t e r n o o n of W e d n e s d a y 24 May 1989, Chief Superin ten den t
                 D u c k e n f i e l d b e g a n to give evidence to the T a y l o r Inquiry. The questions
                 from Mr Colli ns QC were, in the main, innocuous.

                 On the m o r n i n g of T h u r s d a y 25 May, Mr D u c k e n f i e l d retur ned to the
                 w i t ness box.     The line of q ues ti o n i n g from Mr Collin s became more
                 pointed and aggressive.               Mr Duckenfield, ado ptin g an ope n and helpful
                 attitude, did his best to answer ea ch of the questions.                         It was obvious
                 at this stage, however, that he was e m b a r r a s s e d by c e r tain questions
                 (eg, he p e r c e i v e d a p r o b l e m w i t h packing on terraces but did not d e p loy
                 police o f f ic ers to deal with it - pages 14/16 of transcript day eight).

                Mr D u c k e n f i e l d had p r e v i o u s l y taken co nfi d e n t i a l and p e r s ona l advice
                from Peter M e tca lf of H a m m o n d Suddards, Solicitors.                    I w a s not aware of
                what that advice was.                I was c o n c er ned in case Mr D u c k e n f i e l d might
                i n c rim inat e himself withou t legal advice.

                It was n orm al p r a c t i c e , t h r o u g h o u t the Inquiry, for me to take lunch wi th
                counsel and solicitors at the offices rente d by H a m mon d Suddards on
                Campo Lane.


                Over lunch on T h u r s d a y 25 M a y ( 1989, I raised the q u e s t i o n of
                Mr D u c k e n f i e l d ' s p o s i t i o n in respect of c r i m ina l lia bili ty and h ow
                giving evide nce to the Inquiry might affect su ch liability.

                In p a r t i c u l a r , I s p e c i f i c a l l y r a i s e d the p o s s i b i l i t y of m a n s l a u g h t e r
                charges against Mr Duckenfield.                           The response of Mr W o o d w a r d QC
                s ug gested that he had not c o n t e m p l a t e d such a p o s s i b i l i t y (this was
                before the Zeebru-gge charges were laid - a l t h o u g h I was aware of the
                Kent C o n s t a b u l a r y i n v e s t i g a t i o n ) .

                He asked Mr Limb, his junior, to advise.                   Mr Limb d i s c u s s e d the nice
                d i s t i n c t i o n b e tw een 'negligence' and 'gross negligence' (as a spectrum
                w h i c h r anged from m a k i n g an error of p r o f e s s i o n a l judgment to 'sailing
                out of port w i t h the b o w doors open as a m a t t e r of policy').                 Mr Limb's
                argument was convincing.               However, Mr W o o d w a r d p romised to raise the
                same q u e s t i o n w i t h Lord Justice Taylor.

                Mr D u c k e n f i e l d c o n t i n u e d to give evidence for three days.              The questions
                and answers were i n c r e a s i n g l y in cri m i n a t i n g (see p a r t i c u l a r l y pages
                90/93 of t ran scri pt day eight).

                During one lunch -tim e the f oll owing week, Mr W o o d w a r d told me that the
                po s s i b i l i t y of Mr D u c k e n f i e l d 's crimin al l i a b ili ty had been raised w ith
                Lord Justice Taylor, t h r o u g h A n d r e w Collins QC.                 The m e ss age w h i c h had
Gen/2
                                             -   2   -




come b a c k to Mr W o o d w a r d - (he att rib u t e d the words to Lord Justice Taylor)      -
was that "the p o s s i b i l i t y was so u n r eal isti c that it did not dese rve
consideration".

I did not tell Mr D u c k e n f i e l d of m y concern, nor of the dis cus s i o n s w h i c h had
taken place on this subject, u nti l after the p u b l i c a t i o n of the Interi m Report
- w h i c h c o i n ci ded w i t h Mr D u c k e n f i e l d 1s sus pens ion fro m duty.

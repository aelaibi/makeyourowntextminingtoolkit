     Por the attention of Mr. G« Mackrell

M    Dear Mr. Mackrell,
;^                        Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
\t                              Barrier Testing 1988
1         Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, £he fourth
| " part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.

  ■%The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
   I 128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
     the lower area of terrace at the Loppings Lane end of the ground.
     The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
     1610/64E, a print of which Is enclosed.
          The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
     procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
     Grounds*•
           In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
     withstood the applied load. A clip over the rail of barrier 124
     broke before reaching the full test load.
           Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
     that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
     tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those tested on the
     Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
     load.
                                                             2




     The rail on barrier 133 is    badly corroded and should be
replaced now. There was also a     lot of movement of the rail on
barrier 144# when tested, and we   also recommend that that rail
is also replaced.
     As agreed we have arranged    for the clip on barrier 124 to
be replaced together with rails    on barriers 133 and 144, before
the start of the coming season.
     Enclosed are single copies    of our record sheets showing the
results of the barrier tests.



                              Your8 sincerely,

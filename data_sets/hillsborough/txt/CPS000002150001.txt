        process.

        There can be no justification for the postponement o f the disclosure o f this critical material on
        the grounds that one party might be granted leave to quash the decision not to take over
        proceedings which are pending in a lower court.

        The magistrate has confirmed that the committal proceedings will begin on I9,h April.

         1 look forward to an early reply.


         Yours sincerely

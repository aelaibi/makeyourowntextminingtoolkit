    Thank you for your letter of 17 April to the Prime Minister,
  which you kindly offer help into the investigation of the
tragedy at Hillsborough.    I have been asked to reply.


    As you may know, an enquiry under the Chairmanship of Lord
Justice Taylor has been formed to investigate the events of
Hillsborough and to make recommendations.    I have therefore
forwarded your letter to Mr R Whalley, Secretary to the enquiry,
who can be contacted at this address.




                                        MISS C J BANNISTER

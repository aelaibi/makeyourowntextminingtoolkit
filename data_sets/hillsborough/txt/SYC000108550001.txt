      Garda Security? - A. Yes.
Q. You have been employed by the company and you have
   worked at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club for I
   think in 19S9 about thr©e~and~a*-hiilf years, something
   of that order? - A. I worked on about four or five
   occasions at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.
Q. Over a period? - A. When I was requested on certain
   match days because I am subcontract with Garda
   Security and I did a lot of other sites as well.

Q. On the 15th April 1989 you were there, that is right,
   is it not? - A. Yes.
Q. Can you remember whether you were there the previous

                                                       C. L. GILLAM


Q. You have got a map in front of there, have you not? -
   A. Yes.
Q. Can you see the perimeter iron gates on the plan? Do
   you prefer to have a picture rather than a plan? Can
   you make it out from the plan? - A. I can just about
   make it about.

Q. Is it abit small for you? - A.     It is    a bit small.
Q. Canyou see it on the screen? -     A. Yes.
Q. Walk to the screen? - A. That is right.

Q. Are      those the gates you were at? -A.Yes.
Q. Youcan see there a semi-circle     or at    least an arc.
   Can you see that? - A . Yes.

Q. They seem to be divided by a fence.        Can you just
   point to that fence? - A. Yes.

Q. Show the gentleman where the River Don is.        Okay? -
   A . Yes.

Q. Which gates were you positioned at? * A. There

Q. You were positioned across the perimeter gates which
   protect or guard or whatever you want to call it,
   Turnstiles A to G, is that right? - A. Yes.
Q. I think there are three gates there, is that right? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Of different sizes? - A. That is right.

Q. Come back because it iseasier to hear you from here.

Q. Your job basicallywas to stop vehicles driving
   through those gates or unauthorised vehicles driving
   down, is that right? - A. Yes, unauthorised vehicles.
Q»    So your task was to open and shut gates as
     appropriate for the vehicles? - A. That is right,
     yes.

Q.    It depended on the size of the vehicle which gate you
     wanted to open and I do not think we need go into
     that detail. That is right, is it not, because some
     were wider than others? - A. Yes, the middle gates
                                                               3

       where I was were for traffic. The other gates on
       either side were for pedestrians mainly.
B   Q - Put UP C.258. If you    flick through that album in
        front of you and find   it. Perhaps Mr. Griffiths will
        do it for you. There    you can see three gates, is
        that right? - A. Yes,   that is right.

    Q. You were positioned at the centre one, is that
       correct? - A. Yes, that is right.

    Q. You arrived at about eight o'clock as you have told
       us and you took up your position. Initially
       presumably there was no one there or very few people,
       is that right? - A. There were an odd few Liverpool
       supporters there at that time.
    Q. At that time? - A. Yes.

    Q. But no problems? - A. No, no.
D   Q. What time did you begin to notice there were more
       people coming down approximately? It does not have
       to be spot on? - A- It was well into the morning,
       near lunchtime.

    Q. By that time was there a Police presence already in
       that area? - A. Yes.

    Q- Was it foot or mounted Officers or both? - A. Both.
    Q. What time did you put the presence of mounted
       Officers, around lunchtime or later? - A. Oh no,
       early.

    Q = They were quite early so far as you were concerned? -
        A. Yes.

    Q* Did you see people congregating on the little bridge
       which goes across the River Don? - A. Yes, but it was
       rather later in the morning.

    Q. What time would you say it was approximately? - A.
       Lunchtime.

    Q. Were these youngsters? - A. Yes.

    Q. Were they well behaved as far as you could tell? - A.
       Yes.

                                                 C. L. GILLAM


Q. Did any Police action take place at that time in
   relation to those youngsters that you saw? - A. Yes,
   the youngsters weren't going into the ground- They
   were hangingr around where I was mainly, just sort of
   being in the way of other supporters coming in and so
   the mounted Police asked them if they had got
   tickets..

Q . Did they gain any response? Did they get any
    replies? - A. They seemed to nod their heads to say
    they had not got tickets.
Q. You mean they went like this (demonstrating)? - A.
   Yes.
Q. So they shook their heads as if to say no, is that
   right? - A. Yes.
Q« What did the mounted Officers   then say ordo? - A. He
   says, "Go back out of the ground. If you haven't got
   tickets get out".
Q. Again I am not pinning you to    any specific number but
   this was around noon time, is that right, or watr it ®
   bit later? - A. Eleven o'clock.
Q. How many were there at that time would you say?— A.
   Youngsters without tickets, about twenty to thirty.
Q. When you say they were youngsters without tickets,
   they were youngsters you assumed had no tickets
   because of their demeanour? - A. I assumed that.

Q. You did not personally enquire? - A. Yes, because
   they weren't going into the ground.

Q. Are you a football supporter as a matter of interest?
   - A. Not really.

Q. Have you been to big football matches before on duty?
   - A. Only Sheffield Wednesday.

Q." What was the biggest match you have been to? - A. It
    would be that one.
Q. The biggest after that if you can recollect? - A. No,
   but nowhere near as big as that.
Q. When did the crowd begin to build up? - A. After
   lunchtime. It was rather - two o'clock time I would
   say.

                                                   C- L. GILLAM



Q. Had you been surprised there had not been a greater
   influx before that time? - A. Yes, it did surprise me
   that day.
Q. Why was that? You did not have any particular
   experience of football matches and so why were you
   surprised? - A. The other football matches I had been
   to, although not important matches, supporters came
   on, a bigger influx of supporters came on in the
   morning time. That particular match that day it was
   very quiet in the morning.
Q. Presumably the people who were coming up to about two
   o'clock - we will take that as the cut off point for
   the moment - to get to the turnstiles they had to go
   through the gates? ~ A. Yes.
Q. Did you open and shut them or were you really just
   there to hold up your hand when a car came? - A. No,
   the gates were all open. I did not open the outer
   two gates. I just opened the middle gates. Now a
   steward opened the other gates and left them open.
   The gates where I was I had one gate open and I
   controlled the traffic restriction by the ©tl»r gate.
   If I leave the gates open then people with ears drive
   straight through, whether I am there or not, and so I
   used to push the other gate forward so that a car
   could not come through.
Q. In other words, the gates were in two halves? - A-
   Yes.
Q . You had one half open and the other half you
    controlled? - A. Yes.
Q. So that pedestrians could get through but it was too
   narrow for a car? - A. That is right.
Q. Unless you allowed them through? ~ A. Yes, and so the
   gates were open.
Q. Until about a quarter to two or two o'clock the
   turnstiles appeared to be operating perfectly
   satisfactorily? - A. Yes.
 Q. You mentioned a steward opening these gates? - A.
    Yes.
 Q. Can I just take you back to that for one second? - A.
    Yes.
                                                       C. L. GILLAM


Q. Can you recollect what time he opened the gates? - A.
   It was.early in the morning.

Q. When you say   early do you mean eight,      nine,ten,
   eleven? - A.   I am not sure of the time.    I just guess
   ten o'clock.
Q. That sort of   order? - A. Yes.

Q. Did he stay or did he    go? - A. No, he     went.
Q. Was he wearing a yellow jacket? - A. Yes.

Q. You were wearing what colour uniform? - A. A light
   blue uniform.

Q. Bright blue? - A. Light blue.
Q. Nothing yellow on you? - A. No.

Q. Then at two o'clock onwards what did you then
   observe? Just tell me in your own words what you
   noticed? - A. A tremendous influx of people coming
   on. So many people were coming that the turnstiles
   became jammed with the weight of the people and one
   of the mounted Police Officers guided his horse right
   into the influx, the queue at the turnstiles. He
   drove his horse between the people to relieve the
   pressure on to the turnstiles so that the horse was
   dividing the influx of people into the turnstiles.




                           /Q.   That is within.....
                                C. L. GILLAM


" That is within those blue gates but before you get to
  the turnstile, is that right? - A. Yes.

 Within that area somewhere? - A.     Half-way between the
 gates and the turnstiles.

 There is a sort of little railing on the right-hand
 side, at about that position you aresaying? - A. Just
 before the railing, yes.

 In fact, this crowd really built up quite fast? - A.
 Very fast, yes.

 Were they well-behaved at that point? - A. Yes.

 Did you notice anything about them which agitated you,
 in the sense that they misbehaved, or that they were
 drinking alcohol in their possession? - A. Not at
 all.

 1 think you did notice that the crowd did not appear
 to be moving that fast, is that right? - A. That is
 right, yes.

 At some point you saw some youngsters climb onto a
 wall, is that right? - A. That is right, yes.

 Can you estimate what time that was? Have you any
 idea? - A. It would be maybe quarter-past/twenty-past
 2•

 I think you   said that they     were cheered onbytheir
 colleagues,   that is right?     - A. Yes.

 But they did not make much progress; they just stayed
 on the wall? - A. They got to the top of the wall and
 then they must have seen a steward over the other side
 so they came back.

 I think at about half-past 2, or thereabouts,
 something else happened, you noticed something else -
 a police officer I think turned up somewhere, is that
 right? - A. A young police    officer turned upatthe
 gates, yes, the gates next    to where I was.

 The one closest to the River Don? - A. That is right.
 Was it one or two officers at that point? - A.        Only
 one.

 What time was that again? - A.     It may have been
 around half-past 2 time.

                                C. L. GILLAM


Q.' What did he appear to you to be doing? - A.     He closed
    the gates behind him.
Q.   Those gates near the Rover Don? - A. Yes, and he stood
     in front of the gates.
Q.   How long did he stay there? - A.   All the while.

Q.   When you say "all the while", all the while until
     when? - A. Until the crowd came through the gates.
Q. When was that? That is what I am trying to find out,
    because presumably that gate was opened at some point
    again, was it? - A. No. When that policeman arrived,
    he stood at those gates to stop anyone coming through
    them.

Q. What happened? - A. He stayed there. Despite the
   huge crush of the crowd against the gates, he stayed
    there and I realised that he was going to have
    problems, just one officer on his own, so I went to
    help him. I went to those end two gates and there was
    a steward with me. He came as well, so we were all
   holding that gate.

Q. The one near the liver Don? - A. That is right, yes,
Q. The one that is on the right of our picture looking in
    there? - A. That is right.

Q. So you are saying there was a police officer outside
    the gate. You were presumably on the inside, or were
   you on the outside? - A. I was on the inside with the
    steward.

Q.   What happened then? - A. The middle gates where I
     normally am, two police officers closed those gates.
Q. What happened after that? - A. We tried to keep the
    gates closed to stop any more people coming in because
    there were too many people. There were hoards and
    hoards of people and those gates had to be closed,
    otherwise it would have been just one big crush.

Q. What happened then? - A.    We held the gates.
Q. For how long? - A.   Until after 3 o'clock.
Q.   Are you saying that those gates were not opened again
     until after 3 o'clock? - A. That is right.
Q. You are quite sure aboutthat? - A.    Yes.
                           C. L. GILLAM


Can you remember that there was a big concertina gate,
what we call Gate C? Can you remember that gate
opening at all? - A. I have no idea. My eyes were to
the front most.of the time.
The reason why I ask is that there is plenty of other
evidence which indicates that those gates did open at
some time between 2.30 and 3.00 to let people through.
Are you saying that that is wrong? - A. As far as I
am concerned that is wrong.

How did they get into the enclosure then? Which gate
did they use? - A. I don't know about the other gates
on the other side, those gates. There was such a huge
number of people there, I just don't know about those
gates. The gates I know about are the ones next to
the Rover Don and the middle gates. Those are the
gates that I remember.
You are satisfied that they ---   A.   Remained closed,
yes.

You are absolutely sure about that? - A.    Yes*

That is not what some other people are saying sad that
is why I have to press you on that, - A, If those
gates were opened, there would be hundreds of people
coming through them and you would not be able to close
them again.
Were the gates open at any time before the match was
terminated? - A. Yes, the gates were opened before the
match was terminated, yes.
At that point when the gates were opened were there a
lot of people still outside? - A. No.
I see. So the crowds, you are Saying, had dispersed
by some means or other, but not through your gates, is
that right? - A. No. The crowd had come through the
gates after 3 o ’clock, many, many hundreds of them and
just vanished within a matter of a few minutes.
So you are saying - we will forget about the time for
the moment - that there was a big crowd of people
outside those gates - right? - A. Yes.
You, plus the steward, plus a police officer, were
holding them, that is the end gate and the middle
gate? - A. That is right.
At some point those gates were opened, is that right,
and a load of people came through and just vanished in
minutes, is that right? - A. That is right, yes.

                                                                  10



                                            C. L. GILLAM

           Q.' Your recollection is that that opening, when those
               outer gates opened, was after 3 o'clock is what you
               are telling me? - A. Yes.
       B   Q.   Did you see any horses outside these gates? - A. All
                I could see was just a mass of heads. That is all I
                could see.

           Q.   I think it is only right to say that you were very
                impressed with the officer who had come to stand in
                front of those gates? - A. Yes, very brave indeed,
                because I was scared and I was on this side of the
                gates; he was on the inside.

           Q.   I just want to ask you one or two more questions. You
                have mentioned a steward who helped you? - A. Yes.
           Q.   How was he dressed? - A.   He had got yellow round his
                middle.

           Q.   So he had a yellow bib on? - A.   Yes.
       D   Q.   Had he turned up, or had he been there all the time? -
                A. He had been there since roughly half-past 10.

                He was not the same steward who opened the gates, that
                was somebody else who opened the side gates initially,
                you told me somebody else? - A. That was somebody
                else.

                This was just a steward. Did you know him? - A. I
                don’t know his name, but there was a steward that
                assisted me for 3 hours or so.

                So it is definite, you are absolutely certain that
                there was a steward out there for a considerable
                period of time? - A. Yes.

                In your duties as a guard, have you on other occasions
                had to deal with motorists parking cars, and so on? -
                A. Yes, I have.

                Is it your experience that people in general, and
                motorists in particular, take notice of what you ask
                them when you ask them to park in a particular place,
                or to do a certain thing? - A. Most of them do, yes,
                but you just get the odd element that do not.

                You get some who want to go where they want to go? -
                A. That is right, yes.

' On those occasions, to the best of your knowledge,
  would those people have had any drink, or would they
  just be in the ordinary course of their daily lives? -
  A. On that particular day —

 I am sorry, I am not asking you about that particular
 day; I am talking about your general experience of
 controlling crowds. — A. It is okay generally, people
 are okay generally.

 But when you get people who will not go, when you say
 the odd one? - A. No, I don't think drink is
 involved.

            Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE
 When the large crowds arrived and the hoards of people
 were outside the gates, as you have described, you
 have told the Court what the policeman did to try to
 stop more people coming through the gates to approach
 the turnstiles. - A. The policeman on horseback, to
 relieve the pressure on the turnstiles.

 Yes, and the other policeman who shut one of the
 gates? - A. There were two other policemen that I
 recollect closed the middle gate.

 From what you could see was there more that the Police
 could do to make the crowd form up into queues? - A.
 I don't know. All I could see was just so many
 people. There were just so many people about. I just
 don't know.

          Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING

 Mr. Gillam, you said that you saw 20 or 30 youngsters
 outside who indicated they did not have tickets? - A.
 Yes.             *

 They had been sitting on the bridge, on a wall on the
 bridge, I think somewhere on the bridge? - A. I
 didn't say that. They seemed to be hanging around,
 but where I was at the gates they kept hanging around
 in a gang.

 Then later on you saw, at about 2.15/2.20, some
 youngsters climb on the wall cheered on? - A. Just
 one youngster.                                    ,

I am sorry, my note says, "Some youngsters climbed on
a wall. They got to the top and then must have seen
the steward and turned back"? - A. I recollect one
youngster climb up.

Q. After that your duties kept you pretty attentive to
   what was going on in front of you, I think? - A. That's
   right, yes.
Q. But can you help us as to whether there was any further
   repetition of the efforts to climb on the wall and go
   over the top? - A. I don't recollect any more
   incidents.
Q. You can't tell us about any more? - A. No.
Q. What you say is that even on the inside of that gate
   that you were scared by what was happening on the other
   side? - A. Yes, the build up at the gates, yes, because
   the people were screaming for us to open the gates to
   let them in.
Q. Thank you very much.
                Cross-Examined by MR. KING
Q. Mr. Gillam, is it the position that you were expecting
   thousands of people to cosae to the game, this
   particular game? - A. I was expecting thousands, yes.
Q. Is it the position that up to 2 o'clock your view was,
   from what you could see, that not many people had
   arrived, was that the position? - A. That's right.
Q. So if I had tapped you on the shoulder at 2 o'clock and
   asked you, you would have probably said to me, "Well,
   there's a lot more people still to come, it would
   appear"? - A. That's right.,
Q. You would have probably said, "It looks as if there's
   thousands of people still to come"? - A. Yes.
Q« In the final hour before kick-off? - A. Yes.
Q. Can I deal with how people were getting into the
   turnstile area before you told us that two Police
   Officers closed the gates, before that time? - A. Yes.
Q. Because have I got it right that at the time those two
   Police Officers tried to close the gates, there was a
   great mass of people already in the turnstile area? -
   A. Yes. That was the end two gates on the other side.

        THE CORONER:   Can you point at the left-hand
   gates, Mr. Griffiths, just to make sure that those are
   the ones:
Q« Are those the ones? - A. Yes, those gates.     Those gates
   are directly in line with the turnstiles.
                                                                     13

                           So there came a time when two Officers
         if1      s**ut those gates? - A. Not those gates, no.
B        The Officers closed the middle gates.
    Q. I beg your pardon - they tried to close those middle
       gates? - A. Yes.

    Q. But before then, all right, before that time -because
       at that time there was a whole mass of people inside
       the turnstile area, wasn’t there? - A. Yes, which
       stretched back beyond those gates.
    Q. Yes. At the time those Officers came to close those
       gates there was already a huge number of people?- A.
       Yes.

    Q. Both in and out of the turnstile area? - A. That's
       right, yes.

    Q. At that time,
                  - j  at the time they
                                   w iic jr came to
                                        w o h i qu u try to close
D      those sates,   fnr-n,™ of queues,
             gates, forming      — -- at that   tha time, was just
       impossible, at that time, wasn't it? ** A. Yes

    Q. Can you put an estimate on that time, the time when
       queues were impossible, there was a great mass of
       people inside and outside, and the Officers came to
       and close the gates? Can you put a time on that? - A.
       Roundabout 20-past-2.

    Q. Something like that. Before that position had been
       reached, that s what I'm interested in, how were people
       getting into the turnstile area. What was their route
       into the turnstile area? - A. Through those end gates,
       directly m line with the turnstiles.

    Q.    Were they going through the middle gates? - A. Going
         through the middle gates as well, yes, to join in the
         queue.                                     J

    Q. So in order for them to join into the mass of people
       who were building up inside the turnstile area they
       went througn all the gates? - A. All the gates, yes.
    Q. Until the Officers came to try and close those middle
       gates, I take it those middle gates were open for them
       to go through? - A. Yes.

    Q. And it was only after the crowd had really become so
       dense the queues were impossible that efforts were made
       to close the gates, that's the position? - A. That's
       right, yes.

    Q. I have no further questions.    Thank you.

    B   Q. Mr. Gillam, can I just make clear exactly what your
           duties were? You were employed to control the traffic
           going down that lane into where the South Stand is? -
           A. Yes.

        Q. That goes down just near the Directors* Entrance of the
           Ground? - A. That's right.
        Q. You only became involved in closing those gates once a
    C      Police Officer had come and attempted to close it, and
           you, realised that he wouldn't be able to do it on his
           own? - A. Yes.

        Q. You went to help him? - A. Yes.
        Q. And that was of your own initiative? - A. Yes.
        Q. And you were helped by a Steward? - A. That*s right,
           yes.
    D
        Q. At that point presumably no traffic could get through?
           - A. No, that is correct, because the Police actually
           did my job for me that particular day, by forming a
           barrier on Leppings Lane, outside the gates, to stop
           any traffic coming in at all, so in effect my job was
           done. The Police was doing ray job for me by stopping
           any traffic coming in at all.
    £   Q. Thank you very much.

        Q. I just want to clarify one point. Mr. King put it to
           you that he was trying to fix a time before the Police
           Officers came to try and shut the gates, he put to you.
           What I want to know is are you saying that they tried
           and failed, or are you saying that they actually
    F      succeeded? - A. They succeeded.

                THE CORONER;  Anything else anybody wants to
           raise? Yes, Mr. Payne.
                HR. PAYNE:   I wonder if we could just have some
           more information about the whereabouts of the barrier
           which stopped the traffic on Leppings Lane.

Q.        MR. PAYNE:   I am just wondering if we could find
     a useful photograph. - A. I believe it was a human
     barrier.

          THE CORONER:    Would C255 help you, Mr. Payne?        It
     is the overhead:

Q. Mr. Gillam, could you turn to 255 in that folder?        It
   saves you turning round. - A. Yes.

Q.         MR. PAYNE:   Can you recognise the scene which is
     m   the photograph, Mr. Gillara? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you help whereabouts the barrier was? - A. Yes, it
          the edge of the road, at the entrance to the
   bheffield Wednesday s property.

              CORONER:   Can you turn round and see whether
     the Officer is indicating correctly? - A. That is
     correct, where he is pointing.

Q.         MR. PAYNE:   And what sort of a barrier was that?
     - A . It looked like a human barrier of Officers.
Q. On foot? - A. On foot, yes*

Q.    Can you say about when this was? - A. It was I would
     say 12 o'clock, mid-day.

Q.    Right, and onwards after that? - A. Well, up until the
     huge numbers of people coming on, because once huge
     numbers of people started coming in I couldn't see
     properly.

Q. The barrier then became swallowed up in the crowd, did
   itf - A. I imagine it would have been, I don't know.
Q.    Allyou know is you couldn't see them any more?   - A. I
     couldn t see them any more, no.

Q. So from 12 until about 20-past-2 then? - A. I couldn't
   give a time. From 12 o'clock onwards.

Q. What work was the barrier of Policemen doing? What
   were the actually doing? - A. Stopping any traffic
   coming m , into the gates where I was.
Q. Thank you very much.

                    Further by THE CORONER

Q* San |      asjE y°u one more question. I want to put
   Mr. Payne s question slightly differently. You said
                                                                    16

     this barrier was erected, formed, at about 12? - A.
     Yes.

Q. Can you remember the latest time that you actually saw
   it? Never mind when it disappeared, when did you lose
   sight of it, if you are able to remember?   A. Maybe 2
   o ’clock.
Q. So are you saying that between 12 and 2 there was what
   appeared to be .... - A . A human barrier, yes.
                Further Cross-Examined by MR. KING
Q. I just want to clarify this barrier, which is puzzling
   me slightly. Was this a human barrier for pedestrians
   or for motor cars* - A. You had best ask the Police
   that. I don't know.
Q. Was it a barrier which was stopping pedestrians,
   stopping motor cars? You talked about traffic. - A. It
   wasn t stopping pedestrians, no.
Q* What was it doing? « A. Well, it certainly stopped any
   vehicles coming in.
          MR. KING:   I wonder if we could see a photograph
     of outside the perimeter gates, sir, because I want to
     try and pinpoint where this was, if possible.
          THE CORONER:     Yes, which one would you like?     258
     perhaps.

          MR. KING: Sir, can we try     260, because we can
     see the road on that?                   - --
            THE CORONER:   Yes, that is right, I agree with
     you.

Q.        MR. KING: Where was this human barrier? Can you
     help us on that photograph? - A. Yes, just this side of
     the cones.

Q. I see, and how many Policemen were in the barrier,
   would you say? - A. I don't know how many but a rough
   guess, maybe 20.
Q. So anybody going into the ground, a pedestrian, would
   observe these 20 Police Officers? - A. Would have
   observed them, yes.
Q. So we can build up a body of evidence, you see, from
   people who went in at various times. The last time you
   were conscious of this 20 group of Police Officers what
                                                C. L. GILLAM



     was the state of the turnstile area? - A. That was
     blocked with people wanting to get into the ground.
Q. Are you saying this, that the last time you saw this
   barrier of 20 Police Officers, behind those Officers
   already got into the turnstile area, was a whole block
   of people? - A. The last time I remember seeing that
   Police barrier was when there was many hundreds of
   people coming into the ground.

Q« I understand   that. My question was at the time you
   last saw the   barrier what was the state of the area in
   front of the   turnstiles where people were waiting to
   get in? You    said it was blocked? - A. It was blocked,
   yes.

Q. So those people who were blocking the turnstile area,
   to get into the turnstile area had had to go through
   that barrier of Policemen? - A. Oh, yes.

Q. And it doesn't look as if that barrier of Policemen had
   stopped them going in? - A, That's right, yes.
          MR. PAYNE:   There is a photograph which might
     help to illustrate what Mr. Gillam is talking about and
     that is C282:

Q. If you look in the bundle, Mr. Gillan, which you have
   got in front of you there.

          MR. PAYNE:   It is not exactly where he is talking
     about, but is slightly further up the road. It might
     illustrate, however, what he is describing.
Q.        THE CORONER:   Mr. Gillam, this is just to try and
     help us to understand what you are saying.

Q«        MR* PAYNE:   That photograph is not exactly at the
     same place that you were showing us just now, it is a
     little bit further up Leppings Lane, towards the
     roundabout, to the right as you look at Leppings Lane.
     - A. I know where it is.
Q. The point is you see that line of Policemen standing
   there? - A. Yes, I do.

Q. Is that the kind of thing you have been describing? -
   A. That is right, yes.
Q. A little bit further along the road? - A. Yes, it could
   have been the same sort of Police, you know, right the
   way round. Yes, that is what I mean.

                           Bv THE CORONER-

Q. You are Kevin Carroll? - A. Yes.

                        ? - A. Exactly.

Q. At Liverpool? - A. Yes.

Q. As a matter of interest, what is your occupation? — a . Office
   administrator.

Q. And you went to this football match on 15th April, 1989, with
   various friends, including, in fact, Barry Bennett, who
   unfortunately lost his life.  That is right, is not it? •« A
   Yes.

Q. And you went by car? - A. That is correct.

Q. And what time did you leave Liverpool about? - a. It wasiabout
   quarter-to- 1 2 . Before 12 o'clock anyway.

Q. And did you have any problems getting to Sheffield? - A. We
   did, indeed, ye s. We ran into quite a bit of traffic.

Q. Where was that? - A. It was outside Sheffield.

Q. Close to Sheffield or far? - A. There were two places.  I
   think it is the end of the M 67, is it, there is a roundabout,
   and then just outside Sheffield as well.

Q. In round terms, how long would you say that delayed you? - A.
      is difficult to say, but half—an—hour 1 would say. We were
   standing still on the motorway for quite a long time, 20
   minutes or so.

Q. That is where the motorway runs into the roundabout, is not
   it? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q- And you arrived then in Sheffield and you parked somewhere.
   Is that right? - A. That is correct.

Q. How many minutes from the ground walk? - A. A good bit.        20
   minutes, 25 minutes.

Q.   And did you go straight from the car straight to the ground or
     did you stop off en route anywhere? - A. Can you repeat that
     question, please?

Q.   Having parked, did you go straight to the ground or did you
     stop off? - a . We went straight to the ground.

Q. And did you see other supporters going to the ground as well?
   - A . We d i d , indeed, y e s .

Q. And were there just the odd ones or were there a lot? - A.
                                                             20


                                             K. CARROLL

     Quite a few.

Q. And did you perceive them as being Liverpool supporters or
   Nottingham Forest? - A . Liverpool.

Q. So you were in the right bit of Sheffield? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see anything about those supporters which concerned
   you in any way at that point? - A. No.

Q. I take it they were singing and chanting? - A. Yes, as usual.

Q. Hoping for a win? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see any of them drinking alcohol from cans as they
   were walking along? - A . Yes , but none were drunk.

Q.   When you say "drunk",what do you actually mean by that?
     Everybody has a different view of what "drunk" is. WhatSdo
     you mean? - A. Visibly.

Q. They were not ill-disciplined, you say? - A. No, they weSre
   not .

Q. I am sorry, I did not hear your answer.     I was trying to catch
   the word. - A. None were visibly drunk.

Q.   Did they the supporters you saw carry on®, two, three, four,
     how many cans? - A. One.

Q.   And that is what you would normally expect of a   crowd of
     supporters, would not you? - A. Yes.

Q.   So we will leave that now. - A. Not everybody was carrying
     them.

Q. Would you say half, quarter, three-quarters? - A. Less than
   half.  Far less than half.

Q. And you then approached the ground at what time? - A. It would
   be about half-2.

Q. You separated at that point because some of your friends had
   stand tickets, and you and Barry I think .... - A. Ground
   tickets, y e s .

Q. I think I am right in saying, and I put this to you to save a
   bit of time, your impression was that the turnstiles for the
   stands were relatively clear at that point.  Is that right? -
   A. I don't recall.

Q. You don't recall? - A. No.

Q. No, I have made a mistake.  You did not say that. So you are
   quite right not to recall it. But you separated? - A. That is
   correct.
                                         K. CARROLL

Let me ask you what you actually saw in front of you? - A.
When we arrived there was already an appreciable crowd there,
all outside the outer gates waiting, trying to get in. Not
actually physically pushing, but they were all milling
outside.

Would you put them in hundreds or in thousands at that point,
or c a n ’t you do it? - A. There was quite a few. There was
more than 500 I would say.

This is outside those outer blue perimeter gates? - A'. Yes.

Are we talking about the ones which lead to turnstiles A-G,
the ground bit? - A. If you look at the....

Do you want the photograph or the plan? - A. The one that has
been on the most, the actual photograph, please.

We will have 258. Would you turn round and look? - A. Yes,
that is the outer ones.

It is those gates we are talking about? - A. Yes.

At that time were the gates shut? - A. When we arrived, syes.

All of them? - A. As far as I could see, yes.

were the gates being moved? Were they being moved in and out?
- A . It is difficult for me to say because I was not actually
at the front.

What happened to those gates in the end, and which ones are we
talking about? - A. The middle ones opened, and a small number
of people got through.  They were then closed again.

You did not see how they opened, I take it? - A. No.

And then somebody, you d o n ’t presumably know who, closed them
again? - a . Yes. I believe they were closed, possibly by the
Police.

Did you see whether it was supporters or Police or somebody
else who might have closed those gates? - A. No.  I think it
possibly was the Police.

And then did the crowd get closer to the gates and more
tightly packed against them? - A. Again it is difficult for me
to say because I backed off because it was quite packed, so I
moved out to the side close to the river.

Why did you do that?   Tell me why you did that? - A. I don't
like crowds.

So you felt you were more comfortable away? - A. That is
correct.

So you were then, in a sense, becoming an observer? - A. Yes,
                                                            22

                                             K. CARROLL

   I' was slightly, near enough against the gates of the river -
   against the railings of the river.
Q. How many yards back from the gates, approximately? - A. Not
   very far. Five or six yards.
Q. Relatively close but not on top? - A. That is correct.
Q. Just describe to me what happened? - A. I seem to recall there
   was a Police horse in front of them.
Q. In front of the gates? - A. Yes. As I say, the gates opened.
   They were then closed, and then a short while after the gates
   were opened and everybody went in. Quite a few people went
   in. I was one of them that went in. I went in and I started
   to queue up in front of the turnstiles. It was quite packed
   there. I was told, a Policeman shouted, that the side gate
   was opened. I was then helped under like a barrier. I was
   helped.

Q. You can see it on the photograph. Can you see the van, and
   then on the left-hand side is that the barrier you are talking
   about? - a . Yes. •

Q. Yes. - A. I was helped under the barrier by a Policeman and
   showed the way round the corner to go in.
Q. That is the way you then entered? - A. Yes.
Q. Do you recollect about what time that was when you went in? -
   A. It was definitely before 3 o ’clock, because when I got into
   the ground the players had not kicked off.
Q. And can you remember whether the gate was wide open or just
   slightly open when you went through? - A. I think it was wide
   open, because there were quite a few people going through.
Q. In fact, just to get this clear, because you were separated
   ffom Barry outside? - A. Outside.
Q. And you never saw him again until it was too late, so to
   speak? - A. That is correct.
Q. Which of those three gates did you enter, the outer perimeter
   gates? - A. The middle ones, I believe.
Q. So you are saying that gate was opened?    - A. Yes.
Q. Before 3 o'clock? - A. May be 7 or 8 minutes to.
Q. Are you saying then it was shut until about that time, apart "
   from that one opening which you have mentioned? - A. I believe
   so, yes.

Q. You could not see what was holding it shut at that point? - A.
   No.
                                               K. CARROLL

Q. You don't know how it opened either? - A. No.

Q. You were an observer, but were the crowd outside that
   perimeter gate stationary, were they anxious to get in,
   were they calling - one of the witnesses just a few
   minutes ago said he was scared because the crowd was
   shouting and saying, "Open the gates".   Did you hear
   anything like that? - a . It is difficult for me to
   recall.  It is possibly just the same as every other
   home game.   They possibly were shouting to open it,
   asking them.

Q. I am not criticising either you or them.  I am just trying to
   establish what you heard or saw, that is all, so don't feel
   concerned about that. - A. Right.

Q. You mentioned there was a Police horse outside that gate? -A
   Yes.

Q. Did you see any more than just one Police horse? - A. Just the
   one.  I can only recall the one.People were backing* staying
   away from it.

Q. In fact, as far as you were concerned you were actually
   directed to that side gate? - A. I was, indeed.

Q.   And then having got through that gate you could see a tunnel
     in front of you? - A. That is correct.

Q. Had you been to this ground before? - A. Never.

Q. And I take it there were quite a lot of people aiming at that
   tunnel? - A. That is correct.  You just followed everybody
   else.

Q. That    is right.   And down you went, the tunnel? - a . Yes.

Q. Just  quickly, the tunnel was clear or.... - a . It was packed.
   There were quite a few people going through it and there were
   some people coming back out as well.

Q. Did the people who were coming out say anything? - a . No.

Q. They did not say to you, "Don’t go down there"? - A. No, I
   don't recall.

Q. You d o n ’t recall anything saying anything? - A. I d o n ’t recall
   anybody saying anything.

Q. Obviously there were more people going down than coming up.
   That is obvious. - A. Yes.

Q. When   you say people were coming up, was it just the odd oneor
   was it more? - a . Just a couple were coming out.~ They were
   coming along the sides of the tunnel.

Q. The main crowd was going down the middle? - A. Through the
                                                                        24

             piddle, yes.

        Q.    When you say it was packed, are you saying it was packed in
             the sense that it was solid, or are you saying there were a
®   _         lot of people walking down? - A. There was quite a few people.
             You were able to walk.

        Q.   You then entered the right-hand pen? - A. That is correct.

        Q.    When you got on to the terrace, in your statement you say, "I
             got into the terrace.   The players kicked off”?— A. Yes.

        Q.    Is that right? Had the match just started? -A. I would say as
             I was coming through the tunnel it had not started.  They.were
             just ready to kick off.

        Q.    In the centre. - A. As I actually got in they kicked off as       I
             was positioning myself.

        Q. So in effect you were there before the kick-off but only just?
           - A. Y e s .

        Q.    And   when you exited from the tunnel - I will take you through
             this   a little bit slowly - when you got out of the tunnel and
             into   the terrace, the first few steps into the terrace, was
             that   clear or not? - A. Packed.

        Q. It was packed? - A. Yes.

        Q. And having seen it what did you decide to do?          A, Try and get
           to somewhere as safe as possible.

        Q. What did you endeavour to do? - A. Get just in front of a
           barrier.

        Q. I entirely accept what you say that it was packed.         How did it
           compare? Do you go to big matches? - A I used to.          I have not
           been for the past year or so.

        Q. Prior to that time you used to? - A. Yes.

        Q. You looked at it. How did it look to you when you first
           glanced at it, at the time, not in retrospect? — A. It was
           packed.  It was full.

        Gh You did not think of turning round and coming out? - A. No.

        Q. Does that mean it just had not crossed your mind or that you
           were merely keen to see the match or that you were not
           apprehensive - that it was full but you' were not particularly
           apprehensive? - A. I think the latter one is correct.

        Gh You were not particularly apprehensive?          No.     I did not
           expect it to get as full as it did.

        Q. And you in fact managed - did you manage to work your way or
           go or walk about halfway into the pen? - A. It was to the

                                                              25

                                            K. CARROLL

     right and about halfway down.

Q. I will get you to show us where it was in a moment. We have
   got a little plan and we will get you to put a cross, if you
   are able, that is.  That was in your case a voluntary
   movement? - A. I had to force myself to get there.

Q. Yes, but you were not being forced from behind by others up to
   that position? - A. Yes, to some extent, but I was forcing
   myself as well.

Q. You were trying to get yourself somewhere where you thought
   you would be able to see and be reasonably comfortable? - A.
   Well, be reasonably comfortable, yes.

Q. What happened then? - A. The pressure just kept on coming.
   People kept on coming in, coming in.

Q. Have a drink of water? - A. I am fine.       It is difficult.

Q. It is very difficult.    I appreciate it. - A. I heard shouts.

Q.   What sort of shouts did you hear? - A. People screaming.

Q.   Was this halfway in the terrace? - A. This is in front of me.
     There were people trying to climb out, and the Police were
     stopping them initially.  There was somebody on the fence
     shouting "Move back. Move back'’.

Q. You could hear that? - A. Yes, I could, and there were people
   shouting back saying, "We c a n ’t move back. There’s nowhere to
   go", and then there were people still coming in at this time.

Q. Was this at your level where you could hear that and where
   people were shouting, "We can't move back"? - A. Yes.

Q.   It was halfway.  We will see where it is in a moment. Could
     you hear people behind you still cheering and chanting at that
     point? - A. I don't recall that.

Q. You don't recall? - A. No.

Q. Can you remember - I may as well tell you - Beardsley hit the
   cross bar at about 4 minutes or five minutes after.  Can you
   recollect that? - A, I do, yes.

Q. Can you recollect whether at that point there was any
   cheering? - a . I can't recall.

Q. You just can't remember? - A. No.    It was quite bad then.     It
   was starting to be a struggle.

                 /Q. It was getting quite....
                                                  K. CARROLL

Q. It was getting quite bad at that point? - A. Yes.
Q. At that point were fans already climbing out? - A.
   Yes, and they were climbing up behind as well. They
   were getting helped up into the stand above.

Q. You did not notice whether anybody else was going out
   sideways into the other pen? - A. Yes, they were
   climbing out. To the right you could see them
   climbing out of the centre pen into the other pen.
Q . Did you notice whether anybody was going out into the
    side pen right at the back? You may not have done
    because you were facing forward? - A. No, it was
    about three-quarters the way forward, just a bit
    back, and they were climbing over the fence into the
    far pen.

Q. At that point people were already being helped over
   the fence? - A. I would say that was about the same
   time they were starting to help them over the fence.
   Timing is difficult.

Q. Pardon? - A. Timing is difficult*

Q. I am not trying to pin you down? - A. That is okay.

Q. What we are trying to do is do the best we can and it
   is hard? - A. Okay.

Q. You said to me a moment ago that people were trying
   to get on the pitch, over the front? A. Yes.
Q. Initially you said? - A. Yes.

Q. How long is initially? - A. Again it is difficult.
   It is a couple of minutes at least. Definitely at
   the beginning they were stopping them getting over.

Q. Did you see the gate at the front open at all? - A. I
   do not recall it actually opening but I do recall it
   being open.

Q. So you do not know when it opened? - A. No.

Q. Can we put the usual acetate up? I am just going to
   get you to put a cross on the picture of the
   terraces. We are trying to build up a picture of
   where people were if we are able. Can you work out
   where Pen 3 is? Show him where the tunnel is? - A.
   Probably about there.

                                                 K. CARROLL


Q. That will be C.303. Can you see immediately below
   where you put your cross there are a couple of dotted
   lines? Can you see them? - A. Yes.
Q. Do you have any recollection at all of seeing or
   hearing that barrier break? - A. No, but I seen it
   getting thrown. They tried to throw it over the
   fence.
Q. You did not see the barrier break but did you notice
   any forward movement of the crowd? - A. No.
Q. You did not know it was broken? - A. No, I was
   positioned with my back to the barrier and there was
   no pressure behind me.
Q. You saw it being thrown over the fence? - A. Yes, and
   it nearly hit somebody as it was thrown over the
   fence.
Q. Pardon? - A. It nearly hit somebody. Somebody picked
   it up and threw it over the fence. I think it nearly
   hit a Policeman.
Q. You do not know why it was thrown over the fences of
   course? - A. Obviously it was broken and they were
   just getting it out of the way.
Q. But you do not know.   You did not throw it over the
   fence? - A. No.
Q. You saw it being thrown? - A. I saw it being thrown,
   yes.
Q. Quite a big bit of metal, was it not? - A. Yes, I saw
   something getting thrown anyway.
                Cross-Examined bv MR. HALE:

Q. Mr. Carroll, I missed perhaps a little bit of your
   earlier evidence but I get the impression that you
   had not had anything to drink at all? - A. I was
   driving.
Q. So you had nothing to drink? - A. Nothing at all.
Q. We are talking about a lot of gradual things, are we
   not? The build up of the crowd was gradual, was it
   not? It did not hit you all at once that it was
   dangerous. You went through the situation and you
                                               K. CARROLL


made decisions from time to that, is that right? " A.
Yes.
When you were outside you felt apprehensive then, is
that right? You do not like crowds? - A. I don't
like crowds, no.
There is quite a deal of sense in that in the light
of what happened. You took a decision at that point
and later on you found yourself going in. You went
in with the crowd and you got to the terrace. Then
you took another decision, that is right, is it not?
First of all, you took the decision that you ought to
try to get to a place of safety? - A. That is
correct.
You also took a decision at that time that it was not
all that bad. It was not bad enough for you to turn
round and try and fight your way up the tunnel? - A.
I don't believe I could have got back out.
What I think you said was that you did not try? - A.
No.
Because you did not really think it was that bad at
the time? - A. No, on first impression, no.
Obviously there were a lot of other people there and
they all had similar decisions to take? - A. Yes.
But you had a clear head because you had nodrink   in
you at all? - A. None at all.
            Cross-Examined bv   MR. MANNING:

I think that the last comment you made in answer to
Mr. Hale is that your first impression of the terrace
was not that bad and it seems consistent with
something a young lady told us yesterday afternoon.
Her name was Stephanie Jones and she said as she came
into Pen 3, at what must have been almost the
identical time to you, the terraces looked just as
they normally do? - A. That is correct, yes.
 I am sorry to jump around because I am going to go
 back outside now? - A. That is okay.
 The first gentleman we heard this morning, and I do
 not know whether you were in here for his evidence,
 he was a security guard standing at the blue gates,
 the other side of the blue gates, which were closed
                                              K. CARROLL

until such time as they were opened to let you go
through. He said - and again this is consistent with
what you were saying, although you said that you do
not like crowds anyway but you wereapprehensive - he
was actually scared standing the other side of the
gate with that crowd trying to press in? - A. I
wouldn't use the word "scared".

You would not use it? - A. No.

You I think suggested a sort of normality situation,
that this is something you are used to at
Liverpool? - A. Queuing up outside to go into the Kop
is usually far more organised.

It is far more organised? - A. Yes.

But you are used to hearing people shouting to open
the gate? - A. Yes.

The same sort of scenario when you earlier described
people walking down the streets, some of them with
their tins of beer in their hands, chanting and
singing, that is not something which strikes you as
abnormal? - a . No, it does not.

But might strike other people not used to that sort
of thing as something which is abnormal? - A.
Possibly.

             Cross-Examined bv MR. KING:
Mr. Carroll, is it your experience that fans who go
to football matches never ever have a drink before
they go through the gate? Is that your experience? -
A. No.

Is it your experience that it is quite a normal and
natural part of the activity before people go to a
football match that some people go and have an
alcoholic drink? - A. True.

What I am really seeking your help on is what one
could expect at a game before the game takes place.
Would it be reasonable to expect the crowd at a
football match to be totally stone cold sober? - A.
No.

We have heard an awful lot - and I do not know how
many days you have been at the Inquest ~ about people
                                              K. CARROLL

carrying cans of alcohol. Did that strike you as
something unusual at a football match? - A. No.
You have been very clear evidence and very helpful
evidence and I think everyone would agree with that
because you yourself had a good view? - A. Yes.

Were you worried yourself about the amount of alcohol
being carried by people? - A. No.

Let me move on if I may. I am just trying, if I can,
to pinpoint the time it was when you went through the
perimeter gates into the turnstiles and then were let
through that big gate. How long was it before you
went through the big gate into the ground that you
entered that turnstile area? - A. Not long, a couple
of minutes that is all. I know the gates were opened
a few minutes before.

Which gates are you referring to now? - A. The main
gates on the side.

The perimeter gate? - A. No.

I beg your pardon? - A. The main gates on the side.
The concertina gate? - A. Yes.

That had been opened a few minutes before you went
in? “ A. Yes, but we were queuing up for the
turnstiles and although the Policeman was shouting
that the gates were open I couldn't work myself to
the right to actually go through.

It is very difficult, I know, but how long do you
think it was before you went through the concertina
gate that you had first arrived at the ground? How
long was it you had been outside the ground before
you got to the concertina gate? - A. It is difficult
to say.

I know. It may be impossible? - A. Twenty five
minutes. It is something that is really difficult to
say.

Can I go now to when you were let through into the
concourse area and you went through the tunnel
because you said that was the natural way to go?
Everybody was going that way? - A. Yes.

        Q. When you got on to the terraces and you were being
           pressed about this, your impression was that it was
           full? - A. Yes.
    B
        Q. Can you tell us what you mean by full in terms of the
           amount of space that would be between you and the
           next person? - A. No. It was very, very little
           space.
        Q. If I had tapped you on the shoulder at the very time
           you entered that terrace and said, "There is going to
           be about another thousand people coming in behind
           you" what would you have said to me? - A. I would
           have liked to know where they were going to go.
        Q. Did it look to you that that terrace, as you entered
           it, could take many more people? - A . No.
        Q. What was your view? - A. It was full.
    _   Q. You did tell us that you saw people escaping the mass
    U      of people by climbing into a side pen? - A. That is
           correct.
        Q. From your view what was the state of those Side pens?
           How full were they? - A. I wondered why we couldn't
           get across that way. I couldn't see that there was
           an actual dividing fence and on the far side it
           appeared to be quite spacious.
        Q . But you had not realised before you entered the
            terrace that in fact this wide terrace was divided by
            a radial fence into sections? - A. No.
        Q.   You did not know that? - A. I did not know that, no.

        Q.    You could see spaces in those side pens but you could
             not see how you were going to get there? - A. That is
             correct. I could not understand why everybody was
             pinned in.
        Q. The picture is that everyone was pinned into the
           centre pins? - A. Yes.
        Q. The side pens were quite spacious? - A. Relatively
           so, yes.
                        Cross-Examined bv MR. CATCHPOLE:

        Q. Mr. Carroll, can we just help to flesh out the
           picture of your movement of the crowd outside the
                                                     K. CARROLL


    turnstiles going through that gate? Were you the
    only person who was being pushed under that barrier
    to go round? - A. No, quite a few people.

Q. Quite a few? - A. Yes.
Q. Was the whole space outside filled with supporters
   moving in that direction because there is a label on
   the side of the barrier if you look. It might be
   easier to actually look at the photograph C.254 in
   the bundle in front of you. The barrier you were at
   is there and you were on the left hand side of it
   just past that white band? - A. That is correct.
Q. You got pushed underneath it or helped underneath it
   by a Police Officer and there is a gate just beyond
   the white band where you went in? - A. That is
   correct.
Q. Was this whole area filled with supporters moving in
   that general direction? - A. There was quite a few,
   yes.
Q. when you went in through that gate the general line
   of travel was in one direction towards that tunnel? *
   A. Yes.
Q. So you just followed on and upwards the way it goes
   because everyone else was going that way? - A. There
   were no signs to go left, to go right.
Q. You were actually following the crowd going
   through? - A. That is correct.
Q. That is the way you had gone? - A. Yes, that was the
   obvious way in.
     MR. KING:   There is a question which I could stand up
and ask but I thought it was far more sensible that Mrs.
McBrien ask it because she has not had her turn. Perhaps
if I deal with it, sir?
       THE CORONER:   Yes, go ahead.
               Further Cross-Examined bv MR. KING:

q   „ You were mentioning, Mr. Carroll, about your
      experiences at Anfield? - A. Yes.
 Q. And how at Anfield it was more organised, there were
    more queues and so on? - A. That is correct.
                                                   K. CARROLL


Q. Can you tell the Jury from your experience of Anfield
   the differences between when you normally go to the
   Liverpool Football Ground and how it was on that day
   in 1989? - A. At Anfield everybody is made to queue
   up. The queues can be a hundred yards long. They
   are made to queue up and they are organised. Outside
   this ground there was no Police to organise you at
   all. You were just left to get through.

Q. It also looks, to be fair, that at Anfield there is a
   lot more space for people to queue if they are a
   hundred yards long? - A. Yes, they can go round on to
   the main road.

Q. What you are saying is more Police, more organisation
   and more space?- A. Yes.

     THE CORONER:   What you are saying is that your
impression and understanding is that there was more space
and organisation? What was the third point?

     MR. KING:     More Police, more organisation and more
space.

Q•        THE CORONER:   That is your impression as you
     compared the two events, Mr. Carroll? - A. Yes,
     definitely.

                 Cross-Examined bv MRS. McBRlEN:

Q. Mr. Carroll, I have just one question for you. How
   would you expect to go into a football stadium
   normally? Would you expect to go through a turnstile
   or would you expect to go through a large gate? - A.
   Turnstile.

                 Cross-Examined bv MR. RUSSELL:

Q. Can I please seek to establish from some photographs
   we all have when, according to your evidence, you
   were able to get in because I think it could help to
   pinpoint from when you moved outside the perimeter
   gate to inside? I think you have a bundle of
   photographs there which includes one marked C.295.
   Do you have that open? - A. Yes.

Q. We can see that the perimeter gates, and in
   particular the middle perimeter gates, in front of
   which there is a mounted Police Sergeant, do you see
   him? - A. I do indeed.
                                                 K. CARROLL


Q. Those gates are closed? - A. Yes.

Q. WE can see the time that that photograph was taken
   was at five to three according to the time on the
   photograph and we are told in fact that means six
   minutes to three because the camera was a minute
   fast? - A. Yes.

Q. According to your recollection you did not move from
   your position outside the gates until after those
   gates were opened and we can see they are closed at
   six minutes to three? - A. Yes.

Q. Turn on further because there is another photograph
   which....

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Russell, I do not want to interrupt
you but can you draw that inference because my
understanding was that he had got into the turnstile area
and then was helped underneath the barrier? There may have
been a time gap between traversing the perimeter gates and
getting to the position where he could be helped underneath
the barrier.




                               /MR. RUSSELL:
                             K. CARROLL

     MR. RUSSELL: Sir, I am coining to that, I hope. I
just wanted to deal with it in stages. If I could ask
roan s*r * an<^ t^le witness and the Jury to turn to
C299, we can see what the position was two minutes
later.
Have you got 299 there? - A. I have, indeed.

We can see in that photograph that the middle gates
have been opened in the 2 minutes that had elapsed
since the last photograph was taken? - A. Yes,

And the corrected time of this, one presumes, would be
4 minutes to 3? - A. Yes.

Because the time was 14.57. So would it be right that
you passed from outside the perimeter gates to inside
the perimeter gates when the gates were opened,
therefore, perhaps in the course of those two minutes?
- A. Yes.

Having entered the perimeter gates, you stood queueing
for the turnstiles themselves for a period which you
estimate to be about 2 minutes? - A. Yes.

Then you were admitted under the barrier and into the
concourse via what we know as Gate G, the concertina
gate which was open? - A. Yes.

You made your way walking? - A.    A brisk walk.
To the tunnel? - A.   Yes.

And down the tunnel and you emerged onto the terracing
at about the time the kick-off took place? - A. Yes.

You have told us and confirmed to Mr. Manning that the
terrace at that stage.looked as it normally does? - A.
Yes, at Anfield.

Your experience, presumably, is gained from Anfield? -
A. Yes.

And the Kop, is that right? - A.   Yes.

Are you used to being on the Kop when there is a full
Kop? - A. Yes.

Looking around you when you arrived on the terrace, it
looked like the Kop does on a normal day with a full
Kop and do you think that is what it would have
appeared like to someone looking in? - A. It is
difficult to say.

                                    K. CARROLL

Q.' But, as far as you were concerned, it was normal for a
    full terracing such as you had experienced at
    Liverpool? - A. When I arrived into the ground.

Q.    I am interested in when you arrived on the terracing
      at or about 3 o'clock? - A. Yes, but when you arrive
      onto the terracing at the Kop it tends to be very
      packed there, until you actually move out and it gets
      spaced out. The actual entrances, there are usually
      quite a few people moving around.

          MR. PAYNE;  Sir, I wonder if I might be permitted
     to ask some questions about the comparison that has
     been made between the organisation of the crowd
     outside the ground at Anfield and on the occasion that
     the witness has been talking about, because this has
     been raised further down the row after I had finished.
          THE CORONER:     Yes.

          MR. PAYNE:     I am grateful.

          THE CORONER: I agree that you should be allowed
     to ask questions, but I do not want you to start
     getting into the field where we compare, but I accept
     that you do want to ask some questions on it,
          MR. PAYNE:     I will limit it.

          THE CORONER:    That is all I am saying.

            Further Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

Q. You have talked about the organisation and I want to
    just show you a document which relates to the
    organisation of the crowd at the place that you are
    talking about. - A. Yes.

         MR. PAYNE: Sir, I wonder if I might be allowed
    to refer to C285, the Operational Order. You will not
    find it in that bundle, Mr. Carroll. (Handed) It is
    page 32.                                     "
Q. You have not seen this document before and it is not
    one t^lat y°u know about, but I want you just to look
    at this on the question of organisation. Do you see
    at the top it says, "Sub-Sector 8"? - A. Yes.

Q.   Then underneath that "Leppings Lane turnstiles"? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   "Phase 1 - Before the Match", do you see that? - A.
     Yes.
                               K. CARROLL


This is about Serial 16, you can see the number in the
top left-hand corner of the page with the list of
policemen underneath who are in that serial at this
Leppings Lane turnstiles, do you see? - A. Yes.
At "Phase 1 - Before the Match", "This serial will be
responsible for turnstiles A to G", do you see that? -
A..- Yes.

Then it gives their jobs:

     "They will ensure that persons entering do not
     possess items prohibited by the ground rules,
     banners, etc., weapons, missiles or alcohol.
     They will maintain order and ensure orderly
     queues are formed."
Do you see that? - A.   Yes.

Then there are Phases 2 and 3, and that is later on.
Now just go down to the next serial, Serial 17,
Leppings Lane turnstiles, another list of policemen,
"Phase 1 - Before the Match" and there are similar
instructions:

     "This serial will be responsible for turnstiles 1
     to 8. They will ensure that persons entering do
     not possess items prohibited by the ground
     rules..." as above. "They will maintain order
     and ensure orderly queues are formed."

You will find the same over the page for Serial 18,
which is responsible for turnstiles 9 to 16, do you
see that? - A. Yes.

So as far as the instructions are concerned, let us
just count the number of policemen deployed there.
There are 10 in Serial 16, and I think there are
another 10 in 17 - there are 11 in 17, so that is 21 -
and another 10 in 18, that is 31 policemen are
deployed with those instructions. Do you see that? -
A. Yes.

In -addition, I am not going to trouble you with this
because the Jury will see this later on, but there are
also a large number of mounted Police deployed. In
fact, if you turn to page 59, the Mounted Section was
deployed at various places round the ground and
actually 6 were allocated to Leppings Lane, although
we have seen in the photographs that a good deal more
than that number were actually there shortly before
the kick-off? - A. Yes.
                              K. CARROLL

I am just asking you on the question of organisation,
I am dealing with this particular situation. Having
looked at that, thank you very much, just to draw that
to your attention. Can you now turn to photograph
C255. Do you recognise what we can see in that
photograph? - A. Yes.

You can see Leppings Lane dog—leg just outside the
entrance to the ground? - A. Yes.

The ground then, we know, can be approached from the
two directions, either from the right of the
photograph or from the left? - A. Yes.

Can you just tell the Jury, which way did you come? -
A. From the left, down the main road.

From the left as we look at it? - A . Yes, from the
bottom of the picture, followed the main road.
So you turned left into the ground? - A.   Yes.

You have put your time of arrival at the ground at
about 2.30? - A. Yes.

And you got yourself into the pen just before the
kick-off? - A. Correct.
Just about 3 o ’clock? - A.   Yes.

So it is a half-hour wait for you altogether between
arrival and arriving in the pen? - A. Correct.

The first place that the crowd really built up was
outside the blue perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

The evidence which the Court has heard is that between
half-past 2 and 3 o'clock, and mainly round about
quarter-to 3, hundreds   of peoplewere running down
Leppings Lane from the direction that you had come, do
you follow? - A. Yes, I follow.

Of course, that was after you had already arrived at
the ground? - A. Yes.

So they would be coming down behind you? - A.     Yes.
And at the same time, between half-past 2 and 3
o ’clock, thousands of people were coming from the
other way, across the bridge, do you see? - A. Yes.
To the right as we look at the photograph? - A.     Yes.

                                  K. CARROLL

Q.   So the picture is that in that half-hour large crowds
     were converging on these turnstiles, do you follow? -
     A. Yes.

Q.   I. mean 'on the perimeter gates. As far as organisation
     of that crowd was concerned, the Policet according to
     the Order, those serials, had to try and form them up
     into queues, do you understand? - A. Yes, I
     understand.

Q.   In fact, what happened was that a large mass of people
     built up outside the blue perimeter gates? - A. Yes.
Q.   They were being used as a means to try to control the
     numbers which were getting access to the turnstiles?
     I mean, the gates were closed to try to only allow a
     certain number of people in to get to the turnstiles?
     - A. I suppose so.

Q.   If those gates had been opened, then the next thing
     would have been that the crowd would have been
     stopped, instead of being stopped at the perimeter
     gates would have stopped at the turnstiles? - A.
     Possibly.

Q. That is right, is it not? - A.   Yes.
Q. So if queues had been formed of these hundreds or
    thousands of people who were arriving between 2.30 and
    3 o'clock, whereabouts would the queues have formed? -
    A. I don't know - possibly outside the gates.

                  Further by THE CORONER
Q.   I just want to ask you one more question, nothing to
     do with any of this stuff about the gates. I just
     want to see whether I can time this incident. You
     know you mentioned this incident when you saw part of
     the barrier being thrown? - A. Yes.

Q.   I am just interested to know whether you can put a
      time on it when that happened? - A. No.

          THE CORONER: Okay, thank you very much for your
     help. It is much appreciated, thank you. We are
     going to break now for our coffee. We will start at
     12. Is that satisfactory to everybody? Then it will
     be our next witness, which is Mr. Knowles.

           ROBERT ARTHUR K80WLES Called (Sworn)
                       By THE CORONER
Q. Good morning.   You are Robert Arthur Knowles? - A.
   That's right.


   Merseyside/ - A. At that time, yes.    1 have moved
   since.

Q. Can you give us your present address? - A.

Q. And I think you are an engineer by profession, is that
   right? - A. Yes.

Q. On 15th April - we will go straight into the matter -
   you were going to go to the football match here at
   Hillsborough, which was the semi-final, and in fact you
   were bringing your wife down, I think, who was not
   intending to go, she was going to do some shopping in
   Sheffield, I think, and did you have two children who
   were coming to the match with you? - A. Two boys were
   coming to the match.

0. You left at about 10.15 in the morning because you
   wanted to get here in good time? - A. That's correct.
Q. For various reasons which we don't need to worry about,
   and I think - and again, we don't need to go into great
   detail - you did run into some traffic problems, X
   tnink at Stockport, wasn't it? - A. There were traffic
   hold-ups around Stockport, at the M63.
Q. Eventually what time did you get into Sheffield? - A.
   We actually parked in Sheffield at 1.35. I can be
   precise about the time because we parked in a National
   Car Park and they gave us a ticket with the time on.
Q. So you are actually sure about that? - A. Yes.
Q. So you took quite a long time to get here? - A. Yes.
Q. You were thankful that you had set off relatively
   early? - A. That's right. I think anybody leaving
   later would have been ....

Q. would have been in some trouble, time-wise. Oddly
   enough, having taken such a long time to get into
   Sheffield, you then found it very easy to get from the
   car-park to the ground? - A. That is right. We jumped
   in a taxi.
%                                                                     41
    A
                                              ROBERT ARTHUR KNOWLES



        Q. It was ironic .... - A. The traffic in the centre
           wasn't too bad.
    B   Q. You I think are a regular match attender, I believe,
           that is right, isn't it? - A. That is correct, yes.
        Q« This was not a one off? - A* No, I have gone for 20
           years.

        Q. Yes. You were anxious to get there early because you
           wanted to get the lads into a good position, I think,
    C      that is right? - A. That is correct. Normally, the
           youngest lad was 13 and I had a family friend with us
           as well, when we attend matches, if we did attend
           matches home and away we normally liked to get in a
           good half hour, 40 minutes before the game, and I tried
           to get him sitting on a barrier so he could get a good
           view.

        Q. In fact, having got into Sheffield at 1.35 you then
           went into town to get a bite to eat? - A. Yes, we
    D      parked not far from here, just by the Fiesta, and we
           went to look for something to eat because we had been
           in the car for a good three hours. We hadn't brought
           anything because we weren't expecting to be held up for
           so long, so we went and bought some chips and then we
           stopped at a pub and I had a pint in there, before we
           actually made our way up to the ground*
        Q. Did you walk it? - A. We were in the pub and it was
    E      fairly busy. There were football supporters froa both
           sides in there, plus a lot of local people. It was a
           quite friendly ataosphere, talking about looking
           forward to the game, and we stayed there until about 5-
           past, 10-past 2. I asked a local if I could get a taxi
           from round that area, and he said if we just went to
           the end of the road we would probably see a taxi
           passing and could hail one down, which is what we did,
           and then travelled up towards Hillsborough.
    F   Q* I® the pub you said it was a mixed crowd, no problems,
           and I assume from what you said no excessive drinking
           a?     as y °u were concerned? - A. No, no, a couple of
           pints. There was a lot of talking about football as
           crowds normally do when they get together.
        Q. Of course, you were coming towards Leppings Lane from
           the Nottingham sector, so to speak? - A. What was
           designated as being that, yes.
        Q- ^e can move on now to the ground, you arrived - the
           taxi took you to Leppings Lane, is that right? - A. I
           don t know the name of the road, we did hit a
           standstill to the traffic. We could see the ground



    H
                                      ROBERT ARTHUR KNOWLES



   from up the top of the hill and the driver said, "I't
   will take you about 10 minutes to walk down from here".
   He said otherwise we would probably be sitting in the
   taxi for the same amount of time, and the taxi was
   ticking over so we actually paid and got out of the
   taxi and walked down.

Q. So do you know the road you walked down? - A. I am
   afraid not, no. It was down a hill and through a park.
Q. I see, and did you approach, when you approached the
   gates did you come at them and have to turn right into
   them, or did you turn left into them? Can you
   remember? - A. Right, over a bridge.
Q. Right over a bridge. That gives us an idea of the area
   where you came from. You got there, I think you said
   in your statement, about 2.30, is that right? - A. It
   was around 2.30.

Q. What did you see? - A. There was a bunched crowd, quite
   a thick crowd of people, attempting to make their way
   into the ground. I was quite surprised to see so many
   people milling about. There were some milling about on
   the bridge as well as actually trying to make an
   entrance into the ground.
Q. Why were you surprised to see that many people? After
   all, it was a sell-out, wasn't it? - A. It was a sell­
   out game, an all ticket game, which usually means that
   you can turn up and gain access quite easily, because
   you know you are going to get in because you have got a
   ticket, so it was quite surprising to see a lot of
   people hanging around outside, with no orderly queue as
   well.There was no queueing. It    was just a crowd.
Q. At that stage you hadn't even got anywhere near the
   perimeter gates, when you saw this crowd? - A. No, we
   were a few yards away from the perimeter gates.
Q. Could   you see them? - A. You could see thegates.
   There   were Police horses in front on them.
Q. Just as a matter of interest- how many horses did you
   see? - A. Two.

Q. Were the gates open or shut? - A. They were shut.
Q. Did you also see Police Officers who were shutting or
   trying to shut the gates? - A. They were shut, and it
   was a crowd but you could move through it, so I made my
   way through the crowd and we came up to the horse. It
   was quite bunched at that stage, there was a bit of
   pushing from the rear, probably as more people were
                                      ROBERT ARTHUR KNOWLES



     arriving and saying, "I want to get in”. The Policeman
     standing on the inside of the gate saw that 1 had the
     two boys with me and beckoned me to push through and he
     opened the gate slightly and allowed me to go in
     through the gate.
Q. So he made a deliberate effort to enable you to come
   in? - A. That's right.
Q. Because of the lads? ** A. Yes, it was getting a bit
   crowded and the horse started to move about.   We were
   right by the horse.
Q. When that happened did you notice if the movement,
   attitude, behaviour of the crowd changed or altered in
   any way? - A. The crowd were, I think, a bit
   frustrated, not knowing exactly what was happening.
   There was no indication of why those gates were shut.
   There was quite a crowd inside and again there was no
   orderly queueing so I think people were a bit anxious
   about what was actually happening.
Q. Anxious in the sense that they thought they were being
   kept out, is that what you are saying? - A. Possibly,
   yes.
Q. Did you hear any shouts or any exclamations at all
   about ...? - A. There were a few words being bandied
   about.
Q. What sort of things? - A. People just saying, "What's
   going on, why are we being kept out here?” People
   saying, "I have got a ticket, why can't I be allowed to
   go through?"
Q. I see. Was it being said forcefully or not? - A. No,
   they were shouting, but not really aggressively.

          HR. RUSSELL:   Sir, I didn't hear that last
     answer.
          THE WITNESS:   They were shouting but it wasn't
     aggressive.
Q.        THE CORONER:   You didn't think it was aggressive?
     - A. I didn't think it was aggressive.
Q. In fact, when the Police Officer let you through, why
   did he do it? What was the motivation? - A. We were by
   the horse. The horse, I think, was moving backwards.
   The Officer was trying to control his horse as people
   were around it. We got to the back, the rear of the
   horse, and it started to push us and the Officer,
                                     ROBERT ARTHUR KNOWLES



   possibly seeing that we might get trampled by the horse
   or whatever, then asked us to come through.
Q» So really what you are saying is it was done in order
   to protect you and the boys? - A. I think so.
Q. For whatever reason. - A. Yes, I think to allow us
   access.

Q. At that point, when you were still outside the
   perimeter gate, before you got in, how strong was the
   pressure of the crowd? - A. We were shoulder to
   shoulder.

Q. And back to front? - A. And back to front, yes.

Q. Was it comfortable or uncomfortable? - A. I am quite
   tall. I didn*t feel uncomfortable but the boys, yes,
   were feeling a bit nervous.

Q. In fact, you got into the area and there were "B" signs
   over the turnstiles? - A. That is right.
Q. And that was, in fact, the area you were aiming for,
   wasn’t it, as it happens? - A. Yes.
Q. Now, you then had got past the perimeter gates and you
   were now, so to speak, in front of the turnstiles? - A.
   We should have been. I expected to be in front of the
   turnstiles.

Q. But you were in a courtyard, in fact, in front of the
   turnstiles? - A. That is right.

Q. What happened? What was it like in there? - A. It was
   literally a free for all, trying to get through the
   turnstiles. There was no sort of queueing or anything.
   There was a Police horse in there at the edge of the
   crowd. The crowd was against the wall running up to
   the turnstiles and then there was a gap, and the horse
   was at the end. There were people trying to get past
   ®e to get out, saying that they were in the wrong
   placeg had the wrong tickets for this area, they
   weren t allowed in, and they were trying to get back
   out of the gate which was closed, which was impossible.
   Joining the queue was pointless so we just stood at one
   side, and watched. There was people attempting to
   climb up the wall; there was people on the wall trying
   to pull people up, and there was quite a crush goine on
   there.

Q. So it was pretty crowded in there - worse than outside
   the outer perimeter gates? - A. It was much worse
                                       ROBERT ARTHUR KNOWLES



     towards the front of the turnstiles.   It was just a
     crush.

Q. There was a crush? - A. There seemed to be no movement
   through into the ground. There just seemed to be a
   complete blockage.

Q. That as your impression, that nothing seemed to be
   moving? - A. Yes, that's the impression I got. As I
   say, there was no problem in getting into it with the
   boys so I just stood to one side.

Q. You tried tostand a bit to one side?- A. I just
   moved. You were quite able to walk about. You were
   quite able to move about in there if you stayed out of
   the crush. There was plenty of room on the side, which
   is where all the Police were standing.

Q.    So you couldget out but in the heart of the crowd it
     was very .... - A. Yes, there was a barrier that run
     parallel with the end of the wall where the turnstiles
     ended, and that is where the crush was. On the other
     side of that was it quite free moving.

Q. Yes. We will put up a picture - 258. Can you see the
   barrier, can you see the van? - A. That's right, yes.
Q. What you are saying is that on the right of that
   barrier, looking at that picture, it was relatively
   clear? - A. By the van, yes. That is where we stood.
Q. And on the other side is where all the crowd were? - A.
   Yes, right along the small wall and the fence was quite
   a crush.

Q. You had a conversation with one or two of the Police
   Officers, didn't you? - A. That is right. It was
   nearing about 20-to, quarter-to-3. Obviously we were a
   bit anxious wondering whether we were actually going to
   §®t in, in time, or not, so I did say to a Policeman,
    What s happened to the queueing? There seems to be no
   queues here, what's happened?" In my experience of
   being to football matches they normally have Policemen
   by the turnstiles, at the front of the turnstile,
   asking for tickets, to see that you have actually got a
   ticket, and forming a queue. Liverpool in particular,
   they have a horse, a mounted Policeman walks up and
   down the queues so there is a space between the two.
   Here there was no space it was just a crowd of people
   pushing each other to try and gain entrance. Obviously,
   probably they paid money they wanted to get in and see
   the game. They were worried about not seeing the kick-
   off. I asked a Policeman why there were no things. He
   said, The men have come out. We were worried they may
                                  ROBERT ARTHUR KNOWLES



get hurt", because they were standing by the wall, they
were being pressed up against the wall. He told me the
Policemen had actually been taken out.
Because of the number of people whom they were facing,
forward? - A. Yes.
What you are saying is that that is what would have
happened in the other grounds where you have been, that
the Police are actually at the turnstile entrance? - A.
Each turnstile, there is one Policeman either side, and
they would ask for tickets, so that people couldn't
turn up and get in the way, and there would also be a
horse so that people would queue either side of the
horse and leave a gap*
I thought you said that there was a horse? - A, There
was a horse by the van on the other side of the
barrier. He could see what was happening but obviously
wasn't affecting it.
You didn't see a horse on the left hand side of the
barrier? - A. Yes, by the van*.
By the van, yes. That is the only one that you
noticed? - A. Yes.
Did you have any other conversations? - A. There was a
row of Policemen standing by - at the end of the
turnstile there is a concertina gate, as you are going
round the ground - there was a row of Policeman
standing, there, six or seven Policemen and women.
There were a number of people, mainly I would say older
people and people with children like myself. I made my
way down there and they were actually asking, I think
it was a Sergeant, if they could gain entrance through
that concertina gate, to save being involved in the
crush. I myself proffered my tickets to him and said,
"If we could be allowed through there you may be able
to clear the people off a lot quicker, because there
was an obvious blockage there. People were just not
getting into the ground at the rate you would expect
them to get in there.

So you envisaged that this would be a mechanism of
actually easing the problem, if they opened the gates
and allowed people with tickets through it? - A. That's
right* Somebody did actually go in that way. The gate
opened and a Policeman went in, and then came back out
a little bit later. You could see, there was a little
window in the gate, you could see Policemen standing on
the other side as well.
                                                             47


                                     ROBERT ARTHUR KNOWLES



Q. Sorry, say that again? - A. There was a small window in
   the gate and you could see through it, that there was a
   Policeman standing on the other side opening and
   shutting the gate. It was under control by somebody
   that could open it.

Q. But by the time you had got there the Police Officer
   had said, "We have had to withdraw from the turnstiles
   because we are frightened of getting hurt, and the fans
   have got to fight it out amongst themselves", or
   something like that? - A. The actual words he said to
   me, I think, were, "Let them fight amongst themselves
   if that's what they want to do". He seemed to have
   just given up control in that particular area and just
   left the fans to it, to try and get in any way they
   could, which left them open to pushing and shoving each
   other in their attempt to get through.
Q. I think you were saying, you said in your statement,
   because I have put what you actually said, I think you
   also said you formed the impression the crowd was
   becoming more aggressive at this stage, is that right?




                     /A. I think they were .....
                                                            48

                                           R.A. KNOWLES

   - A. I think they were very frustrated in trying to gain
   access to the ground. The ones at the back were pushing and
   saying, "Come on. Let's get in", and the ones at the front
   knowing there was nowhere for them to go were shouting back,
   "Please, stop pushing. People are- actually getting crushed
   in the front part. Please ease back", but in a situation like
   that you can't really hear or understanding. You are just
   pushing forward trying to gain access. I don't think they
   could hear anything being shouted from the front.
Q. Did you hear any loudspeakers? - A. I saw a Policeman with a
   megaphone actually came from by the concertina gate and walked
   the other side of me, so I don't really hear what he was
   shouting.
Q. You could not hear what was being said? - A. No, because I was
   on the other side of him.
Q. I am not saying he did, but if he had shouted something about
   the timing of the game you would not have heard it? - A.iHo, I
   would not.
Q. Is that because there was such a lot of noise going on? - A .
   It was quite noisy, people shouting.
Q. I am not saying he said that.   Don't get me wrong.    ~ A^.-No.
Q. Then eventually in fact you heard Officers discuss openipg the
   gate? - A. We were standing right by the gate, and there was a
   line of Officers there. I think it was a Sergeant, I remember
   I was standing particularly by him, and he did start to
   discuss the possibility of opening this gate to ease some of
   the pressure from the crowd. They were saying if they kept
   the perimeter gates closed and eased the people by the
   turnstiles through, this may be a way of stopping, unblocking
   the turnstiles and allowing people outside to actually then to
   start to move forward. So I stayed with the boys by that
   gate, expecting perhaps we might get through that way.
Q. It was your hope that would happen? - A. Yes.
Q. As anaside, have you ever   gone through a gate as opposed to a
   turnstile? - A. No.
Q. In fact, that is precisely what did happen, the gate did open?
   - A. Yes. The Policeman with the megaphone I think went
   inside, and then after perhaps a couple of minutes came back
   out, and I think it was the Sergeant that was standing by got
   a message over his radio. I remember distinctly standing
   right by and he put his message, it was mentioned, "The gate
   will open". He enquired, "Open the gate?". I remember him
   saying, "Open the gate?", and it came back across the radio,
   "Yes". So he then went to the gate and knocked on the gate,
   and it was opened, slightly at first. The 20 or 30 people
   that had been milling around that area then moved towards it.
   I think I was about two or three behind. I was offering my
   tickets, but there was nobody even bothered about that. The
                                                             49

                                              R.A. KNOWLES


     Police that were standing on the outside just stood back, and
     the gate eventually opened to the full extent, I think.
     Inside there was a couple of Policemen.  They moved to one
     side.  The first thing I saw having moved through the gate was
     the tunnel and through that you could see thegoalmouth and
     the pitch.  So that is where we headed.

Q. You had not been to the ground before, had you? - A. I had
   actually been to the ground before, but it was 1980.

Q. A long time ago? - A. A long time before.      It had changed
   slightly.

Q. In fact, when that gate was opened you described there $tas a .
   cheer? People were pleased? - A. From behind I distinctly
   heard shouts going up.  The message was being passed back that
   there was a gate open, and it was a big gate. It was   _
   obviously going to let a lot of people through at one t^me.
   There was no sort of funnelling or telling people in which
   direction to go to actually gain access to the playing ifeea.

Q. And you, too, went down the tunnel with the boys? - A. .Wfe went
   down the tunnel. At the end of the tunnel there was a Pence
   running down the centre towards the pitch, and we went #ff to
   the left facing the pitch, and began to walk, to force ©ur waj|.
   through the crowd towards the goal.   Normally, fr©« beifig to
   football matches, people do tend to stand where they first
   come into the ground.  It tends to be quite full there, so I
   expected to push through that particular place, but as we got
   to the front - it was not a large terrace - as we moved
   towards the front it was very packed.   So I said to the boys,
   "Move left away from the centre".   So we got virtually right
   down to the front.  There was steps leading down, a terrace
   leading down.  Down the bottom there was a yard or so flat
   area right next to the front, and that was fairly free.    There
   was a gap you could walk along.   So we walked along as far as
   we could go. We then came up against the fence running from
   front to back.

Q.    The radial fence? - A. Preventing you from going any further.
     We turned back a little bit and moved into the crowd a couple
     of paces. We did have to push our way i n , and the boys could
     not see anything.   It was quite packed. So they went a couple
     of steps forward and stood actually on the fence itself.

Q.    They climbed up? - A. There was   a small piece at the front
     they could stand on.   They were   holding the fence at the
     front.

Q. Let us try and put times on it. It is not easy. When you
   first entered on to the terrace and you were going to go down,
   did you look at the pitch at all? - A. We looked at the pitch.
   The players were actually out.  The Liverpool goalkeeper was
   actually in the goal in front of us.

Q. Then it sounds to me as if what you were doing was working
   your way down diagonally towards the front? Would that be
                                        R .A . KNOWLES

a,bout right? - A. We worked our way towards the goal and then
to the left.

So you were trying to get right to the front if you possibly
could? - A. That is right.

If I have understood you correctly, when you actually got
right to the front, which is like a little well almost, is not
it? - A. Yes.

You could walk along that front.  There was some room?' A.
There was a bit of room to push past people,where actually on
the terrace was quite difficult to move.

When you got there and you were making your   way towards the
left, what was happening on the pitch? - A.   The players were
kicking in towards the goal.  As we got to the fence and I
looked over it - again with being tall I could look over - on
the other side of that fence the terrace was virtually itipty,
and the terrace at the side of the stand on that side of the
pitch was empty.  I remember thinking at 10-to-3 with ail/the
people outside, "Why is that terrace so empty?".

Why did you say 10-to-3? - A. The players normally come put
about 10 minutes before the game kicks off.  I was assuiilng it
was about lQ-to-3.

When you were first at the radial fence before you looke* to
the left and said, "My goodness me, it is very empty", % e y
were still kicking around at that point, were they? - Ail They
were kicking in towards the goal and warming up, generally
doing exercises.

Then they started playing? - A. Yes, I do remember them
kicking off.  I do remember them kicking off at 3 o'clock.

What I am trying to find out, this was when you were next to
the left radial fence? - A. Yes, we had actually got to the
fence, taken up our position that we were happy to be able to
see the game, and possibly in a minute or so the game did
actually kick off.

The reason why I ask you about the 10-to, the players came out
- we know what time they came out because they were filmed -
and you did not look at your watch, did you? This was a
guess, the 10 minutes? - A. Yes.  I don't remember looking at
my watch.  I was guessing about that time.

     THE CORONER:   What time did they cpme out?

     MR. BEECHEY: 3.2.77, and it was 14.54 when the
Liverpool team came on the pitch.

     THE CORONER:   14.54 the Liverpool team on the pitch.*

By the time you got to the top of the terrace they were
definitely on the pitch kicking the ball around? - A. Yes.
                                          R.A. KNOWLES


In fact, at this point you were jolly pleased because you had
achieved what you wanted and the boys could see? - A. Yes.
The main idea of the day out was to get in, see the match, and
I thought, "OK, we have made an unusual entrance into the
ground, but we are in".

The game kicked off.   You saw that.     What happened then,
briefly? - A. I think there was a shot at the Liverpool goal,
and the crowd moved forwards slightly, and again as they
normally would, people craning at the back to see push the
people in front, and there was a bit of a push.      I actually
ended up against the boys on the fence.      The gap that was
there disappeared.   When I tried to move back, to take a step
back - normally you move forward and take a step back - there
was not really any room to move.    I would say perhaps two or
three people to my left were up against the fence at the side
as well.   It was shoulder to shoulder.     Looking towards the
goal there were some people actually starting to climb #ie
fence and trying to get over.   I d o n ’t why - I will nevil|rknow
why - I just said to the two boys, "Climb over the 'fenceSand
get on the pitch.   I just don't feel comfortable.     I th in k
there is something wrong".   So I half hauled them and a couples
of people at the side of me helped to push them up.      The fence
was quite difficult to climb.   It was very tight mesh and you
could not really get a toe hold on them.      There are spikes on
the top as well which curled into the crowd.      They were 13 and;
14 and were quite agile, so they actually got up and over the
fence and dropped down in front of the goal, in front of me.
I was then against the fence.   There were a few people then at
that time actually doing the same thing, climbing over the
fence at the same time, and also at the side of me at the
fence going into the next area, they were starting to climb
over there.

In fact, the enclosure next to you was a very narrow one. Can
you remember that? - A. I did not really see the extent.  I
just remember noticing it was empty.

When you asked the boys to go over this was almost before you
realised something had gone wrong? - A. Yes.   I don't know.  I
say to this day I would probably never know why, I just felt
uncomfortable.   The boys were in front of me against the
fence, and obviously they were smaller than me and I felt it
did not feel right.   It was very tightly packed.  There was no
movement either way.   So I suggested that they might be better
off out of i t .

And the match was in progress at that point? - A. The game was
being played, ye s.

And you in fact took their place against the fence?      - A. Yes.

And how did you feel? - A. I was a bit worried at that time.
I was glad that the boys were out.  I thought they were safe.

What you said in your statement, and again I want you to tell
                                              R.A. KNOWLfeS

       m;s what you said:  "I myself was pushed up against the front
       fence unable to move but not feeling any great discomfort"? -
       A. Yes.   I was not being crushed in the sense I was hurting in
       any way, but I was up against the fence and unable to move,
       which did worry me.   I thought, "If I am going to get pushed
B      any more from the back there is nowhere for me to go".

    Q. What you are saying is you were being apprehensive that if
       there was any more pressure you did not know where to move
       to? - A. That is right.

    Q. But just at that point it was bearable as far as you were
       concerned? - A. Yes.

    Q. Would that be fair? - A. Yes.

Q. By this time were people calling out? - A. Yes, they
   were.  There were shouts mainly I thought from - they
   were girls' voices, screams, and younger voices
   shouting for help, "Please stop pushing". There was
   a girl standing to my left who was obviously
   distressed.  I was facing left.    I couldn’t turn
   round to see behind me but I could see this girl.     I
   think I was lucky in that we were by the fence
   running from front to back.   As people climbed over
   that fence you did get a bit of breathing space, a
   little bit of movement, but as you moved you were
   getting pushed.  It was like, I should imagine, if
   you have got pencils in a tin. As you take one out
   there is a little bit of room but then somebody puts
   one in the other side and it is just as full.     People
   were getting out but quickly being replaced by people
   coming from somewhere else.

Q. You have mentioned what you heard. Was there a lot
   of noise altogether? - A. It was quite noisy because,
   as I say, the match I think was still being played
   and people were shouting.

Q. Did you hear any shouts from further back? - h. Yes,
   there were shouts from people behind saying, "Move
   forward".  As I say, there were shouts of discomfort
   and pain as well.

Q. Did you hear any cheering at all? - A. There was
   cheering from around the ground.  Whether it was from
   the section I was actually in I couldn't be sure.  I
   certainly wasn't cheering.

Q. Your lad was actually asked to go into one of the
   pens? - A. When they climbed over the fence, as I
   say, they were standing in front of me. A
   Policewoman came over.  As I say, there were a few
   people running on to the pitch at this time, as I
   say, quite a lot and coming from further up.    It
   seems from where we were I think they were the only
   ones who actually got over at the front but a bit
   further up towards the middle there were quite a lot
   of people trying to get ov e r . They were starting
   then to move away from the goal.    They wete being
   directed from behind the goal which way, to the left
   and the right. A Policewoman came over and grabbed
   my son and the other boy who was with us who is a
   family friend, and a gate the other side of the fence
   running from front to back was opened and he was
   pushed back in.

Q. That pen was full, empty or what? - A. That was the
   empty pen.

Q. It was empty? - A. Yes.

Q. So he was not in fact in any danger in the pen he was
   put in? - A. No, but I think having seen me he d i d n ’t
   want to go too far away.

Q. No, I accept that but in fact you would accept the
   pen was empty? - A. Yes.

Q.    I think you have mentioned there was a girl near you
     screaming, is that right? - A. There was a girl to
     the side of me.

Q. She was eventually helped out, is that right? “ A.
   Yes.
Q.   Was that by an    Officer? - A. No,   I helped, or people
     around helped, to ease her up on to the fence.

Q. She then went over? - A. She went over into the other
   side as a number of people were doing.

Q. The Officer who escorted or directed your lad, was it
   a he or she? - A . It was a lady.

Q. Are you sure because in your statement you say it was
   a Policeman? - A. No.

Q. it was a Police lady? - A. It was a Police lady
   actually got hold of my boy and pushed him through.

Q. I do not want to go into a great deal of detail in
   view of what you said but at one point you noticed
   that it looked as if somebody was in really serious
   trouble on the floor near to you while you were still
   within the pen.  Do you remember that? - A. No.

 Q. I will read to you what you said:

     "As I moved I saw a man who had been pressed
     alongside me slide down to the fence on the
     floor    "

     A . A man.

 Q. Do you remember that? - A. Yes.
                                         R. A. KNOWLES

You say he was ashen and did not display any signs of
life? - A. Yes, once the girl had got out over the
fence on the side there was a bit more room. For
some reason it kind of eased slightly and I was able
to turn. As I turned I presume he had been standing
a couple of places from me. There was somebody else
directly behind me who was moving away. He did
literally just fall to the floor. There was no
colour in his face, very little, and a small gap
appeared around him, a semi-circle, and we were then
able to move. Why at that time we were able to move
I can't say. We gave him a bit of space. Somebody
shouted to try and help, try and administer first
aid. I had moved up slightly towards this fence and
there was a Policeman actually standing. The gates
that led out on to the pitch had a small platform on
it and there was a Policeman there helping to pull
people out. I shouted to him. I put my hand up. I
held my hand out to him and said, "Please come and
help here". He was pulled in and went down and tried
to administer the kiss of life.

Thankfully for you, Mr. Knowles, you left? - A. I
felt my best place at that time was to get out of
that particular area. I climbed out on to the pitch,
went to the front of where I had been standing and we
tried to rip the fence up to enable them to get in to
help this man who was on the floor. Seven or eight
people tried to work the fence. As it started to
come away I moved away to find the boys. The one
boy, my son, had been put on the terrace and had got
back out. He was actually in the penalty area. I
walked on to the pitch and found him.

Fortunately they may have been a bit shocked but they
were all right which is the crucial thing? - A. Yes.
Just one more question because you seem to have a
fairly clear recollection. Can you recollect whether
people were coming from behind you, from higher up
the terrace, or towards the front fencing? - A. When
we are actually on the terrace?

Yes. - A. The pressure was from,...

No, running over the crowd as I would put it- I am
not meaning pressing forward but trying to get out.
Were they coming forward? - A. Yes, definitely.
There was no way back. There was no way you could go
anywhere backwards. It had to be through that fence
or over that fence somewhere.

 Q. People from further back, you say, did actually move
    forward? - A. They were forced forward.

Q. You do not really know that, do you? - A. I presume
   with the pressure that I felt on my back that people
   were trying to scramble that way towards the fence.
Q. Would you be kind enough to just mark the plan for
   me? You were in Enclosure 4, you said, and you can
   see which one it is, can you not? - A. Yes. Show us
   your position when you took up your match viewing
   position with the lads. That is C.304. - A. Yes.
                 Cross-Examined bv MR. HALE:

Q. Mr. Knowles, it is customary for us on this side of
   the table to say how deeply sorry we are for
   everything that happened there and offer our sympathy
   to you. It must have been a terrifying experience.
   Throughout that experience am I right in saying that
   you kept a clear head? - A. I think so.

Q. You had your children very much in mind? - A. That is
   right.

Q. You took various decisions from time to time to
   safeguard them? - A. Yes.

Q. You are an engineer? - A. In a very loose way.

Q. I think anybody can understand what I am going to ask
   you. If you had to make a line of peas on a board,
   three wide in columns, and you make two, three, four
   or fivs lines of peas in columns, and you then put a
   ruler across the back of them and pushed forward,
   what would happen to those peas? - A. They would get
   squashed, wouldn't they?

Q. Let me make it clear to you. Would they stay in the
   columns you had put them in? - A. I wouldn’t have
   thought so.

Q. They would spill sideways, would they not? - A. Or
   up.

Q. Forwards, up, or somewhere, and if you wanted to stop
   those peas from coming out of those orderly lines you
   had put them in you would have had to put something
   at the side of them to keep them in those lines? - A.
   Yes.
                                          R. A. KNOWLES



Would you accept that what you had put there would
have to be continuous from the front to the back to
hold them in line? - A. Yes.        '

If you put something against every alternate pea to
stop it moving aside the other ones would move? - A.
Right.
You would not have to apply pressure for very long,
would you, before all you would get is a big mass of
peas all in a circle. Is that not the situation in
front of the turnstiles with people? There was no
physical barrier, was there, to keep them in line? -
A. No. Actually trying to gain entrance to the
ground?

That is right and right up to the turnstiles? - A.
That is right.
There were no fences in lines that people could have
been channelled down? - A. No.
So the obvious result of pressure from the back would
be that the queues would just disappear and they
would all get into a mass and that is what you saw? -
A. That is right.
             Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE:

Mr. Knowles, just looking at the place where you have
marked the plan, as we look at it, just to one side
there is the fence which runs from front     to backand
across the front of where you were there     was themesh
which eventually you and others pulled away? - A.
That is right.
I do not suppose you saw it but there is another
fence running from front to back down the middle of
the picture? - A. Yes, we actually came across that
one when we came through the tunnel.

If you look at the front perimeter fence there is
Gate 4 marked on it? - A. Yes.
Were you able to see that that was kept shut? •-* A.
No, we couldn't see that one.
Once you were in the position marked by your cross
where was your nearest means of escape? - A. Only
across the fence running from front to back.
                                         R. A. KNOWLES



Climbing over that fence? - A. Climbing over that
fence which was spiked.
Where was your nearest ordinary means of escape? - A.
Back through the tunnel.
           Cross-Examined bv MR. MANNING:
When you arrived down the ground you saw the bunched
crowd with people separately milling around on the
bridge itself and not apparently anxious to get into
the ground as you were? - A. That is right.




                      /Q.   Then you said.

                                    R. A. KNOWLES

Q.' Then you said at all-ticket games it usually means
    that you can gain access more easily? - A. Yes, in my
    experience.

Q.   It means very simply that people have not got to take
     money out of their pockets, there is no question of
     the gateman having to give change and, therefore, it
     is just a ticket to be perforated, pulled apart, and
     through the turnstile they go? - A. That is right.
     It is usually quite free-moving.

Q.   So even though there was that large crowd milling
     round which surprised you at that time, you thought
     that it was going to move fairly quickly and get
     through? - A. That is right.

Q.   When you got inside the gate, because of the obviously
     clever attention of the police officer not wanting the
     boys to be in a crush, you realised that it was even
     more crushed inside the gate? - A. The actual trying
     to gain access to the turnstiles, yes.

Q.   Which, of course, explained to you why the gates were
     closed? - A. That is right.

Q.   Because if all those people had been allowed into that
     concourse area, it would have made it dangerous? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   Indeed, you then learned that it had been considered
     to be dangerous, that police officers, according to
     what you were told, had been standing as you had
     expected them at the front of the turnstiles? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   That is what you were told? - A.   That is correct.

Q.   And they had had to be pulled out because they were
     getting crushed against the wall, that is what you
     were told? - A. I had been told they had been
     removed. For whatever reason, I do not know. They
     were obviously in danger perhaps of being crushed, but
     I would have thought so were the people that were
     standing next to them.

Q.   We heard this morning from a security officer who was,
     in part, responsible for the manning of the blue
     perimeter gates. He was the other side of them, not
     the crowd side of them, the concourse side of them.
     He described himself as being scared. Can you
     understand that? - A. Yes, I can understand his
     feelings.
                               R. A. KNOWLES


When you got onto the terrace itself, you were not
particularly overly concerned about what you saw on
the terrace? - A. No, not when we first got there.
There were a number of people standing where they had
got in? - A. Yes,
But that, you say, is fairly common practice? - A.
Yes, they normally stand and get their bearings,
decide which way to go first. Having had the boys
with me, I had decided that I wouldn't stand there, I
would get to the front and move to one side.

Although you had to force your way through a little
bit, you were able to get down the steps and to the
position that you have indicated? - A. Yes.
So at that stage, which was moments before the kick-
off, I think, again as far as you were concerned then
the terrace was not abnormal? - A. No.
            Gross-Examined by MR. KING

Mr. Knowles, just picking up what Mr, Manning has been
talking about, is this the normal scene when you go
onto a terrace, that a lot of people are immediately
standing where they have just entered, as you say to
get their bearings, and then they will try and move
further onto the terracing and spread out? - A. That
is right.

So that when you arrive at the back and see a lot of
people immediately in front of you, you probably say
to yourself, "Well, I am not too worried about that
because I can get further in and spread out"? - A.
That is correct.
If we look at the terraces, we can see on the model,
we see that the actual width of the terraces runs the
whole width of the West Stand?
     THE CORONER: He cannot see.   Is it easier on the
plan of the ground?
     MR. KING:   It may be, sir.
     THE CORONER: It is 274. I am not trying to stop
you using the model, but I think it might be easier.
     MR. KING: Sir, that is quite right. It is
convenient for me but that means, of course, that it
is totally inconvenient for the witness, and the
witness is far more important.   I wonder if the
officer, with his pointer, could point out the West
                               R. A. KNOWLES


Stand and the terrace in front of it.
You see, there is the West Stand and those are the
terraces which look out onto the pitch and those are
the terraces which, if you go to the Leppings Lane
end, you are going to stand on, do you see? - A. Yes.
One can see that, in fact, they stretch the whole
width of the West Stand, but what you said was
different on this occasion was that when you moved to
your left in the pen you were in, you could only get
so far and then suddenly you came across a radial
fence? - A. That is right. There was just nowhere to
go.

So unknown to you before you entered that terrace, it
was not a terrace you could move along left and right;
it was sectioned off into pens? - A. That is right,
or cages.

You say "cages", which probably is an accurate way of
looking at it. You gave an observation, which is an
important one, that you looked over beyond the pen you
were in and made an observation about the state of the
ground beyond the pen you were in. Could you tell us
again what you could see beyond the pen to your left?
~ A. Yes, that is right. No.6 and No.7 were
virtually empty.

You made a thought to yourself, you had a thought
process at that stage: could you tell us again what
your thought process was? - A. At that particular
time, with the players out and the kick-off time so
near, it was unusual for a terrace with a sell-out
crowd expected to be so empty.

You said something about the people outside? - A.
Having come through the crowds that were outside, they
should have been inside at that time.

That was a stage when you were very close to kick-off?
- A. Yes.

Can I go back outside the ground for a moment. When
you had got through those perimeter gates, it was
obvious to you that the crowd of people who were in
the area before the turnstiles, who were trying to get
through the turnstiles - I wonder if the pointer could
be used to show the turnstiles. Just turn to look at
the model, I know it is difficult. If you look at the
7 turnstiles, which is the area we are talking about,
you have already told us it is divided up already by a
metal fence down the middle? -A. That is right.
                                R. A. KNOWLES


Was it your observation when you had got through those
perimeter gates that the mass of people who were in
front of the turnstiles in that area between the metal
fence and the wall dividing the two turnstile areas
were absolutely jammed packed? - A. That is right.
There was no question at that stage of any queueing
because they were totally jammed packed? - A. Yes,
there was no queue. It was like a bottleneck: there
was just nowhere for anybody to go.
It would not surprise you if people were getting
crushed at the front because of that mass of people? -
A. That is correct.

At that stage you tell us the perimeter gates were
shut, because you had been allowed in? - A. Yes.
So that mass of people somehow had already been
allowed through the perimeter gates toget into    that
position? - A. That is correct.

Obviously before you got there? - A.   Yes.

You get through onto the concourse area, and you say
there was no funnelling, no one directing you? - A.
No.
Why do you make that comment? - A. Inmy experience
of games that I have been to, normally you are
shepherded right up to the turnstile to prevent people
from wandering about and causing a nuisance of
themselves.

You yourself went down the tunnel because that was the
obvious way to go? - A. Yes, I could see the pitch,
so I went.

     THE CORONER: Mr. King, excuse me, the witness's
response was ”... up to the turnstile”.
     MR. KING: I beg your pardon. He may have
misunderstood me.
     THE WITNESS:   Once we got through the concertina
gates.

     MR. KING: You probably misunderstood me, and it
is my fault entirely. You have got through the
turnstiles, you are now in the concourse area? - A.
Yes.

If you look at the little plan you can see where we
are talking about? - A. Yes.
                              R. A. KNOWLES


I was interested in your answer to the learned
Coroner, after you had got through the big gate you
said it was obvious that many people were going to go
through this big gate, this concertina gate? - A.
That is right, yes.
You say there was no funnelling, or letting people
know, or directing people to where they should go, is
that right? - A. Yes. There were policemen on the
other side of the concertina gate, and stewards, who
just stood to one side.
So there was no effort to send people round the sides
of the stand to get to what seemed to be the side pens
with lots of spaces? - A. That is right. Once I had
actually gained access to the ground and saw that the
side pens were empty, I remember thinking to myself,
'I wonder how you get onto those terraces'.
Yes. Because, of course, if you had been directed
around the side of the West Stand, you could have got
onto the empty terraces? ~ A. That is right.

But you did not know that? - A.   No.
I just want to deal, if I may, with the scene on the
terrace you were on, having come through the tunnel,
before you put your two boys over the fence. You have
been to many football matches, and I am sure you know
what I mean about swaying, where people sway forward
and sway back again? - A. That is right.
Then there is a phenomenon known as a surge, where
people move in a surge and stop and do not go back
again. Before you had the foresight to put your-two
boys over the fence, were you conscious of surges in
the crowd in the way I have described? - A. No.
There was swaying but you could take a step back.
Can I just try and jog your memory about that because
it is important and probably I alone - I do not know
if anybody else has, I know the learned Coroner has ~
have got the benefit of something you wrote not long
after this awful disaster happened. Can I just read
to you what you wrote.
     MR. MANNING: I am not sure whether my learned
friend can read from that which is in his possession
and nowhere else. It is a ruling, of course, for you,
but I must raise that and flag it.
     THE CORONER: I can understand what you are
trying to do, but I think before you do that, Mr.
King, the thing that concerns me a little bit is that
"T%
                                                                   b4

               you have put to the witness the difference between a
               sway and a surge, but we do not actually know that he
               distinguishes it in that way. I think we ought to get
               him to define what he understands by the terms in his
      B        words, and then I think we can go back and you can put
               that one sentence. I know what you are wanting to
               put.

                    MR. KING: I am obliged, sir.   I thought the
               witness had agreed with me.
                    THE CORONER: I realise that, but the trouble is,
               as you know, it is very difficult for witnesses
               sometimes to disagree, particularly when they have not
               really thought through what the words mean.
                    MR. KING: I agree, sir. It is important and I do
               not want to do anything where the witness does not
               fully understand it, and it is important that we all
               understand.
                    THE CORONER:   Indeed.
      D
                    MR. KING: You have heard, Mr. Knowles, my speak
               about a surge, which I have suggested to you is one
               thing, and a sway another. But forget what I have
               said. Do you know the difference and, if so, can you
               put it in your words? - A. As we were waiting for the
               match to kick off, there is normally some movement in
               the crowd as people jostle for places, late-comers
               move in, so I would imagine that you do tend to move
               back and forth, up and down. If I was in a situation
               where I could not move at all, I would feel that there
               would be something wrong.

               If you are pushed forward in a sway, you expect the
               sway to pull you back again? - A. That is right.

          Q.   But what is unusual is when you are not pulled back,
               you are pushed forward and you stop? - A. That is
               right.

          Q.   On this occasion - I am now talking about 15th April
               on the terraces you were on - I want to put to you
               something you wrote, and you may disagree with it and
               you are entitled to say, "Well, that isn't right. I
               got it wrong then and I am right now", you see. But
               this is in your description of what was happening
               before you decided you had got to get your two boys
               over, do you understand? - A. Yes.
                    MR. KING: Sir, I am not trying to hide anything
               from my learned friend and if anybody wants to see the




      H
                                R. A. KNOWLES

statement, of course they are entitled to.      It is page
7 on mine.

     THE CORONER:   Mine is 6, but never mind.
     MR. KING:   You said:

    "As the match kicked off the crowd surged forward
    towards the pitch. I was forced up against the
    fence with the two boys in front of me. This was
    not unusual in a packed crowd and usually eases
    off after a few seconds, but after the first
    crush came a second surge pushing everybody even
    harder against the fence. Screams and shouts
    from the crowd against the fence indicated the
    pain and obvious discomfort people were feeling."
That is something you wrote not long after the game?



                        THE CORONER: Not in my
                                                                    66

           THE CORONER:     Not in my version.
           MR, KING:      I am sorry, sir?
          THE CORONER:   "Screams and shouts for help", and
     then it differs from your version.
          MR. KING:   Sir, maybe I have got a different
     version, in which case ....
          THE CORONER:   Well, we don't really need that bit
     because that is not what you are after. You are
     talking about the surges, aren't you?
          MR. KIUG:   Yes.      Sir, I am very happy to show the
     witness the document.      It is not something I have
     invented.

          THE CORONER:       Have you got the original
     statement?
           MR. KING:      Sir, can I show you what I am looking
     at?

          THE CORONER:   I think I have got his formal
     statement and you have got a letter, haven't you?
           MR. KING:      I have, sir.
Q«        THE CORONER:   I think you wrote a letter didn't
     you? - A. That is right, to the Taylor Inquiry.
Q.         THE   CORONER:    As well as making a statement.
          MR. KING:   Sir, this was a letter written by the
     witness, to the Inquiry.
          THE CORONER:       Yes.   I have been relying upon the
     formal statements.
Q.        MR. KING:   Mr. Knowles, so there is no mystery,
     it would seem that not long after the disaster you
     wrote a long letter and you also gave a formal
     statement? - A. That's right.
Q. What provoked you to write the long letter? - A. The
   following day, the Sunday, or even the Saturday night,
   the reports that the press and the media were giving
   out I felt were wrong.
Q. So you wanted to put your version? - A. That's right.
Q. To the Inquiry? - A. Yes.
                                                 R. A. KNOWLES



Q. It may be the section I read out isn't exactly word for
   word what the learned Coroner has? - A. No.
             HR. KING:   But the gist, I suspect, sir, is the
     same.

          THE CORONER:     The wording until I Stopped you was
     the same.
Q.        MR. KING:   So that the picture which you have
     given in your letter, and apparently in your statement,
     was that originally there was a movement of the crowd
     which you didn't think would be unusual because you
     expected it to ease back? - A. That's right.
Q. But a second surge came which clearly was unusual
   because you didn t get back, is that right? - A. That's
   right.
Q. And this was before you had had the foresight to put
   your boys over the fence? - A. I was in that position,
   I was leaning against the fence, the boys tucked in
   below me, and unable to push back any great distance.
Q. In the sentence I read out to you, which is something
   you wrote, talking about the very siame event, the same
   segment in tine, when everybody had been pushed against
   the fence in that second surge, you said, "There were
   screams and shouts from the crowd against the fence,
   indicated the pain and obvious discomfort people were
   feeling", is that right? - A. That is correct.
Q. This was before you had the foresight to put your boys
   over the fence? - A. Yes.
Q. Did you get the impression that as people were trying
   to get out, that there was panic around you? - A. Hot
   in the sense - people were frightened but I think they
   were all expecting the crush to ease off.
Q. But it didn't? - A. It didn't.
Q. And you heard shouts clearly from people wanting to get
   out? - A. Yes.
Q. Did you get the impression that originally those who
   were on the other side of the fence, that is where the
   Policemen were .... - A. The pitch side.
Q. On the pitch side, that the Police at that stage had
   realised what was going on? - A. No.
Q. You thought they hadn't realised? - A. They hadn't
   realised.

But they were looking into the crowd? - A. Yes.
At the time you have just described the distress which
you could observe? - A. Yes.
Going back, if I may, to outside the ground, before you
had arrived at the ground, and you were making your way
towards the entrance, had you observed any sort of
system, I don't know, call it what you will - a cordon
of Police - any sort of barrier preventing you getting
anywhere near the great mass of people who were outside
the ground when you turned into it? - A. No, there was
no form of planning at all. There were Policemen, I
did notice Police and the blue vans that they use,
several Policemen sitting inside it, just by the park
that we walked through but they weren t actually
talking to anybody or doing anything.
Thank you very much.
     HR. PAYNE:   I wonder, sir, if through you I could
ask Mr. King just to complete the picture that he has
been putting through these documents which he has read,
and which you have seen, because the timing is quite
important of when the serious crushing occurred. What
Mr. Knowles said was that, when he was first asked by
Mr. King, before he started to produce the documents,
he asked him about what had happened. Mr. Knowles
said, "Before I put the boys over the fence there was
swaying, but you could take a step back". Then the
documents were read out and it is obvious that after
that the situation got much worse, but in order that we
can just follow the sequence, we know that Mr. Knowles
got into the pen and down to the front after the teams
were on the field, at sometime after 6-minutes-to-3,
because the Liverpool team caae out at 14.54. "At
sometime just before kick-off there was swaying but you
could take a step back and then afterwards it got much
worse". Sir, I wonder if Mr. King could just get that
sequence completely right, dealing from the time when
there was swaying but you could take a step back?
     THE CORONER:   I thought that I had attempted to
do that in my examination-in-chief but by all means,
Mr. King.

     MR. KING:   I think my learned friend- is
suggesting perhaps, I don't know, sir, whether he wants
you to, but I will gladly try and clarify what I have
put to see if I have got it right:
I was anxious to establish, through refreshing your
memory from your letter, that before you had the
foresight to put your two boys over, before then, there
                                               R. A. KNOWLES



had been this surge, which you expected to go back, but
in fact it didn't go back. What Mr. Payne is putting
to you is before then there was some sort of ordinary
swaying? - A. There was movement.
Yes.

       MR. PAYNE:    Let the witness answer.
       MR. KING:    Just bear with me:
Perhaps then I can take you back in your own words ....
     MR. PAYNE:  Let him say what happened. Ask him
what happened. Ask him what the sequence was.
     MR. KING:   Sir, I am obliged to my learned friend
for inviting me to ask the witness questions. He can
ask his own questions:
I want you, Mr. Knowles, to take us back from the
moment you go onto the terraces, go from that point. I
won't say a word, I am sure my learned friend won't say
a word and we will just listen to what you say. - A. We
came out of the tunnel. There was a fair pack of
people at the top of the terrace, so I suggested we
make our way to the front of the terrace, and to the
left, because there was a fence down the middle — you
could only go left. So I pushed the lads in front of
me, we forced our way down - it was tightly packed but
you could gain access. We got down to the front and
behind the goal and began to walk along the front
towards the left of the ground. There was a slight gap
at the bottom that you could walk straight along. You
weren't pushing past people moving up and down the
terrace, it was a pretty straight channel through. We
got as far as we could, we came upon a fence running
from the front to the back of the ground, and I took a
step onto the terrace, a step up, on a large spur of
the fence, standing holding the fence at the front.
As the match kicked off we were pushed, I was pushed,
towards the fence, behind the boys* Then it eased off
slightly and I took a step back towards the terrace. I
think somebody had a shot at goal, the ball went over,
the crowd moved forward again, and I couldn't move.
When I went to move back I couldn't move as far as I
had moved forward. It was at this time that further
along the terrace towards the goal people were looking
to get out over the fence, and at that time I just told
the boys to get over. As they were climbing the fence,
and I helped them over, as they moved out I was then
pushed against the fence and couldn't move.
                                                             70

                                             R. A. KNOWLES



Q. Thank you.

        THE CORONER:    That was my recollection of the
   account, not in answer to your questions but in answer
   to mine. Is that clear to you, Mr. Payne? Are you
   satisfied with that?
        MR. PAYNE:   Yes.

        THE CORONER:   I am going to rise before we go
   onto the rest - it means you have got to wait until
   after lunch and I don't want anybody to feel they are
   under pressure, but I just want to put one thing to
   you. Mr. King has put to you the difference between
   swaying and surging, but it is right, isn't it, in the
   statement which you put to the witness, I think I am
   right in saying that he uses the word "surge" to
   describe both events. That is right, isn't it, Mr.
   Knowles? Can you read it to him perhaps, just that
   bit. I am not trying to cause any problems but I think
   it is important that we don't make distinctions which
   don't actually have real differences.
        MR. KING:   I am very happy, sir, to re-read the
   paragraph without making any coouoent, just reading it
   through. Sir, I will read from the beginning of the
   sentence, "As the match kicked off          Sir, I
   appreciate you haven't got quite the same      wording.
        THE CORONER:   We can start where it     says, "hard
   against the fence" because that is all that we are
   concerned about.

        MR. KING:   "As the match kicked off, the crowd
   surged hard towards the pitch. I was forced up against
   the fence with the two boys in front of me. This was
   not unusual in a packed crowd and usually eases off
   after a few seconds, but after the first crush came a
   second surge, pushing everyone even harder against the
   fence."

        THE CORONER:   So it is right, isn't     it, Mr.
   Knowles, that you used - and this is no criticism - you
   used the word 'surge" in both instances, and you
   weren't saying "sway" in one and "surge" another, that
   is right, isn t it? - A. That is right.
Q. I am not criticising you.

        THE CORONER:   Right, I think we have to allow the
   Jury to have lunch, and we need to have a break as
   well. Are any of the Howards here? (No response) Or
   the Murrays? Yes, Mrs. Murray is here. There are two
   witnesses this afternoon and I would like to hear them

both if at all possible. I will shorten the lunch hour
and we will be back at 5-past-2. Can everybody manage
in three-quarters of an hour?

     MR. HALE:    It is very difficult, sir, when one
has an office to run as well, to manage it in such a
short time, but if that is for the majority I will come
in late if I may.
     THE COROHER:   By all means. We will be back with
this witness in the first instance. I understand your
difficulty but bearing in mind that we are bringing
people from great distances I feel that I have to take
that into account.

                        Cross-Examined by MR. CATCHPOLE:

    Q. Mr. Knowles, could I ask you to have a quick look again at
       C.258, the photograph of the perimeter gates.   Can I focus
B      briefly on the area inside those perimeter gates and your
       experiences there. We might have some photographs that
       may assist in pin-pointing the time you were there.   Can I
       just run over your evidence.  When you got inside those
       perimeter gates you described in your words as a free for
       all on the inside. Would you look at C.301.   You described
       going down to the line of Police Officers down by the gate
       you entered? - A. Yes.
    Q. That is taken from behind the line of Police Officers with the
       gate on the right.  I think you can just see beyond the Police
       Officers the crowd spilling out all around the whole area. -
       A . Yes .
    Q. Is that roughly what you can remember? You can see if you
       move round in front of these Police Officers that the crowd is
       everywhere? - A. Yes.

    Q. That is the sort of scene you saw? -         It looks a bit busier
       than I recall.

    Q. Can I take you back in time.  I think put that when you moved
       down at about 20-to-3, quarter-to-3. Can I go back in time to
       another photograph, which I know we have got an acetate of,
       MWL 10/25A.  All I am trying to do is contrast the scene you
       saw with this scene.

                 THE CORONER;   That will be numbered C.305.   It was MWL
            10/2SA.
    q   .        MR. CATCHPOLE:   The actual time on the photograph is
            14.31, but we know the proper time is 14.30, so it is a little
            bit before the time you are talking about.  I d o n ’t know
            whether you can see very well on that particular photograph.
            Do you see the bar on the outside of the turnstiles, the blue
            bar? - A. Yes.

    Q.      You can see people actually standing there.  There is no
            apparent anxiety to get in.  They are standing waiting, and
            you can see in the distance a Police Officer on a Police horse
            who is moving through.  That is not the scene that you saw, is
            it? - A. No.
    Q . So whatever happened, something turned that apparently quite
        orderly crowd into the free for all that you witnessed in a
        relatively short space of time? - A- Yes.

                          Cross-Examined bv MRS. McBRIEN:

    Q. Mr. Knowles, would you have minded if the game had been
       delayed whilst order was restored outside the turnstiles so
       that queues would have been formed and the safety of the fans

                                            R A . KNOWLES


    ,1/33 considered? - A. No, not at all, as long as the
     information is given over.   As long as you know what is
     happening, that is all you want, but there was no information.
     The first thing you want to do is to try to enter the ground
     to see the game.

Q. So you needed guidance and some orders being given out, some
   instructions? - A. That is right.  The Police are usually in
   control, and you expect any information to come from them, but
   there was none forthcoming that I knew of.

Q. Do you know that the tunnel you went down is a normal exit
   route from the terraces? It is for going in and for coming
   out? - A. And coming out. No, I would not have known that-

Q. You did not know you could come back out of there? - A. I
   would assume if I could find no other exits I would come out
   that way, but I don't recall seeing any signs saying that.

Q. No.  For instance, as you were going down the tunnel did you
   notice toilets on the right and left-hand side of the tuifnel?
   - A. No.

Q. I was going to say if you had gone down the tunnel and 3^ou
   went to the terraces and then you suddenly decided you panted
   to go back to the toilet, you would have expected there to be
   a reasonable way for you to go.  You would not be blocked, in
   other words? - A. No.

q   . Your access to that route would not have been blocked? - A.
      No.

Q. If there was, for instance, a bomb scare on the terraces or
   fire broke out even, which way would you have expected 'to get
   out of that area? - A. The only way out would have been the
   way in, I would have thought, having actually got on to the
   terrace and come up against the fence at the front and then
   the one at the side.    Ifthere had been anything to make me
   get out quick I would have gone out the same way if possible.

Q. That was the normal wide entry, in other words.  The other
   paths were gates, were not they? That was an opening where
   you could come back through.  You would expect exit routes at
   all times to be kept reasonably clear? - A. Yes.

Q . And you would expect somebody to be there preventing
    congestion occurring at that point? - A. I have seen stewards
    used in that way.

Q. On 15th April, 1989,     didyou see anybody looking out for that
   sort of danger? - A.     Notin that area, no.

Q.    Do you normally prefer to go to the centre pens when you go to
      a football match? - A. I prefer to sit down, normally, but I
      could not get a ticket for that particular game.

Q. Yes, it would be nice.     I know this is an opinion, but it
                                                      74
                                       R.A. KNOWLES


would be nice if they were all seater stadia, especially for
the big matches like the Semi-Final. I do agree with you in
that way. But if you had to stand would you prefer to go
behind the goal? - A. I think having grown up going to
football matches as a youngster, yes, you go behind the goal.
You like to see the goals going in. The atmosphere, the
camaraderie between the crowd is all behind the goals, so yes.
As you grow older you tend to move away from there.
So I take it it was a very popular spot for most people? - A.
Yes, especially for younger people.
If you had gone down the tunnel and you found it was very
full, a normal way of going down, you would naturally want to'
go back up the tunnel, would you not? - A . Yes.
     MRS. McBRIEN:  I think I have covered everything I
wanted to say. Thank you very much, Mr. Knowles.
              Cross-Examined bv MR. RUSSELL:
In describing the state of the crowd, first of all outside the
perimeter gates and then between the perimeter gates and the
turnstiles, you twice used the word ”frustrated", once to
describe the crowds outside the perimeter gates and once
before the turnstiles. Can you help us with the way in
which that frustration was made manifest? How did you
recognise that the crowd was frustrated? - A. They wanted to
get in to see the game, and talking to each other, asking,
"What's going on? Have you seen these gates are shut?”. As
you come next to somebody he will say to you, "Do you know
what's happening? Why are the gates shut? Are they trying
to keep us out?". In a crowd of people rumours start to go
round. I did hear somebody mention, "They've shut the^
gates. They don't want us to go in. It's full inside".
You are getting misinformation from different sources all
around the crowd.
And even though it was only a rumour, what you felt was that
the act of shutting the gates to keep the crowds away from the
turnstiles, for example, had angered the crowd to an extent
because they felt they were not going to get in? - A. They
were perhaps, not knowing what was going to happen, they
wanted to know why those gates were shut. I would not say
they were angry of considering knocking them or anything like
that.
Your prime concern, both outside and inside the ground, was
for the well being of the two boys you had in your charge that
day, your son and his friend? - A. Correct.
Can I please try and identify your state of mind at two
particular times. As I understand your evidence, you reached
your preferred place in enclosure 4 moments before the kick-
off? - A. Correct.
At that stage, as you confirmed to Mr. Manning, the state of
                                                                  75

                                                 R .A . KNOWLES


     'the terrace was not abnormal, and you were happy at that stage
      for the two boys to go forward and go up and on to the fence?
      - A. They were able to gain a position in which could see the
      pitch.

Q. I am concerned with your state of mind.  You were happy they
   should do that, and I think you encouraged them to do that at
   that stage? - A. Yes.

Q. And then following the kick-off, when you first gave your
   evidence, and again just before lunch, you mentioned there was
   a Liverpool shot? - A. No, it was at the Liverpool goal.

Q. A shot at the Liverpool goal? - A. Yes, at our end.

Q. Which caused the sort of excitement and surge that is common
   place on a terrace when there is a shot at goal, either
   attacking or defending? - A. Yes.

Q. And it was when that occurred, there having been previously a
   surge forwards and back, it was when that occurred that there
   was a surge which did not move back? - A. Yes, round about
   that time.

Q.     Round about that time, and that is when    your state of mind
      changed from one of satisfaction to one     of concern for your
      charges, the two boys? - A . Right.

Q.     You yourselfwere not in discomfort until somewhat later? - A.
      That is right.
                        Further bv THE CORONER:

Q. I just want to ask you one question which Mrs. McBrien
   reminded me of, and that is, when you were outside the
   turnstiles can you recollect either seeing or hearing anybody
   making announcements over loudspeakers? - A. I did see
   somebody with a megaphone, yes.

Q. With a megaphone.  What did that person say? Can you remind
   me? - A. I was nearer, the picture we had before, I was nearer
   the Police.  He was the other side of me.

Q. Facing away from you.      In other words, out towards the crowd?
   - A . Ye s.

Q.    You did not see a Land Rover by any chance? - A. No.

Q.    In any case, whether you did or did not, you never heard         any
      announcements at all? - A. No.

Q. About kick-off or anything else for that matter? - A. No.

Q. You are Matthew Colin Gould? - A. Yes.
Q. What is your present address because I have got the
   address of the Polytechnic which I do not suppose is
   still the same? - A. No, I am in a house now.
           give me the address? - A.
           Sheffield.
Q. In 1989 you were a student at the Sheffield
   Polytechnic. Are you still there or have you
   finished? - A. No, I am in my third year.
Q. Your main team is Wolverhampton Wanderers? - A. Yes.

Q. But you also follow Liverpool, is that right? - A.
   Yes.
Q. On the 15th April 1989 you thought you would go and
   see the match? - A. Yes.
Q. Because you were inSheffield and you went     with a
   friend I think? - A. I did.
Q. It is right that neither of you had a ticket? - A.
   No, we didn’t.
Q. You both knew it was an all ticket affair? - A. Yes.

Q. Experience had taught you that ticket touts plied
   their trade and you thought you might be able to get
   one, is that right? - A. Yes.
Q. You would have preferred a ticket for Leppings Lane
   but you were prepared to compromise? - A. Yes, we
   would have gone anywhere.
Q. You and youJp friend   set off   at about12.30from  home.
   You went by bus and you got off nearMiddlewood Road
   at about 1.15? - A. Yes.
Q. Somewhere in Middlewood Road, is that .right? - A.
   Yes.
Q. You then walked down towards Catch Bar lane
   crossroads? - A. Yes.

This was around 1.15 and it took you ten or fifteen
minutes to get to Leppings Lane, is that right? - A.
Yes.
So we are at about 1.30. As you were walking down
did you see any other Liverpool supporters? “ A.
There were a few about. Not as many as I originally
thought but there were some about.
Were these drinking from any containers of any
sort? - A. Yes, they were.
What were they drinking from? ~ A. Cans and bottles,
anything really.
Most or just some? - A. There were a few. Quite a
lot were but again not as many as I would have
thought.
It is only fair to say that although they were
drinking from these cans as far as you could judge
they were perfectly well behaved? - A. Yes.
They were boisterous, shouting and chanting, is that
right or not? - A. Not too much at that stage. There
were no signs of anybody being drunk.
You got down then at 1.30 to the ground, is that
right? - A. Yes.
 When you got to the ground at that point, 1.30 we are
“talking about, what did the turnstile area look like?
 - A . It was fairly empty. There were a few people
 standing around but no queues or anything.

No queues? - A. No.
Was this because there were not enough people to form
queues or because there were not any? - A. They
weren't enough people to really warrant making a
queue.
So in fact it was not that there was a huge crowd
there? - A. No.
It was just that there were too few people to
necessitate a queue is what you are saying? - A. Yes.

You are sure about that? - A. Yes.

Q. And there were not any queues at that time? - A. No.

Q. You are sure? - A. I think so, yes.

Q. You stayed around there for some time hoping to find
   some tickets but the problem was that they were all
   too expensive, was it not? - A. Yes, and there
   w er e n 't many touts about.

Q. You had fixed a     limit beyond   which you were not going
   to go cash-wise     so to speak? - A. Yes.

Q. After a while you got fed up     with this and you set
   off towards the   other end, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. How did you get out from there? - A. We followed the
   lane round towards the roundabout.

Q. You were walking away from the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. Were fans coming towards you? - A. Yes, they were.

Q. Were these Liverpool fans? - A. Yes.

Q. What were they doing? - A. Again some were drinking,
   just generally walking up to the turnstile area.

Q. Exactly the same.    They were not abusive? - A. No.

Q. You were not too concerned? - A. No.

Q. But you did see some who were drinking out of cans? -
   A. Y e s .

Q. Were they carrying one, two, three four cans? How
   many cans did they have? When I say "they" obviously
   it was not all of them but what did you see? - A.
   Either carrying full cans or what was left of four
   cans and some had like two litre bottles.

Q. Again what sort of proportion? - A. 50/50 perhaps.

Q. You got to the roundabout and turned right down
   Penistone Road which is taking you towards Nottingham
   Forest? - A. Yes.

Q. We do not need to spend too much time on that because
   you did not take any tickets there either? - A. No.

Q. Having wandered around a bit longer you came back
   towards Leppings Lane, is that right? - A. Yes.
Q. In fact you went down the back and you saw the teams
   arrive? - A. Yes.
0. That was interesting I suppose. You were quite
   pleased and I assume you saw that? - A. Yes, we were
   right by the coach as it pulled up.
Q. When that was over what time was that about? - A. I
   cannot remember. I have read through my statement^
   and it reminded me of the time which I know is right,
   about two o'clock I should think.
     THE CORONER:   Ladies and gentlemen, as is normal
procedure after eighteen months we allow the witnesses to
refresh their memory. In fact, we do it in the building
because it is impossible to expect them to remember. It is
generally done and I am sure it is quite proper.
0. So you came back then and did you get back into the
   Catch Bar Lane area? - A. We followed it round and
   done a circle of the ground. I don't know what the
   lane is called but we followed one of the back
   streets up and ended up round by Leppings Lane.
Q. Please say that again? - A. We ended up at a sort of
   flower garden surrounded by a brick wall at traffic
   crossroads by the top of Leppings Lane.

Q. At the top of Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.
Q. Can we put the street plan up? We will show you this
   plan and can you point to the junction of Leppings
   Lane and Catch Bar Lane? - A. Yes, that is the one.

 Q. That is it, is it? - A. Yes.
 0. At that point about what time are we talking about?
    If you can help me so much the better. If you cannot
    help please say so. It was obviously after two
    o'clock because you say in your statement that is
    when these players arrived? - A. Yes.
 Q. Can you say about how much later? - A- Quarter past,
    twenty past.

Q. What was the position like then with regard to
   supporters? - A. There were a few more coming down.
   They were streaming down.
Q. Can you find it on the map? - A. I would think it
   would be Rockley or Carlton Road perhaps. So they
   would be going straight over to the crossroads and
   straight down Leppings Lane.
Q. In fact, there are other roads which lead down to
   there? - A. Yes.
Q. That is from where? - A. From that area.

Q. Towards you? -A. Yes,
Q. What were they   like? -   A. They   werea lotmoreloud,
   vociferous, chanting the standard stands. Again they
   were carrying alcohol but they weren't drunk as such.

Q. The same sort of proportions as earlier and in the
   same quantities or different? - A. The same sort of
   quantities I would say but perhaps a few more just
   because of the age range of them all I would think.

Q. Do you think there was a difference in age range? -
   A. I would think the ones coming in at this time were
   more my age, 20-25.
Q. Younger peoplein other words? - A.   Yes.
Q. When you say they     were not drunk - when Isaytoyou
   what you mean by the word drunk - when is a person
   drunk in your eyes? - A. When they are obviously out
   of control and can't walk properly.
Q. Because there are obviously gradations? - A. Yes.

Q. Then you continued. Did you continue down towards
   the ground? - A. We stayed in the flower garden for
   ten or fifteen minutes.

Q. I think I am right in saying that you were actually
   approached in that people wanted to get tickets off
   you? - A. Yes.
Q. Which was ironic because you could not help them? -
   A. No.

Q. Can you recollect how many times approximately that
   happened to you personally would you say? - A. Three,
   four or five.
Q. Not all that many? - A. No.
Q. What did you decide to do then? - A. We went down to
   have another look at the turnstile area.
Q. Which ones, Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.
Q. What happened then? - A. Again we tried to get
   tickets but it was no good and so again we decided to
   leave that area and retrace our footsteps back down
   one of the side roads to go back towards the
   Nottingham Forest end.
Q. Did you make it to the Nottingham Forest end? - A.
   Yes.
Q. Did you get any tickets there? - A. No, we did see
   some signs of some but we had missed out on them.

Q. What did you do after that? - A. We went back up.

Q. You circled the ground again for the second time? -
   A. No, we went back the way we had come.

Q. And then what? - A. And then went back to the
   Leppings Lane end.
Q. What time did you now arrive at the Leppings Lane
   end? - A. I would think about a quarter to three.

Q. What was it like then? - A.. There were lots of
   people. The whole of the concreted area was full of
   people and there were some people climbing over
   turnstiles but there was not a great deal of worry at
   that time.

Q. Not a great deal of worry, did you say? - A. No.

Q. Did you see any Police Officers at that stage? - A.
   There were some about with the megaphone and also I
   was standing next to somebody who was a Police
   cameraman taking pictures of the whole situation.
Q. When you say a megaphone, do you mean a hand-held
   job? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you recollect by any chance what was being
   said? - A. He was trying to assure people, to keep
   calm.
Q. Did you see a Land Rover as a matter of interest? -
   A.' No. .
Q. You did not hear loudspeaker announcements over a
   Land Rover. If you did not see the Land Rover you
   could not have done. Apart from the megaphone did
   you hear any other announcements? - A. Not that I
   remember.
Q. You were then positioned on the roadway somewhere, is
   that right? - A. By the bridge.
Q. Looking towards? - A. Towards the concreted area.

Q. You had no ticket, of course? - A. No.
Q. You could seeother people and so presumably you
   thought there was no hope? - A. Yes.
Q. Could you from your position see the perimeter gates,
   the blue perimeter gates? Do you know which I am
   talking about? - A. Yes, I could.
Q . Do you want me to show you a picture to remind you of
    what they look like? - A. Yes.
Q. C.254 please. Were those the perimeter gates you
   could see or were they the other ones? - A. The
   railing gates.
Q. Those were the ones you could see? - A. And the area
   around them was full of people.

Q. This side? - A. Yes.
Q. Could you see whether there were people on the far
   side as well? - A. There weren't many at all, no.

Q. Were these gates open or shut? - A. They were shut.
Q. How were theybeing secured, if that is the right
   word, so far as you could see? If you could not see
   please say, "I did not see" because I do not want you
   to guess? - A. Some were open. It was more the
   middle ones of the railing gates that were shut and

  the ones on the outside were open and there were
  stewards on the posts of the open ones.
Q. When you say stewards, how were they dressed? - A. I
   couldn't see if they were Police or just ground
   stewards but they had the fluorescent tops on.
Q. They were people with fluorescent tops? - A. Yes.
Q. How many would you say there were? - A. Just one on
   each post. About four or five at the most.

Q. As many       as that? - A. Yes.
Q. You aresure of that? - A. Yes, butthey were dotted
   along all the way.

Q. Along the front there? - A. Yes.
Q. Inside or outside? Behind the gates or in front of
   them? - A. They were standingnext to the posts and
   so they were in the gateway.
Q. If I have understood you correctly you were saying
   that the middle gate was shut? - A. Yes.
             d                                          9

Q . The end gates, so far as you remember, were open, is
    that right? - A. Yes.
Q. Your recollection is that there were stewards. The
   reason why I ask is that we cannot find stewards in
   the other evidence at the moment. We may have found
   one or two perhaps but you said five and I want to be
   quite sure you did definitely see five people with
   yellow bibs? - A. I saw one on the post and one on
   the post next to it and so I presumed there would be
   one on every post.
Q. That is what I wanted you to avoid. I do not want
   you to presume? - A. But at the time I presumed that.
Q. Just tell me how many you actually saw with your own
   eyes? - A. Two.
Q. That was your assumption at the time?   A. Yes.
Q. We are trying to piece the picture together, you see?
   - A. Yes.
                                                   M. C. GOULD



Q. Whilst you were out there looking in, so to speak,
   you were an observer? - A. Yes.
Q. What washappening to the crowd on this side of the
   gates? - A. They were trying to get through to the
   other side of them, pushing.
Q. How could you tell that? What gave you that
   impression? - A. The way that they were trying to
   push through the gates that were open and to try and
   open the gates that were shut.
Q. How were they trying to open the gates that were
   shut? - A. Either by physically opening them or by
   asking or shouting at other people to open the m .

Q. Could you hear that with your own ears? - A. I could
   not hear the words but you could guess what they were
   saying by their gestures.
Q. Could you see whether the gate was moving? I do not
   mean opening but moving backwards and forwards? - A.
   No, I couldn't.
Q. You could not see that? - A. No.
Q. So you are making a bit of an assumption there, that
   they were trying to open that gate? - A. I mean, I
   wouldn't have thought it was an assumption. If
   people are trying to get through then they would need
   to open the gate.
Q. Okay. I am not trying to catch you out but I am just
   trying to make sure we get it as accurately as we
   can? ~ A. Yes.
Q. While this was going on you noticed I think a big
   concertina gate? - A. Yes.
Q. Which is actually on the plan behind. Turn round and
   look. Is that right? - A. Yes.    I could see it
   through the trees because I was standing further
   away.
Q. I think you noticed that it opened? - A. Yes.

Q. It opened slightly? - A. Yes.
Q. Did anybody get through at that point? - A. Only
   twenty or.^so at the moment.

Q. A small number? - A. Yes.
Q. Then it was shut? - A. Yes.
Q. Then did you notice a c o n c e r t i n a gate again? - A. Not
   at that time, no.
Q. Tell me your story then? ~ A. We saw the gates open
   and then it was shut. So the two of us decided to go
   further forward into the crowd and if, by chance, it
   would open then we could get through the gate. Once
   we had got in and reached the railings and were
   standing in the vicinity of the railings we saw it
   open once more.
Q. Did you get through it that time? - A. No.
Q. This time how wide did it open, would you say? - A. I
   think it opened fully.
Q. How many people got through? I am not asking you to
   tell me in precise detail but how many people got
   through that time? - A. A lot more than before but
   that was mainly because it was open for longer.
Q. How long was it open for? - A. About a minute.

Q. Then it was shut again? - A. Yes.
Q. Did you notice whether any Police horse went in front
   of the gate at that point when it was being shut? -
   A. In front of the concertina gate?
Q. Yes. - A. There wasn't a Police horse there.          There
   was one behind me by the railing gates.
Q. How was it shut that gate? Did you see who shut
   it? - A. I didn't see who shut it.
Q. So you thought you had missed your chance? ~ A. Yes.

Q. Tell me what happened then? What did you see or
   do? - A. The rest of the railing gates where we were
   were then opened.
Q. By whom? - A. I didn't see that. So we followed
   through although it wasn’t very rushed and we went
   and stood by the fence, by the river, for a while.

0. Opposite this concertina gate? - A. Yes, and we stood
   there for a couple of minutes. While we were
   standing there the gates opened again, this time for
   even longer, and we decided to walk through it.
0. Stop there for a minute. You are now in the ground
   but I want you to stay outside for a moment. - A.
   Yes.

Q   Did you see any Police horses at all during this
    period? ~ A. There was one standing by me before it
    got through the railing gates, telling people to keep
    calm and not to worry.
Q. Did you see any others? I think there was an
   altercation which you saw? - A. There was, yes.

0. Tell me where you were and what you saw? " A * Again
   it was right behind me before the gates had been
   opened, the railing gates. I couldn't say what it
   was about but obviously the fans were upset that the
   Police were saying, "Don't worry” because they
   obviously were worried. The verbal abuse carried on
   and I definitely saw one fan strike out at the
   Policeman on the horse and the Policeman....

      MR. RUSSELL:   I am sorry but X did not hear that.
      THE CORONER:   "I definitely saw one fan strike out
 against the Policeman and the horse .
 Q. That is right, is it not? - A. Yes. ^1 didn't see the
    Policeman draw his truncheon but he then used it
    against the fans that were clamouring at him and the
    violence then stopped. The physical violence then
    stopped but the shouting carried on.

                                M. C. GOULD


Around this time you also saw, I think, one or two
fans who appeared to you to be a little bit
distressed, is that right? - A. It was when Ihad got
through and was standing by the fence by the river
that there were three people standing there that were
distressed.

Did you speak to them at all? - A.       Not   really, no. I
sort of heard their conversations.

What were they complaining about that you can
recollect, or can you not remember it? - A. Just the
fact that the young child was slightly grazed and
injured, and one of the women was saying things like,
"Somebody is going to die outside".

That was her impression? - A.     Yes.

At least that is what you heard her say?- A.        Yes.

Because you do not know whether that is true or not,
but that is what you heard her say? - A.  Yes.   I
looked at my friend and we sort of agreed with her,
looking back at the mass of people.
You, in fact, were in a relatively safe area, weren't
you? - A. Yes, there were very few people where we
were.

If you look at the photograph, can you see the railing
fence? Can you see where the railing fence is? That
one there, yes, and the wall on the other side there.
Was that the area? - A. No.
Where was the mass? - A. It was further over to the
right. It is not actually on the picture. It is
there.

Where all the people were? - A.    Where we were
standing.

No, I am asking you where the mass of the people was?
- A. The mass of the people was the other side of the
outer gates.

I see, this side? - A.   Yes.
You were not, if I can put it this way, that impressed
with the problems outside the turnstile, is that
right, immediately outside the turnstiles? - A. Where
you have just pointed to?

Yes. - A. No, I wasn't really that bothered about
the people there.

    Q.   You were more concerned about the pe o p l e   • A.   The
         other side.

B   Q.   The other side of the railing gate, towards the road?
         - A. Yes.

    Q.   Anyway you managed to get in? - A, Yes.

    Q.   We will draw a veil over that for the time being.
         Having got in, quite a lot of other people were
         getting in as well? - A. Yes.

    Q.   The interesting thing is that I think all these people
         were behaving perfectly properly? - A. Yes.

    Q.   They were not rushing, they were walking quite
         normally? - A. Because there were very few people
         really going in, there wasn't any need to run or to
         push or anything.

         Is that because the area they were entering was much
         larger and so they were dissipating, or is it because
         there were very few people? - A. Because there were
         fewer people.

    Q.   Are you sure about that?         Yes.
    Q.   What about all these people outside whom you have
         mentioned, what was happening to them? - A. They were
         trying to get in. They were obviously pushing,
E        getting more frantic.

    Q.   Yes, hang on. Were they trying to get in through this
         concertina gate which was now open through which you
         had entered? - A. I imagine so at the time because it
         was a bigger areafor them to go through.

    Q.   Are you saying that when you went through in your
         little group there wasn’t that many? - A. Yes.

    Q.   But when you went in there were still a lot of people,
         you say, this side? - A. There were thousands left
         outside.

    Q.   I think you then went down the tunnel, is that right?
         - A. Yes.

    Q.   Is that because you had been there before, or what? -
         A. I had been there before and that was the tunnel I
         went down before, but at the time it was the one that
         was directly in front of us, the only one we saw.
    Q.   What time would that be in your estimation? - A.
         About 5-to 3.

Q.   We know what time the gates were open, most of the
      times anyway, but 5-to 3 you would say? - A. Yes.
Q.   You went down the tunnel: that was clear, blocked, or
     what? - A. It was full of people, but they were all
     walking with quite a bit of space.
Q. So no problem in the tunnel as far as you were
    concerned? — A. No.
Q.   Were you able to exit from the tunnel, or did you hit
     a blank wall of people? - A. We hit a wall of people
     at the end of the tunnel, but I had no reason to want
     to leave and go back.
Q. You were not concerned about that? - A.      No.
Q. You turned, I think, into the right-hand pen,is that
    right? - A. Yes.

Q. We have called that pen 3. - A.     Yes.
Q. Your friend was with you at that time, I believe? - A.
    Yes.

Q.   When you first exited, you said there was a wall of
     people, so presumably you had to push your way through
     them to get out, is that right or not? - A. To get
     into the stand?
Q. Yes. Well, terrace. You had better use the word
    "terrace". A stand is where you sit, and a terrace is
    where you stand. Anyway, the terrace. - A. It was
    a point of pushing to get in there, but we were being
    pushed as well so, in effect, I suppose we were
    pushing but not really barging.
Q. What happened then? Just tell me. - A. We carried
    on more or less straight down the left-hand side of
    pen 3.
Q. Did you notice that there was a barrier there, a
    radial fence rather? - A. Yes.
Q.   You noticed that, did you? - A.   Separating pens 3 and
     4?
Q. Yes. - A.   Yes.

Q. Was it along that that you went? - A. We followed
    that down, and we went about two-thirds of the way
    down and started to move a bit to the right.
                                                             90

    Q.    Stop one second. Can you remember whether the players
          were on the pitch at that time? — A. I think they
          could have been warming up, but they had not started
          playing.
B
    Q.    They had definitely not started playing at that point?
          - A. No,

    Q.    So you got half-way down and moved slightly to the
          right. Tell me now more. - A. I think it was about
          that time that the match started, and with the extra
          surge of people we again carried on moving further to
          the right.

    Q.    You are saying that at that point your movement became
          more involuntary, is that what you are saying? - A.
          It was generally involuntary all the way down, but we
          wanted to go where we were being pushed, so we weren't
          too concerned.

    Q.    It suited you, yes. - A. But we weren't really in
          control of ourselves, but I wasn't too worried at the
D         time.

    Q.    That, in fact, was my next question: at that point in
          time - and I think you have said the match had just
          started? - A. Yes.
    Q.    Were you concerned for yourself at that point in time?
          - A. Not at that time, no.
    Q. So carry on then with your story, please? - A.    We
        carried on going over to the right until we were more
        or less directly in front of the exit gate, and then
        we wanted to more or less stand still and watch the
        game. It was difficult to stand still but I would say
        that at that time it was the first time we were
        actually motionless.
    Q.    That was more or less opposite the exit gate? - A.
          Yes.
     Q. And how far back? Do you want me to put a plan   up for
         you so that you can see? - A. If you could.
     Q.   We will put the acetate up. Can you orientate
          yourself on that? — A. Could you just explain what
           the dotted line is?
     Q.   The dotted line is the barrier which broke. - A.     Yes.

     Q. There is the gate. - A. I would say about 6 lines
         back, perhaps a bit further.

                                       M. C, GOULD


    Q.    Can you go over there and just mark it for me. That
          is C306. I am interested in your movement m the pen.
          I appreciate that you were moving forward because you
          have explained it to me, but was this movement a
B         continuous forward movement,       was there a movement
          backward and forward, with an overall forward
          progression? - A. I wouldn't say we were at all
          pushed backwards. We were moving forwards at
          different rates, but we w e r e never pushed backwards.

    Q.    I was not meaning that you were actually pushed back,
          but what I meant was were you able to actually move
          back at any point? - A. I couldn't move my feet back.
          I could perhaps lean backwards, but there was no way I
          could have moved my feet backwards.
    Q.    So once you had taken a step down, so to speak, that
          was it? ~ A. Yes.
    Q.     You might be able to get your trunk a little bit back
          but you could not get your feet, that is fine. When
          you were in that position, tell me what you saw and
D         did and what people were doing around you? - A. I was
          still in contact with my friend at this time. There
          were people who were obviously quite upset, especial y
          there were two people in front of us who we tried to
          help. There were a lot of people who were upset.

    Q.    Take your time and have a drink, - A .   Yes.
    Q.I will help you a    little bit, okay? Two of the people
        who were in front of you were what looked to you like
         a father and a son, is that right? * A. Yes.
     Q.   Did you deduce that because they had similar looks? -
          A, They looked similar.

     Q.    And they wore the same sort of glasses? - A.   Yes.

     Q.    They were, I think you said, metal-framed glasses?
           A. Yes.

     Q.    What I want to know, because I think it is worth
           hearing, the lad was having real difficulties, wasn t
           he? - A. Yes.

     Q.    And he was slipping down, that is right, is it? - A.
           Yes.                              •

     Q.    And dad was saying things. Can you remember what dad_
           was doing and saying? - A. He was just shouting out 1
           people could try and help him and actually open the
           gates onto the field. He had r e a l l y a high-pitched,
           anxious voice, just wanting people to help him.

He was doing his best for the boy, wasn't he? - A.
Yes, because being taller, and your body was swaying
backwards and forwards, we could more or less stand
upright, but obviously being smaller you haven't got
as much chance.
You are talking about the little lad now, are you not?
— A., ' Yea.
Were people shouting to move back as well at that
point? - A. Well, I bent down to try and pull the lad
off the floor, but I couldn't reach him and came back
up, and at that time I looked round and noticed that I
was by the barrier and there were people buckled over
the barrier, pushed, just couldn't move, and they were
asking to try and push people back off them.
Did you try and do that? - A.   I tried, yes.
What did yoxi do? You turned round and were pushing up
against the crowd? - A. Pushing against the people on
the barrier.
So the people on the barrier were on what was to you
the far side of the barrier, is that right? — A. Yes.

Not this side of the barrier? - A.     Their legs were
the far side of the barrier.
But their bodies had come over? - A.    Yes.
You were not pushing the barrier, you were trying to
push the people? - A. Trying to push them upwards and
backwards, yes.
Were people shouting? What else was being said at
that point in time? - A. It was general hysteria. I
can't think of anything in particular, but the general
view was that people needed help and needed to get
out.
The match was being played at this point? - A.     Yes.

Definitely being played? - A.   Yes.
Do you remember Beardsley hitting the crossbar at all?
~ A. I didn't see it. I read about it and I felt the
massive surge, which I presume was When it happened.

Tell me about this massive surge because we have not
got to that yet? - A. I had turned round from helping
push these people back and again I tried to pick the
lad off the floor, and the surge just pushed me
forwards over the boy, and so I pushed myself to the
                             M. C. GOULD


side so I wouldn't stand on him, and from then on I
was much closer to the gate and on the way out.
So are you saying then that at that point, shortly
before you managed to get out, there was an increase
in pressure which you perceived as a surge? - A. Yes.
You are not quite sure when it was but you think it
might have been then, but you do not know? - A. I
think it was when the shot was hit.
Did you hear cheers and chants at that time as well?
It is very difficult. - ? - A. Not a chant as such,
but cheers, you know, just the sort that people cheer
when a goal is scored.
In fact, at one point you   were quite squashed
yourself, were you not? - A. Yes.
Did you try and shout out at that time? - A.      I tried
to but it was physically impossible.
When was that? Where were you? Was it after this big
surge or before? - A. I think it was before.
So when you were still at that position where you were
near the lad and his dad? - A. Yes.
Then you were carried past them, in effect? - A.      Yes.
I think you did say that you actually   stepped to one
side? - A. Yes.
To avoid him? - A.   To avoid standing on him.
Did you see the gate being opened at all, thegate in
your pen? - A. I saw the    gate being opened, but I
didn't see who opened it.
When did you notice the gate being opened, at what
point, where were you? - A. When I had been pushed
past the boy and standing directly in front of it, 2
or 3 metres back.
He was behind you and you were near the gate, further
forward? - A. Yes.
And you saw it being opened? - A.   Yes.
Did you actually see it being opened,or did you see
it open? There is a difference. - A. I saw it from
when it was like half-open being pulled the full way
back.
                            M. C. GOULD


Just very briefly, how did you get out? - A. I waited
for the people in front of me to go and just gradually
inched my way towards the gate. It was quite orderly
really.
By then you were able to move under your own steam, so
to speak, towards the gate? - A. Yes.
Do you know about what time you got out? Have you any
idea? - A. I don't know the time, but the players were
still playing.
They were still playing? - A.     Yes.

You are sure? - A.   Yes.
Between that big surge which you have described, do
you remember, and the time you got out, how much time
would you estimate in seconds, or minutes if you
prefer it? - A. About a minute.
When dad and these other people    were shouting, "Open
the gates" and so on, how close    to you were they in
relation to that position which    you have marked on
that plan? - A. How close were     the gates or the
people?
The people who were shouting, "Open the gates ? - A.
Well, the father was directly in front of me.

So he was really close to you? - A.      Yes.
So if I said to you mark his position, you would put
the cross immediately adjacent to yours? - A.
Immediately in front of me, yes.
           Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING

Insofar as you are the first witness that we have
heard that was at the scene outside on a number of
different occasions, I would like you, please, to help
so far as you can in commenting on what some other
people have said, and you can tell us whether that
fits within your own recollection. Can you help us
about the scene when you decided to go forward. You
had been on the bridge, I think, hadn't you? - A.
Yes.
 Was that about 2.45 time? - A.    Yes, it would have
 been then.
 Do you remember seeing large groups of people
 coming down either Leppings Lane or across the bridge
 where you were? - A. Yes, there were people coming
                               M. C. GOULD


down. I would not necessarily say they were large
groups, but there was a steady stream of people.




                         /Q.    A lady who was on
                                                             96


                                               M. C. GOULD



   o      W^° Was on Middlewood Road said that at about
   2.45 she saw several groups, perhaps 100 or so, going
   down the road, and described them as, "Never having
   seen so many in drink as I saw that day". - A, Is that
   100 groups or 100 people?

Q. 100 people. - A. 100 people, I would say that that was
   probably a fair number, yes, but I wouldn't have said
   anybody as seen then was, in my definition, drunk.

Q. No, your definition of drunk, I will just look back at
   it if I may to make sure I get your exact words, "Drunk
   means out of control, can't walk properly"? - A, Yes.
Q. I am going to look at another witness who I think used
   the words, the glow of drink", perhaps a lesser degree
   of drunkenness. Is that perhaps a definition or a
   description which is nearer to what you think? - A. I
   would think so, yes.

Q. Then another witness also at 2.45 time, "There were
   lots in this running group, hundreds. They were drunk,
   very boisterous and swearing". - A. I didn’t see
   anybody running. Obviously there would be swearing and
   people would be boisterous, but nothing really
   untoward.

Q* You don't think there was anything untoward but this
   morning we heard from a security officer who was at the
   other side of the perimeter gates, the blue gates. - A.

Q. And he was trying to keep those gates closed, and you
   have told us that your impression was that people were
   trying to push the gates open? - A. Yes.
Q. He used the word "scared" to describe how he felt at
   the other side of the gates. - A. Scared of?

             what was haPPening presumably. - A. I would
   think if he was standing there watching then he would
   be scared, yes, because if the gates are shut and more
   and more people are coming and wanting to get through
   then obviously people would get hurt.
Q. You are a person who is used to going to football
   matches? - A. Yes.

Q. You could see that not only was there a large number of
   people who were the turnstile side of the perimeter
   gate, but numbers of people who were the other side,
   the outside of the perimeter gate, and there were still
   ?   these people coming down Leppings Lane and over the
   bridge? - A. Yes.
                                            M. C. GOULD



Did it not surprise you, as a person who was used to
going to football matches, how apparently late these
people were turning up for a serai-final? - A. It
surprised me that they were late and it obviously was
surprising that we had been told that the match was
still kicking off at 3 o'clock*

You had not heard anything saying that the match was
being delayed, but you had heard a Police Officer
saying, "Don't push, you will all get in"? - A. Yes,
which is why people were getting angry at it.
So when a lady who lives in Leppings Lane used these
words, "There were larger numbers of people coming
later than you would expect. By 2.45 people were still
flocking in ', that is entirely your recollection of it?
- A. Yes.

In fact, I made a one line note of my own cross-
examination - a bit difficult sometimes to write when
you are standing up at the same time, even with these
wonderful lecterns - but this was the note I made of
that particular lady, her overall comment, "More late,
more intimidation, more cans and bottles and more
drunk". What do you feel about that? - A. More than
what? More than usual?
Yes. - A. Well, having never been to a semi-final
before I don't know about that. I mean, she would
obviously have experienced it more, but I wouldn't have
said anybody was more drunk or more late necessarily.
When you talked about the people - you, of course,
separated them and suggested that the second group, the
one that caused you more concern, those were younger
people who were perhaps carrying more alcohol? - A. I
wouldn't say they were causing me more concern, no.
What about the people who were climbing over the
turnstiles? What can you tell us about them? - A. They
were in the main youngish, 15, I would say were the
youngest, to 30-ish. It is something I wouldn't have
done because of the height of them, and the danger.
How many people were attempting this? - A. There were
about ten on at any one time, a steady stream of them,
so I would think about 30 at the most.   ■
Then you said, describing the people at the turnstiles,
"They were obviously pushing, trying to get in"? - A.
Yes.

Why was it obvious that they should be pushing? Would
it not be more obvious to stand still because pushing
                                               M. C. GOULD



they were just jockeying each other out of the way? -
A. The time was getting much closer to kick-off time
and although it might be obvious to stand still and be
more orderly, you don't see things like that in that
situation.

What seems like a long time ago, the learned Coroner in
his last words to a particular witness said, "If there
was a brick wall there and you knew the brick wall
wasn't going to move, would you continue pushing
towards it"? - A.   Idon't knowwhether they were
pushing towards the brick wall as opposed to the
entrances.

But you   can see now the lack of sense of pushing
towards   the entrance? All it was doing was potentially
slowing   down the flow of people who could have got
through   the entrance? - A. Yes.

     MR. RUSSELL:    I think he nodded, but I didn't
hear any answer.Was there an    audible answer to that
question?

     THE CORONER:      I think he nodded:
Can you give a reply? - A. Can you repeat the question
once more?

     THE CORONER:      Shorthand writer, did you get it?
     MR. RUSSELL:    Perhaps the shorthand writer could
read out the question. I think the answer was
affirmative but I don't know whether the shorthand
writer would have taken a note of it.

     THE CORONER:      Just read the question, then he can
answer it.

     THE SHORTHAND WRITER:   "But can you see now the
lack of sense of pushing towards the entrance? All it
was doing was potentially slowing down the flow of
people who could have got through the entrance", and I
have got an answer, "Yes".
     THE CORONER:      Yes? - A. Yes.
     MR. MANNING:   Your impression of boisterous, of
chanting the usual songs, could have been interpreted
by a member of the general public as an atmosphere
which was not of good humour, do you accept that? - A.
I would feel that somebody not used to football could
be intimidated by it, yes.

Thank you very much,     I have no other questions.

        THE CORONER:   Mr. King, please allow me for one
   minute. I think it is highly unlikely we will get to
   the next witness, though it is just possible we would
   be able to begin. Whether we begin or not, it is
   certain that you will have to come back tomorrow, so it
   is up to you, you can either leave us and be here first
   thing in the morning, or you can stay and we might
   start, but I think it is unlikely that we will start
   with you today. It is probably more sensible to do it
   in one, unless I am totally wrong with my timings
   again, and I have managed to be wrong almost from Day 1
   continuously. So long as you are here in the morning
   because we do need you as a witness. Yes, Mr. King.
                   Cross-Examined by MR. KING
Q. Mr. Gould, in fact I don't have that many questions,
   you will be pleased to know. I just want to get your
   impression. You said that you were surprised that the
   match was still going to kick off. Do I understand
   from that answer you are saying to the Inquest and to
   the Jury that you were surprised that the kick off
   wasn't being postponed beyond 3 o'clock? - A. Yes.
Q. Why did you think in your own mind that the kick off
   perhaps ought to be postponed after 3 o'clock? -* A.
   Because of the number of people still waiting to get
   in.

Q. Do I understand from that, that it was obvious to you
   from the number of people outside trying to get in the
   ground at Leppings Lane end, that they weren t going to
   be able to get in, in time for the kick off? - A. Yes.
Q. When   you got to Leppings Lane at about quarter-to-3,
   that   is before you took your position up on the bridge,
   were   you able then to see the perimeter gates, those
   blue   gates? - A. Before I got to the bridge?
Q. Yes. - A. No.

Q. When you were on your vantage point looking down, and I
   think you thought you saw stewards and so forth, you
   say the middle gates were shut but the end gates were
   open, is that right? - A. Yes.
Q. So were people still going through the end gates? - A.
   There were some going through, yes. Not many, I mean
   considering the number of people that were there, there
   were few actually going through the open gates.
Q. The position then was that you were able to go through
   the concertina gate eventually? - A. Eventually, yes.
                                                               100


                                                 M. C. GOULD



Q. How many times on your recollection did the concertina
   gate open before you went through it? How many
   different times? - A. I went through on the third time.
Q. Right, and on your third time, on your evidence, there
   were still thousands outside? - A. Yes.
Q. So with still thousands outside you then go through the
   tunnel and arrive at the back of the terrace? - A. Yes.
Q. I was interested in what you were saying to the Coroner
   about how you made your way down. You said, "We
   weren't in control of ourselves", that was your
   expression? - A. Yes.

Q*    This   is before the surge, this is while you are    making
     your way down. Could you explain what you mean by
     that? How it was you weren't in control of yourself? -
     A. Well, we wanted to go forwards and it was just a lot
     easier to go with the flow going forwards than to try
     and change direction.
Q. So there was a flow going forwards? - A. Yes.

Q.    What   was your ability    to move around you?What  wasit
     like at that stage on the terrace? - A. Wecouldn't
     move our arms or anything. It was just step by step*
Q. So when you   were actually, before any major surge you
   were trying   to get down, you couldn't move your arms? -
   A. Yes. We    thought there would be more room at the
   front which   was why we were going there.
Q. I have already put this to one witness already, but in
   view of the fact you mention it now I will put it to
   you: when you go to a terrace and you enter from the
   back, you are not too worried that it is crowded at the
   back because you believe you may be able to make your
   way to the front or sideways? - A. Yes.
Q. But of course on this occasion you couldn't move
   sideways beyond the radial fencing? - A. I have never
   been to a ground where the pens have been so small, so
   I have never experienced it before really.
Q. Now, you gave a description of seeing people in
   distress, and I include in that the people who were
   unfortunately over the barrier. - A. Yes.
Q. And^ that unfortunate father and son and the father
   obviously trying to rescue his son. Those people were
   m distress and difficulty before this major surge
   came, wasn't it? - A. Yes.
                                                               101


                                                 M. C. GOULD



Q. You gave a picture of general hysteria at that stage,
   before the major surge came? - A. Yes. The people that
   were in distress were, yes.

Q. The people who were in distress were clearly in
   distress because of the vast number of people around
   them and they had lost their footing and fallen? - A.
   Yes.

Q. The people on the barrier had clearly been pushed over
   the barrier through the pressure of the crowd? - A.
     Mmm.
Q. I have no further questions, thank you.
          MR. CATCHPOLE:   I only rise for one very remote
     possibility, perhaps Mr. Gould might be shown the
     photograph. I have managed to get it wrong every time
     so far, but it is C294.

               Cross-Examined by MR. CATCHPOLE
Q. I will show Mr. Griffiths where there is a possibility
   you might be shown.

Q.        THE CORONER:   Mr. Gould, if you turn to 294 in
     the book, it saves you craning your neck round.
Q.        MR. CATCHPOLE:  It is only a remote possibility
     that it is you. - A. No.

               Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN
Q. Mr. Gould, you say you went to the match without a
   ticket? - A. Yes.

Q. Didn't anyone bother to check if you had a ticket when
   you passed through the main entrance gate? - A. No.
Q. Have you ever been able to get in to see a football
   match without a ticket before? - A. Not without paying,
   no.

Q. I was going to ask you that. I was just going to say,
   or without paying. - A. There were people standing by
   the gates as we went through but nobody asked to see a
   ticket.

Q. Did you expect somebody to stop you? - A. I thought
   somebody would say something but there wasn't much they
   could do once you were there. I mean they couldn't
   have just taken us through the crowd and put us on the
   road again, but I did expect to be asked. It has been
                                                                102

   known to slip them the money anyway and get in that
   way.

Q. Did you notice if any Police Officers were stopping
   fans from climbing over the turnstiles? - A. I saw them
   shouting at them to tell them to come down and as
   nobody else got up after that I presumed that it had
   worked, but nobody actually climbed up and stopped
   them.

Q. Were there any Police Officers outside the turnstile
   area preventing the fans from pushing forward all the
   time? - A. I only saw the one on horseback.
Q. Just one Officer? - A. Yes.
Q. That is all, thank you.

              Cross-Examined by MR. RUSSELL
Q. Would it be fair to say that you never gave up hope of
   getting into the ground and seeing this match,
   notwithstanding that you didn't have a ticket? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Were you aware of anyone else who likewise didn't have
   a ticket, but were determined or hoping to get into the
   ground to see the match? - A. Well we saw lots of
   people who didn't have tickets and were trying to buy
   them and I presume if they were in our situation they
   would have done the same, but I didn't actually hear
   anybody say that.

Q. You described the mood of some of the supporters
   outside the perimeter gates as angry, I think? - A.
   Yes.

Q. The witness that gave evidence before you used the
   adjective frustrated - I don't know whether you heard
   that evidence - but how was that anger making itself
   manifest? - A. Well it was mostly just shouting but
   there was the instance of striking out at the Policeman
   and the horse.




                /Q.   You used the phrase .....
                                                             103

                                            M.C. GOULD

Q.'You used the phrase "Further abuse".  You described there
   being physical abuse in that instance, and after the use of
   the truncheon there was the continuation of the verbal abuse?
   - A. Yes, but it was not necessarily directed at the Policeman
   on horseback.

Q. Against whom was the verbal abuse directed? - A. Anybody, I
   presume, that could have...

Q. Anybody that cared to listen? - A. Yes, and who could have
   done something.

Q. Now, you used the phrase that the crowds before the turnstiles
   were obviously pushing, and you were asked by Mr. Manning to
   explain the fact they were pushing was obvious, and you
   answered that.  Were you able to see - I took your evidence to
   be slightly different.  "They were obviously pushing".  In
   other words, it was obvious that they were pushing.  What I
   would like you to tell me, please, is how they were pushing.
   Were they using their hands to push other people or their
   bodies? Can you remember in what way the pushing was obvious?
   - A. It is just the fact they were trying to get towards the
   turnstile or the concertina gates, and obviously some would be
   pushing with arms but walking forcefully could be seen as
   pushing, I suppose.

Q. You confirmed to my learned friend, Mr. King, a few moments
   ag o, that you saw the concertina gate open three times? - A .
   Yes.

Q. And it was on the third occasion you went through.      That is
   right? - A. Ye s .

Q. The first occasion it opened for a very short period? - A.
   Yes.

Q. And we can tell from other evidence that that was a period of
   just 24 seconds. - A, Yes.

Q. I am sorry, 27 seconds. Then it opened again a few minutes
   later for a longer period? - A. Yes.

Q.   And then it closed, and then it opened again? - A.   Yes.

Q. Shortly before 3 o'clock? - A. Yes.                ,

Q. And it was on that occasion shortly before 3 o'clock that you
   went through? - A . Ye s.

Q.   When you got on to the terrace into enclosure 3 you saw you
     were part of a flow of people going forwards? - A. Yes.

Q. As I understand your evidence, your movement was between other
   people or between people and the radial fence.  Is that right?
   - A . Between other people, y e s .

Q. It was not a matter of putting everyone and everything that
                                          M.C. GOULD

 ' was in front of you further forwards? - A. No.
Q. You were trying to get between people? - A. Yes, and they
   stayed where they were.
Q. Yes, I thought that is what you were saying. There came a
   time when having got about two-thirds of the way down you
   decided or you wanted to move to the right? - A, Yes.
Q. And that was a conscious decision to wish to move to the
   right, was it? - A. Yes.
Q. And so you were able to move to the right? - A. Yes.
Q. It was quite easy to ease yourself between other people on the
   crowded terrace? - A. Yes. I mean, there was still a flow but
   it was not as violent as before.
Q. And you have identified on the acetate, I think C.306, the
   position at which you ended? - A. Yes.
        MR. RUSSELL:   Might that be put back, please:
Q. You have identified a position, if one were to have stood in
   the gateway and looked backwards at the people on the
   terraces, just to the right of the gateway? - A . Yes.
Q. Almost in front of the right-hand upright of that gateway
   looking back towards the stand? - A. Yes.
Q. You have also marked yourself just in front of a line of
   barriers? - A. Yes.
Q. Are you able to identify the position and make that mark on
   the acetate by reference to your recollection of where those
   barriers were? - A. I remember being in front of the barrier
   to my left of the gate.
Q. So as you were facing forwards towards the gate you were aware
   of a barrier to your left? - A. Behind me.
Q. Behind you? - A. IfI was facing the gate it was     behind me.
Q. Yes. Assuming I am     towards the gate     and you arestanding
   looking towards the pitch, where was the barrier which you
   recall, in relation to your position there in the witness box?
   - A. It was just like where this is, more or less.
Q. You are motioning really behind your right shoulder? - A. Yes.
Q. At that stage there was a barrier there? - A. Yes, it was the
   one the people were bent over.

     MR. RUSSELL:   Sir, as far as I couldsee,    the witness has
described the barrier that subsequently failed.
        THE CORONER:   Yes, I agree with you.
                                                M-C. GOULD



Q.         MR. RUSSELL: I don't think that was apparent before.
     - A. No, it was not apparent before, but I was not asked
     before.

q   . it was the barrier behind your right shoulder from that
      position? - A. Yes.

Q.         THE CORONER: We might as well just clear that up.   Do
     you recollect a barrier broke? - A. I did not see it break,
     but I know that one did break.

Q.   And is that the one that you recollect you were close by    to? -
     A . Y es.
Q. So in fact you are pretty confident about your position there?
   - A. Y e s .
Q. But you don't remember it breaking? - A. No, I saw it buckled.
   When I turned round and looked at the people I saw it was
   buckled, but I did not see it break.

          MISS SINCLAIR:     Sir, can I just ask one question arising
     out of that?

           THE CORONER:    Of course you can.

                   Cross-Examined by MISS SINCLAIR:

Q. Mr. Gould, you were talking about this barrier which was just
   behind you and to your right.  You say you had seen people
   buckled over it? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you just give me an idea of how far back. When you say
   "buckled", presumably you mean that people were bending
   forward? - A. Bent over at the waist.

Q. Bent over at the waist, but their legs were behind the
   barrier? - A. Yes.

Q. Their legs were straight, as far as you could see? - A. Yes.

Q. Was it just one row of people behind the barrier who were bent
   forward? - A. There was the people directly next to the
   barrier were, and obviously the people behind them were to a
   lesser degree.

Q. So there was a row of people standing immediately behind the
   barrier? - A. Yes.

Q. -And they lent forward? - A. Yes.

Q. And the people behind them, the next row, as it were, they
   were bent forward.  To the same degree? - A. No, they
   gradually got less and less.

Q. I know it must have been difficult to see.        I am sure this was
                                                              106


                                              M.C. GOULD


     not something   you were directing your mind to at the time.
     How many rows   back, as it were, could you see people pitched
     forward? - A.   It is difficult because everybody was moving
     backwards and   forwards.  Only two, three at the most.

Q. Three rows    of people? - A. Yes, basically because you lean
    forward as   far as you could to get some a i r , to breathe,
    because if   you were back with everybody else their heads were
  ' in the way   of air.

Q.        THE CORONER:  You say they were trying to lean forward
     like this to breathe? — A. Yes.

Q.        MISS   SINCLAIR:  And presumably they were lifting their
     heads up,   as you would to get some air? - A. Yes, and to try
     and speak   as well, to try and get us to help.

Q.    Could you hear what any of those people   were saying? -A. Only
     the one who asked to try and push everybody back, which I
     tried on my own but....

Q. Could you see that other people behind the barrier were saying
   something, or’not? - A. No, just screaming, but nothing really
   to hear.

Q. But you could see they were distressed? - A. Yes.

Q. Finally, can you remember how closely packed those people were
   along the barrier? - A. I think there were about eight people
   along it.
Q. How much of the barrier could you see? Could you see along to
   the fence? - A. No, just the first barrier.

Q. The first span? - A. Yes.

Q. You mean the bar between two uprights? - A. Yes.        Are those
   all joined together?

Q. Yes. - A. Yes, it was the first actual bar.

Q. About eight people.  Were they all facing full on? - A. As
   much as possible, yes.

Q. Thank you very much.
          THE CORONER:   Mr. Russell, as you know we have proceeded
     on the assumption there were three openings of the gate, 14.48
     for a short period, 14.52 and then 14:59, which I think is
     what you were putting to the witness, if I understood you
     correctly.

          MR. RUSSELL:     That is right, sir.

          THE CORONER:   The problem is there were many other
     openings of this concertina gate which had happened from 12
     o'clock onwards, and I don't intend to list them all because
                                                              107


                                            W.C. GOULD

 ' it would be an almost impossible task.  The problem I have is
   in some respects this gentleman's evidence did not quite fit
   our three openings. Do you mind if I go over that again with
   him, because it is possible he is talking about an opening
   which we have not classified, if I can use that term, as
   opening No. 1.                  .
          MR. RUSSELL:   Sir, I thought we had identified all the
     openings after 14.40.

          THE CORONER:   When I asked him how long the second
     opening was, he said, "About a minute", which would fit in
     with the 14.48 opening much more readily than with the 15.52,.
     which was clearly open for five minutes at the minimum*

          MR. RUSSELL:   The 14.48 opening that he spoke of, that I
     understood him to be referring to, was when gate C opened a
     little way, and that is how it was possible to distinguish
     between, on my understand of his evidence, the 14.48 opening
     and the 14.52 opening.  On the second occasion it opened fully
     and on the first occasion it only opened a little, and I think
     he identified about 20 supporters going through.

          THE CORONER:   Let me just have another go.  I am not
     criticising you, nor am I criticising the witness, ofcourse.
     I am anxious we get it as near as we can right.   I will go it
     again, and if you want to come back and re-verify it, please
     do.

                       Further bv THE CORONER:

Q. You heard that, have not you? Just describe to me again, you
   saw gate C, the concertina gate, you saw it open once.  Tell
   me what you saw on that occasion? - A. The first time was when
   I was still on the bridge and it opened slightly. Then it was
   shut again quickly.

Q. How long would you say it was open for at that point? - A. No
   more than half-a-minute.  You lose all idea of time.

Q.    It is very difficult, I appreciate that.   Did you   look at your
     watch at that time? - A. No.

Q. So you don't actually know what time.     You just saw it? - a.
   Yes.

Q. Then you entered the crowd, thinking you might be lucky? - A.
   Ye s .

Q. And then you saw it again.  Describe that opening as carefully
   as you can? - A. I was standing by the outer gates, the
   railing gates, and saw them opening and then a number of
   people went through again, and by the time I had looked next
   they were shut.

Q.    What sort of time period would you put on that? - A. I don't
     really know, because I did not see them being closed.
F                                                                    108


                                                      M.C. GOULD



        Q. You did not see them being closed? - A .    I did not see them
           being closed.
    B   Q. Were you moving forward^ aiming towards this gate? - A. We
           were making our way towards the clearer area by the fence
           which we could not see by the river, and by the time we looked
           next it was shut.

        Q. How long were you at the river edge before it opened again? -
           A. About two or three minutes.

Q. Then it was opened fully and you went in? - A. Yes.
Q. Just refresh my memory once more, having got on to
   the terraces? I do not want to know all the details
   about it but what had been happening on the pitch
   again? - A. The players were on there but they hadn't
   started the game.
Q. When did they start the game after you got on to the
   terraces? - A. We were on the way down the terrace.

Q. Would that be seconds or minutes? - A. Only a couple
   of minutes I would think.
Q. A couple of minutes is quite a long time. If you
   think of a boxing match a couple of mi rtutes is a long
   time if you are boxing. Can you be mor e precise? I
   know it is very harsh and it is not tr} ing to catch
   you out but we are just trying to estab lish whether
   you went in there in between 15:52 or 5:57 or at
   15:59 or thereabouts? ~ A. Well....

Q. You do not know?     A. The match started while we were
   on the way down.
Q. Having got in through the concertina gate you did not
   hesitate, you did not go to the loo or anything? - A.
   No, we went straight in.              j '          '
Q. Pretty fast or what? - A. It was pretty fast towards
   the end of the tunnel but once we had reached the
   tunnel it wasn't fast.
       THE CORONER:    You may be right, Mr. Russell.

     MR. RUSSELL:   Sir, the impression I am left with is
that it is the   third opening. Ido not need to take it
further.
     MR. KING:     As I understood the witness whichever
opening it was   he went through -and perhaps I could put it
through the witness?
        THE CORONER:   Yes.
               Further Cross-Examined bv MR. KING:

      Whichever opening it was that you went through, you
      got the impression that not many peoplb went through
      with you? - A. No. I mean we were walking freely
      through the gates.

                                              - M. C. GOULD-



     MR. KING:   I say that, sir, because it is known that
at the opening which was 14:52 or 14:57 thereis an
estimate of going into thousands going through m that five
minutes.
     THE CORONER:   I did try and cover that, if you
remember, because I asked him whether there was a crowd
following and he did say, yes, there was a big crowd still
outside. He started off in this instance in a vantage
position because he was opposite the gat^s.   Is there
anything else?
     MR. KING:   No, sir.
     THE CORONER:   Mr. Gould, I am most grateful
                                          _        to you
for coming. I wanted you to come particularly. I was
interested in all your evidence because it was interesting
and very relevant. I did want you to come particularly
because I wanted you to tell us about this father and son
Although we cannot prove it, I have got a pretty good idea
in my mind who it was. We had dad here a day or so ago and
he could not remember all the things he was doing. I
thought it would be nice for him and his; wife to know what
an effort he had made and you had seen it. This was the
golden opportunity for that to be expres sed so to speak.
Thank you very much.

     THE WITNESS:   Can I just say - and I do not know
whether this is relevant - when I did ge t on to the pitch I
was put into the next pen? I didn't sta y on the pitch.

G" I do not think that matters. Which number were you
   in? - A. Directly to the right, Pen 2.

     THE CORONER:   It is Mrs. Murray at the back, is it
not? I hope I did the right thing. Carl I just say before
I let the Jury go, and this is no criticism of you at all,
I had asked a witness something about alcohol. You went
over it and you said that we are asking about it. I cannot
remember the exact form of words but I noticed it and 1^
thought it was something I ought to mention. I do ask the
supporters about the alcohol and I do it deliberately
because you know as well as I do that w^ are going to have
a lot of other witnesses, including a 16t of Police
witnesses, and no doubt they will be giving evidence as to
their recollection of the fans. If I shut up and do not
ask the supporters we could then get a view which might be
described as one sided. So I am doing it in a sense to
balance the views. I hope you accept that.
   , MR. KING:   Speaking for myself; sir   I thought your
questions were entirely proper.
     THE CORONER:   I did not think you w< ire criticising
the questions but it did occur to me that you might think I
was going over and over a question which in a sense you
have already explored. We may drop it at some-point but it
was intended to give the Jury as balanced a view on topics
as we can.
     MR. KING:   Sir, I agree with you because different
witnesses see different things.   One man says a crowd is
drunk, another man says not at all, one man says he sees
everyone with a can and another man says he did not. It is
a picture and we have to feel our way through that picture.
I have no complaints at all.
     THE CORONER:   I was doing it on purpose but with a
plan in mind.
     MR. KING:   I know, sir, but I can say that those I
represent are anxious we should have a balanced picture
because you can get an unbalanced picture from just one or
two witnesses.
     THE CORONER:   Ladies and gentlemen, that is it for
today. It is a few minutes early but we are starting at
9.30 tomorrow. Somebody among the lawyers had an even
better idea that we start at 9.30 or thereabouts and work
through over the lunch hour and then finish and have a
longer afternoon. I do not want to do that tomorrow
because I have a feeling that we have got people arranged
to come. If it is agreeable what I would intend to do is
start at 9.30 and go on until half past one to quarter to
two with the appropriate coffee breaks and then we will
finish for the day. That will only happen on Friday
afternoons. Does that sound a nice idea or not? You can
tell me tomorrow. We start at 9.30 tomorrow. Thank you,
Members of the Jury. Have a nice evening.
 (The Inquests were adiourned until 9.30 the following day)

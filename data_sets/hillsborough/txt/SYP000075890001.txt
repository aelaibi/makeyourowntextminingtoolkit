                             , who also          lives at



                 We made        one    stop on the way to the ground,                    that was at the first

                 s e r vices      on the M 1 , to use          the toilets.         We only encoun te re d one             delay

on the way there,            that was as we entered Sheff ield.                         Ihis was       because

          had been        informed of a quick                route and he         ignored the Police

sign di recting Liverpool                   supporters and this             resulted      in us       running

into Forest        supporters.          We were       delayed for about an hour.                  We a c t u a l l y

arrived       in S h e f fi el d at about           quarter      to one,       and with this          delay.    We

eventually        parked our        vehicle at about               quarter      to two.    I can't

remember        exactly where we             parked,       but    it was only a five minute walk

to the ground.          We had      p r eviously       received Police            directions about

where    to park while we were                 delayed amongst             the Forest Supporters,               so

having     parked the vehicle                it was    just a case of walking                  to the ground.

1 was    familiar wit h the L e p pings Lane                      end of H i l l s b o r o u g h as    I have

been to the ground on               previous         occasions.        Whilst walking           to the    ground

I can y e c a 11 seeing          s u pporters        sitting       on jrfalls drinking          out of beer

       , but there were           no forms          of diso£*fer        or any fighting          everybody

           e. The whole          of the       segment       in front       of the      t/urnst,i 1es was        just

           of    people and t V p / e         were     no queues at all,              it was    just

  taotic.       I recall     seeing         three    policemen standing               on a wall       to the

left    of the turnstiles.              T hey were shouting              for    the    crowd to       push back,

but    it had no effect at all.                 I did not see any gates open,                     nor did        I

see any gates          being opened           other    than the turnstiles.               We    pushed     in

w i t h the     crowd to try and             gain entry to the ground.                  It was    very tight

and rny movement          was    very       restricted,          however    I w ould not describe               it

as a crush.        E v e n t u a l l y we    saw a slight          gap near to an end tur n s t i l e                by

the    c o n certina    gate and        I made       for    that.     I m a n a g e d to get     thro u g h the

turnstile.        By this       time    it was about five               to three.       I handed my ticket

in and     I was    given the stub back.                   I have since         returned the stub to

A nf ie ld and o b t ained a refund.                 Once    inside the ground,             I remember

          I made my way to t h a / se ct io n without                   too jptfch d i fficulty and once
                                                                                C,
          there      I was d i r e c t e d to my seat           in t h r N o r t h stand by a steward.                 From

          the    time that           I. ente r e d the g r o u n / T X did not see any                 person drinking,

          neither        did      I see any sort          of disorder     or fighting.          I got to my match

          seat at about              two minutes         to three.     My actual       match seat was            on a line

          w i t h the half way             line    on the     pitch and was        v i r tually the         centre      of

          the N o r th stand.            From     the    time that     I took up my seat               remember

          looking at the Lepping Lane S tand and thinking                               how packed          it was      in

          the    two     pens behind the            goal?     whilst    the    other    pens,        were   vir t u a l l y

          empty.       At this        time,      I was    in compnay w ith                              and his wife

                    . S ho r t l y after         the m at c h started           became aware           of   people

          starting to             climb over the fen                    the    front    of the        pens and getting

          onto     the     pitch.        It was    obvioi±*n.y very      packed      in there.         I cannot       recall

          seeing any             crowd surges air any stage.             More and more           fans were         climbing

          over     the fences.             By about       two minutes      past three,         more an d more

          people were             climbing       out from the front           of what     I now know to be

          pen 3. This a p p ea re d              to be because       the Police        had opened the            gate at

          the    front       of the       pen.    The m atch ji^Ts e v e n t u a l l y stopped, jand I then

          ;Pelt that the Police were                     sjXfw to respond.       I think       this was        probably a

          general        u nawareness         on j/ne part of the Police,               who may have           thought

          that     it was         just a case of transferring                 supporters       from the        central

          pens     to the outer            ones.    Eve n when     people obv i o u s l y      realised the

          se r i o u s n e s s    of the matter,          it was   the fans who were             doing      everything,
A

          to help,        with things            such as     carrying    the a d v e r t i s i n g    hoardings       that

          were     being         used as m ak es h i f t     stretchers.



          Overall,         I think       there wacs a definite           lack of Police              on the outside           of

          the    ground          prior   to trfe m a t c h    I felt    there    should haver been more

         *   o rd e r l y queues/,   and    perhaps,       prevented what       s u b s e q u e n t l y happened.   I

             feel   that the Police were              o b viously aware    of the s i tuation outside               the

             turnstiles,       and should have a cted quickly to                 prevent     the    chaos    atKside

             and get       people    in the ground quickly and safely.                 I actual l ^ x eft       the

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY - PART II
TECHNICAL WORKING PARTY ON THE GREEN GUIDE

My note of 13 November confirmed that I would be in touch shortly
with the Agenda and papers for the Working Party meeting on
Tuesday 28 November.  These are now enclosed.

I am afraid that there are no conference room facilities
available in Queen Anne's Gate on that day, and our meeting will
therefore^ take place in Room G 2 1 , Abell House, John Islip Street,
commencing at 10.30am.   Abell House is approximately ten minutes
walk from St James' Park underground station, and slightly over
five minutes from that at Pimlico.      I hope the enclosed map is
clear, but if there are any difficulties, do not hesitate to give
me a ring.

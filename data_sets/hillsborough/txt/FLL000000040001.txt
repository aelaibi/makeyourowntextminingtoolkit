      On behalf of all League football, I write to express our
feelings of shock and utter dismay at the horrific tragedy
which occurred at Hillsborough on Saturday.  Our deepest
sympathy is extended to the people of Merseyside for the
suffering they must be going through and heartfelt condolences
are sent to those who lost loved ones in this terrible
disaster.

      Liverpool has become football's premier city and we would

will help to unite the people of Merseyside and give them
the strength and fortitude to overcome this latest
heartbreaking setback.

      We will continue to pray for the families and friends of
those who died so tragically.

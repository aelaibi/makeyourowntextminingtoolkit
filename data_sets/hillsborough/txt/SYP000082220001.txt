no sooner had we arrived,              than we were being asked to get into the

transits and en-block we travelled to the Football                                        Ground.

the halfway line.           Some people appeared             injured and distressed?                              others

were   lying on the ground,            being attendac to by oth^r supporters.

I looked round to see              people   being      carried from the field by football

supporters      to the exit between the N and E S t a n d s .                                 As time       passed 1

saw Police officers          begin carrying supporters from the field to cheers

There was jeering          coming from the E            Stand a ad the large crowd on                                 tne

of the pitch to separate the two sets at/ supporters.

I could see supporters breaking up the hoariflings at the sides of the

pitch and using them as stretchers.                         y/’                  ^                           p

I. left the     cordon and went to help thf^ injured people                                            as    I moved

amongst the crowd,          I could see people            lying on the                    pitch who were

obviously dead,         indicated by their blue              pallor.

I helped     carry makeshift          stretchers       to the front of the E Stand and

               tried to help general!y with                           the injured and distressed.

               1 was then told to leave the                           pitch and go out onto L e p p i n g s      L n and

               form a line to assist the exit of f a m                            iway   from   the   laround.

               Approximately                   1900 hrs      I was    taken, along with other Officers,             to Wei

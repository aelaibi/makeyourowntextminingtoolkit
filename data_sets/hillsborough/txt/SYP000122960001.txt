                               DEATH OF CHRISTOPHER BARRY DEVENSIDE


                 Sir

                 On Wednesday 19 April 1989 as a result of a telephone call from DI Charles
                 incident room, I was informed by him that the bereaved parent
                 Mr Barry Devenside of Formby, Liverpool had made a request to talk to
                 me in connection with the death of his son Christopher Barry Devenside,
                 18 yrs.

                 At 10.00 am on the same date I telephoned Mr Devenside              who asked
                 me questions about his sons death. I gave my sympathy and that of the
                 South Yorkshire Police to pass on, to his wife and relations.

                 Mr Devenside in return, thanked me for the help I had given and for caring
                 for his boy.

                 He further expressed that I make it known, to the South Yorkshire Police
                 and all the officers on duty on that fateful day of his thanks for what
                 they did in. carrying out their duties.

                 Finally he asked me for my full particulars and collar number which I
                 gave to him.

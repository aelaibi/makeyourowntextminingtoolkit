                    houses,             which were            open and         serving.              The     pubs      we     had       passed      on our

                    way       to    our       point        were    all     shuttered            and       appeared          c lo s e d .

                    As    the       day       progressed more               and more            fans       were       seen     to       be w a l k i n g     with

                    cans       of       lager     and       beer    and     just         up t h e        road    from       th e    r a i 1w a y    station

                    probably             around        1000,       were     sat      on    the       grass       verge       with        cans      of a l c o h o l .

                    The       train arrived                 around       10 m i n u t e s       early,          and when           the     fans     alighted

                    a number             were     searched          by     our      serial.              These       fans    were        well      behaved

                    and       posed        no    problems.              They      appeared           sober       and acted              in a n     orderly

                    manner.              We     escorted          the    f an s     down     to      the     football          ground         and       u po n

reaching           the       g r o u n d , th e      fans       made      their        way       to    the    turnstiles.                    Our

arrival        at       the       gates       of    the    ground         on L e p p i n g s          Lane    would          have       been

no    later        than E .13p m .

At    this     time          there          was    a number         of    people           milling          around        but      no     real

problem.            Th e      majority were                drinking            from        l ager      or    beer       cans       and a

number       were        sat       on       surrounding           walls        drinking.               Attempts           by    officers

were       made     to m o v e          these       people        from     the w a l l s           but      it w a s      a no w i n

s i t u a t i o n as         fast       as    one    g r o u p was        moved        another           came      along        to      t ak e

their       place,,

At    a r o u n d E .3 3 p m           I noted       that       from a steady                   stream       of    people          of w h i c h

we    were     able          to    easily          control        into     keeping              them     into      a    limited          area

of    the    pavement              and       road,       things       were? g e t t i n g          very      crowded.              I

recall       looking              from       the    grounds         entrance           on L a p p i n g s         Lane       further          up

the     lane       from       the       direction          we     ha d    escorted              the    fans       and     seeing         a

solid       block        of       people          heading       towards         us.

I remember              an    Inspector Sykes                   coming         over        towards          myself        a n d PC 3 1 8 3

Trcek       w ho    I was          stood          next    to    and      telling           us    the     road was            being

closed       off        to    traffic.              It w a s      inevitable               this       was    going        to    have         to

be    done     as       people          were       walking        about        all     over        the      road       in s w a r m s ,

everyone           appeared             to    be    drinking,            in m y       opinion          it w a s        only     a small

minority           who       were       not.

We    should        have          gone       for m e a l       to C l a y w h e e 1s L a n e           for 3 p m        but     due      to

the    large        amount             of    people       arriving         at     this          late     t im e    and       the     chaos

we    stayed        in situ.

At 2 . 3 0 p m      people             were       panicking        outside            the       gate.        They were             asking

for    directions                 to    their       stand.          It    had     become           obvious         to     them       t he y

had    left        it    too       late       and were          not      going        to    see       kick    off.

to    go    between           the       horses.           It w a s       obviously              an at t em p t      at       keeping          the

fans     in o r d e r      and       stop     them      pushing             in t h e i r      panic       to    get          into      the

ground.           Whilst        trying        to a c h i e v e         this       and       trying       to    stop          the     f an s

getting        through,          the       surge       of    people          became          so    strong       that          I wa s

lifted       from     my    feet       and moved             along          with       the    crowd,          amazingly              enough

this    also        seemed       to    happen          to    the P o l i c e           horse       I was       n e xt        to.

Fans    were        totally          ignoring          requests             to    stop       pushing          forward           and       to

move    orderly          around        t he     cordon           we    had made,             they were          scrambling

through        horses       legs       and      generally              taking          every advantage                   in a

situation           when    the P o l i c e        were          outnumbered                and    little       could           be     done

by w a y     of     correction.

Inspector           Ellis       I remember             was       sat    on       top    of    a Land          Rover          and

shouting          through a           loudhailer             for       fans       to    stop       pushing          forward.               This

appered        to    have       little        effect         on the          fans.

On    turning        towards          the     turnstiles               on L e p p i n g s         Lane    I saw          one        mass       of

people,        it was       at       this     stage         I realised             things          were       going          very

quickly        downhill.              An    Inspector             whose          identity          I do       not       k n o w wa s       sat

astride        a wall       by       the    turnstiles                and    was       pulling       people             over        the wall

who    were       obviously           in d a n g e r        of    being          crushed          outside       the          ground.

I recall          making        comment         to PC        Trcek          at    this       time    t h at     there           was       going

to    be a t r a g e d y .           It w a s      chaos         but    still          fans       continued             pushing

forwards          it wa s       as    if    they were             ignorant             as    to w h a t       was       occurring.

I was      stood      looking          on h e l p l e s s l y          trying          to    hold    the       rear          en d    of    the

fans     back a nd         shouting           at    people            standing          around       the       entrance              gates

to    move     if t h e y       h a d n ’t got         a ticket.                 The    fans       appeared             beligerant              to

requests          made     of    them and           just         sauntered             around.

It w a s     at     this    time       1 heard a             radio          message          requesting             all       available

Police       personnel           onto       the     pitch.             I have          no    recollection                of     ho w      I got

into     the      ground        through         th e    crowd          but       I remember waiting                      a    few

steward.            Once    on       the    pitch       I remember                thinking          it w a s        a    pitch         invasion

we    were     dealing           with      as     I had          heard      no    further            Police          radio        message.

I approached              on e     youth        and        in m y    ignorance             told       him       to    return        to    the

stand,       he    t o l d me        " I t ’s hell            in t h e r e " .        I moved           further            towards        the

fence      and     sa w      piles        of    people           thrown      up a g a i n s t         the       fe n c e .        They    all

appeared          mangled          together.                Officers         were      getting             up    onto        the    tap    of

the    fence       and       hauling           people         over.         I then         began        recovering                these

bodies       once       over       th e    fence           and    pulling         them      onto        the      pitch and

assisting          wherever            necessary?                giving      heart         massage          and mouth              to m o u t h .

I worked          on    several           bodies           and    summoned          the     makeshift                advertising

boards       f an s     were       using        as     stretchers.

The    majority           of     the      casualties              I had      dealings            with       were       already

d e ad,    this        has     been       thought           with     hindsight             of    the       tragedy           but    at    the

time      anyone        who      appeared             to    have     any     life      in them,             I worked              on.

I remember             feeling         helpless             when more            oxygen         bottles          were        needed       arid

a St.      Johns        Ambulance              woman        t o l d me      there      wa s      no m o r e .

The    one     body       1 spent          most        time with            was     a male           approximately 22                    years

with      s a n d y / g i nge ry       hair      and        pale     eyelashes             and       freckles.               1

administered              oxygen          to    him whilst            an     off     duty        fireman             did     heart

massage.           We     thought          there           was    a flicker          of     life        in h i m       but w h e n        put

on a      stretcher            and     c a r r i e d a w a y we          thought           differently.                    When     things

finally        calmed a            little        from         the    initial         bustle           of    getting              fans    out

from      behind        the      fence         onto        the    pitched         area      I re ca l l          fans        c ryi ng a n d

hysterical             and     fighting          amongst            themselves.                 I intervened                 in    no    end

of    squabbling             between           th e    fans.

The    smell       of a l c o h o l       was         unbelievable               it s e e m e d       to h a n g       in the           air.

W h e n all       the     casualties             who        were     believed          to       be    alive          were        removed

and    taken       to ambulances,,                    the     atmosphere            wa s    electric             and       looking

back      t h is w a s       the     most       frightening.                 Both      sets          of f a n s       seemed        to    be

brewing        trouble           and a         line        of P o l i c e    officers            was       formed          across        the

pitch).
             I d o n ’t k n o w w h e t h e r          this    is    because           the    N o t t s . Forest           fans       were

             unaware        of     the     tragedy       and were          of     the    impression            the       ca.su.laties

            were      victims         of    fans       fighting          each     other       or w h e t h e r      it w a s      sheer

             ev iI n e s s .

             The    difficulties                were    made    doubly           worse       by    not    only      having        to    deal

            with      the       injured         but    also    the       fighting        and       the    fear      of     a   pitch

             invasion           by N o t t s . F o r e s t     fans.

             In m y    opinion           th e    tragedy       occurred           due    to       the    en m a s s      arrival        of   fans

             at    such     a    late      t i me.      On    their       arrival        it w a s        apparent          th e   majority

             had    been        drinking         and    in fact          had     the    gall       to    sti l l    be     drinking.

             There     was       no   rush       unt i 1 the        f i na l     moment       to    get     into      th e     ground and

             their     priority            was    to    drink       as    much     a n d as        long as         possible.            H-y m a i n

             concern        is     that     the       people    I was          trying        to    help    had      been       th e    innocent

             victims        as     they     were       obviously          th e    early       arrivals         to     be       positioned

Lord Justice Taylor’s concern about
uninformed speculation about even s
at Hillsborough Football Ground ui
Saturday 15 April 1989.
Unfortunately an inaccurate and
misleading account of the Service s
response to the Hillsborough
Disaster is emerging in the Press.

Tn avoid this, I confirm that the
initial call for assistance from
Hillsborough was received by the
Fire Service Headquarters Control
Room at just before 3.14pm.  The
call informed the Service that there
was a major incident at Hillsborough

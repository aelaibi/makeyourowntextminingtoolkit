LETTER FROM LADY HARDING: SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS


I attach a copy of a letter sent to the Prime Minister by
Lady Harding suggesting a number of measures which could improve
safety at stadiums.    No 10 have asked that a reply be sent to
Lady Harding at* either Ministerial or Private Secretary level. I
would be grateful to learn whether you feel the reply could best
come from the Home (Office.    If not, a contribution from you to
the reply would be appreciated.    We have been asked to provide a
draft by 12 May.

              Woodseats           Police       Station.            I had       been       told    t hat     my    duties       t hat    day

              were      in    connection            with    the     FA    Cup Semi             Final    between         the    teams     of

              Liverpool           and Nottin g h a m          Forest.

              We      were    conveyed         to    the    ground        in    police          transport         and    on a r r i v a l     at

              the      ground      we w e r e       formed       into     series           and    went      to    the    North       Stand       of

              the      ground      for    the       general        brj^Ting.           I was      assigned         to    serial        7 under

              the      command        of P o l i c e   Sergeant           752 B A T T Y .         Our     duties        that    day w er e         to

              Following           the    general       briefing           we    took       up/our       duties      in the       centre          of

              the      Spion      Kop.      In the         corner        of    the     Kj^p n e a r e s t    to    the    North        Stand

              was      to    be a n     area    set    aside        for       Liverpool          supporters         who       came     into

this     part        of    the       ground.           One       aerial          was    assigned             to    cordon          of    this

area     and are           duties          were       to    reinforce             the    cordon          should          the       need       aris

At    around         12 n o o n       the       first       groups          of    supporters             began          to    enter          the

ground.           Xnitally            they were             good       humoured          but       as    more       and more             f ans

entered         the       ground          the    atmosphere                changed.           As    pushing             was       occurring

at    the    cordon            near       the    North       Stand          we as       a serial             went       to     reinforce

that     co r d o n .          At    that, t i m e         in t his         area       were       approximately                   200

Liverpool            supporters             and more             were       entering          all       the       time.           There       was

no    hostility            between          the       groups          of    supporters             tha t      I witnessed                at    thi

time,       other         than Fores t            supporters                pushing          at    the       cordon          of w h i c h      I

was    a member            in a n         effort       to    get       into       the    comparitive                space          of    the

Liverpool            supporters             end       of    the       Kop.

I was       aware         however          that       many       of    the       supporters             had       been       drinking

heavily         and were             the    worse          for    drink.              This    was       true       of    both          set    of

s u pporters.

Although          I did         look       over       to    the L e p p i n g s         Ln    end       of    the       ground          from

time    to      t ime      I was          not    aware       of       any    serious          overcrowding                   or    pushing.

I was       not      in d i r e c t        radio       contact.

As     k i ck     off      t ime a p p r o a c h e d         the       pressure          on       the    cordon          increased             but

the    Kop      as    a whole             was    not       overcrowded,                but    it as          full.

At    3pm    (1500)            the    teams       kicked          off.           At    approximately 3.04pm                            a s the

Nottingham            team was             attacking             the       Leppings          Ln    end       of    the       g r o u n d.      I

saw a s urge              of    supporters             from       the L e p p i n g s         Ln T e r r a c e          come       onto       t he

pitc h.         I was          not    aware       of       the    cause,          but    more       and       more       supporters

came    o nto        the       pitch.           The    Police          Officers          on       duty       at    t hat      end       of

ground       rushed            towards          them and          the       perimeter             fencing          but       I was       unable

to    see    what         was       happening          clearly.              The       teams       then       ran       off       he    pitch

and    large         number          of    police          rushed          towards       th_a_t .end of             the       ground.

The    pushing            then       on    the    cordon          i n c r e a s e d as        the N o t t i n g h a m             Forest

supporters            began          to    push       towards          the L i v e r p o o l        fans.           Due       to       this    I.

was    not     in a          position          to    clearly          see w h a t       was    happening         at    the

Leppings           Ln    s i de     of    the       ground,       but       1 was       aware      that    people          were       being

carried        on       stretchers             and    advertising              hoardsings           and were          being

treated        by St          Johns       Ambulance          men       Police        and      supporters.             I was          aware

that    a serious              incident             had    happened,           but      I was      unaware       what       had       t o ok

place        nor    was       I aware          of    the    gravity          of    the       situation.         I saw       two

supporters              run    o nto      the       pitch and          begin       to    gesticulate            to

the    Forest           supporters             in a n a g g r e s s i v e         manner.          This    only agg ra v a t e d

the    situation              and      the     pressure          on    the     cordon         increased         as F o r e s t

supporters              pushed         harder        on    the    cordon          in a n      effort      to    get    to       the

Liverpool           supporters.                 A    co           of P o l i c e        Officers       was      then       placed

across        the       middle         of^tj^f^pj’t c h w h i c h            calmed          the   situation.              As    it

became       obvious           that       a    serious       incident             had    happened         the    Hop       became

calmed.            I then         turned        my a t t e n t i o n        to w h a t       was   happening          on    the       pitch

and    at    the L e p p i n g s         Ln     end.        I saw a m b u l a n c e s          taking      people          away       and

more     people          being         treated        and    carried           off      on    stretchers.

I remained              on    the S p i o n         Kop    until       we    were       ordered      to    usher       people             from

the    ground           I had       no    personal          contact          or    further         information             which          I

can    give,        regarding             the       events       which       happened          on the      Leppings             Ln    side

of    the     gro und.

At    7 pm    ( 1900)         t h at     day    f o 11owing           the    debrief          in the      North Stand                of       the

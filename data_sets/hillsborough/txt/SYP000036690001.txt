Dear Assistant Chief Constable

Thank you for your letter of July 23rd

In my letter of April 20th, I suggested the possibilty of some
experimental work aimed at measuring the sort of crushing     *
forces which had occurred at Hillsborough.                    I
                                                              f
I have made the first moves to get this work started. We planv
to enlist the help of a commando regiment at Aldershot and we
are in the process of approaching them. I have also contacted
the Bio-Engineering department of the Medical School at
Edinburgh University who will advise on the sort of forces
which are potentially fatal in a crushing situation.  This
could result from the collapse of the rib cage or restriction
of the ability to breath.

The timescale for our experimental work however will be May
1990 due to the availability of the largely voluntary effort we
will be using. The motivation in doing it was really to add to
the body of knowledge available to designers of future civil
engineering structures. I feel strongly that most fatal
accidents are in large measure the responsibilty of designers
who should design for safety in all extremities of human
behaviour.

It would be possible to bring the work forward should you wish
it to form part of the inquiry. I would come down and discuss
this with you if you wish. At sometime in any case it would be
useful to know the details of crowd movement which caused the
fatalities so that we can ensure the relevance of the
experimental programme.

There is another aspect which I did not go into in my original
letters but which we would seek to cover in the experimental
programme and that will be the effect of a crowd surge. This
could result in the build up of sufficient momentum to be
dangerous even in the situation on horizontal ground. In the
case of Hillsborough for example I believe it was the roar of
the crowd when the ball hit the crossbar which was heard by the
crowd outside the ground which caused a surge. I do not know
whether this surge caused any injury in the Hillsborough case.
Whether it did or not it is clearly an important parameter to
know for the future. In the case of a London Uunderground
station in the rush hour, there will not be the roar of the
crowd to trigger such a surge but a whiff of smoke might cause
3uch an event.


Yours sincerely

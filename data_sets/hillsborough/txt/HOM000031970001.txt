I must take issue with the story which appeared on the front page o f Friday’s Post
(HILLSBOROUGH: STRAW BACKS DOWN.). Far from opposing an open debate
in Parliament on Hillsborough, I have always been sympathetic to the requests of
Merseyside MPs that there should be such a debate, as I made clear in my comments
to the House o f Commons on 18 February. My colleague Ann Taylor - who is
responsible for scheduling Parliamentary business - shares those concerns, which is
why she has arranged the debate for Friday 8 May.

I am only too aware o f the strong feelings on Merseyside about the terrible events o f
Hillsborough and I will continue to respond openly and directly to questions raised
by the families and local MPs whether inside or outside Parliament. I will be opening
the debate on 8 May - as I have always intended to do.

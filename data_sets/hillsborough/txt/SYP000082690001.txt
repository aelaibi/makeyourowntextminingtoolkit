                       time       it was about S. 4 5 pm              (1445)    avid I remember           that       I made a       comment

                       about       the fact       that     supp o r t e r s were        still     only    just making          their         way

                       the d i r e c t i o n    of the ground,               and that      it was      nearly        time   for     the

                       k i ck o f f .

                       couple       of times and           I remember          that     som e t h i n g was    said to       the     effect

                       that       there w ould       be a serious             public: order        sit u a t i o n    if the gate

                       the    radi o f o r the         gate       to be      opened,     again     this message was               repeated

                       there were a number                 of     s upporters mill i n g about               just     outside       the

                       inside       the     iron gates,,             My serial    were      there      for    only a short           time,         t

                       that       the   supporters         were       leaving    the     ground,       and    that     they were

of the West Stand.                    There were           officers             and members           of the       public

carrying            injured        people      out       through this             gate.           I was     still    not aware

of what           had h a p pened       inside       the    ground at             this        time.

I saw        that       there were          some    officers           stood      in front           of about       5 or 6

bodies w h i c h            were    laid      near       the wire me she cl fencing                    opposite       the

gate,.           It was     obvious         that    they were            dead as        they were           covered with

c o a t 5,       jacket     etc.      The     inspector          in charge             of these        officers

instr u c t e d my serial               to stand with his men and                             form a shield of sor

in an attempt               to sc r e e n the        bodies          from the          s u pporters who were

leaving           the    ground.       Tne     injured and dead ware                          c ontinually         being

brought           out,    the dead were             placed behind                us and the           injured were             sat

or laid at the                bottom of a wall,                 at     rear      of    the       stand,     almost    opposite

us.. E v e n t u a l l y     the    number         of dead            at   our     l o c ation        rose to 11 >

Even at           this    time     I still         did    not         realise         the     enormity of what had

happened,            I really did think                  that    the       only       dead were the           ones    I was

still        with.        It was      some     few minutes               later        w hen      I heard someone           saying

that     the       gym was       being      used as a mortuary,                       and     that    there were at

least 5 0-60             bodies     in there at            that        time.

There        was a constant            stream of a m b u l a n c e s              collecting           injured       people

All    the        time we were         stood there              suppo r t e r s        leaving        the    ground were

A fter       a    while      I began        to feel       faint and             Ihave       to    leave     the     line.        t

moved a           short     distance         from the bodies, and                       sat      by the mesh fencing

until        I recovered.             Id o n ’t know how              long            I remained there, but                I

eventually              returned     to my         position          in the       line.

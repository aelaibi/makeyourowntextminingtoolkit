         Q53.       IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO

                    THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?



          I think that when people                come into the ground all they can see                is tne

         tunnel       to the   centre pens        in front of them.       1 think crowds are       like

         sheep and just follow one another not realising the side terraces had

         room in them. The dividing fences                    in the terraces stopped people

         moving to the empty areas at the sides.




         Signature of person interviewed                                                           ».

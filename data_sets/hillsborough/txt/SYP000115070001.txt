           At 0800 am on Saturday,       ISU^p^^VgS^           (150489),          I came on duty at

           Adwick Police Station where together with other officers                      I was picked

           up by the force     coach and taken to Doncaster Police Station.

           Here   I met up with the remainder of my s e r ial , ^yrtlmber 5 4 , under the
                               ...                                        J   _

           direction of PS £248 Sherratt and Inspector T o w n e n d .

           Once our serial was all       present we set off in a transit van for the

           Hillsborough Football Ground for the game between Liverpool and

           Nottingham Forest.

           At 1000 am this date we paraded and were briefed in the North Stand

           of the ground.      After a short meal we resumed to our serial- duties.

           We were engaged in the parking and uloading of L i ^ r f p o o 1 supporters

           coaches on C la yw heels L a n e .   Whilst doing this we were              informing each

           coach of the alcohol and banner          restrictions,        prior to the coaches

           emptying.

           At approximatley S.30 pm <1430) when the last coach had been parked

           and unloaded my serial      resumed to Halifax Road where we took up

           position outside the      'Gate*     public house.

           There were still a vast number of supporters and the majority of whom

           were Liverpool supporters Walking down from Halifax Road towards the
                                                                                   Pa g e
                                                                                   R434

ground.

Due to the main of these still          carrying and drinking         cans and bottles

of beer/lager/cider as they were walking down this road,                  I was

engaged   together with other officers stopping all supporters with

drink at this point and telling them to finish it here and the^e.

The ctf park wall of the       "Gate*        pub at this point was literally

covered in beerfcans and bottles that had been left behind.                   No one1

seemed to be in i hurry to get to the ground even though it was well

pa s t 2.30 pm (1430)   by t h i s M, im e

A great number of these jpfpporters were drunk at this point during



At 2.45 pm (1445) M e r e     was a report of a fight taking place            inside

                    I attended with my colleagues.                The back doors to

the pub were    locked but had been opened to a l l o w a few Liverpool               fans

inside.   An argument had occurred with some              local    lads but it had

resolved itself.     The landlord was advised accordingly.                There were

fans still    inside this pub at this time.

At 3.00 pm (1500) we were informed to clear the pub of supporters                       in

case of a recurrence of trouble.              The   landlord was to close for the

afternoon anyway.

At 3.20 pm (1520)    on the    instructions of Inspector Townend our serial

was told to make    its way to the ground.            There would appear to have

been some problem in the ground but I did not know what                  it was.

There was sounds of ambulances outside the ground.                   I heard a report

that a man had had a heart attack,             and assumed that was what the

ambulance was called for.

I got to the ground at 3.30 pm (1530).               There was a great deal of

confusion,    no one seemed to know what was happening.

We entered the ground from Peniston Road, at the side of the

gyjnnasium.    There was an ambulance situated at this point and laid
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         R434

out next to this was the body of a teenage         lad covered in a blanket*

1' received a report that two persons had been killed by a crowd

crush.   At this point PC 2718 Ward and myself were directed by

Inspector Townend te stop supporters walking from the Hop to the exit

where the dead body        was, with the ambulances.   More and more Forest

supporters from the        Spion Kop kept walking up to me asking to pass' by

to leave the ground,      many said they didn't want    children to see what

was going pn.       I did not know what had happened and tried to stop

these people from passing.         Eventually more a n d more kept coming to

leave the ground to PC Ward and myself had no choice but to let them

.pass.         '/

At this pa^nt       I walked up and looked over the crowd.     I couldn't

believe/what    I saw.     I was   confused as to what was taking   place.

Theraf was a great deal of activity on the field.         There was a great

raspy people running       around on the field at this end of the pitch.        I

rould see over a dozen people         laid out on the grass.   People were

using the advertising boards as stretchers and carrying these people

off the field to the back of the North Stand.          My serial was then

directed to assist where       possible.    I made my way to the rear of the

North Stand,    a great deal of activity was taking place with about

fifteen or twenty peop l e f laid out on stretchers obviously dead.

Family or friends w pre trying frantically to revive them,          screaming at

them to breathe,

I ran onto thpr pitch where I assisted in stj||et^cjT^^n^3^i^^o^ to

the back of the North Stand outside the gymnasium.

1' still did not know what had caused this tragedy 1' kept hearing

reports that fans, had rushed into the ground at Leppings Lane end at

the last minute and the ^urge forward had crushed those in front.

A Sergeant told me to make a cordon across the centre line of the

pitch as,there was the fear of a crowd invasion.          We were stopping

    people wandering from Leppings Lane end to the Spion Kop end

    Hundreds of fans were        crying and screaming,     many were just sat on the

    grass apparently        in a daze.



    No bji? seeded to know.        All I knew was that there were up to twenty

    pepons    near the gymnasium that looked de-ftd

                                                                                        at

    W   .should foe doing.      I had split up from mamy of my serial      in the

    confusion    .      There was no announcement on the public address system



    calling us murderers and it was all our fault.            What was our fault,        I

    did not know and neither did a great many other officers stood on the

    centre   1i n e «

    Eventually there was an announcement by Kenny Dalglish that there was

    a serious    incident taking place and for the hundreds of fans on the

    pitch to disperse and co-operate with the police and give

    assistance.         At this hundreds on the pitch in front of the West Stand

    began walking towards the terraces and clearing the pitch.              There was

    a further announcement that ticket stubs should be retained and the

    match would be abandoned.            There was no direction for us on the field

    as to what had caused the serious          incident.

    At 4.20 pm <1620)        on the instructions of Inspector Townend we

    gathered as many of our serial as we could find and resumed from the

    ground as we were not doing anything          constructive    just stood on the

    centre line.        We made our way back to Claywheels Lane,       to the

    Liverpool    coaches.      The fans that were also making their way back

    there shouted and called us ’Murdering Bastards,             it was all your

    fault, you've got your overtime         in and you're killing     people.*

    Even though these jibes were being made there was a lot of supporters

    who had from the ground gone to an off licence and were taking cans

          of beer back to the coaches.

          We were told to pass each coach driver the emergency number for

          persons to ring for details tff injured or missing         persons.   Almost

          every coach had people missing many having no idea of their

         . whereabouts.

     ■    Coach drivers and fans were informed that any persons          left after the

          coach had gone would be given transport to their homes.           No one would

          be left behind stranded.         Slowly the   coaches returned on their

          journey back from where they had come.

          At 6,15 pm <1815)        together with serial 34 I resumed to Claywheels

          Lane g a r a g e .   At around 7 pm <1900) we returned to Doncaster Police

          Station and then to Adwick Police Station Where I went off duty at

          8.00 pm (2000).

Stuart Anderson has brought to my attention a letter he has received from
Mervyn Jones dated 5 September, and 1 an extremely concerned about the
aooarent misunderstanding that atill seems tei aiHRtt ahnnf rh*» r n r m n f          /V(?
state of the criminal and discipline enquiry arising out of the Taylor
Report,

Having spoken to both yourself and latterly to Sir Richard Barratt I
understood that the Coroner's inquiry and the criminal inquiry were being
pursued with the vigour and awpfirfttlftn rh*f J-h* mxft-tr rj.qn-tt a b .
letter from Mr Jones indicates that this is not the case end I cannot
accept that the inquiry should be set aside to await the outcome of
discussions on finance.

Again it is wy understanding that all the evidence collected to date has
been stored on HOLMES and to quote from the Taylor Report ‘it is unlikely
that any further evidence gathered will significantly alter or add to the
history of events',

A.g*±n«fc fehi# background I am not cure what £e moant by 'b «u work' ether
then the interviews with the officers singled out for criticism by the
Taylor Report. Whilst^, I understand the difficulties created for you by
tha financial d*b*t« %otu««A th« Uon« Offie* and our v«ap«etivo Poltca
Authorities, I think it is intolerable, considering the strain imposed on
the officers involved, that this should introduce delay in bringing the
criminal and discipline inquiry to a speedy conclusion. In his letter
Mr Jones also implies my agreement to the continued involvement of Mr Cooper
in the disciplinary aspects of this enquiry, which is certainly not the
case. Your decision not to serve notices or pursue disciplinary matters
until the financial issue is resolved, whilst understood, does not have my
agreement.
In order to gain a better understanding of the problems faced by yourself
and Mr Jones, I would appreciate the opportunity to be up-dated on the
current state of the inquiry and on the work perceived necessary in order
to bring it to « conclusion.

In the meantime our investigation continues to satisfy the needs of the
Coroner. To a larse extent these enquiries are related to the criminal
inquiry and, therefore, nothing is o e m g lost at u u s m u c in impetus.

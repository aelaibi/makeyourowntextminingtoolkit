  On Saturday 15th April, 1989, I attended the F.A. Cup Semi-Final Fixture

  Liverpool and Notts. Forest, with my Wife,                          (Nursing Member)

  and                 (Ambulance Member), travelling in our own ambulance,

  registered number           and arriving at the ground at about 1.55 p.m.     We

  travelled from our Headquarters, 131 Psalter Lane, Ecclesall to the ground via

  Penistone Road and on that road I saw large groups of Notts. Forest fans both

  walking to the ground and in vehicles.    All these fans were in a carnival type

  good mood and I saw no trouble.    I can say that on passing the various public

  houses, along our route, I saw persons outside consuming drink, so I therefore

  assumed that they were full inside.    I also saw a number of fans, few in number,

  drinking from cans, which I presumed to be beer.



  All the licensed houses we passed were either on Penistone Road or adjacent to

  it.



  We entered the ground via the car park entrance off Penistone Road North and to

  the near of the South Stand where the ambulance was to be based.



  We all left the ambulance and reported at the the First Aid Roan where the

  majority of our members were already in attendance.     The St. Johns members

-usually involved work from half an hour or so prior to start of normal matches

 • till the end but for larger matches like semi-finals we usually attend 1.00s -

  p.m. or so till the end.   Upon the arrival of the rest of the members, all the

  .members.were allocated-positions.by ,_Da¥icLSenior (Div_Sup£.~) and. by. 2 .15~*un---

It was      around        this time      that     I could see that                   things were            easing as

Some        of the          casualties were               so badly     injured     by crushing           that   their

chest wall                 had    collapsed,         making       heart   compressions        impossible.

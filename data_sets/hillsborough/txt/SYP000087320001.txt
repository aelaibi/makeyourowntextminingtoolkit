            I did notice          o t h e r / s u p p o r te r s walking            to the        ground drinking            cans of

                 supporter.           I later      learned he had stopped the game.

               were    p ositioned about          10 - 12 feet           to my right        near to the       perimeter

               screamin g    but there were a few people                     pulling bodies         from the        pile and

               offering     1st aid and       resuscitation.               I was dased at first              but

               went    over and together with                         I pulled about         four   people     out and

               terraces     I told                who    had remained at the, fence                 (position 2 on

goal     posts.          The    time     now would now be about 3.30                pm (1530).           After

one or two minutes                   we w a l k ^ T ' o v e r and sat    in the N o rt h stand where a

lady unknown to us gay* us a drink.                             She     had a small     2" type

unaware       of the s it uation started                 chanting a m r s l o w      hand    clapped which

resulted         in a group of about 5 or 6 /Cive^pool                         supporters     run from

L ep p i n g s L.n towards            the S pi on Kop.          >ey were      stopped however            by a

line     of Police         officers across            the field w hich          I now feel        was a good

idea.       At the time              I did not feel        they should be there             but    I felt        that

way because             there were a          lot of people       in need of help.            Anyway

after      leaving        the N or th stand we met                        near the     corner flag.              We

left     the ground via the                 tunnel    under     the upper North West              terracing

and met                  back at the         car.

I feel       that       blame    for     the disaster         should be d ir ected        irv^s number           of

ways.       Suppo rt er s are           obv io us ly the reason periitieter^erices have

Old T ra f f o r d would have               been more      suitable. y T h e       club are       to blame        for-

ground design.                 There     should be no s e g r e ga ti on of terracing at

Leppi ng s L n .          There       should be no tunnel             direc tl y behind goal.             If

s eg r e g a t i o n    remains as         people are      directed towards           terraces      from that

d i r e ct io n only it should               be one or the other.               If there was        no fencing

this would not have                   happened.       1 feel     that     the Police      in S h e f f i e l d

             I did not witness a ny thing           I consider        to be a criminal      offence.

             I also feel        that    if as m edia   coverage       has s ug gested the    police made

            d e cision s     regarding a l l o c a t i o n of ends      then    inevitably blame    should

 w     HILLSBOROUGH:   COSTS OF INQUIRIES BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE



      I attach a further letter from West Midlands Police Authority
  pointing out that no reply has yet been received to their letter
  of 4 May and seeking a meeting with the Home Secretary. The Home
  Secretary has seen this and has asked that they should be seen by
  Lord Ferrers or senior officials.  I should be grateful if Ms
  Adams could let you know as soon as possible whether Lord Ferrers
  is happy to see them. When this has been settled your letter to
  Mr Astling can issue, amended accordingly, since the Home
  Secretary has seen your submission of 28 April and agreed the
  draft subject to the views of Lord Ferrers and Sir Clive
  Whitmore. Neither had any comments on the draft reply to West
  Midlands. As you know, Sir Clive has, however, commented on the
  draft letter to South Yorkshire. I shall show the Home Secretary
  Mr Yates' minute of 4 May over the weekend and will let you know
  on Monday whether the Home Secretary is content for your letter
  to South Yorkshire to issue.

         Judicial Review - Hillsborough Football Tragedy


         I am writing to ask if you personally #111 meet with a deputation from this
         Authority as a matter of extreme urgency to discuss the matter of the recovery
         of costs incurred by the West Midlands Force by virtue o£ its Involvement in
         the judicial inquiry Into the Hillsborough tragedy.

         This request derives from a special meeting of the Authority held this morning
         and the fact that no response has been received to date to my letter of
         25th April, 1989, seeking confirmation that this Authority would be reimbursed
         in full for any additional costs it incurred In this matter.

         X should be glad if you would let me have, as soon as possible please, date a
         when the Authority's deputation may meet with you.

         Tours Bincerely,



                                                  -

            "jear

           Thank you for your recent letter to the Prime Minister which
           has been passed to this department in view of our
           responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I
           apologise for the delay in replying to you.

           Unfortunately I am unable to send you a copy of Lord Justice
           Taylor's Final Report on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.
           However, it is available for Her Majesty's Stationery Office
           bookshops (code no ISBN 0 10 109622 4) at £10.50.  Your
           nearest HMSO is at 9-21 Princess Street, Manchester M60 8AS
           (061 834 721).  I hope this information is of use to you.

                                                                           Yours sincerely

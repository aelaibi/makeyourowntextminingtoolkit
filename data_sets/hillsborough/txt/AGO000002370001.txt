You will wish to see the attached transcript from Hansard oft an

adjournment debate on Friday, 24th January.          It is the first

indication to myself or anyone in LSLO that Hillsborough was

being debated.



You had already had an approach from Mr George Howarth MP for a

meeting to discuss Hillsborough and that is now arranged for

Wednesday the 18th February.       I shall provide a full briefing.



For the moment, it is sufficient to say that your only respon­

sibility in this field arises under section 13 of the Coroners

Act 1988 in consenting to the making of applications to the High

Court for orders quashing inquisitions.       Subject to one point,

nothing has so far been placed before you to indicate that any

of the statutory grounds for quashing an inquisition exist.              In

short    there must be   either   fresh evidence,    insufficiency of

enquiry, material irregularity or other good cause and it must

be in the interests of justice that there should be a fresh

inquest.



You will note that Mr Howarth himself says (at column 67 8j:



        "I am not criticising the conduct of the inquest, just

        the structure and procedures that it was obliged to

        use.    I do not believe that    it satisfactorily or
        adequately answered any of the questions raised in the

        interim report".



Mr Gerald Bermingham intervened to say:



        "I agree   that the inquest was conducted as fairlyas

        it could   be, but perhaps it was the wrong format to

        adopt in a case of multiple death.            Should not we

        devise a better system that would enable each family

        to help ease its personal pain?"



The position remains that there is nothing which would justify

the      time and effort of    somebody from this office or counsel

instructed on      your behalf combing the transcript of theinquest

(which took more than 100 days) to see whether any grounds might

exist for an application under section 13 of the 1988 Act.               Even

then,    that person might be required to address rather wider

issues:    neither "fresh evidence" nor "insufficiency of enquiry"

would    necessarily   be   obvious   from   simply   a   reading   of    the

transcript.        At the moment we have no more tangible criticism

of the inquest than that        it did not make       the families feel

satisfied that enough had been done to hold the organisations or

individuals concerned responsible for their actions.



The only qualification to the above is that Mr Malcolm Thornton

wrote to you earlier this month on behalf of a constituent who

was dissatisfied with aspects of the inquest as regards her son.
*   ■'V




          The MP did not, however, enclose the relevant inquest papers and

          we asked for them.   Those papers arrived today and I shall be

          reading them over the weekend.     I will advise further as to

          whether those papers in any way change my view.

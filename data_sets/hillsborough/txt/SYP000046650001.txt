Summary and Findings

This     is    the        First    Report    of    the      research       project:

'Hillsborough             and     After:    The        Liverpool     Experience',

commissioned         by     the Liverpool City Council.              It   has     been

researched,        written and produced collectively by the                      four-

person       research       team    but     has   drawn     on     resources      made

available       by other individuals and organisations.                    A     range

of     people have supported and assisted with the project                         but

we     are    particularly         grateful       to    Tommy    Smith,    Research

Officer to the Hillsborough Working Party at Liverpool                            City

Council        and        to    Barry     Devonside,       Secretary        to     the

Hillsborough Families Support Group.                     Our colleagues at         the

Centre       for     Studies in Crime and Social Justice                  have    been

generous in their support to the project.


The     project       was established in October 1989 and                  its    main

objectives were defined as follows.



 1      To monitor the Home Office Inquiry under Lord                            Justic
        Taylor and to present a thorough appraisal                               of it
        findings;

         consider the implications of its       recommendations,
         particularly with regard to liability or prosecution;

 3.

         controversial deaths;

 4.
5.       To consider the impact of negative images of Merseyside
         and of its people on media reporting, political comment
         and proposed policies;
6        To make recommendations on all aspects of the research
         particularly concerning the response of agencies to the
         Disaster   (i.e. police,   social services,    emergency
         services, finance - including the Disaster Fund).


Initially the research team took a decision not to                         approach

the      bereaved       families but to make its work             known     to     the

Hillsborough Families Support Group and to those involved in

giving      advice and support to survivors.               Gradually, as           the

work      has    become        more fully    developed,      a    close     working

relationship         has been established between the team and                     the

Support Group.            Through the contributions of families to the

project the emphasis of the research has shifted.                         It became

apparent        that      there    was going to be a major          gap     in     the

official         inquiries concerning the events immediately                     after

the Disaster through to the next day.                 Yet it was the shared

experiences         of     many people that what happened to               them       in

 Sheffield        during those hours had contributed                considerably

 to their grief          and   anguish.     Thus the research team          decided

    to   investigate       thoroughly       the events     that    followed        the

    Disaster:     the     emergency       response   and    the    procedure          at

    hospitals;      the    use    of the     Hillsborough        gymnasium       as      a

    temporary     mortuary and the process of              identification;            the

    co-ordination         of the various agencies and the            problems          of

    communication         and consultation; the role of the               police       in

    the immediate aftermath; the treatment of bereaved                      families

    and their experiences of searching for and identifying their
relatives.       This work has involved extensive interviewing of

families,      social workers, hospital               administrators,          senior

police officers and others directly involved on the night of

the Disaster.



The    First     Report        is     presented     in    six   chapters.           The

introductory       chapter considers the impact of the                      Disaster,

the    context of the Home Office Inquiry under                      Lord    Justice

Taylor     and    the need for in-depth              research.        Chapter       Two

considers        the relationship between crowd safety                  and        crowd

control     within the broader context, prevalent in the                           1970s

and 1980s, of 'hooligan hysteria'.                   This chapter shows             that

the    dominant      theme          concerning soccer over       the        last     two

decades has been 'hooliganism'.                    It has been consolidated by

media coverage, political comment and academic research and,

as     a    direct       consequence,        crowd       behaviour     and         crowd

management         has         been     viewed      through     the     'lens         of

hooliganism'.            The        result   has    been policing       based         on

surveillance, regulation and control with concerns of                              crowd

 safety,     ground       facilities and civil             liberties    neglected.

 Furthermore, key issues such as male dominance,                       nationalism

 and   racism have been ignored as substantive problems                            which

 exist within soccer at all its levels: terraces; boardrooms;

 administration;           media        coverage.         The    Project       finds,

 therefore, that crowd control has been developed within                             the

 context       of broad assumptions relating to 'hooliganism                         and

 key considerations such as crowd safety, civil liberties and
adequate facilities have been sacrificed.                           This has led to a

prevalent          attitude          in      policing formulated                  solely        on

'managing          trouble'           at       the    expense           of        all        else.

Consequently,            the     safety of people at soccer                       grounds      has

become secondary to the control of the crowd.



Chapter       Three provides a critical appraisal of the                                     Taylor

Inquiry,       its       two        reports and      its     main       recommendations.

While     recognising               the    substantive       achievements               of      the

Inquiry       it     examines the remit, the chosen                      priorities             for

investigation, the balance or weighting of evidence and                                         the

short     time available for completion.                         The analysis            concurs

with Lord Justice Taylor in terms of the principal cause                                         of

the     Disaster          (overcrowding)             and    the     principal                reason

(failure       in     policing)            but   finds      that     the          Inquiry       was

restricted          in that it did not include serious events                                 which

occurred in the immediate aftermath of the Disaster, that it

did     not    address the broader issue of                       police          preparation,

briefing       and accountability and it tended to hold                                 back     in

 its criticism of other agencies involved.                              Further,          despite

 recognising          that          'hooliganism'          was    not     an        issue        at

 Hillsborough         the Final Report devoted considerable time                                 to

 considering             the        'hooliganism'      issue,       particularly                the

 evaluation         of     the        1989     Football      Spectators            Act.        This

 practice,         both        in    Popplewell and Taylor,                  to    present        an

 'Interim' Report solely concerned with a specific issue                                         and

 a 'Final Report' based on a broad sweep is regrettable
particularly       as    other     matters   central      to     the       specific

concern are omitted.



Chapter Four focuses on the media coverage of the                      Disaster.

This     extensive       chapter    considers      the    use    of        explicit

descriptions       and     photographs,      the    obsessive         search       for

causation and the early allocation of blame, the                       persistent

reference to crowd violence and 'hooliganism' and the impact

of intrusive journalism on families.                There is little in the

coverage of Hillsborough which shows the press in a positive

light.      The     project      finds that in      the    media s         rush     to

judgement       many news stories and editorials 'got it                    wrong .

At     the hard end of the continuum there were crass                      examples

of fabrication, at the soft end was innuendo, inference                            and

careless        reporting.         The   decision    to    publish          certain

photographs and to write insensitive descriptions caused not

 only widespread anger but deep, personal suffering.                        Editors

 not    only permitted but actively encouraged                  journalists         to

 generate stories concerned with 'hooliganism' and one of the

 worst excesses in 'quality' news coverage as well as in                           the

 tabloids,      was the introduction of what this Project                     refers

 to    as the 'Heysel factor'.           The utilisation of            a    negative

 image     of     Merseyside and its people was            often       gratuitous,

 generating a form of collective guilt and responsibility for

 the     Hillsborough       Disaster.     The Project finds a              range     of

 examples of intrusive journalism which exacerbated the                            pain

 and anguish
of    the bereaved and injured.               Finally, the response of          the

Press Council to the complaints which it received once again

provided       evidence      of    its    reluctance     to       act   and     its

ineffectiveness when it does.                 Unless the industry        supports

its supposed commitment to self-regulation on these matters,

it    will provoke a form of censorship based on reaction                       and

restraint.


Chapter Five deals with the events in Sheffield on the night

of    the     Disaster.     It considers the         effectiveness        of        the

'emergency         plan';   the co-ordination of            and    communication

between       agencies;      the   operation of       the     gymnasium        as     a

temporary       mortuary; the process of identification                  and        the

taking        of     statements;     the       relationship        between          the

hospitals,         the Boys' Club, the Medico-Legal Centre and                      the

Hillsborough          gymnasium.         In    considering        the   role        and

 effectiveness of the professional agencies involved it                         will

 rely    on    the experiences of families             and     others     directly

 involved with the process.               The Project found many examples

 of     good       professional     practice,       personal        courage         and

 initiative but also it found fundamental issues of                       concern.

 Specifically, the lack of co-ordination and direction at the

 time of the Disaster, on the pitch, behind the Leppings Lane

 stand and, initially, in the designated clearance area - the

 gymnasium         - probably cost lives and added to the                suffering

 of     the injured.        The lack of triage in these locations                    and

 the apparent inability of people 'on duty' to react
positively      and    effectively        was    an     indictment         of     their

professional          training      and      pre-match         briefing.             The

inadequacy of the emergency facilities at the ground and the

under-preparation          of      the     facility      and       its        stewards

demonstrated       a cavalier approach by the club to the                        safety

and    well-being of paying customers. It was in keeping                             with

the    poor     fabric     of the terracing, the             inability          of    the

turnstiles       to cope with the through-flow of supporters                          and

the    absence     of checks on overcrowding in                   the    pens.        The

project       finds tha* there was an excellent response                        at    the

hospitals       although     the    means of      passing          information            to

waiting relatives and friends was inappropriate.                          The use of

the     disused    boys'     club     as a      holding      area       for     waiting

relatives       and the 'stacking' on buses of those                      waiting         to

identify       the dead were wholly inappropriate choices.                           They

were     made for professional convenience rather than                          in    the

best interests of the bereaved.



 The    most    contentious findings in               this   chapter,         however,

 relate    to the use of the gymnasium as a temporary                           mortuary

 and    the role of the police throughout the                     procedure.              The

 Project       finds     that the designation of the gymnasium                       as     a

 temporary        mortuary,        which     resulted        in     bodies           being

 transported back from the hospital mortuaries, set in motion

 a     procedure of identification which                accentuated           suffering

 and     demonstrated limited understanding of the needs of                               the

 bereaved.         The     physical       environment        of     the       makeshift
mortuary,        the      long      periods         of      waiting          to       make

identification,          the restrictions on information given                        out,

the use of Polaroid photographs to create a 'gallery                                of the

dead     to    which     all     were    subjected         in     making          'initial

identification',          the presentation of bodies -                    dishevelled,

and    in body bags, the emphasis on speed with                         no     provision

for privacy or grieving and the gathering of evidence by the

C.I.D.        immediately      after identification               together         created

circumstances          which were clinical and inhumane.                      They    were

circumstances in which many workers from the caring agencies

experienced difficulty in counselling the bereaved.



Throughout        the     long delays for families                and     friends      the

information           supply and communications were                virtually         non­

existent.        The Project finds that the central police role in

 the     co-ordination           and    control      of     the         procedure        of

 identification created an atmosphere more akin to processing

 and     gathering       evidence       than   to        easing    the       stress      of

 bereavement.           While workers from other                agencies          disagreed

 strongly with the decision to use the gymnasium and with the

 adopted procedures, the police, as the lead agency, affirmed

 their priorities effectively subordinating the                              professional

 judgement        of the other agencies involved.                   The       alternative

 was     to     use     the    Medico-Legal     Centre          which        could     have

 accommodated the dead, provided a more suitable facility for

 the bereaved and presented the bodies in a more                              appropriate

 and humane form.             The use of the Centre, however, would                     not
have challenged the overall direction of the police                    and this

issue     requires     further analysis in terms of            the     conflict

between     policing and caring, the dynamics             of     inter-agency

co-operation         and   the    need   for      effective      arrangements

governing      the     accountability        of     the police         to     the

communities they serve.           These issues will be pursued in the

Second Report.



The final, albeit brief, chapter considers the operation and

administration        of   the Hillsborough Disaster            Appeal      Fund.

While recognising the achievements of the Fund, this chapter

raises     questions concerning the criteria for allocation                    of

awards, accountability for decisions, the impact of payments

on families, the effect of payments on welfare benefits                       and

the     effect of media coverage on those             receiving        payments.

The Project finds that the trustees do not intend to publish

even     broad criteria upon which payments have been made                    and

that there exists no requirement concerning                    accountability.

Further,     the Project finds that welfare benefits have                    been

affected by Fund payments and no exemption is to be granted.

Families     have     expressed their concern           over     the    apparent

inconsistencies        in payments and anomalies in the                treatment

of some relatives.         Tensions over payments were               exacerbated

by      insensitive newspaper coverage.            These issues have         been

 included    briefly       in    the First     Report    because       of   their

 immediate significance but they will be developed further in

 the Second Report.

The     Research             Project    is    in        broad     agreement          with       the

recommendations                made    by    Lord       Justice     Taylor       concerning

safety        at soccer•grounds, planning and                      co-ordination,               the

duties          and     responsibilities            of     the      parties           directly

involved.             In certain instances, such as all-seater                             stadia

or     the      continuing use of perimeter                     fencing,       the        Project

disagrees          with        Lord    Justice      Taylor.         Elsewhere             it     is

considered            that he does not go far enough                    in     establishing

new      working         arrangements for the              safe     administration               of

 soccer.          This        would    apply       to    issues     concerning             police

 strategies           and      briefings and procedures                 for    establishing

 effective          accountability.            It       would     extend       further           to

 include         the     direct        involvement of           fans,     through          proper

 representation, in all aspects of the game's                                 administration

 from       club       level through to national level.                        Many       of    the

 Project's          recommendations concerning the areas                         covered         by

 Lord       Justice          Taylor are detailed in              Chapter        Three.          The

  following            recommendations,             however,       provide            a        clear

  indication of the limitations of the Home Office Inquiry and

  arise       directly          from    the findings of            Phase       One        of    this

  Project.

  p.t'omH Sa-fet.v. pm icing and the Rights of Spectators

  1.       At all levels of the game the issue of crowd safety
           should be addressed independently of matters relating
           to soccer-related violence.




                                                                                                       r
2.        At all levels of the game current policies         and
           practices relating to crowd control should be re­
           assessed to take consideration of the civil rights of
           spectators.


3.        All pitch perimeter fencing and radial segregatory
           fencing within terrace sections should be removed.


4         Recent    statutory   provision, under the  Football
           Spectators' Act,   for a national membership scheme
           should be withdrawn.


5.        There should be improved and close liaison between    all
           agencies concerned with safety at soccer grounds     with
           no single agency possessing the power of veto        over
           others on operational matters.


6.        The policing and regulation of soccer crowds should be
           governed by a locally devised operational programme
           which should be appraised regularly by a         Safety
           Advisory Committee.


7         The police should be accountable to the Safety Advisory
           Committee for all aspects of operational policy and
           practice within the ground.



 S_       There should be full consultation with supporters,
           through the Football Supporters' Association and the
           local Suppporters' Clubs, on all matters relating to
           crowd management and the provision of services and
           facilities at games.


 9.       There is an urgent need for further research into crowd
           safety,  the policing of spectators and the needs of
           spectators as consumers.



Thft Ro3a and Conatitution of Official       IlWliri&g   IntQ
Disaster

    10.    Official inquiries into disasters should be instructed
           to consider the wider implications of the management of
           and response to events by the relevant agencies.

                                     xi
11.    There should be limitations on the breadth of the remit
       of such inquiries thus confining the work of inquiries
       to matters of direct relevance to the events.


12.    The practice of interim and fin&l reports should be
       ended and replaced, where necessary, by the publication
       of reports of equal status [i.e.   First and    Second
       Reports].



13.    Wherever possible official inquiries should be staffed
       and administered to by independent agencies,   such as
       academic research teams.


       Official inquiries should be required to make public
       the criteria used in the selection of evidence and the
       relative weighting given to evidence.


15.    There should be publication and justification         of
       methodologies used in inquiries and specific details of
        interview procedures, the presentation of evidence, the
        lay-out of questionnaires, etc.


Thft Role and Funntion of the Media in the Aftermath— of
Dlsastera-

 16    There is required a clear acceptance by the press and
        broadcast   media that those bereaved,     injured    or
        affected by disasters have a right to privacy and a
        right   to be protected from additional        suffering
        occasioned by the publication of explicit photographs
        or descriptions or by intrusive journalism.


 17.    The behaviour of journalists and photographers should
        be governed by current 'codes of conduct^ relating to
        privacy and intrusion which exist within the media
        unions,   the Press Council and     the   Broadcasting
        Standards Counc i1.

 18     Existing 'codes of conduct' should be re assessed    and
        re-written to include sections specifically on       the
        reporting of disasters.
19.   The selection of photographs and the publication     of
      descriptions of individuals should be determined by the
       identifiable effects on the bereaved, the injured and
      the emergency service workers.


20.   A 'code of practice' concerning the media coverage of
       disasters should operate on the basis of self -
       regulation with the proviso that persistent breaking of
       the code will lead to statutory control.


21.   News organisations should      attribute all sources    in
       which serious allegations     are made and presented   as
       factual accounts.


22. Coverage should provide a balance of sources and guard
     against   the   establishment   and   maintenance   of
     'hierarchies of credibility' based solely on       the
     'official' status of statements or information.


23    All agencies concerned with responding, both short-term
      and long-term, to a disaster should provide factual and
      accurate accounts of their operational strategies,
      practices and responses.


24     As part of local disaster plans local authorities
       should establish provision for intensive media coverage
       including centralised facilities, close liaison with
       agencies and consultation with local press officers.


25     In   the   immediate aftermath of a      disaster    all
       individuals directly affected should be provided with
       information concerning the role of the media,        the
       practices regularly adopted by journalists, the rights
       of the individual and the procedures for          making
       complaints.

 26    All press    and broadcast media should make provision for
        a 'right     of reply' in those situations in which a
        breach of   the 'code of practice' has been established.

 PftRonnding t,o Disasters

 27    The guiding principle   in responding to disasters should
       be the provision of     facilities and procedures which
       prioritise the needs    of the bereaved and the injured
       and to those who work   with them in a caring capacity.

                                 xiii
28.    Temporary,   or   makeshift,    mortuaries  should    be
        provisions of last resort      and, wherever possible,
        mortuaries and staff with      bereavement  counselling
        experience should be used.


29.    Procedures of identification should be handled        with
       extreme   care and sensitivity and should include     full
       and proper provision for the bereaved to spend        time
       with the deceased.


30     In   disasters   such as Hillsborough the       use     of
       photographs for identification purposes should          be
       adopted    inconjunction   with   other   forms         of
       categorisation such as sex, age, clothing, etc.


31.    Every effort should be made to make the procedure
        of identification a private and discrete experience
       within     the   grieving process and not   to  allow
        professional convenience take priority over personal
        needs.

32.    The dead should be presented to      the   bereaved   with
        dignity, as is normal practice.


33. Body-bags should never be used in the presentation         of
     the deceased to the bereaved.


 34    Proper   facilities including    appropriate   physical
        conditions and full medical and social        services
        support should be provided to the bereaved both before
        and after identification.



 35.    Relatives and friends waiting to identify victims of    a
         disaster should be given access to full information    on
         the procedures and the reasons for their adoption.


 36     Authorities should take care to provide        accurate
         information and to make it public in a sensitive manner
         - public announcements are inappropriate.


 37. Proper systems of communication should be established
      to enable relatives to communicate with their families.


                                 xiv
38.    There should be full co-operation between agencies
       concerned with the immediate aftermath of a disaster
       with the caring agencies given the lead-role        in
       assessing the needs of the bereaved and the process of
       identification.


39.    In the immediate aftermath of a disaster there should
       be no intrusion into the process of identification by
        the demands of any police investigation which has been
        established.


40.    Facilities,  such as the Medico-Legal Centre,    should
       make adequate provision for the viewing of bodies and
        for physical contact to be made by the bereaved if so
        desired.


41.    There is an urgent need for further research into the
       management of personal welfare of those bereaved and
       injured in disasters.


42.    Professional   and   voluntary workers    involved   in
       responding to a disaster and its aftermath should    be
       provided with a programme of counselling.


43.    Each agency concerned in responding to a disaster
       should be obliged, as part of a local disaster plan, to
       provide a thorough overview and evaluation of its
       response to the local authority.

Disaster Funds                         .

44.     There should be no loss of income-related benefits as a
        result of payments made to the bereaved,   the injured
        and the survivors of disasters.


 45.    Disaster Fund payments should be treated as   one off
        payments exempt from taxation or from welfare benefit
        calculation.


 46.    Information regarding the availability of       welfare
        rights advice services (e.g. Advice Centres, CABx,
        Unemployed   Centres)   should    be  made   known   to
        beneficiaries so that those people encountering benefit
        problems can readily seek advice.
47.   Welfare Rights'   advisors should            advise    trustees on
      matters appertaining to the D.S.S.


48.   Trusteesshould make available guidelines     concerning
      the methods of assessment to all beneficiaries.


49.   General   criteria used in the assessment    of             awards
      should be made public in the Trustees' reports.


50.   There   should be an accessible system of                   review
      established   to  enable beneficiaries to                  request
      reassessment.


Finally,    the      First   Report     of   the    Research     Project

demonstrates      clearly that all issues relating to          disasters

and their aftermath are under-researched. There is an urgent

need to respond to the fullrange of concerns raised by               this

Report.    Further recommendations, on the           legal     processes,

the   coroner's inquest, the work of state agencies and            other,

broader issues will be made in the Second Report.

THE HILLSBOROUGH PROJECT: AM INTRODUCTION
The Impact- nf the Hillsborough Disaster


On    the   afternoon of the 15th April 1989 the            most    serious

disaster     at any sporting or organised leisure event in                the

U.K. occurred at Hillsborough Football Stadium in Sheffield.

The    officially-recorded        statistics show    that     ninety-five

people      died, four hundred received hospital        treatment         and

seven hundred and thirty were injured [1].            These statistics

do    not, and cannot, record the full extent of the               Disaster

and    its victims.       It is clear from the experiences of          many

concerned with counselling survivors since the Disaster that

an     inestimable    number of people received       actual       physical

injury but did not seek immediate medical help [2].                  Claims

for     compensation made to the Hillsborough         Disaster       Appeal

Fund     provide no more concrete or substantive indication                of

the     numbers    involved as a further     inestimable       number      of

people have declined to pursue claims for a range of reasons

[3].     In addition to the 'hidden figure' of physical              injury

is     the massive number of people, many of whom were              not    at

Hillsborough,        who have suffered severe       mental anguish         and

debilitating       trauma.     Again the evidence suggests          that     a

 substantial number have suffered alone and, typically,                   have

 refused     to   speak    with   anyone   about    their    experiences.

 Others, however, cannot stop talking about their experiences

 as the Disaster has come to dominate their lives.                 Recurrent

 nightmares and fundamental changes in behaviour are further,

 regular long-term effects endured by survivors, friends                   and

 relatives.       Thus any attempt to establish the real            'extent



                                     2
of    the Hillsborough Disaster is impossible if                          not       futile.

It    remains apparent, however, that several thousand                               people

have been deeply affected and it will be a long time                                 before

recoveries            from physical and mental injuries will be                          made.

For some,         'full recovery' will never be possible.



A     further dimension of the Disaster which took                         its       direct

and     indirect effects beyond those immediately involved                                 was

that        it occurred in a situation with which many people                              are

familiar.             As   some time in most           individuals         lives          they

attend       a     mass     public occasion        —    at     rallies,         religious

gatherings,            sporting      events, rock        concerts,        etc.           Large

crowds           at    major   public     venues        are    not      unusual                and

    overcrowding'          — on trains, in shops, on stairways —                          is     a

taken-for-granted feature of daily life in towns and cities.

There        exists        a form of collective 'act of              faith           in        the

licensing,            policing, management and organisation of                           events

and     of 'safe passage' through public facilities.                                As     with

other        recent disasters: Zeebrugge; Bradford;                     Kings            Cross;

Clapham;              Hillsborough       provoked         a     deep           sense            of

 identification              which     manifested         itself          in         typical

 expressions: "it could have happened to me"; "it could                                    have

 happened             anywhere";        "it    could             have           been            my

    son/daughter/mother/father/friend".                       This   is        in        marked

    contrast to the comments made by Directors of other football

    clubs    who       commented     to Lord Justice           Taylor      that           ...it

    couldn't have happened here” [4].




                                           3
In addition to this sense of identification was the terrible

reality that the Disaster unfolded literally before the eyes

of     the     nation.        As     with    the     Bradford        Fire        in      1985,

television cameras deployed to cover a crucial soccer                                   match

from     every        possible       angle    became        the     transmitters            of

tragedy.        The Saturday afternoon B.B.C. Grandstand programme

was     interrupted to relay live coverage of the chaos                                behind

the     goal     at     the Leppings Lane            End     of    the      Hillsborough

Stadium.        By the time it was apparent that death and                              injury

had     occurred        on    a    mass      scale     it    was     too     late.         The

television        audience,          many of whom had             stood     on        terraces

similar to Hillsborough, watched the confusion,                              desperation

and     organisational             ineptitude        with    a     growing        sense     of

disbelief.            Unlike the Bradford Disaster in which the                           fire

was     the     tangible, immediate and horrific                     explanation           for

tragedy, at Hillsborough there was no self-evident reason as

to why the situation had become so serious.                           This gave           rise

to      a      whole         range     of      uncorroborated              claims          and

unsubstantiated              theories which dominated media coverage                        in

the     months that followed.                Despite the Home Office                   inquiry

and     its clear findings these explanations, based                              often     on

little        more     than assumptions and prejudice,                     retain        their

credibility           and, as discussed later, continue to be                           voiced

in the media and by senior police representatives.



Finally,        the     Hillsborough Disaster occurred at                        a     soccer-

match,        arguably one of the three most                     significant           matches
played        in     England       during      any   season.            The       relative

importance          of an F.A. Cup Semi-Final is emphasised                          by    its

location           at    a 'neutral' ground. This match,                  as      with       an

identical           fixture        a    year    earlier,          was         particularly

significant          as the participants, Liverpool                     and     Nottingham

Forest, were two of the most successful clubs of the decade.

As     the    media        continually has pointed out,                  and     this      was

endorsed           by Lord Justice Taylor, soccer has the                       status of

being        England's 'national game.' It is not clearon                            which

criteria           this judgement is made. Possibly it is                        based       on

participation            at    both amateur and professional                    levels       or

possibly on regular attendance figures.                       Certainly it enjoys

privileged and extensive coverage in terms of column                                  inches

in daily newspapers with every utterance, cliche and crossed

word     of     its      players       and     managers    reported            with       hyped

headlines and sensationalised drama.                      Whatever criteria                 are

employed to underwrite the 'national game                          status, the claim

consistently            ignores that in participation, attendance                           and

reporting          soccer remains a male preserve.



The     ascribed         status        of soccer     as    the.     nation s              game,

whatever its legitimacy, has come to dominate all aspects of

 the     debate         around its identifiable 'ills               and        its    future

 both     on and off the field.                Alongside this is the issue                   of

 national          pride      in   the game and England s               role     in       world

 soccer.       Lord Justice Taylor invoked this world role when he

 stated:
           Football is our national game.    We
           gave it to the world.  But its image
           in our country has been tarnished.
           [5]


This highly possessive, if not imperialist, construction                               of

soccer     presents an image of the               nation     as    a     homogeneous

entity.    What        it fails to acknowledge            is that        soccer,       in

terms of its administration, organisation and                          presentation,

is   riven by class divisions.               In its contemporary form                 the

professional          game     is controlled and         managed        by    affluent

'owners'        and           the paying        customers       have          remained

marginalised, their 'interests' barely recognised.                             In    that

sense professional soccer is one of the crudest examples                               of

class     division           with boardrooms aloof from the                  needs    and

demands    of     the       terraces.      By     contrast,       the        facilities

provided     to       the occupants of          the    expensive         hospitality

boxes',    usually           rented   to companies        and     other       business

interests, are first-rate.



Further,        it        is the capacity of the game's            officials          and

participants,             of politicians and of media commentators                    and

journalists          to    overstate     the     role    and      significance         of

soccer. It        is an overstatement unique in both                      sports       and

leisure      industries.         This    context,       with      its        taken—for-

granted assumptions about the                   golden age      of soccer,           about

 'hard    but     fair'       play,     about     'passionate       but       sporting'

 behaviour        on          the terraces       and    about     the         part-time

 professionals who played for 'love not money', has                            produced

 a romanticised version of soccer's history against which its
critics are judged as heretics.



The     Hillsborough             Disaster     has     been    represented         as     a

watershed in English soccer, the moment which will transform

the     game 'blighted' by old grounds,                    appalling       facilities,

crowd     disorder and violence, drunkenness                      and     out-of-touch

administration into a spectator sport to be enjoyed,                              rather

than     endured, by the 'family'.                  The intention is to           regain

its dignity, retain its passion and, most of all, return its

supporters       to the "rounds.             Lord Justice Taylor, in              little

more     than nine months, produced two detailed reports                           which

moved beyond the immediate brief of examining the events                                 on

the     day and extended into a broad range of related                            issues.

Clearly     his concern was not only the avoidance                         of    further

disasters       but        also    to      provide     guidelines       through        his

recommendations              which,        taken     together,      will        transform

professional soccer and its presentation to the public.



The Taylor Reports and the Role of Government Inquiries


Given     the    broader          context of         the   Hillsborough          disaster

outlined        above       it    was      inevitable      that     the     Government

announced        a    Home        Office inquiry, more            usually       called    a

public     inquiry,          into       the circumstances.           The    then       Home

Secretary,           Douglas       Hurd,     appointed       Lord    Justice       Taylor

within two days of the tragedy.                      The Assessors, appointed to

assist him, were the Chief Constable of Lancashire, Mr Brian

Johnson     and        a    Professor        of    Mechanical       Engineering,         Dr
Leonard       Maunder.          The Inquiry's terms           of     reference       were

short     and       to the point, while allowing scope                  for     broader

investigation:

              To inquire into     the events   at
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground
              on   15 April 1989 -and to     make
              recommendations about the needs of
              crowd control and safety at sports
              events. [6]

Governments set up official inquiries more or less at                                their

discretion.             When    major      crises    occur,        however,     it        is

difficult          to    resist the public and          media        pressure     which

clamours        for a full, independent inquiry into events and                            a

review of the relevant and appropriate procedures.                            Examples

of    major        state       inquiries     demonstrate       the      point:        Lord

Widgery's 1972 Inquiry in Northern Ireland concerning Bloody

Sunday;       Lord Scarman's 1974 Inquiry into the events at                           Red

Lion    Square and his 1981 Inquiry                  into     civil     disorder          in

Brixton.        Each of these Inquiries focused on public disorder

and     its     regulation by the military and                 the      police.        The

events,        including         the    loss of life,       were      considered          so

serious that independent inquiries were demanded and granted

through the appointment of a senior judge.                          It is the use of

the     judiciary            by Governments which applies the               veneer        of

independence            while     appropriating       necessary professional

expertise           and       judgements.      The    role     and     function           of

Government          Inquiries,         however, has been           criticised        on     a

series        of    points: that they are given terms                  of     reference

established             by    the government of the day;             that     they        are

required to report within a restricted time-span; that                                they
are    serviced by civil servants/professional                   assessors        who

are not necessarily independent; that they define 'relevant'

or     'significant'          evidence    on the basis     of        criteria     not

published      or negotiated.            The main issue here is          not     that

Government inquiries inevitably show bias but that the faith

given to them as independent and public should not be                           blind

to their limitations.




Lord     Justice Taylor's Inquiry is not the               first        government

inquiry      into       issues relating to soccer         in     recent        years.

Since     the setting up of the Chester Inquiry in 1966,                        which

was      given      a   broad     brief     concerning    the          state       of

Association Football, there have been seven working group or

inquiry reports commissioned by the Department of                        Education

and     Science,        and    Home Office or     the    Department        of     the

Environment         [73-      The most recent, the       Popplewell        Report,

illustrates exactly the problem of direction which can beset

Government         Inquiries.      By a most unfortunate coincidence                a

disaster      of hitherto unprecedented proportions of                    Bradford

City's       Football Ground occurred on the same afternoon as                      a

serious crowd disturbance at the ground of Birmingham                           City.

Fifty-six people died in a fire in the stand at Bradford                           as

the large crowd and television audience looked on in horror.

At     Birmingham        there was crowd violence on             a    large     scale

which resulted in injuries.                Mr Justice Popplewell           referred

 to    the    Birmingham disturbance as a              'riot'.        Despite     the

 clear       and    immediate       evidence    that     each        incident     was
distinct,     raising quite different questions                and    demanding

separate     analysis,       the   Government       saw    fit to       link the

incidents      in     the terms      of     reference       of the Inquiry

commissioned two days after the events.                   These were:


            To    inquire,    with    particular
            reference to the events at Bradford
            City and Birmingham football grounds
            on 11 May, into the operation of the
            Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975;
            and to recommend what if any further
            steps should be taken, including any
            that   may   be   necessary    under
            additional powers, to improve both
            crowd safety and crowd control at
            sports grounds. [8]

It   had    been     clear     for some     time    that     the     Government,

particularly        the Prime Minister, had been outraged                  by     the

issue      of soccer-related violence.             Hooliganism, as         it     has

become popularly labelled, and its eradication had become                           a

major focus of Cabinet concern.              The much anticipated               White

paper,      Rfivisw of Public Order, which eventually led to                      the

draconian 1986 Public Order Act was released during the week

of   Bradford        and Birmingham.        The then Home      Secretary,          Mr

Leon Brittan, informed the House of Commons:


                   People have     the right     to
             protection against being bullied,
             hurt,   intimidated or    obstructed,
             whatever    the   motive   of    those
             responsible may be, whether they are
             violent    demonstrators,     rioters,
             intimidatory mass pickets, or soccer
             hooligans. [9]


 The following day's nailv Express added, "race riots, animal

 rights     demos,     Greenham,     the miners'          strike,    the    Libyan



                                       10
Embassy        siege"          to "soccer-violence" in            echoing           the       Home

Secretary's 'litany of the violent' [10].



This     was     the       climate        in    which     Mr    Justice            Popplewell

initiated        his           inquiry.     It was compounded just                 two       weeks

later by the disaster at Heysel Stadium, Brussels on 29                                           May

1985.      Throughout              the    day     there    were     persistent               minor

incidents           of     violence provoked by Liverpool                  and       Juventus

fans.      The           seeds     of that rivalry had            been     sown          a    year

earlier        at        the     European       Cup    Final,     in     Rome,           between

Liverpool and Roma F.C. when serious injuries were inflicted

on     over forty Liverpool fans in knife attacks by groups                                        of

Roma     'supporters'.              Many Liverpool fans            who camped                in    or

near to the city on approved camp-sites reported attacks                                           by

gangs     throughout their stay in the city.                            These       incidents

were never addressed and raised serious questions about                                           the

choice     of        Rome for a European Final                  involving          the        local

team.       Inevitably             visiting       supporters were          placed             in    a

volatile         situation           lasting      several days          and        the       game's

 European        administration had a responsibility                          to     safeguard

 their         interests.            This        was    not      done         and         serious

 confrontation ensued with short and long-term consequences.



 It was decided to hold the 1985 Final at the Heysel                                      Stadium

 despite        protests           from   Liverpool Football             Club        that          the

 stadium        was        an inappropriate choice.               The    culmination                of

 these     factors              was that a      world-wide        television             audience

 witnessed a number of Liverpool supporters gaining access to
a     section of the            terrace accommodating Juventus fans.                    In

the     ensuing panic a severe crush developed and a                          retaining

wall     collapsed            killing thirty-eight        people       and     injuring

approximately four hundred.                  The failure of effective                crowd

control,      inadequate policing,•the ill-conceived                         allocation

of     tickets      and the poor repair of the                terracing        and     its

walls collectively contributed to this disaster in a section

of      the      ground         officially      designated           for      'neutral'

spectators.             The     inter-mixing       of rival     fans,        given     the

incidents in Italy a year earlier, together with the                               choice

and     management of the venue were the conditions                         which      set

the context for an appalling disaster.



This      incident,            with    the   uniqueness        of      circumstance,

complexity         of     contributory factors          and     implications           for

international            soccer       relations,     could     not     be      compared

directly      to        those     at Bradford and       Birmingham           two     weeks

earlier.      Yet Popplewell was drawn into this issue to                            "take

account of any lessons arising from this tragic event"                                [11]

and his investigation formed the first chapter of his                                Final

Report. What this ensured was that the issue of crowd safety

was      bound irretrievably to the distinctive issue of                             crowd

violence,        or football hooliganism.              It reflected a              climate

of     near hysteria over the issue of soccer-related                          violence

which ranked high on the list of 'law and order'                             priorities

endorsed by successive Conservative administrations.
The    Bradford      Fire    Disaster along    with    the     Hillsborough

Disaster    had      nothing to do with       soccer-related         violence.

Both     Disasters     concerned    the    adequacy    of     the      venues,

policing and stewarding arrangements and safety                    precautions

in managing large crowds.          Yet both were placed in a broader

context     of soccer-related violence.          In his Interim            Report

Lord Justice Taylor was explicit in his findings:



                   the real     cause   of            the
            Hillsborough       disaster                was
            overcrowding. [12]

                   the main reason    for  the
            disaster was the failure of police
            control. [13]


The     entire    Interim Report dealt        with    what    happened        at

Hillsborough      (Part I) and why it happened (Part II).                    When

it     addressed 'hooliganism' it did so in the context of                    the

 "fear of hooliganism" and its "influence on the strategy                      of

the     police"   leading to an "imbalance between the                need     to

quell a minority of troublemakers and the need to secure the

 safety    and    comfort of the majority" [14].             Yet    the      Final

 Report devoted an entire part to the issue of crowd                       control

 in terms of 'hooliganism'.          To be fair Lord Justice Taylor s

 concern     in   his Final Report was to address a                 much     wider

 issue     of the state of contemporary soccer and to                 lay     down

 some     guidance for the future.         Yet once again a          Government

 commitment to a favoured strategy for regulating crowds                       and

 ridding     grounds        of 'hooligans' - the      Football       Spectators

 Act, 1989 - debated and passed while Lord Justice Taylor was



                                      13
still     involved       in       his Inquiry,        placed        an       unprecedented

political      pressure           on    the      Inquiry.      In        that       sense        it

demanded that Lord Justice Taylor should consider the                                         issue

of hooliganism as central to the problems of soccer.                                      It was

an     issue   which        had        little    bearing     on      the        events           at

Hillsborough       but        again it gave hooliganism                  a      status          and

priority it did not deserve.



Understanding         the     Wider        Issues:__ The                     far     In-Depth
Research

The     servicing of an inquiry such as that conducted by                                     Lord

Justice Taylor is an extensive and costly endeavour.                                      Apart

from     the    immediate              Inquiry team there was                the     task        of

gathering, collating and cross-referencing the evidence                                         for

the     Inquiry.       This        task was given to           the       West       Midlands

Police     Force under the overall responsibility of its                                      Chief

Constable,      Mr.      Geoffrey          Dear.     He appointed             one        of     his

Assistant Chief Constables, Mr. Mervyn Jones, to conduct the

investigation,         to      take statements from all who                        wished        to

submit     them     and to examine and make                  available             all        other

relevant       material           and     evidence.         Lord     Justice              Taylor

recorded that four hundred and forty West Midlands' officers

were deployed on the Inquiry based in Birmingham,                                   Liverpool

and     Sheffield      [15].            Thx'ee    thousand     seven          hundred           and

seventy-six statements were taken, one thousand five hundred

and     fifty letters received and seventy-one hours                                of        video

film was viewed.            Clearly the Inquiry represents one of                               the

most     extensive       investigations, in terms                   of       material           and
evidence      generated, of any single event.                        Inevitably             this

raises, the        question of why it is considered                        necessary          to

pursue       a     further           research           investigation               into     the

Hillsborough Disaster.                If so much resources were allocated,

so    many       investigators deployed, such                  advanced            technology

made available and such experienced professionals                                    appointed

to    co-ordinate and examine the evidence what could                                  further

research add to what has been established?



The    commissioning             and developing of further                    in-depth        and

independent         research         can be justified, indeed it                      is    made

necessary,         on     several counts.            First, and        this          has     been

discussed         in the previous section, a judicial                          or     official

inquiry          functions        within       the      parameters        of        terms      of

reference         and     time       limits     determined       by       a         Government

department.             Whatever        the     discretion       afforded             to      the

appointed         team,       this     limits        considerably         the        scope     of

inquiries.          At     first       sight       it    would   appear             that      the

Hillsborough            Inquiry used its discretion to the full.                              For

while     the      Interim        Report focused in some               detail          on     all

aspects appertaining to the Disaster, apparently considering

every        possible         contributory           factor,     the      Final            Report

broadened         its scope to consider soccer's 'wider-ills',                                its

potential         'better future', and the appropriateness                             of     the

 Football        Spectators'          Act,     1989.      This      was       an     ambitious

 undertaking,            no      matter       how       extensive         the        available

 resources, in just nine months.                        Yet there remains a                series

 of    issues,      some directly related to the                     Disaster,             others


                                              15
not,     which        require further         consideration.             Two        examples

illustrate the point.



In     the Interim Report Lord Justice Taylor devoted only                                  one

paragraph        to     the        use of   th6   gymnasium        at        Hillsborough

Football Ground as a temporary mortuary.                     While            recognising

the     logistical difficulties involved at the                         gymnasium           and

the ordeal to which families would be subjected there was no

comment nor recommendation on the events that occurred                                     once

families arrived to identify and mourn their dead.                                  Yet this

procedure        and its effects on the bereaved has been                            a    most

serious       cause      for concern.        Of    further    consequence,                  and

probably        not considered by Lord Justice Taylor as being                               of

any     relevance        to his Inquiry, was the role of                      the     media.

This was a difficult issue initially as camera crews, sports

journalists and sports photographers were 'on the scene' but

it     became         an issue of major contention in                   the       days      and

weeks     that        followed.         The problem shifted             from        how     the

Disaster        should        be     recorded and published             to     the        worst

excesses of intrusive journalism.                   Both examples, and                    there

are others, added to the tragic consequences of Hillsborough

but did not feature in Lord Justice Taylor's Reports.



The     second        major        justification for    further              research        is

concerned        with     placing the official          inquiry              in     context.

For, no matter how extensive an inquiry might be it                                  remains

part     of     a     broader process concerning             the        subject           under
investigation.                 It     embodies and          formalises        an        'official

reaction'          to     a     specific event and becomes                   tied        to     that

event.        In        that        sense    it    becomes      the     'last           word'     or

definitive           document on the issues raised.                     Yet,        given        the

discretion of definition, selection and presentation of                                          the

evidence,          afforded to the principal inquirer and given                                  the

political bias of interpretation employed by Governments                                          it

would be folly to accept the 'weighting' of the Reports                                          and

their        interpretation             without      considering            their         broader

context.        It       is    the function of              independent        research           to

consider       all        dimensions which relate to an                      issue        over     a

reasonable period of time.                        In the case of the           Hillsborough

Disaster this means a thorough consideration of the Inquiry:

how     it    was        established; the gathering                   and    weighting            of

evidence;          the        presentation of findings and the                      making        of

recommendations;                the     selection and discussion                   of     broader

issues;        the       media coverage and             political           responses;           the

short-term and long-term implications.



Finally,        the official inquiry is just one, albeit                                 central,

element        of       the     aftermath of          the     Hillsborough              Disaster.

Running        alongside the Inquiry has been                     the        investigation,

also     by the West Midlands Police, for the                           South           Yorkshire

Police.         There          is     no    public      right    of     access           to      the

information             gathered or to the contents of                      the     subsequent

report.        Following Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report this

investigation             became           a criminal       investigation           geared        to

establishing             whether           or not prosecution,          on        the     grounds
potentially     of     a     range    of     criminal      offences      of    which

manslaughter         could      be    the     most      serious,       might         be

appropriate.           Clearly        this      internal        and       strictly

confidential     inquiry will arrive at a                  decision     concerning

prosecution     in     consultation 'with            the     Crown     Prosecution

Service.     While issues concerning criminal liability                        remain

unresolved     the     adjourned inquests into the deaths                     of    the

ninety-five     victims        cannot be       completed.        The     Coroner's

inquest     is not a court of liability but a court which                          aims

to    reach an appropriate verdict, through the decision of                            a

jury,     consistent       with the established medical                'cause'       of

death.      Recently it has become increasingly                   apparent         that

controversial        cases     which involve concerns over               civil       or

criminal     liability have placed an inappropriate                     weight       on

the     inquest, raising expectations among                  bereaved     families

which the procedure is unable to fulfil [16].                        The build-up,

organisation,        investigation, selection of               evidence,           legal

representation,        selection       of     witnesses,       conduct        of     the

court,     guidance and direction of the jury are issues                           which

involve considerable discretion on the part of the                        coroner.

It     is a process in which families and survivors will                           place

considerable     trust        in     providing       answers    to      unresolved

questions yet it is a process which will not meet with their

expectations         or    deal      with    their     demands.        Given         the

inevitable media focus on an unprecedented 'mass inquest' it

will     be necessary to monitor all aspects of the                     procedures

of investigation and examination.
Apart     from     the monitoring of the      official    inquiries          and

investigations other elements which form a necessary part of

the     research project include: the response of              the     police,

particularly        in South Yorkshire, to Lord        Justice        Taylor's

Interim     Report; local government responses to the needs                   of

the     bereaved, injured and traumatised; the           role,        function

and consequences of media coverage and intervention;                    claims

for     compensation, the allocation of funds and              consequences

for     welfare     claimants.       This extensive    range     of     issues

together with the task of effective monitoring comprise                      the

main     elements     of this substantive research project.                  The

project's         main objective isto consider all       dimensions           of

the Hillsborough Disaster and it seeks to establish a                      fully

integrated        analysis of its context and its         aftermath.          To

that     end       the project will report, as    thoroughly          as     its

research       allows,   on issues which      remain     unconsidered         or

neglected by the official inquiries.



t ha Hiliabnrnngh Project: The Structure and Format— of— jfcte
Reports

The project research team has agreed to produce two reports,

one presented after the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's

Final Report, the second shortly after the completion of the

inquests.           As many of the    issues discussed above         are      on­

going     it is difficult to draw an arbitrary line              on        events

and present a 'full' account.            The research team, therefore,

has     decided to present its more definitive work,                 including
historical          and    theoretical        analysis      of        soccer-related

issues,      in its Second Report.            There are, however,                   several

elements      of     the work which have been completed                      and         these

comprise      the First Report.           Lord Justice           Taylor        published

his    Interim       Report in August '1989, just over                   four        months

after the Hillsborough Disaster.                  The research team has                   had

time    to consider his findings and recommendations,                               examine

the    broader      media and political response to                    them         and     to

investigate           further        issues       touched         upon         by          his

investigation.            Thus   the      First    Report        of    the      research

project contains an evaluation of the official inquiry.                                     As

Lord    Justice Taylor focused specifically on the                           events         at

Hillsborough         and the question of direct              responsibility                 in

his     Interim Report, and moved to the broader                        ramifications

of     the   issues which he considers dominate                       soccer        in     his

Final Report, the research project deals primarily with                                    his

Interim      Report.       It is of some concern that the reports                           of

official        inquiries        choose     to    label     their        reports            as

'Interim'       and       'Final'.     As with     Mr     Justice        Popplewell's

report       on Bradford, the substantive issues                      concerning           the

Disaster       at     Hillsborough        are dealt with          in     the        Interim

Report and therefore are given scant attention in the                                    Final

Report.        Inevitably this leads to establishing a                         hierarchy

of     significance and in the future when people turn                              to     his

report       for information they will take the Final                        Report         as

definitive.           As discussed later, this question of                      relative

status is not without consequences.
Prior    to the assessment of Taylor, the First Report of                            the

research        project   considers       the central       question          of     the

relationship        between provision for crowd safety                  and        crowd

management         and    the    predominant        emphasis       in         central

Government        thinking,     official bodies, media            accounts           and

academic        work of the 'problem' of            'football     hooliganism'.

While     not     wanting to ignore the        issue       of    soccer-related

violence it is important to put this issue into                        perspective

and to consider the issues of crowd management, crowd safety

and     civil     liberties      in a    context     not    predetermined             by

'hooligan hysteria'.            Clearly there are important lessons to

be drawn from the mismanagement of the crowd at Hillsborough

but     these     should not be lost or overshadowed by                  an        over­

emphasis on the issue of crowd-related violence.



The     third     section of the First Report              concerns      the        part

played     by     the media at Hillsborough and in               the     immediate

aftermath.        The 'media' were present in mass numbers and                        in

all     forms (from the press, radio, television) and from                           all

levels (local, national, international).                    Serious      questions

were      raised     about      the     responses     of     journalists             and

photographers        as   the     Disaster happened,            about    the        live

broadcasting of events on television and about the radio and

television coverage throughout the day.                    In addition further

serious questions were raised about the decisions, taken                              at

editorial         level   to     publish     graphic        descriptions             and

photographs        of the suffering.         Further, the issue of                 media
coverage became more controversial as statements of un named

'witnesses' and unattributed 'official sources' were used to

misinform       the   public     of   the events   leading      up    to     the

Disaster       and    the behaviour of football supporters            as     the

Disaster developed.         This coverage continued to focus on the

issue     of hooliganism, drunkenness and          violence.         Finally,

the media became directly involved in exacerbating the                      pain

and suffering of the bereaved through journalism which                      was,

at     best,     'intrusive' and, at worst,        deceitful.        Each      of

these     issues, together with a critical review of                 the     role

and ruling of the Press Council, is dealt              with in the First

Report.


A     fourth and most significant element of the             First         Report

focuses        on the treatment of survivors and the          families         of

the     bereaved in the period immediately after             the      Disaster

and subsequently.         The Inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor                dealt

only     with the Disaster itself before moving on to                 consider

more general problems besetting soccer and its future.                        Yet

the Disaster set in motion a series of events which must                       be

considered        thoroughly and critically.        This   includes:          the

setting        up and administration of the temporary mortuary                 in

 the     Hillsborough          gymnasium;   the     co-ordination             and

 administration of the temporary mortuary and the                  procedures

 adopted       for identification of the dead; the         provision          and

 accuracy of information offered to those inquiring about the

 dead and injured; the co-ordination of the services involved



                                       22
i.e.     hospitals,             mortuary, etc.; the             interviewing           of     the

bereaved;        the       administration and execution of                      the     police

inquiry     including             the taking of statements; the                    issue       of

compensation           and the withdrawal of benefits; the                         right       of

access     to information particularly with regard to                                 bereaved

families.



Thus     it is clear from the above that the First Report                                    aims

to     provide a substantial statement, based on                            thorough          and

rigorous        research,             of     the events which       unfolded           in     the

immediate        aftermath                 of the Hillsborough           Dis:,jter.         This

includes an assessment of the official inquiry.                                 The      Second

Report     of        the research project intends                   to     develop          these

issues     further.              It        will carry: a     full        account       of     its

monitoring           of     the inquest procedure and                the     response          of

families        to        the    adequacy of the           coroner's        procedure          of

investigation and examination; a detailed examination of the

criminal        investigation,                prosecution,       liability         and        the

implications              of    decisions taken by the              Crown       Prosecution

Service     and,           if    appropriate,         verdicts       reached          in      the

criminal courts; the response of the South Yorkshire Police,

the police authority, the issue of 'corporate' liability and

the     question           of police accountability;                an     evaluation          of

contemporary              sociological            and criminological            theories       as

they     have been applied to soccer, especially the                               issue       of

crowd     behaviour;              a    broader       consideration         of     the       media

coverage         and           comment       in    terms   of    the       creation           and

perpetuation               of     Merseyside's         unjustified          but         assumed
reputation for violence, militancy and public conflict.

                                25
The briefest consideration of the contemporary literature on

soccer      and         crowd       behaviour        reveals        an     overwhelming

preoccupation          with 'football hooliganism' [1].                          In        recent

years     there        has    not been a debate             concerning          soccer            in

either     of     the        Houses of Parliament               which    has        not      been

dominated         by       'hooliganism'           and    the     problems            of         law

enforcement          and      public order [2].            The     media       has         become

obsessed        with       the issues of violence both on and                         off        the

field     publishing every excess, no matter                        how        exceptional.

As a result almost every penny of available funding has gone

into     researching           soccer-related violence                  resulting           in     a

plethora        of books, articles, radio                  broadcasts,           television

programmes        and even a unit of study on an                        Open     University

course.         There is no question that there exists a range                                    of

collective        male        behaviours at and            around        soccer        matches

which     is     anti-social,          initimidatory,             inflammatory               and,

occasionally,           violent.       Heavy drinking, sexual                   and        racial

abuse     and        harassment,       damage        to    property        and        violence

against        the     person occur both inside                  and     outside           soccer

grounds but the numbers of people arrested and charged                                       with

offences,        given        the    heavy     police       presence           at     matches,

compared to the number of people who attend is minimal.



 For     example,          the      1984-85     season,         which     included               the

Birmingham           disturbance and the Heysel disaster, produced                                 a

 total    First        Division attendance at 9,810,649.                            The     totax

 arrests were 3,752 and ejections were 3,299.                             This gives              an



                                              26
arrest     rate of 0.38 per 1,000 an ejection rate of 0.34                             per

1.000, and a joint arrest/rejection rate of 0.72 per                             1,000.

The     following season's First Division gross attendance                             was

was     9,008,673 producing 1,839 arrests and 2,206                        ejections.

Thus arrests had fallen to 0.2 per 1,000, ejections to                                0.25

per     1,000 and the joint arrest/ejection rate was                        0.45        per

1.000.      At    the     very     time    when     the     issue     of       football

hooliganism       was      at    its height       the     arrest     and       ejection

figures dropped by 51% and 33% respectively [3].                           Even these

relatively        low     figures cannot be         equated        with        'violent

interpersonal           behaviour.        Individuals are          ejected        for     a

whole     range     of reasons and it can be               assumed        that     their

actions,     while        provocative or intimidatory,               were        not     of

sufficient        seriousness        to    give    the     police     grounds           for

arrest.     Equally, arrests are made for a variety of offences

of which stealing is common.                Arrests, therefore, cannot                   be

simply     equated        with    violent     behaviour.           Finally,        these

figures     are nothing more than arrest figures -                        no     figures

are provided for prosecution or conviction.



Yet      the 'hooligan hysteria' continued unabated                       with        still

more      pressure       for reactionary measures to               deal        with     the

 'pathological          violence' on the terraces.            The 1970's              media

 coverage     had set the scene depicting soccer 'hooligans'                             as

 “mindless morons ... we should make sure we treat them                                like

 animals     - for their behaviour proves that's what they                             are"

 [4],     Eleven years later the same newspaper had changed                             its

 mind:
           It would be wrong to compare them
           with animals because no animal is
           like them.     No brute could be so
           brutish.   No pig could so wallow in
           the   mud.    No rat could be     as
           cowardly. [5]
After    Heysel football supporters were               "Europe's      polecats"

[6]     inflicted       with "the English Disease ...           the    root       of

contagion ... the home of the virus              [7] culminating in              the

canker of mindless hooliganism" [8].              Yet solutions had been

voiced     in     the    preceding period: Lady        Emmet     of    Amberley

recommended        "putting them in the stocks", Arthur               Lewis,       a

Labour     M.P.     suggested "spraying them with           dye"      [9],      and

Bobby     Robson,       England manager, demanded a         return        to     the

ritual     of     Tyburn arguing that they should be             "flogged         in

front     of the main stands before the start of a                 home        game"

[10].     This was the climate           of righteous indignation, moral

panic     and     knee-jerk      reaction    which     spawned     the         Prime

Minister's        Special Project : the Football Spectator s Bill.

The     Luton     Town    prototype,      with   its    membership        scheme,

identity cards, pass gates, ban on visiting fans and a                          Tory

M .p. as Club Chairman, was accepted blindly as the                      exemplar

system of control and regulation.



Apart     from     the problem of exaggerating or           amplifying           the

actual      level        of    soccer-related    violence      the       football

hooliganism        debate has created other major              inhibitions        on

dealing with the management and regulation of soccer crowds.

 For     example,        its    myopic   focus   has    been     on   acts        of

 interpersonal          or collective violence.        While people,           quite
correctly,        have been policed and arrested for                fighting        or

wrecking     property       a   whole    range     O j.   other     intimidatory

behaviours        have been allowed to continue             unpoliced.            Most

obvious      of    these is the       almost     officially        unchallenged,

certainly ignored, level of racism.                While racism is endemic

throughout         soccer   [11],     fanried only too       readily        by     the

nationalism,         jingoism and chauvinism of the tabloid                     media,

it     remains a "no-go" area as          far as the police, the                 clubs

and    the    media commentators are           concerned.          Dismissed        as

'banter',     'name-calling' and 'winding-up', hard-core racists

have been allowed to occupy specific areas of soccer grounds

and     maintain      a constant barrage of intimidatory                  and     law-

breaking behaviour.



The     construction of 'football hooliganism' as                   representing

mass     civil      disorder at every soccer match has led                  to     the

 'over*policing'       of   soccer and the gradual           erosion        of     the

civil liberties of all soccer supporters regardless of their

actions.          It has created a climate of 'guilty until                     proved

 innocent'        and, with the consolidation of already                  extensive

powers under the 1986 Public Order Act, the police literally

 lay    down the precise conditions upon which                    spectators       can

 take part in this mass form of organised leisure.                        There      is

 no    parallel in British society: spectators are herded                         onto

 trains      and    coaches, body searched, placed                under    constant

 surveillance,         stopped      at motorway     services        and     searched

 again,      herded     from     trains and      coaches,     marched           through

 towns,      penned in cages, locked until well after                     the     match
has finished and marched back to their departure points.                                   It

was no surprise, therefore, that an unprecedented attempt to

introduce        "identity     cards ,       under           the     euphemism      of      a

'national      football       scheme',           should       emerge     from       within

soccer.       The message was clear and consistent: the                             threat

to   public       order'     posed     by        soccer       was     &q— great          that

democratic civil rights could be temporarily withdrawn                                   from

those     who wished to attend.              The        logic       was clear in         Leon

Brittan's speech to the House of Commons on his announcement

as Home Secretary of the 1985 White Paper:                            Rev 1ew of Pub 11,£
Order     when     he talked of rights to participate                        in    certain

activities,        of    which    soccer          was     one,       being    “balanced"

against     the rights of         protection of the                  wider    community

[12].      Consequently          the draconian powers                 granted      to     the

police      and    the     courts under the 1986                   Public    Order       Act,

giving new definitions to threatening behaviour,                              disorderly

conduct,      violent disorder, affray and riot, were                             justified

in   part     as    a rational response                 to    the      escalation          of

 'football hooliganism'.



The atmosphere of           mass violence           at soccer matches has been

developed         further     by a media with a capacity and                       will    to

turn      exceptional         events     into           'common'      occurrences          or

 'regular'        features.       This tendency was well noted                      in    the

 following observation by Jock Young:


              They (the mass media) select events
              which are atypical, present them in
              a stereotypical fashion and contrast


                                            30
              them   against   a   backcloth                  of
              normality which is over-typical
              [13]



It     is on this basis, ever mindful of Government policy                           and

of     the 'ratings' or 'sales' war, that isolated examples                           of

pitch invasions at Luton, Birmingham and Selhurst Park                              have

been     rerun        to   give the impression that           such     events        are

regular,       typical        and clear evidence of the             propensity        of

soccer fans to 'riot'.               This was compounded by the appalling

loss     of        life    at Heysel Stadium.        Taken    together       over      a

period        of     years these specific          incidents,       alongside        the

continual           political and media hype about the escalation                     of

violence, have been used and manipulated to create an                           image

of soccer which is dominated by endemic violence both on and

off     the        pitch, both inside and outside             the    ground.         The

issues        do     exist     but   rather than      dealing       with     them     as

specific problems involving masculinity, nationalism, racism

and     class within broader society they are                   decontextualised

and p l a c e d solely at the door of soccer under the                      catch-all

ascribed label of 'hooliganism'.



The     creation of this dominant image and                   its    consolidation

through        media       coverage,    political      comment       and     academic

research has delivered a sharply-focused lens through                           which

all     crowd        behaviour and,        therefore, crowd         management       and

safety        is     viewed.     Crowd safety, involving the               fabric    and

condition            of      grounds,the        lacklustre      approach              to

 overcrowding,             the   use       of    fences,     the maintenance          of
barriers,     the procedures for identifying problems                      and    the

formulation        of    coherent, integrated emergency              plans,       has

been    minimised in direct proportion to the maximisation                         of

control and regulation.            When Lord Justice Taylor criticised

the    police for emphasising the "prevention of disorder"                         at

the expense of keeping watch "for any possible                      overcrowding

on     the terraces" [14] he was illustrating the                   pre-eminence

given to the "fear of hooliganism .                 His reporting of poxice

evidence     "that packing fans close together on the                      terraces

assisted in controlling the unruly since the less room                           they

had     the less scope there was for misbehaviour" [15]                      was     a

perfect       illustration         and     damning     indictment          of      the

institutionalised view through the lens of hooliganism.



As     discussed earlier, the Popplewell Inquiry                 developed          an

analysis     of 'soccer's problems' through this                 lens.           Crowd

violence     and        public disorder had nothing to           do    with        the

Bradford     Fire        Disaster yet the      discussion,       analysis          and

recommendations            of   what     happened    at     Bradford            became

subordinated        in     the Final Report to         'crowd    control'          and

 'hooliganism'.          Lord Justice Taylor followed a similar                   line

 in presenting his Final Report.               Clearly, then, there              needs

to     be   some    consideration given to the              issue     of    soccer-

 related     violence       and    the     potential      problems     of        crowd

 disorder.     Soccer, however, is not the only site of                     violent

 behaviour     among       young    men.      The    British    Crime        Surveys

 demonstrated           clearly that the most likely           perpetrators         of



                                         32
public acts of interpersonal violence are young men                                 between

the     ages          of     16 and 25.     They showed also       that        the        most

likely       victims           are young men within        the    same        age-range.

Collective             male       violence based on loosely        formed           'gangs'

which     present             common identities or public               images       is not

unique       to        soccer.       Street-corners,      pub car-parks,             clubs,

youth     centres,             parks, estates, shopping centres                and        rock

concerts          each provide venues for inter-group                   rivalry           and,

occasionally,                  orchestrated        violence.            Soccer            and,

increasingly, other spectator sports provide                            a     further and

more     dramatic             dimension to collective male                  behaviour and

violence          but it should not be isolated as if                    somehow          male

violence          is        created by or emanates from           the        'nature'       or

presentation                of the sport.      Collective male violence is                  an

issue     substantially               more significant      and     certainly             more

deep-rooted than writers on football hooliganism have so far

explored.             It should be of no surprise, however, that soccer

grounds        provide exciting public venues.                   Soccer in          Britain

is played, presented, reported and administeredas an almost

exclusively                male    preserve.     Its   grounds,         terraces           and

boardrooms             are        essentially patriarchal        dedicated          to     the

culture        of masculinity and in a 'man's world' the                         excesses

of     male behaviour are to be expected, both on and                               off    the

pitch.


 It    has     become             clear, through    the   official           inquiry       and

 through          a        range of other personal testimony,                that     crowd-

 related disorder or 'hooliganism' played no part in                                 causing
or exacerbating the Hillsborough Disaster.                                While the          myths

of violence, excessive drinking and thieving persist through

irresponsible             and        mischievous comment in               the     media,           the

issue of crowd safety at Hillsborough could not be connected

to     any     acts of misbehaviour within the crowd.                             Yet        it     is

clear        that     the          scale     of the      disaster                    have         been

lessened        had       the        authorities'          obsession       with       'football

hooliganism'             not dictated their initial response to                              people

attempting to escape from pens 3 and 4 at the Leppings                                            Lane

End      of        the         ground.            With     hindsight            it        appears

incomprehensible that a senior officer with a clear view                                            of

the     pens from the police control box could not                                distinguish

between        'escape' and 'invasion'.                     More incredible             was        the

lack     of     understanding                of what       was   happening           by      police

officers           actually              standing    at the      front          of the        pens.

Survivors           from the front of the pens recall                       people           losing

consciousness                 before        the     kick-off     and      telling            police

officers that they needed immediate help.                              Yet there was                no

attempt        to        intervene,          no sense of urgency,               no    relay         of

 information             to        the    control room, no        call      for       emergency

 services          and        no     move     to halt the        start          of the        game.

 Officers refused to open gates, pushed people back into                                           the

 crowd       and     treated             claims     that    people       were        dying        with

 scepticism          and           disbelief.       The twenty       to    thirty         minutes

 which elapsed between the first victims losing consciousness

 and     their evacuation could well have contributed                                   to    their

 deaths and certainly exacerbated an already grave situation.
In   his Interim Report Lord Justice Taylor noted                  that:        "At

3.06pm    Mr        Duckenfield       (Chief   Superintendent     in     overall

command        of     the    policing     operation),     still        primarily

concerned       about public order, caused a message to                 be     sent

asking for Operation Support" [16].                 About ten minutes later

Chief     Superintendent            Duckenfield    informed   Graham         Kelly,

Chief     Executive         of the Football       Association,    and        Graham

Mackrell, Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday, that there                         were

fatalities and that the game would have to be abandoned.                         He

told     them that fans had forced Gate C causing an                   "inrush".

Graham Kelly, interviewed later on television, reported that

the police version of events was that fans had forced                         their

way into the ground.            Lord Justice Taylor was in no doubt as

to the impact of such misinformation:


            This was not only untruthful.     It
            set off a widely reported allegation
            against the supporters which caused
            grave offence and distress.       It
            revived against football fans, and
            especially those from     Liverpool,
            accusations of hooliganism     which
            caused reaction nationwide but also
            in Europe too.     (emphasis added:
            [17])


The initial reaction of the police officers at the                      Leppings

Lane     End to requests for help and the persistent denial                      by

senior officers that what they were witnessing was                      anything

other     than crowd disorder provides a clear example                   of     the

effect     of       the     'lens    of   hooliganism'   in   viewing         crowd

management.



                                          35
The    entire        operation of staging major soccer                       matches        has

come     to     elevate         crowd control over            crowd        safety.         From

police        briefing          through       to the     virtual      imprisonment             of

spectators          in     cages,       the imposition         of     an     ideology          of

regulation at the expense of safe passage of individuals now

dominates proceedings.                  The Green Guide, however, which                     was

written        in    the       aftermath of the           Bradford         Fire     Disaster

established          that       while     access to the         pitch,         in     'normal

circumstances',                should be made difficult, the pitch                       should

provide        an escape route in the event of                      emergencies           [18].

It condoned perimeter fencing on the proviso that it                                     should

not    be      an inhibition to safety.                  In fact the         Green        Guide

established          that "immediate access to the playing                          area       or

perimeter           track"       should       be   ensured.



Hillsborough             was     typical of many soccer stadia                    which     had

maximised            control          while        minimising         safety        in         the

construction             of     its    perimeter         fencing.      The        fact     that

survivors of the disaster tell of beating welded fences with

their bare hands and of losing consciousness an arms                                     length

from     a     solitary,          narrow       gate      is   clear     evidence          of     a

mentality           which put the consequences of a                    potential          pitch

invasion        ahead          of the consequences of            overcrowding.                 Yet

with     access          to the rear of            the    terraces      poorly       marked,

unstewarded and unrecorded, overcrowding in the central pens

always        was     a more probable eventuality than a                       mass       pitch

invasion.           Given the impact of 'hooligan hysteria', however,
it     is    a      mentality          difficult     to        educate.            Even        after

Hillsborough the 'lens of hooliganism' remains the                                    dominant

way of seeing arrangements for crowd management.



A     pertinent example of the extent and seriousness                                 of        this

problem          occurred       at the meeting of              the     Liverpool           Safety

Advisory            Group         at      Anfield         in         September                 1989.

Representatives               of the Ambulance Service and                   Fire         Brigade

raised       the issue of a new 'safety corridor' which had                                    been

constructed            at the front of the Kop by effectively                             'boxing

in'     the front barriers and creating a corridor between                                       the

front row barrier and the wall.                     The emergency services were

concerned           that       far from this       new    arrangement              benefiting

safety        it       constituted       a hazard, limiting                access         to     the

crowd.       The Fire Brigade representative was adamant that                                        it

had     created          a new problem which needed                  urgent         attention.

The     City        Building Surveyor stated that                     as     the     perimeter

fencing          had     been     removed the        safety          corridor        had        been

created to "prevent a mass pitch invasion"                                 arguing that              it

would be important to isolate a crowd before it reached                                             any

real        size.        The     primary objective             was     "stopping              people

getting          onto the pitch" and "this is an important                               part        of

our         safety       arrangements."         He       concluded           that        it         "is

essential           to stop hostile crowds or to stop hostile                                 crowds

meeting          ...     we don't want a pitch             invasion           at     Anfield

[19].         Hr       Bush     is well-respected in his work                      and        was     a

member of the Technical Working Party to the Taylor Inquiry.
Yet     in    this     situation,        with     the   benefit        of    hindsight

concerning          Hillsborough, he prioritised control                     and        order

over safety.          Equally serious was the fact that the decision

to     construct       the 'safety corridor' had been taken                        by     the

City     Building          Surveyor     in    consultation       with         Liverpool

Football Club and the Merseyside Police.                      The Club held, and

continues          to hold, reservations concerning the efficacy                             of

the     safety corridor fence at the Kop End.                    Its        maintenance

is     primarily       a police initiative in conjunction                     with        the

City     Surveyor.           It       is of considerableconcern               that        the

emergency          services,upon whom it would fall               to         rescue           a

situation,           had     not    been      consulted.      Once          again         the

responsibility for crowd management had been ascribed to the

club         and     the     police     and     once    again    the         issue           of

'hooliganism' had dominated their response.



The findings of Lord Justice Taylor echoed doubts concerning

the     role,        function         and accountability of the              police          at

soccer matches raised earlier by supporters'                         organisations.

He     likened        policing of major soccer venues to                    that        of    a

military           operation.          This     development is not           unique          to

 soccer       and     it    reflects a developing           trend      in     policing,

 evident       since       the     late 1970s, towards          paramilitarism               in

 dealing       with public order [20].              At one level the           policing

 of     soccer       has    become militarised not           only       in    terms          of

 operational          policies        and practices but also            in     terms         of

 'intelligence',                 undercover       operations,           surveillance,

 regulation          of movement and control.              As discussed            earlier,
soccer     spectating is one activity which can result                             in    the

temporary       withdrawal        of civil rights          and    liberties.                 At

Hillsborough 38% of the South Yorkshire Police establishment

was     on duty providing 1,122 police officers.                        In       addition

the     club    employed        376   stewards,       gatemen         and     turnstile

operators.



Crowd     management       outside a soccer ground               is     clearly           the

responsibility          of the police.          Their main objective                is       to

ensure     the safe passage of supporters while                       ensuring           that

good public order is maintained.                  At Hillsborough supporters

were     allowed    to approach the ground free of                     excessive             or

intrusive        policing,        there    were       no   columns          of      police

'escorting' fans.          Once fans arrive at a venue and certainly

once      they     enter       inside     the    responsibility             for         crowd

management       becomes        more complex.         The soccer           club,        as    a

private        company     offering       entertainment          at    a     price           to

customers,        is primarily responsible for maintaining a                             safe

environment and for guaranteeing safe passage.                             In order          to

ensure safety the local authority licenses the venue.                                   Crowd

management, however, is not solely the responsibility of the

club.      Once invited into the ground by the club the                             police

have     a statutory duty to uphold the rule of law.                             Thus        any

criminal        offence, or actions likely to cause offence,                             will

be     acted     upon     by     the police      in    accordance           with        their

statutory        duties        and using their        statutory        powers.               The

 assumption has been that the Club stewards will 'manage' the



                                          39
crowd    while        the police will enforce the law.           The     Taylor

Report, however, noted a court ruling by Justice Boreham                       in

which he found that the police had performed services 'other

than' those of law and order:


              In addition to what'may be called
              their law and order role the police
              were expected and did take part in
              crowd management ensuring the safety
              of spectators, the enforcement of
              the Club's regulations and to be on
              hand to assist in the event of some
              emergencies   such   as   fire    or
              accidental injury. [21]


What was significant about this judgement was that the South

Yorkshire Police Authority was seeking payment for                     services

provided       by their police force to the football             club       which

were    beyond 'normal police duties'.               In other words it        was

the Police Authority's case that police operations at soccer

matches amount to more than the tasks of law enforcement and

the preservation of order.                 The ruling against the club        and

in support of payment made it clear that the police had been

hired     in        the same way as a security firm might              have been

hired    to          protect the 'interests' of the club.              Thus    the

responsibility              for    crowd    management   as   well     as      law

enforcement has become a responsibility shared by the police

as     they         enter    a contract which ensures the            safety    and

comfort of the spectators, officials and players'.



What     has emerged, then, is a situation in which the                     police

have     come to assume the central role in all aspects of                     the

staging        of    major        soccer matches.    They determine      travel
arrangements, vehicular access, approaches to the venue, the

distribution of tickets and the organisation and                                      management

of   the     crowd.          While there              is    consultation          with            other

agencies        the     police retain the right to                      final         decisions.

Prior      to Hillsborough, for example,                        the     South             Yorkshire

Police       rejected        requests       by Liverpool              Football              Club     to

reconsider        the       allocation           of        terraces     and,              therefore,

tickets.         The       'operational plan' for a specific                              match      is

developed        within       the    broader               guidelines       of        a      Force's

'Standing         Instructions             for        the     Policing           of         Football

Grounds'.         At       no point does any outside                    agency             have     the

right      to    negotiate          such     standing           instructions                or      the

specific        operational plan.                Consultation is solely                      at     the

discretion of the police and there is no requirement for the

police to comply with recommendations from outside agencies,

the local authority, or, indeed, its own police authority.



Again,       this situation reflects a much broader                               debate           over

police-community relations and the political                                 accountability

of     the      police       [22].     Nationally              the    police,              via      the

Association           of    Chief Police Officers, have made                               it     clear

that     with regard to 'operational matters'                               involving             force

strategy,         policy       matters,          strategies           and    practices              the

decisions of Chief Constables and their senior officers will

be      absolute and not open to local negotiation.                                       Persistent

 controversies             between    police authorities and                      their           chief

 constables have consolidated this position in favour of                                            the



                                                 41
latter.       Consequently it has becomo the accepted                    convention

that    the 1964 Police Act's brief to police                 authorities           to

provide       an 'adequate and efficient' police force                    does     not

extend to operational priorities or practices.                      It has        been

on     this    basis     that the police in aJJ.       aspects           of     policy

decisions        have rejected any attempt by outside agencies                      to

intervene        in operational policy matters and also the                      calls

for effective accountability governing the administration of

agreed        policy and the operational strategies               and         policies

adopted.



Against        this    trend     Lord    Scarman    called    for         effective

consultation between the police and local communities                            which

would provide people with procedures appropriate to ensuring

that     their needs and priorities were met.                These        would     be

procedures           with "teeth" and not mere "talking shops"                   [23].

Under     the 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act                      all     force

areas     were        obliged    to     establish   some     form    of         direct

consultation           through    community forums, panels           or        liaison

committees.            The problem has been that in the             organisation

and administration of community consultation the police have

retained        absolute discretion on agenda              items,        information

giving        and decision to act on matters raised.                 In doing        so

Chief Constables have invoked the principle of                           operational

matters'        and     thus consultative groups           have     no     effective

 powers to influence policies or practices, nor do they                            have

 the right to procedures of accountability concerning                            agreed

 changes        in    policies    or practices.       It     is     against        this
background of debate and controversy over the     effectiveness

of   procedures for police accountability that     any   proposal

which   suggests   an extension of   community   involvement   in

policing must be placed.

THE TAYLOR REPORTS: AN EVALUATION




                  44
The Tavlor Inquiry Interim Report: Identifying the Issues




The Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor was the outcome of

a Home Office inquiry set up:


              To inquire into     the events   at
              Sheffield Wednesday Football ground
              on 15th April 1989 and to make
              recommendations about the needs of
              crowd control and safety at sports
              events. [1]



Held     in Sheffield, the Inquiry's hearing began on the                       15th

May and concluded on 29th June,               a total of thirty-one days.

One    hundred and seventy-four witnesses gave                 oral     evidence

and there were           written and oral submissions from counsel.



The    bare      facts      relating   to    the    Hillsborough       Disaster,

although       extensively reported, also have been distorted                        in

some     sections of the media.             Therefore, it is necessary               to

record        them     once    more.    Ninety-five       people       died          at

Hillsborough.          Eighty-eight were male and seven were female.

The     majority      were under 30 years of age with more                   than     a

third     being under 20 years (the youngest being a boy of                          10

years).        The     cause of death in       every    but    one     case         was

crush asphyxia.             The majority who died were in pen 3, but at

least     five       were     in pen    4.      Contrary      to the     popular

misconception          at the time,     that       many people died      in         the

approach         tunnel, most       deaths     occurred       at       the     front

of the pens with a few fatalities further back.                      A total         of
730 people were injured inside the ground and 36 outside.



Taylor's findings concerning the causes of the Disaster                        can

be summarised as follows:




(i)   The immediate cause of the Disaster was the failure                       to

      cut off access to the central pens once gate C had been

      opened.     This caused the overcrowding which led to                    the

      Disaster.



(ii) The      central   pens        (3 and 4)   were   already       overfull

      because there was        no    numerical control        of    entry nor

      any effective visual monitoring of crowd density.



(iii) Under    the   strain     of overcrowding in Pen 3 a barrier

      collapsed, exacerbated by what Taylor refers to as the

       "sluggish     reaction       and   response     when        the   crush

      occurred" [2].      Lack of leadership and the               small size

      and number of gates in the perimeter fencing                   hindered

       rescue attempts.



 (iv) Gate C, an 'exit' gate between the inner concourse                        and

       the    outside, was opened by the police because                  of     the

       dangerous congestion at the turnstiles.            Clearly             there

       was    no recognition, either by the Club or the                  police,

       that     unless fans arrived steadily over a long,                 drawn-

       out    period    the    turnstiles would not      be        capable       of
      coping        with     the     large numbers         involved.        This        was

      exacerbated           by       the     fact      that        the    operational

      order         and     police     tactics      did    not       consider           the

      possibility           of a large concentration of late arrivals.

      This situation,              according to Taylor, was made worse by

      a     drunken        minority        and   the      Club's     confused           and

       inadequate signs and ticketing.



Taylor      'passed judgement' on the various agencies                           involved

on    the    day and laid the primary               responsibility              with    the

police.        They       were     on the receiving end of               most     of    his

criticism.          This clear emphasis on the police and the                          more

reserved criticism of other agencies will be discussed here.

However, it is prudent to consider general criticisms of the

Interim Report at this point.



An    evaluation of the Taylor Report fundamentally is                               merely

an     evaluation          of    his   interpretation         of     the         evidence

presented       to the inquiry( i.e. it is                 selective        evidence)..

The     West    Midlands Police advertised a                  'Freephone'            number

enabling members of the public who had attended the match to

offer       their     evidence to the Inquiry.                A total           of     3,776

statements          were taken and some 1,550 letters were                       received

concerning          the Hillsborough Disaster.              Taylor pointed              out.



               From this   mass it was essential to
               select only sufficient gQQ.d      and
               reliable    evidence   necessary   to
               establish   the facts and causes of
               the disaster. [Emphasis added: 3]


                                           47
Given that the police were the people taking the                               statements

one might be forgiven for thinking that there was an element

of subjectivity in the selection process, particularly                                     when

it   is    realised that the questionnaire used by                         the        police

included         siconfidential assessment of the quality                            of     the

witness"(impressive; average;                      poor).    A resident              living

close     to     the     Hillsborough ground spoke of                the        "lack        of

interest"        shown by the police when he volunteered                            evidence

regarding the fans behaviour which was contrary to the South

YorkshirePolice              view      of     events.            Further,             Taylor

acknowledged           that the witnesses called were only                      "a        small

fraction        of those from whom statements were or                      could           have

been taken".           Nevertheless he was "satisfied that they                            were

sufficient        in number and reliability to enable me to                               reach

the necessary conclusions" [4].



This      raised        the     fundamental          questions      of     methodology

concerning            the     function       and     procedural      priorities              of

official         inquiries.           From     the     material      available              the

potential        subjectivity of the research process                          is    clearly

 evident.             First,        the     West Midlands        Police             as      the

 investigating              force,    was     entrusted      with        the        task     of

 gathering,           sorting    and selecting          'relevant          information.

 While         this     task    was       onerous     the    very    basis           of     the

 information-gathering                process, the questionnaire,                    demanded

 that      police        officers         untrained     in     research              methods,

 initially made qualitative assessments of witnesses over the



                                              48
telephone.        Despite reservations with the questionnaire from

experienced           researchers      [5]     the    format was retained.

Second, Lord Justice Taylor and his Inquiry team decided, on

criteria        not    published,who would be         called     to       present

evidence        and how sources       would be balanced (i.e.            civilian

witnesses,        police     witnesses, etc.).        Third, in       coming      to

this decision, a further assessment was made on the basis of

"sufficient,          good   and reliable      evidence"       [6].      Finally,

these      intricate and demanding processes were                decided        upon

and operationalised in a very short time-period.



Lord Justice Taylor stated prior to the Inquiry that it                          was

not     the purpose of the Inquiry to apportion blame, but,                       as

outlined        earlier, it is clear that            he believed the       police

to    be    the       'main reason' for      the     Disaster     [7].     Police

reaction to the publication of the Interim Report                        generally

was that they had been criticised too harshly while                         unruly

fans' had been spared criticism.                However, it can be          argued

that by      criticising the police Taylor              paved     the     way    for

 'scapegoating' individual officers for their actions on                         the

day,       rather than criticising the South Yorkshire Police                     in

 terms     of     operational       policies    and    procedures.          Taylor

 directly        supported    South     Yorkshire      Police     policies        in

 general:



                      over   many years the     South
                Yorkshire     Police    have    given
                ftxnellent, service— is— the— public
                They have handled crowd problems


                                        49
            sensitively and successfully at a
            large   number of football     games
            including    major matches,   during
            strikes in the coal industry and the
            steel    industry,  and   in   other
            contexts. [Emphasis added: 8]



These comments, particularly with regard to the handling                        of

of   industrial           disputes,     are    not    uncontested.     On      the

contrary,      a     range     of sources have         criticised    the     South

Yorkshire Police directly for their insensitivity during the

steel    and       coal     disputes.     The Chief      Constable    of     South

Yorkshire,         Peter Wright, quoted from Taylor in his                 address

to   a meeting of the South Yorkshire Police                  Authority.        He

stated:



            The management training,     appraisal
            and selection processes that exist
            with the force are all targeted to
            achieve   a continuation of       that
            'excellent_____ service---- £2-----the
            public .... [Emphasis added: 9]



Wright, therefore, successfully deflected criticism of

operations on the day of the Disaster and then used the                        Siii2

.indica ruling in responding to awkward questions relating to

police    operational          codes     for    the    fateful   match.        Lord

Justice     Taylor's         criticism of the police was            weakened     by

emphasising what he considered to be the "excellent service"

given by South Yorkshire Police.                 By referring directly          and

uncritically         to their policing of strikes in the               coal     and

steel industries a political position was adopted.                      Taylor's

general      support for the policing of South               Yorkshire        added
weight     and legitimacy to the arguments of Police                          Authority

members     in their refusal to accept Peter Wright's offer                                to

resign     (N.B. an offer of resignation is not a tendering                                of

resignation).               It     is    in    this   respect       that        Taylor '3

criticisms were diluted.                  Indeed, there was more written                   in

the    Taylor        Report that is favourable to the                  police         (even

some     justification             for    their actions on the          day         of    the

Disaster       [10])        than there was in            acknowledgement            of    the

behaviour       of     fans.        In fact Taylor        condensed          into    three

lines the positive behaviour of the Liverpool fanscompared

with seven lines on drunkenness and behaviour problems.



The    other      agencies involved in the                Hillsborough          Disaster

were     spared       the        criticisms that had        been       expected          both

inside     and       outside        soccer.       The Interim      Report       of       Lord

Justice        Taylor            made     no   criticism     of        the      Football

Association.           Taylor           excused    the   Football       Association's

decision to play the semi-final in Sheffield for the                                 second

consecutive year because the 1988 game:



            ...had     been       considered                       a
            successfully managed event. [11]


Taylor can be criticised here.                     This statement represented a

tacit     acceptance of the 'success' of the 1988 game                              without

any     indication as to how this conclusion was drawn or                                what

criteria were employed to establish 'success .                           It has          been

argued elsewhere:
             Clearly, the Liverpool fans present
             at that fixture had not been privy
             to these considerations. [12]


In choosing Hillsborough as the venue for Liverpool's               semi­

final     for the second year running, the Football Association

was     criticised    by   a range    of   interests,   including     the

Football      Supporters' Association.       Liverpool Football     Club

complained      about the allocation of places and        tickets     but

the     Football     Association did not respond.       Taylor's     only

comment on this in his Interim Report was:



             No   doubt in future the Football
             Association will be more sensitive
             and    responsive   to   reasonable
             representations. [13]



In    his Final Report however, Taylor         criticised the      choice

of venue:



             ... in selecting Hillsborough as
             the venue for the cup semi-final,
             the Football Association did not
             consider in any depth whether it was
             suitable for a high risk match with
             an attendance of 54,000 requiring to
             be segregated, all of whom were,  in
             effect, away supporters lacking week
             in week out knowledge of the ground.
             [14]



He    did     not believe that the choice of venue was       the      main

cause       of the Disaster.   This would have been the case          only

had     it been impossible to police the Leppings Lane          end     of


                                     52
the ground successfully due to lay-out.                 Taylor stated "I do

not   believe       that      to be so" [15].      It    could     be    argued,

however,    that given the police operational orders                    for     the

day it was the case that the Leppings Lane end was incapable

of being successfully policed.



Taylor     acknowledged that Sheffield Wednesday Football                      Club

contributed       to    the     Disaster    in   commenting      that,          "The

Leppings     Lane      end was unsatisfactory and ill            suited...

[16] .



            Poor    signposting   outside    the
            turnstiles and the unhelpful format
            of the tickets also led to confusion
            aggravating the build-up in      the
            turnstile area. [17].



However,     the       Club    can   be    criticised     for    its     attitude

towards     the     safety      certificate for     the     ground       and     its

contravention          of     provisions    contained     within       the     Green

Guide.     The Sheffield City Council had a duty concerning the

issuing, monitoring and revising of the Hillsborough                         safety

certificate.            Both the Club and the local authority failed

in their respective duties for:


            The certificate took no account of
            the 1981 and 1985 alterations of the
            ground. [18]



The certificate in force on the day of the Disaster was that

which had been issued in 1979 for an indefinite period.                           It
had never been amended and, therefore, was inaccurate.                               Why

did     the    local authority and the Club fail                to      update       the

certificate          and, indeed, why did the           Football        Association

fail     to check the validity of the certificate?                      It was       not

as if there had been no warning signs.                   The 1981        oemi—final

between       Tottenham Hotspurs and Wolverhampton                   Wanderers        at

Hillsborough          was       saved from disaster only because              several

hundred       fans     were       allowed to escape      severe       crushing        by

climbing        onto the pitch. At that time               police        instructed

the      Club    that       the     capacity    specified      by     the         safety

certificate          was too high.        Yet this warning, and             the     near

miss     of a disaster, was not heeded by the Club,                         the     City

Council               or            the         Football              Association.

Sheffield       Wednesday's attitude and response to                    safety       was

apparently influenced by cost.                 This is best          illustrated by

the     provision          of emergency services        at     the    Hillsborough

ground.


 In    the    organisation, administration              and     presentation          of

sports        events       or    other    large-scale    leisure        events, the

correct assumption is that facilities for entry and                           egress,

 safe     passage       and      safe spectating are         regulated        by     law.

 Equally       it is assumed that there exists                contingency          plans

 governing       emergencies which would include fire,                    structural

 damage, overcrowding, injuries, illness, etc.                        There        exists

 no     statutory obligation, however, on events' organisers                           to

 provide        full,       professional       cover    from      the       emergency
services.        In Sheffield the relationship between                    Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club and the loouth Yorkshire Metropolitan

Ambulance       Service (SYMAS) had been strained for some                        time.

Prior      to    1986      there     had    been     no     Ambulance           Service

representative             routinely       present    at     Hillsborough             for

matches.        The     preferred          option    was    to    use     St.     Johns

volunteers rather than full-time professional cover.                             As one

Ambulance Service senior officer stated, " ... no matter how

hard    they     try they are a voluntary agency ...                     there's       no

comparison, but football clubs are notorious for getting the

cheapest deal - £1 per 1,000 spectators" [19].



Despite     ambivalence on the part of the Club, SYMAS held                            a

meeting     of       all    senior     personnel      the    Monday       after       the

Bradford        Fire Disaster.         It was the intention of the                Chief

Ambulance        Officer that SYMAS could cope with that scale                         of

disaster        at    any of the venues within              its   district.           All

clubs     were offered a full-cover, on-site service                       but     that

offer was not accepted.              SYMAS compiled an emergency plan to

respond to any foreseeable disaster at the football grounds.

The     clubs allowed SYMAS entry to their grounds to "look                            at

part     of the facilities" [20] and to draw up                    plans.         There

was     liaison       with the police and the fire                service       and    at

 Hillsborough, SYMAS was able to take a decision as to                            where

 ambulances          could be positioned and parked.               Key    routes        to

 the    Accident        and    Emergency departments of             the     two       main

 hospitals were planned.




                                            55
Through        this    work,        and following requests              by    the     South

Yorkshire Police,             it     was agreed        to    have     two     additional

vehicles        dedicated to the ground on match-days, one at                             the

ground        and     one    a mile away.        The        Club     agreed    that       two

reserved        seats for League matches only, would be                        allocated

for     the     use of ambulance officers so that there                        would       be

professional           help        on hand.   The seats were            in    the     South

stand, close to the players' tunnel, as opposed to being                                    in

the     North        stand    which was close           to     the     gymnasium          (the

designated            casualty       centre   in       the     event     of    a      major

incident).             It     would     appear     that       the      Football           Club

prioritised           their investments in human capital.                       It    seems

that     it was more important for ambulance workers to                              be     on

hand     to respond to player's injuries than to                         be     concerned

with     crowd safety, and the club's physiotherapist played                                 a

large part in the negotiations leading to Ambulance                                  Service

representatives              being located near to the                players        tunnel.

Taylor did not criticise this situation but did recommend.




               At   least   one    fully    equipped
               ambulance   from   the    appropriate
               ambulance authority should be in
               attendance at all matches with an
               expected crowd of 5,000 or more.[21]




 Also     he        recommended that for larger crowds the                    number        of

 ambulances:
           ... should be specified by the local
           authority after consultation with
           the ambulance service and should be
           made   a feature of     the   safety
           certificate. [22]



Lord   Justice Taylor made       no criticism of the       response       of

the Emergency Services:



            ... no valid criticism can be made
           of the response by the St. John
           Ambulance Brigade, by SYMAS or by
           the fire brigade on 15th April. [23]



From   a    range of other accounts, however, it           appears      that

Lord   Justice Taylor was too emphatic in his exoneration                 of

the    Emergency Services.      This applied particularly          to    his

judgement     concerning SYMAS.      Taylor claimed that         the    only

criticism     of   SYMAS came from two        Liverpool    Doctors.       He

stated:



            One claimed that ambulances did not
            arrive swiftly or with sufficient
            equipment and that there was lack of
            triage.   He was proved to be wrong
            in      all     three      respects.
            Unfortunately he had seen fit to go
            on television on 15th April when he
            said more lives could have been
            saved if staff and equipment had
            arrived earlier. ... His comments on
            television were irresponsible. [24]



Taylor     appeared   to   confuse      the   identities    of    the     two

doctors.      It was Dr John Ashton (Senior Lecturer in                Public

Health,     University     of   Liverpool)     who spoke    of    lack     of


                                   57
triage and a.     3 low    response, but it was Dr Glyn Philipo (G.P.

East Kilbride, Scotland) who went on television on the                                15th

April.      It seemed that Lord Justice Taylor treated them                             as

one   and the same person.               While this appears to be a                  minor

point it    could         be    interpreted       as an     indication          of     his

impression of the two doctors' evidence.



In his discussion of SYMAS, Lord Justice                     Taylor s          position

was   contradictory.             While     he made no       criticisms          of     the

Emergency        Services,        he     made    a   substantial            number      of

recommendations           regarding       the co-ordination            of     emergency

services,       first      aid, medical         facilities,       ambulances           and

communicat ions.




Allegations       that         ambulances       did not    arrive       swiftly        was

refuted      by    Taylor         and     the     evidence       of    the      Control

Superintendent          for      SYMAS    supports        this    assessment.           He

stated     to the inquiry that approximately twenty                          ambulances

had been dispatched and that by 3.30pm, at least a dozen                                of

those     had      arrived at the ground.              Dr Ashton was           severely

criticised        at    the      Inquiry    for      claiming         that    only     one

 ambulance was at the Leppings Lane end at 3.30pm.                            According

 to the evidence of Ambulanceman Lawrence Yoxall, however, at

 approximately         3.21pm there was no ambulance present at                         the

 Leppings       Lane end.        In fact he stated that he had                 attended

 to   several casualties before an ambulance arrived and                               when

 it   left for the hospital there were ambulances                            waiting     to
take     its place.          Counsel for the Ambulance          Service          stated

that     there     had been at least four ambulances                  at     Leppings

Lane     by     3.30pm.       If this was so, then it is            difficult            to

understand        the     absence      of   ambulances       when     Ambulanceman

Yoxall         first arrived at the scene.             If, as was          stated        in

the     evidence        of Control Superintendent Clarke,                  the        first

ambulance arrived at 3.17pm                 it would   seem     unlikely               that

four     ambulances would            have been and gone by 3.21              pm,        the

approximate time that Yoxall arrived.                  Although counsel                 for

SYMAS     tried        to lead Yoxall into agreeing            that        ambulances

were     present,        he was very definite as to            when        the        first

ambulance        arrived       and    his evidence lent        support           to     the

testimony of Dr Ashton.



Further,        the Major Accident Vehicle was not sent for                           until

3.29pm,        arriving       sixteen minutes later at          3.45pm.               Given

that this was the main vehicle equipped to deal                        with           major

incidents, the           delay       in requesting     its    attendance              seems

inexplicable.           Even when this vehicle arrived at the ground,

however, it could not be driven onto the pitch.                        Access           was

blocked        due to modifications to the ground which                     the        Club

had not notified to SYMAS.



Although evidence was given to the Taylor Inquiry                           regarding

the Major         Accident       Vehicle, Lord Justice         Taylor        made        no

reference         to    its existence or potential.             In fact          in     the

 Final        Report    he    referred to a      major       incident       equipment
vehicle       used by the Scottish Ambulance Service               and     stated

that:

              This provision goes a long       way
              towards   meeting   the   criticisms
              raised after Hillsborough. [25]


He went on to recommend that:


              A 'Major incident equipment vehicle'
              designed and equipped to deal with
              50 casualties should be deployed in
              addition    to    other    ambulance
              attendance at a match where a crowd
              in excess of 25,000 is expectea.
              [26]

He     made    no reference to the existence of the                SYMAS    Major

Accident       Vehicle, to          the problems experiencedby SYMAS            in

attempting           to     negotiate   adequate      accident     cover      with

Sheffield          Wednesday,       to the delay in deploying the          vehicle

or to the restriction               of access to the pitch.



 Lord    Justice          Taylor   also denied that triage had        notbeen

used      at Hillsborough.          Triage is defined as         ensuring     that

 those most likely to benefit from treatment are seen                       first”

 [27].        It    has     been    difficult    to   establish     the      facts

 concerning         the use of triage at Hillsborough.             The     doctors

 working at the back of Leppings Lane argued strongly that it

 was     not in operation.           Most of the dead, dying        or     injured

 were carried             across   the pitch towards      the    Gymnasium.         A

 senior ambulance officer directed those which he                    considered

 dead to be carried to the Gymnasium and those still alive to

 the     ambulances.           Inevitably,      because   those     rescued     or
    recovered were taken in no particular order, the                     evacuation

    initially was at random.          Consequently triage was limited.



    The deployment        of the     Gymnasium as the        'emergency areawas

    mentioned      by     Lord Justice     Taylor,    but    there        was       no

    evaluation     of     itsuse or criticism         of    its    adequacy        or

    operation.      He     stated,    as   a matter    of    fact,        that     the

    Gymnasium     was     used as a    temporary      mortuary.           His     only

£    criticism    was implied and it regarded the response of                     some

    of the fans.        He stated:

                There was intense distress amongst
                the   injured and    the  bereaved,
                relatives   were reluctant to      be
                parted from the dead and sought to
                revive them.    There were     people
                looking for missing friends       and
                relations;   there were    scuffles.
                Some of these involved those who
                were the worse for drink. [28]


     Taylor's definitive remark concerning fans being                     the    worse

     for drink" was insensitive and has drawn criticism from                        the

®    families.       He    overlooked the possibility             that     the fans

     behaviour     was in a most difficult context involving                     shock,

     not necessarily alcohol.          Many people had suffered             combined

     trauma of escaping death, of witnessing death and of                        sudden

     bereavement.         The   psychological effects of a           disaster          of

     this kind     tend to be neglected, and Post            Traumatic           Stress

     Disorder (P.T.S.D.) is a recognised condition.                  Taylor would

      have been    well     advised to recognise this, not               only     as     a

      possible explanation of behaviour in the Gymnasium but                       also



                                           61
as the basis for making recommendations for future treatment

of    victims       of     disasters.           This implied    criticism          is    in

contrast to the praise offered by senior ambulance                              officers

who stated that they could not have coped with the exteht of

the     Disaster had the fans not'shown bravery and courage                               in

moving the dead and injured [29].



There        is     an     alternative          interpretation       of    the      fans

reactions         to the events at the Gymnasium.                   It is that          they

had every right to be angry.                     For, having started the day by

setting       out to watch a game of football, a few hours                          later

they were searching for the bodies of relatives and friends.

It     is    well-established               that people lose control of             their

emotions in the presence of sudden death and serious injury.

Many people, particularly the emergency services,                              commented

on the composure and restraint of the fans given the                               ordeal

to          which        they       were       subjected.        The           collective

 resourcefulness              of     fans      involved   and   their          persistent

 efforts       to    help          the   injured     represented       a       remarkable

 contribution            in     the circumstances.          Rather     than      focusing

 primarily          on the negative or disruptive behaviour of a                         few

 fans       at the Gymnasium it would have been                  more      appropriate

 for     Lord Justice Taylor to have evaluated the adequacy                              and

 appropriateness              of     designating the Gymnasium             a     temporary

 mortuary.           For it was this use of the Gymnasium                      throughout

 the evening of the Disaster and into the early hours of                                  the

 following          day,       and the associated procedures               adopted        for

 identification               which      has    drawn the    most      consistent         and
substantial criticisms from families, the Ambulance           Service

and    other caring agencies.    Yet this issue was     ignored       by

the Inquiry.

Lord     Justice     Taylor   made'    it   clear    that     overall

responsibility       for co-ordinating the emergency services         at

Hillsborough       rested with the South Yorkshire Police         Force.

This would appear to be the case generally, yet on the basis

of     the Hillsborough Disaster      it is reasonable to     question

the adequacy of such arrangements and the assumptions              which

underpin     them.    At Hillsborough there was a    reluctance       on

the part of senior officials to assume control.         There was a

lack of co-ordination and little co-operation.         When       police

direction     and decision-making was found wanting         the    other

services had no means of co-ordinating their response.



Lord Justice Taylor was unambiguous in his criticism of              the

police.     He stated, with regard to senior officers:


            ... neither their handling of the
            problems   on the day nor       their
            account of it in evidence showed the
            qualities   of leadership    to    be
            expected of their rank. [30]


Lord Justice Taylor continued his indictment of the police:


            It is a matter of regret that at the
            hearing,  and in their submissions,
            the South Yorkshire Police were not
            prepared to concede they were in any
            respect at fault in what occurred.
            [31]
Ttr tav!nr' tnautrv Final Report,i 'From Safety t,o Contra 1_




As        noted earlier, Lord Justice Taylor decided early in                       his

Inquiry that he           would present two reports.               The first,       his

              Report, dealt with the specifics of the Disaster and

maderecommendations              accordingly.            The   second,   his EinaJ.

Bponrt .          reflected   the "second phaseof the Inquiry .


                  directed to making final       and long
                  term recommendations about         crowd
                  --'ontrol   and   safety    at    sports
                  grounds.     Indeed to consider       in
                  depth     information,   opinions    and
                  arguments from a wide range           of
                  sources and contributors both here
                  and abroad.     It was clear from the
                  outset that this second phase could
                  not be carried to completion before
                   the next football season ... [32]


 Lord         Justice     Taylor       sought    written         submissions        from

 sporting, local authority, emergency service, technical                             and

 police       organisations.          Further, he gathered additional               oral

 evidence           and made visits to other venues.               This process         of

  'broadening          out'     the    Inquiry was        adopted     previously        by

 Popplewell and follows a simple logic.                        Following a disaster

 of        the     magnitude of Bradford or Hillsborough                 there     is     a

  major          responsibility       on the inquirers to          gather   evidence,

  present a full account and make recommendations specific                              to

     the events.        This process      enables       all resources and        efforts

     to      be     directed,    in     the     first     instance,      towards        the

     circumstances        relating directly to the disaster.                A      second

     phase        is then utilised to deal with the broader issues                      and
implications.         Yet there are problems in this approach.                                By

identifying       the     first phase report as                      'Interim'      and      the

second       Phase as 'Final' the tendency, in the long term,                                 is

for    the findings of the first phase to be subordinated,                                    if

not lost, to the findings of the second.                             What this can mean

is     that     the Final Report comes to be                        established        as    t:he

definitive        report     and      the        key        issues     specific        to    the

disaster        become     neglected             as    broader        issues,        possibly

completely        unrelated to the disaster, dominate                           public       and

political attention.


Lord        Justice Taylor presented his Final Report on the                                 29th

January,        1990.      The     Report was divided                  into      four       parts

concluding        with     seventy-six                final     recommendations.               In

keeping        with     his intention to conduct                     "wider      and     deeper

 investigations" into the "needs of crowd control and                                    safety

 for the future" [33] the four parts significantly                                  broadened

 the     scope    of his Inquiry.                Part One,          entitled        Football:

 Present and Future' considered the 'lessons' of Hillsborough

 as     a     prelude to considering soccer's                        future.        Part     Two,

 clearly related to the Interim Report, in its                                 concentration

 on 'Safety in Sports Grounds'.                        Both Parts One and Two                were

 directly        concerned with the Hillsborough Disaster                              and    the

 prevention        of    future, similar disasters.                      Part       Three,     on

  'Crowd       Control     and     Hooliganism',               however,        returned       the

 debate        around    crowd      safety             to     the    issue     of       football

 hooliganism'.            This     f u s i o n    of crowd safety             and      'football



                                                 65
hooliganism',       as discussed in the        Introduction,          dominated

the Popplewell Inquiry and re-emerged in the Taylor Inquiry.

Part Four, on 'The Football Spectators Act, 1989' was a more

relevant issue given that the Government had gone ahead with

much—maligned        legislation while the Taylor inquiry               was      in

session     and     that the implementation of the new                law     would

have     major     ramifications        for managing     large       crowds     and

maintaining          safe     procedures.        Yet          this      section,

understandably        given     the stated intentions           of    the     Prime

Minister     and her ministers, was dominated by discussion                      of

'disorder',         'weeding      out      hooligans',         policing         and

'strategies        against hooligans'.        The balance of          the     Final

Report     had     significant implications on           the     debates       that

ensued following publication, an issue discussed later.



Early in the Final Report Lord Justice Taylor stated that in

 his judgement the Hillsborough Disaster could have                     happened

 at other venues:

             Hillsborough should not be regarded
             as a freak occurrence, incapable of
             happening elsewhere. [34]


 Its     broader context was one of a 'malaise' within the                     game

 which     could     be     attributed to a range        of     factors.      These

 included:

             old   grounds,   poor    facilities,
             hooliganism, excessive drinking and
             poor leadership. [35]

 Central     to his assessment is the principle that the                      safety
and behaviour of people at matches is related                   fundamentally

to    the   accommodation and facilities on offer                   and     uo        the

enforcement        of      high   standards.       It    is     a         principle

exemplified by the following .comment:


            Apart    from    the discomfort     of
            standing on a terrace- exposed to the
            elements, the ordinary provisions to
            be    expected    at a    place     of
            entertainment    are sometimes     not
            merely basic but squalid. At some
            grounds the lavatories are primitive
            in design, poorly maintained       and
            inadequate in number. This not only
            denies the spectator an essential
            facility he (sic) is entitled to
            expect.    It directly lowers      the
            standards of conduct. The practice
            of urinating against walls or even
            on terraces has become endemic and
             is followed by men who would not
            behave that way elsewhere.         The
            police, who would charge a man for
            urinating in the street,        either
             tolerate it in football grounds or
             do no more than give a         verbal
             rebuke. Thus crowd conduct becomes
             degraded    and other   misbehaviour
             seems less out of place. [36]


The    Leppings      Lane    terrace at     Hillsborough        was        a     clear

 example    of     the     range of    problems     associated        with           this

 principle.        These    were:     poor access       to    the    turnstiles,

 restricted       flow of people into the ground,              inadequate              and

 erroneous        signposting,      virtually     no    stewarding,             no     pen

 closure     on     reaching full capacity and no access                   to        basic

 facilities once on the terraces.               Yet this was a            designated

 semi-final ground and one of the best facilities in Britain.



 Lord Justice Taylor considered that such conditions were but


                                       67
part     of    the     problem.         He    expressed     concern   over         the

degrading         treatment       and        rituals   sufferedby     football

supporters, particularly visiting supporters, by the police.

He stated:

               the ordinary law-abiding football
               supporter travelling away is caught
               up in a police operation reminiscent
               of a column of prisoners of war
               being    marched    and     detained
               underground. [37]


While Lord Justice Taylor noted the now established practice

of detaining visiting fans at the ground until home fans had

cleared        the     vicinity he made no direct            criticism    of       the

practice.            His   conclusion was that it           was   necessary        but

unattractive:

               Necessary though such operations may
               presently be, they do nothing to
               enhance the image of football as a
               spectator    sport   followed    for
               entertainment and pleasure. [38]


This     practice,         together with the 'enforced march'             to       and

 from the ground is without parallel in contemporary society.

 There        is no other activity in which the suspension                   of    the

 civil rights of spectators has become so                     institutionalised.

 Under        the law, particularly since the introduction                   of     the

 1986     Public Order Act, the police have the statutory                         right

 to subject spectators to these draconian practices providing

 that     they       can   establish          'reasonable    suspicion'      in     the

 circumstances that an offence might be committed.                        Offences

 specified           by the Act which could apply to disorder, or                   the


                                              68
'threat    of disorder', at soccer matches are: riot,                     affray,

violent    disorder        and disorderly      behaviour.          In    policing

spectators       so   heavily     the assumption       is    made       that     all

spectators       are placed under suspicion of committing one                     or

more      of    these     offences     regardless     of    their        personal

histories or individual circumstances.                 In other words           they

are    under suspicion and policed accordingly solely                      on    the

grounds        that they are football spectators            and,        therefore,

potential         'hooligans'.         This   issue    failed      to      receive

attention from Lord Justice Taylor.               He appeared to be             more

concerned        with the 'public image' of soccer than                  with    the

civil liberties of spectators.



In addition to the civil liberties issue is concern over the

accountability of the police for their operational                        policies

 and practices.          The serious and sustained criticisms of                  the

 police made by Lord Justice Taylor in his Interim Report led

 to    a series of recommendations concerning police                     planning.

 These were: a senior officer to be appointed to liaise                          with

 the    management of each football club and                local       authority;

 the    use of 'operational orders' and pre-match briefings                        to

 emphasise vigilance concerning overcrowding; flexibility                          m

 'operational           orders'   to     accommodate        "any        foreseeable

 pattern" of crowd behaviour including sufficient reserves of

 officers        on stand-by; the option to postpone a kick-off                     to

 enable        crowd difficulties to be resolved safely;                  full     and

 detailed        crowd    management      data available        to      the     police
control     room.        The eight recommendations           made     concerning

communications          and the co-ordination of emergency                 services

emphasised        and consolidated the police as tne                Key        service

with central responsibility for crowd management and                            inter­

agency co-operation and response.



In   his    Final       Report Lord Justice         Taylor    extended           these

recommendations.           He    made new     recommendations         on        police

planning        to deal with: ticketless fans; arrest                procedures;

kick-off        times at high-risk matches; strategy training                        for

senior     officers;       financial costs of policing              soccer.           In

both     reports there were no recommendations                concerning             the

adopted     and institutionalised practices of policing                         soccer

matches     and       regulating     crowd    behaviour.          There        was    no

requirement           suggested concerning the priorities adopted                     in

preparation for main matches and no recommendation governing

police     -      police authority consultation.             In    other        words,

despite         the    severe   criticisms      levelled     by     Taylor           and

directed         towards the police he considered it                inappropriate

 that     the     police    should    be     made   accountable        for       their

operational           policies, strategies and practices.                 Strategic

 plans,     police       briefings and operational           priorities          would

 remain police matters, drawn up and conducted behind                           closed

 doors.     Consultation, therefore, would continue to exist                          on

 the terms and conditions decided by the police organised                             in

 keeping         with    the    convenience     and    judgement          of      their

 profession.          As a senior ambulance officer stated.




                                        70
              The police? Uh. They will never let
              go of that mantle of authority.
              They see themselves as the number
              one authority and the rest of us as
              subordinates. [39]


After Hillsborough the police were not the only organisation

under scrutiny.            There was considerable disquiet            concerning

the     Interim Report's relatively mild comments on                      the    role

and responsibility of the Football Association and Sheffield

Wednesday       Football       Club in the Disaster. Some            effort          was

made     in    the Final Report to redress the                balance.          Taylor

pointed       to     the    established      priorities       of    the    Football

Association and the Football League when he stated:


               They have been much concerned to
               avoid pitch invasions because they
               interfere with the smooth progress
               of   the fixture list and       incur
               criticism and penalties from the
               European Football authorities.    But
               advice, for example, as to turnstile
               layouts,  the division of viewing
               areas and, until recently, on ratios
               of seating to standing areas ftas not
               been forthcoming. [40]


 Lord    Justice         Taylor equally was critical of             the    Football

 Clubs, commenting,           "it is legitimate         to wonder    whether         the

 directors         are     genuinely interested         in the welfare          of the

 grass-roots          supporters"        [41].    Taylor's    criticism         of the

 Football          Association for its choice of Hillsborough                   as    the

 venue        for the semi-final, and without broader                 consultation

 concerning          the ground's suitability, is in marked                 contrast

 to      his       defence    of   the     F.A.    in   his    Interim          Report.

 Previously, he had defended that decision because                         the       1938
game,     "had      been considered a successfully                     managed          event"

[42].     Clearly, while crowd management - or the lack of                                    it,

constituted         the      basis     upon which the          police          were         found

wanting,       there      were       other   contributing             factors          to     the

Disaster,        the      responsibility' for            which        lay      with         other

authorities            and    whose     'proportion           of     blame'        can         be

established         only through the courts.                  Briefly          these        were:

the     choice      of       venue; the      distribution            of     tickets;          the

condition        of the Leppings Lane end of the ground                           including

the      turnstile            approach,      the       adequacy           of      turnstile

throughput, the signposting of the terraces, the open access

to     pens    3    and 4, the absence of                capacity           control,          the

fabric and state of the terraces, the perimeter fencing                                       and

the     inadequacy of egress forwards, backwards                            or     sideways.

Each     of these factors, all structural and                         all        measurable,

contributed         to the deaths of ninety-five people and to                                the

physical and psychological injuries suffered by many others.

In making the limited recommendations in his Interim Report,

Lord     Justice Taylor confirmed his commitment                            to     resolving

the     issue      of     overcrowding, the            principle          cause         of    the

Disaster.          He phrased his comments on reduced                          numbers         and

 safety       certificates           in terms of 'rigour'             and        'vigilance'

 alleging        "poor       performance"         on    the    part       of      the        local

 authority         at Hillsborough [43].               Given that twenty-five                   of

 his    final       recommendations          were       concerned         with          terrace

 capacity,         filling       and monitoring          of        terraces,       gangways,

 fences/gates,            crush barriers and safety                  certification             and



                                             72
that     twelve        of   his final        recommendations            concerned          the

duties of football clubs there is every indication that full

and      proportionate            liability        extends    beyond          the        crowd

management           function        of    the      police    to        the         footbaii

authorities,           the South Yorkshire County Council (the                           local

authority        responsible         for     the     Safety     Certificate              until

1986),     the       Sheffield       City Council        (the        local         authority

responsible          from 1986) , the Sheffield               Wednesday             Football

Club     and its safety advisors Eastwood and Partners.                                  While

this      raises        issues      of     criminal,     civil          and        corporate

liability        specific to Hillsborough there remains a                            broader

context of responsibility concerning those local authorities

and police forces              within whose boundaries designated stadia

are     located.        Further, football clubs,               central         government

and      the     main       football       authorities        have       a     collective

responsibility              for    the     effective,        efficient         and        safe

administration and management of the game.



There     was     a total of seventy-six recommendations                            in    Lord

Justice        Taylor's Final Report, many incorporated                            from     the

Interim         Report.           These    recommendations              included:           the

provision         of    all seater stadia;            monitoring             and    amending

 safety    certificates; the duties of football                          clubs;          police

planning;          communications;               co-ordination           of        emergency

 services;        first      aid; medical          facilities        and       ambulances;

 offences and penalties; a revision of the Green Guide.                                     The

 section       of the Final Report which has been publicised                               most

 heavily       has      been      Taylor's       opposition        to    the        National
Membership scheme.         He stated:



                I have grave doubts about the
           feasibility     of   the    national
           membership    scheme  and    serious
           misgivings about its likely impact
           on safety. ..- For these reasons,  I
           cannot support the implementation of
           Part   I    of the   1989   Football
           Spectators Act. [44]


In     the face of his opposition to the scheme the              Government

climbed down on its proposals for a National Identity Scheme.

It     is important to emphasise that the scheme, however,                  has

been     shelved    and    not   abolished.      The     relevant    clauses

contained        in Part One of the 1989 Football            Spectators     Act

remain     on the Statute Book and it is reasonable to               suppose

that     the compulsory membership scheme will re-emerge as                  an

 issue.


 Ten recommendations were made in the Final Report                  regarding

 Police Planning.         These recommendations reflected a dominant

 commitment       by Taylor to crowd safety.        An example of         this,

 noted above, concerns the delay of kick-offs.                 Taylor stated

 that this option should be at the discretion of the                  officer

 in    command at the ground and that, "Crowd safety should                  be

 the paramount consideration in deciding whether to                  exercise

 it"     [45].    However, as discussed earlier, Taylor              made     no

 provision        for     effective      measures      governing          police

 accountability           and    consultation.         His     recommendation

 concerning       the co-ordination of emergency services and                the



                                        74
provision     of      first    aid,   medical       and     ambulance       support

reinforced a paradox established by the Interim Report.                           For

while making no criticisms of the response by the                       emergency

services at Hillsborough he made a range of                       recommendations

concerned with future planning.



A major criticism of the Final Report concerns the                          emphasis

placed by Lord Justice Taylor on 'hooliganism .                       The     Report

was    entitled: "The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster"                        yet    the

Disaster      received minimal consideration.                Taylor        made    the

following statement on this issue:

            Having made my findings as to the
            events at Hillsborough, I do not in
            this report say any more about them
            save by way of illustration. [46]


The    consequence        of    this shift     in    emphasis        between       the

 Interim    and       the Final    Reports was to return             the     broader

debate     over    Hillsborough       to the        issue    of     crowd-related

violence        and      soccer    hooliganism.           Other      key      issuer

 concerning crowd behaviour raised by Taylor, such as                         racism

 and   racial      abuse,      were   neglected       as     the     hooliganism

 bandwagon      rolled        once again.    It was as        if     the      Heysel

 Factor' had received the official seal of approval.                         Nowhere

 was   this     more evident than in         the      parliamentary          debates

 which followed publication of the              Final Report.



 In opening the Commons' debate on the Final Report into                            the

 Hillsborough         Stadium     Disaster the       Home     Secretary,          David

 Waddington stated:
                  I am most grateful to Lord Justice
                  Taylor for the report, which sets
                  out clearly why we have had so many
                  tragedies at football grounds over
                  the years and why we have       had
                  disorder and hooliganism. [47]


    This     statement set the agenda'for parliamentary            discussion

    of     the    biggest   sporting disaster in    Britain       within     the

    context        of   hooliganism.   Although     the    Home      Secretary

    acknowledged that the Interim Report emphasised the issue of

    overcrowding        as the cause of the Hillsborough          Disaster    in

^   the     same sentence he referred to hooliganism and             excessive

    drinking.       While there was much to be commended in the Final

    Report it was inappropriate that Lord Justice Taylor devoted

    such     a    large section to 'hooliganism      as    an     issue.     The

    Parliamentary Debates were a clear indication of how Members

    of     Parliament were quick to capitalise on this             element    of

    the     Report and use it not only to shift the             emphasis     from

    Taylor's       rejection   of the National Membership          Scheme     but

    also     as     a   justification for keeping    the    Scheme     on     the

     agenda:


                   In the light of this advice,     the
                   government   have decided not     to
                   proceed with the establishment of a
                   football membership authority,   but
                   Part I of the Act will remain on the
                   Statute book. Work will continue to
                   see how the shortcomings identified
                   by Lord Justice Taylor could be
                   overcome in case we have to return
                   to the matter again,      should the
                   problem    of hooliganism    not  be
                   defeated by the alternative strategy
                   proposed in the report. [48]


                                       76
Lord     Justice     Taylor's       emphasis        on    'hooliganism'         also

provided    the Home Secretary with the opportunity to                      praise

the      actions ofthe          police     in   controlling      crowds.          He

acknowledged      the tribute paid to the police by x-ordyustics

Taylor, adding:



           ... I want to add my thanks to the
           police for the way that they carry
           out the difficult,     thankless and
           often   unthanked tasks that     are
           thrust upon them. [49]


For the bereaved families and the injured this comment added

a     new and insensitive dimension to the losses and                    injuries

which     they had suffered.             The Home Secretary       was    emphatic

that     there   would      be     no     let—up     in   the   fight      against

hooliganism.         It    is     therefore        not    surprising    that     the

Conservative       Government           took the opportunity       to    use     the

Hillsborough Disaster Report to keep the debate alive.                          What

is     surprising,        and also disillusioning, however,              was     the

ease     with    which      some Labour M .P .'s were           drawn    into    the

 'hooliganism'       debate.       Roy Hattersley, M.P. for             Birmingham

Sparkbrook         and     Shadow Home Secretary,            exemplified        this

problem when he asked:



            Is the Home Secretary aware that we
            support the more vigorous use of
            exclusion orders to prohibit known
            hooligans from attending football
            matches? [50]


 He    went on to emphasise that a distinction should                      be    made
between     pitch     invasions intended to breach the               peace     and

actions     motivated by simple enthusiasm,           "what Lord        Justice

Taylor     describes        as   Joie de vivre      [51].      The     emphasis

would     have     been better placed by ensuring            that     those     in

authority at Football matches are capable of                  distinguishing

between     a pitch invasion and fans fighting for their                     lives

and     struggling to break free from the cages in                  which     they

are so readily penned.             It was left to Eric Heffer, M.P. for

Liverpool        Walton,     to point out that in      the     parliamentary

debate     the     main     issue was    being    side-stepped        and     that

"Hooliganism        was not the issue at Hillsborough" [52].                   Yet

the     Final     Report of Lord Justice Taylor         had     enabled        the

media     and the politicians to reverse the emphasis from                     one

of    crowd safety and the responsibility for the                   welfare     of

spectators        to one of crowd violence and the             responsibility

for the control of 'hooligans .



Conclusion



As discussed in the Introduction to this Report,                     government

inquiries        suffer     from    serious     limitations.        Remits     set

parameters,        political       and public    opinion     demands        speedy

reports     and      investigators are not necessarily              trained     in

advanced         research    skills demanded by such         complex        tasks.

The       Interim      Report,      dealing      specifically        with      the

Hillsborough Disaster and its primary causes, was                     published

 in     August     1989 just four months after the           Disaster.         The



                                        78
mass     of verbal and written statements, the holding                      of        the

public     hearing       and the. sifting      of    documentary          evidence,

including       hours     of    television coverage,           all    had    to        be

accommodated       within that limited time.             The     Final      Report,

dealing more broadly with the state of soccer, followed just

five months later.             As has been noted this Report embodies a

wide      range     of    issues     and    demanded     an      international,

comparative dimension as well as a more general overview                               of

issues     considered specific to Britain.               Without          doubt       the

achievement         in     meeting         these     tight      deadlines             was

considerable.           Inevitably, however, important issues will be

missed     or     not    prioritised,        evidence    will        be     weighted

according        to interpretation and problems which are slow                         to

 surface    will not be realised.             Where appropriate the               above

 evaluation       of the Taylor Reports has highlighted                    the     main

 points of contention.


 The     more    general problem associated             with    presenting             ^wo

 Reports,       as occurred with the Popplewell Inquiry,                    is     that

 the specifics of the Disaster were discussed in the                         Interim

 Report     while the more general, and therefore less                      directly

 relevant issues, are considered in the Final Report.                            To     an

 extent,        then,    the     Final Report       overshadows       the     Interim

 Report and its findings.             In both the Popplewell and                  Taylor

 Inquiries this shift from the specifics of a Disaster to the

 generalities of administering, funding, managing, regulating

  and    watching        'the game' confused         their     objectives.             The

  doubt which is raised here centres on the expectations                              laid
    on    any Inquiry.          Should an Inquiry into a disaster have                 to

    carry     the burden of wider and not directly related                      issues?

    The     proposition being that if the Government                     considers     it

    necessary to hold a wide Inquiry into the state of soccer or

    the     'ills     of the game' then it should            be     established        on

    those     terms       and    not   be attached to        an    Inquiry      into     a

    particular event.


    With     regard to Taylor it is anomalous that so much                      of     his

    Final     Report is devoted to 'hooliganism', not an                     issue      at

^   Hillsborough, while the role and behaviour of the media, the

    operation        of    the temporary mortuary,           the    procedures         for

    identification and the responsibilities of state agencies on

    the night of the Disaster remain neglected.                     This is a clear

     indication       of the strength of political debates in                    pulling

     the direction of an Inquiry towards its own priorities while

     downgrading           or     ignoring   central     issues.           As     stated

     previously,          the central political debate around soccer                   has

     been     concerned         with 'hooliganism' as                primary      issue.

^    Despite        'hooliganism' playing no part in               the    Hillsborough

     Disaster       it came to dominate the text, the                media      coverage

     and the political discussion of Taylor.



     With      regard       to    Hillsborough    Lord       Justice       Taylor      was

     unequivocal in his judgement that the "main reason" for                            the

     Disaster        was "failure of police control".                This       statement

     answered        the    demand, by many, for         a    single       identifiable



                                             80
reason    and it was taken in some quarters as                     an     'absolute'

(i.e. the 'blame' lay with the police).                    In that sense,            and

it    has been felt deeply within the South Yorkshire                          Poj.i^e?

the      'absolute'      was      used     to    exonerate    or        excuse       the

contributory       actions of other agencies.                Yet, as         h&s    been

shown,    these        agencies     also        received   criticism          by    Lore

Justice       Taylor     and,     therefore, must accept            a     degree      of

responsibility.



The    many     and varied recommendations of                Taylor       have      been

published       and     are there to be           interpreted,      debated         and,

hopefully,       acted     upon.     The Taylor        Inquiry,         despite       its

remarkable achievements, fell between two stools.                            It failed

to cover all of the issues which related to the Disaster and

its    immediate        aftermath.       Yet also it failed             to    offer     a

definitive       and comprehensive review of the problems                          facing

professional soccer and its paying customers.                       As       concluded

elsewhere:



              There is no question that a thorough
              and an authoritative report into
              football and its future is required.
              The   Taylor Report is not      that
              document.   Taylor has had neither
              the time nor the available evidence
              to do the dob properly, and he has
              had to conduct his inquiry in the
              shadow of pressure from a government
              keen to push through its legislation
              as quickly as possible. [53]

               "TT'S A STORY":

THE MEDTA'S ROLE IN THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
Introduction


            Collectively I think they went way
            over the top. ... generally there is
            no   dignity and respect in      the
            occupation they are fulfilling.  The
            role that they play is "it's a story
            and    we'll   worry     about   the
            consequences later". [1]


This    comment     from     a     family      member       whose      son       died     at

Hillsborough,           reflects       the    sentiments        of     many        people

concerning        the      media       coverage        of     the    Disaster.          The

behaviour       of and ensuing reports by sections of                        the    media

produced     deep hurt, anger and widespread condemnation                               from

many    people on Merseyside, leading to the                        Press     Council's

special     inquiry        into press coverage of the                 Disaster          [2].

While     there was       concerted outrage atthe style and                        content

of     much of the reporting, particularly the                       fabrication          of

events     to    givea sharp edge to stories,                  there     was            also

considerable       concern       over        the     effect    of     the     media       on

bereaved        families         and    on     the     broader       reputation           of

Merseyside and its people.



To date there has been no in-depth analysis of the impact of

the      media    post-Hillsborough.                 The      research        project's

concentration       on the media, both short-term                     and        long-term

and     both specific and general, adds a unique                       dimension          to

media     analysis.        The     main       objectives        of    the        following

sections are: to provide a thorough content analysis of                                  the

media     coverage immediately after the Disaster;                          to     examine
how     explanations were constructed and developed                         concerning

the     causes     of    the Disaster; to             consider      the     persistent

emphasis on 'football hooliganism", particularly the 'Heysel

factor'; to evaluate the impact of the overall coverage                                 and

intrusive        behaviour    by     journalists on           those        injured       or

bereaved.         A central proposition of this study is that                           the

media     coverage of Hillsborough has had major                      consequences,

both     specifically on the lives of people directly                         involved

and more generally through the portrayal of Merseyside,                                 its

people and its reputation.



Although certain sections of the press have been censured it

is     essential to assess the basis, adequacy and * limitations

of     such   sanctions.         The role of           the    Press       Council,        in

receiving and processing complaints, is considered in                              terms

of     its adequacy and effectiveness.                  While it is clear               that

specific      editions, stories, photographs and comment in                              the

tabloid       press       gave      rise    to    considerable             anger         and

exacerbated         personal        suffering         there    were       many         other

examples      in    the 'quality press' which contributed                         to     the

more     obvious        excesses.        This section, therefore,                takes     a

broad     view     of     the media and          extends      the     discussion          to

include radio and television.                 The wider and more             long-term

issues        concerning           the      historical         development               and

contemporary            manifestations           of     Merseyside's             negative

reputation,        and     the ideology of            violence,       militancy          and

 criminality        on     which     it     is    based,      will     be        reviewed

 critically in the Second Report.
Manufacturing        News; News graduation and,..the— Management— o£
Information

To    fully understand the problems arising out of                    the     media

coverage of Hillsborough, it is necessary to place it within

a     wider      analysis     of    news     production        processes          and

journalistic         practice.        The     news    is      not     a      simple

'reflection'         of world events, it is a constructed                  reality.

In    other    words      the news is       'created',       produced      within

social,       political,     economic and        cultural      contexts       which

determine      the     end   product.       There    has     been         extensive

research into media output, with particular reference to the

sfilftntion and presentation of information [3].                    With     regard

to    the     news there is an ongoing process of               selection,          by

journalists         and   editors, as to what, from            multiple          world

events, are chosen to become the handful of items on N.SHS— at

T en .      The way selected events are presented, by                  choice       of

language,      visual representation, tone and style,                     also     has

been     recognised as important [4].               Within    these       processes

the discretion afforded to media personnel at all levels                            is

a      paramount concern and substantial research has                      examined

all      aspects     of   news     definition,       gathering,        selection,

presentation         and emphasis which, taken             together,       comprise

the manufacture and management of news [5].                    In     conjunction

with this, other research has analysed the structure                         within

which       media personnel operate and the cumulative effect                       of

direct        and      indirect      state      involvement,           government
legislation             and commercial interests of the                      ownership          and

control of the media [6].



A        key    issue       raised by critical media                  research      which        is

clearly          significant to analysing the Hillsborough                            Disaster

concerns the sources of information used in the construction

of news.          Related to this is the notion of 'agenda-setting'.

News           production          processes         rely       heavily       on      official

statements and "structured access                           to social institutions to

provide them with daily sources of information.                                    Government

officials, civil servants, politicians, the police, military

spokespersons               and    a    whole    range          of     experts           provide

journalists             with their 'bread-and-butter' from                         which       they

construct           news          stories.      Such        institutions           and        their

spokespeople                act upon       the media and persistent                  reference

to        them    increases            the importance           and    intensity         of     the

interpretations                   ascribed      to    a     specific         event.            uuch

individuals are reported faithfully and become the                                       primary

definers'          of       social events, issues and problems                       [7].        In

this way, sources of information play a significant part                                         in

establishing             the framework within which events                         and     issues

are        debated       and       analysed      in       the    public      domain.           This

    framework      has been described as an 'agenda' with the                                 media

    as    playing       a    crucial       part in the           way    it    is     set        [8].

    Crit ical      research has examined the way this                        agenda—setting

    process      presents issues with bias and distortion.                               This     is

    derived in the selective presentation of information and the



                                                86
'expert'       opinion    sought and given legitimacy              through     key

interviews.        As others have commented, the implications                   of

this process are significant:


              In such selection and organisation,
              the news follows a narrow set of
              ideas   and interests    and   these
              determine what descriptions are made
              of events. [9]


Thus     it     is important to think of 'news          as     a     structured

process', particularly in assessing media coverage of highly

controversial events such as the Hillsborough Disaster.



Central        to the    news production process is the newsroom and

its      journalists.         The    individuals      within        the       news

structure', journalists and editors, have an important                        role

through        their     assessment of the     'newsworthiness            of any

event [10].        Their selection and presentation of information

is based around          this concept and it important to assess               the

'news     values'        which underpin it.     Put     another       way,    what

criteria        do journalists use in their selection               of    certain

events as 'news' over and above others?



Research indicates that news values are primarily a                       product

of 'newsroom culture' with journalists learning the                          tricks

of     the     trade'    literally 'on the job'         [11].       The      novice

journalist, for example, spends hours ’writing for the waste

paper basket, under the supervision and guidance of                       editors

 and     sub-editors" [12].         Within newsroom culture there is                 a

 basic        division    between    news   gatherers        (reporters)        and
propossors                  ( e d i t o r s )           b u t     e a c h      g r o u p      o r i e n t a t e s           i t s         work

been            identified most clearly by Chibnall but also                                                                    accepted

by          many              others                  [14].                    Immediacy,                       Dramatisation,

Personalization,                                              Simplification,                                         Titillation,

 independent                  categories                       which underpin news                                  values            within

news production processes throughout the media.



 This illustrates how journalists fit into                                                              well-established,

 regulated                 practices                  which               inform            their             news              gathering

 procedures.                   As Whittaker has commented on the press:


                     Time after time the events are                                                    the
                     same, the cliches and headlines                                                   the
                     same. Only the names of people                                                    and
                     places change. [15]


 Within             broadcast news journalists operate more of                                                                    a       'game

 model' in their working practices.                                                        This adheres to a:


                      ... vocabulary-of-precedence: what
                     previous exemplars tell them should


                                                                       88
             be done      in the      present            instance.
             [16]


While     journalists develop a personalised news judgement                            of

events     over    time, this adheres               to     well-established          news

criteria..      Clearly there are contrasts in newsgathering                          and

editing      techniques       between,        for        example,     quality         and

'tabloid'       newspapers,      or    press         and     broadcasting.            Yet

significant       areas       of constancy in             news   reporting      remain

evident between different newspapers or channels and between

mediums.      What is common is the extent to which news has its

sources in officialdom.



Contrary to the popular image of journalists going                             out     and

about' to find out 'what's happening', most news is                             created

through information sent directly to newsrooms from a                                range

of      official    bodies.        News       organisations           divide         their

journalists into specialists (e.g., crime, foreign,                             sports)

or     general     reporters.         Specialist           correspondents        gather

information from sources specific to their subject area                                and

rely      heavily        on    routinized       contact          with     the         same

institutions and their officers.                    This relationship           between

the     media     and social institutions lends itself                    to     subtle

manipulation        on    a    regular basis             and,    on   occasions,        to

misinformation and abuse [17].                 A particular area of concern

has     been the role of the police in the exploitation of                             the

 'news management' capabilities of officialdom [18].



 In the area of crime reporting journalists are                         particularly


                                         89
dependent         on the police and other official bodies, sucn                            as

the     judiciary, in the construction and development of                              news

stories.          Consequently      the police become 'primary                   definers

of      the       'significance'       of    certain         crimes            and    their

newsworthiness [19]-               In this way the role of the police                      is

that     of a 'control agency' in its dealings with the                              media,

and the police have gone to considerable expense and                                 effort

to achieve news management goals.                      This has been done             xiiot

to     facilitate          their    work    (i.e. to        help         them    to 'solve

crime' and          'catch criminals').            Second,          to    protect     their

Public         image by publicising their capacity to do their                             job

 (i.e.       by    concentrating          selectively     on        the     'success        of

police operations).                Third, the promotion of a positive image

of the police through publicising police views,                                 priorities,

 aims and policies [20].


 What        has become clear in recent years is the commitment                             of

 Britain's           police       forces    to    media     management.              Senior

• officers         undergo    intensive          training      in        how    to   handle

 television, radio and press interviews. Press officers                                 have

 become a         significant      part of the process of                 civilianisation

 of      the      police     and    the     'public      relations'             sections    of

 management           services        are    central           to         police-community

 relations.                With     press        and     broadcast ^             journalists

 occasionally invited to attend major operational                                 incidents,

  such       as the Metropolitan Police raid on Broadwater Farm                                 m

     1989,     the close proximity of certain sections of the                          media



                                             90
to    the     police has emphasised the                  significance      of     police

discretion           in         creating   media          insiders        and         media,

'outsiders'.              This working relationship, however,                   has     its

origins         in        the     direct and      intentional        influence           on

government       policies,            organisational        politics      and     public

opinion.        It        was     an agenda set by         Sir   Robert      Mark,       as

Metropolitan Commissioner, during the 1970s.                         He stated:


              The post-war years have seen        a
              gradual change in our role from mere
              law enforcement to     participating
              in the role of social welfare and
              even more importantly to that of
              contributors in the__ moulding    oi
              public opinion and legislation.
              [emphasis added: 21]


During the 1980s this role has been consolidated.                            Public

statements made by Chief Constables on controversial matters

are     processed          carefully       through       their   public      relations

departments and packaged for the mass media.                         The office           of

Chief       Constable stands, high in the professional                       'hierarchy

nf    credibility'              and    this enables the police          to       mould

public        opinion through the favourable and regular                        coverage

which is guaranteed.                  E .P .Thompson, in a critical          appraisal

of      the      far-reaching            effect     of     police       intervention,

concluded:

               What is also something new to . a
               historian is the notion that we
               should be instructed as to what
               value we are to put on freedom and
               democracy, and be instructed by the
               police. And that the police are to
               be seen as, somehow, for themselves,
               rather than servants to us, so that
               we are to be instructed by the


                                             91
              oolice ci3 to         what is     to    00    our
              place. [22]


Senior    officers         reject    the    idea     that    they       enjoy     ouch

influence,       arguing      that their actions and              judgements       are

guided    by the communities they serve, that they 'police                          by

consent'.        The      issue, however, turns on           the      politics      of

interventionism.            If they intervene to shape, or m                    Mark s

terms     to mould, public opinion they do not                    simply       reflect

consent       but actually interpret and construct that                       consent.

In    turn this provides the potential for the police to                          free

themselves       from      democratic      controls        and    the    structural

arrangements which govern political accountability.



The     use    of police information by              journalists         is     closely

controlled in two important ways.                  Journalists who regularly

doubt     or    question       the police are likely             to     find     future

access        restricted or subsequently encounter problems                       [23].

As one observer has commented, most journalists.

                      are forced to develop    an
               uncritical attitude towards police
               information and provide a cursory
               balance with accounts from other
               sources. [24]
 Second, the information given to journalists is selected and

 prioritised         by    the police from a range of              potential       news

 stories.       Usually it is presented via police press                       releases

 ina style and tone similar to press reports. Consequently

 it      hasbecome common practice for journalists simply to                         re­

 arrange        or        paraphrase    press-releases            without         adding

 substantial         material       from other sources.            The        successful


                                           92
management           of     information   by the police has               led     to        the

conclusion that "crime nev/s is really police news” [25..



Recent     work on the relationship between the police and                                  the

news media has substantiated the claim that news                            production

processes            involve,     "a   systematically          structured              Q.var-

a n m as i ng       to the media of those in powerful and                   privileged

institutional             positions" [26].      Conversely, this                work     has

also     established           that the relationship           is    exclusive              and

imposes         a    serious      inhibition    on     access       for     those        not

considered           as 'media insiders'.           Content     analysis          studies

have     revealed           how   selectivity cannot be             explained          as     a

result      of shortage of time in news production, but                           happens

regularly in a high proportion of the coverage studied [27].

In     terms        of who is selected for interviews,                 it       has     been

coneluded that:


                Access to the news is given mainly
                to the powerful.  The view of social
                and political life that informs news
                production limits who is able to
                appear to put his or her case.    It
                is a view of the world from the top
                downwards, in which those at the top
                do most of the talking. [28]


This     raises the question of the origin of the                         determinants

within      news          production which prioritise            the      news        values

outlined above.              The answer lies primarily in the                   ownership

 and    control of the news media and the influence                         of        multi­

 national           media    corporations      on     the     style,      content           and

 selection of news.

                                                                                                  I
The   commercial         interests of media corporations               have     been

recognised        and    researched with regard to their               effect     on

output,     particularly         the    'informal      boundaries'       to     news

content which are laid down by constituent companies and the

impact      of     the demands of advertising               [29].    Concern     nas

focused      on     the increasing concentration              of ownership        of

newspaper        and    broadcast media companies in                Britain    [30].

The     current climate of newspaper journalism is dictated                       by

major shifts towards tabloid newspaper style which has                          been

described         as     "junk   journalism”        [31].      Journalist        Tom

Baistow's        substantial analysis of the            developments          within

Fleet Street during the 1980s is a searing indictment of the

impact     of     the concentration of 90% of               the     British    press

under the overall control of five men [32].                       He argues:


            The   metamorphosis of    relatively
            healthy popular journalism into the
            junk food of the mass mind market
            has deep roots deriving as much from
            personal power complexes as      the
            fragile economics of the underpriced
            newspaper. [33]


 Other    research        demonstrates how          proprietors       increasingly

 have influenced the output of their newspapers in order to,

 "use     newspapers       not    simply      for    money    making, but        for

 power" [34].           Journalists and editors testify to               increasing

 direct involvement in the production of news copy by                          Rupert

 Murdoch,        Robert Maxwell and David English, the three                    major

 newspaper        proprietors.         This involvement           includes     direct



                                         94
interference          in the direction and focus of journalists                               and

the    intimidation             of     employees        who      disagree        with     their

priorities [35]. A further concern relates to the impact                                        of

concentrated          ownership, with                its     emphasio       on    sales       ano

profits, on ethical standards within journalism.                                   In a       ra^e

governed        by    market           forces     tabloid        style      has     become       a

metaphor        for       sensationalised half-truths                    and      fabrication

[36].      It        is     accepted       that       British         journalism        has     an

established:

                    traditional preference      for
            reporting    'action'  stories, overt
            events,    however    fleeting    their
            import, if any, as distinct from the
            much harder task of digging into the
            background of situations for their
            implications, investigating what may
            be      carefully     concealed      or
            camouflaged     developments and     by
            revealing what is going on behind
            the scenes, who is doing what and
            why,    make    them   real    news
            significant information. [37]


However,        since           the     ignoble      rise      of     the   two     newspaper

 'giants',           Rupert           Murdoch     and      Robert      Maxwell,         tabloid

journalism has reduced the news process to the gutter                                       l 38].

The     expansion           of the Murdoch and                Maxwell       media    empires,

which extend much further than newspaper ownership, has been

documented extensively [39].                       It has resulted in a distorted

 consolidation             of     the     notion of           'competition'         which      has

 produced        a        "knee-jerk reflex"               within     tabloid       production

 which     responds less and less to "the actual                               occurrence        of

 any     real        events" and more and more                   to    competitors            [40].

 Described           as     a    "neurotic        and       incestuous         rivalry ,        the


                                                95
content     of    tabloids increasingly centres on             "spoiling"       a

competitor's        'exclusive'    story,    "lifting"    and     re-writing

front-page       features,     and pressurising journalists            not     to

"miss"     a competitor's angle [41].         This "warped concept             of

competition"       has    become deeply ingrained         in    the    tabloid

market     and    has    had   a major impact     on     the    content       and

journalistic        practice    of tabloids [42].        Tabloids      use     an

exaggerated layout geared to bold sensationalist                  headlines,

dramatic         pictures,     colour   enhancement      and     'attention-

grabbing' front pages.           As a journalist commented:


            It is a format which demands a
            degree    of    over-simplification,
            perfectly     suited     to       the
            dramatisation of the trivial and the
            sordid into the sensational. [43]


The tabloid has become shorter in length               using a        mini-text

formula" and, on average, it employs approximately half                       the

number     of specialist reporters than a          quality        newspaper.

The      'qualities' of a successful tabloid journalist are                    the

 "ability to dig out the dirt, in as much detail as possible"

 [44].     The repercussions of this on journalists              conduct        is

 reflected in the massive increase in complaints to the Press

 H mmr.n    (the newspaper industry's watch-dog), the                  scandal

 of   'cheque-book' journalism in 1983 [45], a rise                   in     libel

 cases against individual newspapers and the range and number

 of cases featured on the Channel Four programme, Hard                       Nevts,

 of   abuses of press power.            The Press Council,       in its       1986

 Annual Report, directed severe criticism at those newspapers



                                        96
which     habitually ignored the adjudications of                       the       Council

and persisted in belittling its function [46].                          The constant

ridicule directed towards the function of the Press                               Council

by the newspaper industry has prompted concerned individuals

and     bodies     to campaign for 'Right to               Reply        legislation.

Such     legislation          would impose regulation of the                    press     by

statute         consistent        with    the     existing           regulation           of

broadcasting,         about      to be strengthened          under          a     proposed

Broadcasting          Bill [47].       The Government's response                   to    the

mounting criticism of the standards of newspaper                                journalism

has      been    to set up an inquiry, chaired                  by     David       Calcutt

Q.C.,        scheduled to report by April 1990.                  The     Inquiry         has

been criticised for its narrow remit, its inability to                                   seek

views from the general public and its lack of accountability

 [48].       The newspaper proprietors and the Press Council                             have

drafted their proposals for reform, demonstrating their lack

 of     faith in the official inquiry.              Until it           is       recognised

 that     the virtually unrestrained concentration of                            ownership

 has     had    major       repercussions on       the      content,            focus     and

 approach        of     the    newspaper        industry     this           search        for

 'remedies' to cure the ills of newspaper coverage is                                likely

 to     be     frustrated.       Codes of        conduct,       ombudspersons             and

 regulatory mechanisms which have no powers are no match                                  for

 the economic strength and political influence of the                                multi­

 national        business       corporations.       Yet this is             the     broader

 climate of news production within which the news coverage of

 the         Hillsborough       Disaster    has     to     be        appraised.             In

 considering          the     style,     content and       presentation             of     the
management         and powerful defineis cannot be ignored.




Tragedy as News: Reporting Disasters


              It is a fact that disaster is news
              and in a free society the media have
              a duty to report such major events.
              ... However if freedom is not to be
              abused,  it must be accompanied by
              responsibility. [49]


The     cluster      of disasters which has         occurred     over      recent

years resulting in substantial loss of life has brought into

question       the responsibility of the media in              reporting             and

presenting         'disaster    news'.     The production      of      'disaster

news'     is distinctive on several levels.             At the site             of     a

disaster       the    media    arrive     usually    after     the     emergency

services (i.e. fire brigade, police, ambulance service etc.)

and     journalists and photographers become regulated                     by        the

emergency       disaster       plan in operation.      For     their       initial

information (i.e. survivors> fatalities, injuries etc.) they

rely     on    a     combination of official        statements       and        press

conferences           given    by    police,   emergency       services              and

officials from other organisations concerned.                    As the police

usually adopt a primary role in co-ordinating the                      emergency

services, as well as establishing the central communications

system, they take responsibility for liaison with the media.

Special       arrangements          regularly are made available           to        the

media     (e.g.       telephone       access) to    facilitate       the    smooth
running     of    news production.                 This requirement       has      become

widely recognised by           t h o s e    concerned with drafting          e m e r g e n c y


plans and facilities for the media are seen as an                            important

element in arrangements at a disaster [50].




In the immediate response to a disaster it is to be expected

that     journalists      will             "get things    wrong .         Despite        the

arrangements made for the media at a disaster site confusion

will     be inevitable.          Media personnel are denied the                    normal

'structure'       within       which news is             gathered     and    produced.

Photographs       are     taken, events filmed and                  statements         made

which,      on   reflection, are               inappropriate        and     potentially

distressing.            Consequently               the    direct      and         overall

responsibility          lies     with editors and producers                  to    decide

what is tastefully appropriate and necessary material in the

compilation       and presentation of news reports.                       The     process

of     selection and presentation of material                       and     information

therefore takes on crucial significance.



It     is   clear from accounts of previous disasters                           that      the

media does not always achieve a balance of                          responsibilities

necessary        in the sensitive production of                    'disaster        news'.

The role of 'responsible' media coverage has been                               described

 as:

                    not hindering the rescue and
             relief       operation,      thereby
             jeopardising life and increasing the
             suffering of survivors.     It also
             means not exploiting the survivors

Serious         problems              have           arisen            for            emergency                 workers,

survivors        and bereaved families.                                 Reporters                    have       harassed

people     for      statements and for information                                                  and       have     used

deceitful tactics to achieve a 'different slant' on a                                                                story

[52].     It would appear from the regularity of these                                                           tactics

that     journalists and photographers are not acting                                                           just     on

their     own       initiative, but are                               actively                pursuing           certain

news managers and their organisations.



Apart     from          repercussions                     at          the     site            of      a        disaster,

sensationalist and distressing news coverage has a long-term

impact     on the bereaved and injured.                                        Dr Douglas                     Duckworth,

commented:


             Relatives I have counselled in the
             past have been utterly traumatised
             at the possibility of even touching
             a newspaper which they suspect may
             contain a    picture of theirloved
             ones   or    of   turning  on    the

commented on the impact of news coverage and their anger                                                                 at

concern     that         the      media,      its     journalists             and         its

editors/producers, require restraint and sensitive judgement

in the production and presentation of 'disaster news'.



Hillsborough was a unique situation in which media personnel

witnessed     first-hand          the unfolding of events that                    led      to

serious     loss    of        life and     injury      [55].          This    proximity

created inherent problems in the subsequent coverage of                                   the

Disaster.      At Hillsborough reporters were transformed                               into

commentators        on a national disaster.                There was no time               or

opportunity        for    preparation         or direction            and    it     was     a

situation which demanded a high level of self-regulation and

personal judgement.            While some reporters and                 photographers

became    personally involved in the rescue                      others       continued

with their job, taking photographs of the tragedy                             unfolding

before    them      or    attempting        to      make    sense       of    what        was

happening for television and radio reports.



The coverage of the Hillsborough Disaster was a real test of

journalistic standards, especially given recent claims                                  from

within     the newspaper and broadcasting industries that                               they

can   achieve       good, consistent standards by the                        process       of

self-regulation           [56].      However, the          Hillsborough           Disaster

produced     some        of    the    worst      examples        of    excessive          and

intrusive journalistic practice currently adopted within the

newspaper     industry.              The   behaviour        of    journalists             and

photographers at the scene of the Disaster and                              subsequently

how   news           reports       came to be compiled and        what    were            the

origins of the primary information used.                     While the issue of

intrusive            behaviour by journalists is discussed more                         fully

in    a    later        section, it is important here             to     assess           the

significance            of     the    sources of information           used        in     the

context          of      reporting        a   disaster.       There           is         also

consideration            of     the    implications    of    patterns         of        news

production in relation to events at Hillsborough.


                This should have been a showpiece.
                This should have been a classic. ...
                At the moment it is simple mayhem.


These words, spoken by Peter Jones for BBC Radio's Sport— on

Two, constituted the first public statement concerning                                   what

was       to    become the Hillsborough Disaster [57].                    The           match

coverage on radio and the newsflashes broadcast live on                                   BBC

1's flrandstand provided instant coverage of Britain's                                  worst

sporting         tragedy.          As the minutes ticked by        after           initial

reports sports journalists desperately struggled to come                                   to

terms with            what they were witnessing at the ground.                      Dozens

of    photographers and journalists, commissioned to report                                 a

highpoint of the football season were on the pitch                             covering

instead a scene of devastation, injury and horrific                                deaths.

Their          stories       and     photographs formed     the      basis         of     the

 initial international press and television coverage.



Given          the    chaos and confusion at          Hillsborough        no        police

 press         conference was held until the              evening.       Journalists
sought     their information, first hand, by taking                            statements

from     officials,         notably representatives               of     the     Football

Association, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the clubs

involved,     and       also      by attempting to gain                access       to     the

gymnasium,        the       hospitals     and     the     Medico-Legal              Centre.




Additionally,           comments     were        sought    from         eye-witnesses,

particularly            any    doctors      or    nurses     who       had       assisted

voluntarily        with the rescue operation.                This        reflects          the

'hierarchy        of     access'     adhered to by          the        news     media       in

prioritising           their sources of           information.           Eye-witnesses

who were Liverpool supporters were asked to comment, but the

questions     asked           and space given to their             accounts          varied

according     to        the original location of the                   news     gatherers

(i.e. local, national, Merseyside).                       A further basic            source

of     information was the journalists who had been present                                 at

the match, but similarly their accounts varied according                                     to

their      status           and   experience        as      national           or         local

journalists.



The     use of and access to information from sources                               did     not

alter     substantially           on subsequent           days.        What     developed

within      the    news        media was a        division        of    coverage           into

distinct      categories,          which focused           primarily          around        the

geographic          localities       of     'Sheffield',           'Liverpool'              and

 'London'.        Coverage at Sheffield on the day of the                           Disaster

concentrated           on     events at the ground, the                hospitals,           the
Medico-Legal         Centre and on press conferences                      organised       by

the South Yorkshire Police.                  On subsequent days the focus of

attention      was      the     opening        of   the    Taylor         Inquiry,       the

adjourning        of     the     inquests, -visits-        to    the       Hillsborough

ground      by     politicians,             football      'experts'        and         safety

inspectors, and visits to the Sheffield hospitals by members

of   the Royal Family, politicians, senior clergy                             and       other

dignitaries            which         included       interviews         with         injured

survivors.



Coverage in Liverpool initially concentrated on the response

of   social       services           and details       about    the       bereaved        and

injured.         Later       coverage developed these themes                     but     also

included       the      memorial        tribute at        Anfield,        the     response

locally from politicians and 'football people'                            (players        and

managers),        the        setting     up of the Disaster            Fund       and     the

funerals       as they took place during the week.                        The     'London'

coverage focused on the                 political response            to the Disaster

and the implications nationally and internationally for 'the

game'     of     football.            The    repercussions       on       the     football

 industry were evaluated by 'experts' from sport and politics

who gave interviews on the 'crisis' facing English soccer in

 terms of 'hooliganism' and its future in Europe.



 Within     two        days the process of             categorisation            was    well-

 established           and     the    hierarchy of access            to     official        or

 'expert'        sources was also evident.                A BBC Radio— 4               evening

from         Sheffield            which included an interview with                                the     Home

Secretary,              Mr    Douglas         Hurd;        the         West     Midlands                Police

response of social services; a summary of possible causes by

sports            commentator         Frank Partridge which                         included            quotes

from Rogan Taylor (F.S.A.) and John Williams (University                                                       of

Leicester) on the need for new stadiums; the requiem mass at

Archbishop of Liverpool's address.                                     Most evident in this one

 example           of    many,       is       the     effective            marginalisation                     of

 commentators                on    the Disaster who were                      not      identified              as

 'official'              spokespersons or 'experts'.                          The priorities                 for

 sources            of       information            were      politicians,               the         police,

 football organisations and academics with survivors                                                 usually

 relegated              to describing their injuries,                          their          experiences

 and sorrow.



 A      further          dimension in the process                        of    categorisation                   is

 well-illustrated                    by       considering               the    coverage             in        the

  Guardian. D^ilv Telegraph and Independent newspapers on                                                     the


                                                     105
Tuesday       after        the Disaster.      The lead story on              all     three

front pages concerned the announcement by the Home Secretary

to    set     up     a     departmental      inquiry        while     restating          the

Government's             commitment to the controversial               I.D.        scheme.

The      Tindependent's          headline     was     "Hurd         plans      all-seat

stadiums",          the Daily Telegraph announced "All seat                        grounds

for big matches sought by Hurd" and the Guardian                            proclaimed

"Anger       as     Hurd pushes ID bill"            [59].      More     significant,

however,           was     the balance of content on the               inside        pages

concerning          Hillsborough.         The Daily         Telegraph        ran     eight

reports specifically on football matters, four on                             survivors

and the bereaved, one on the police and one on Lord                                Justice

Taylor.           The     Independent     ran seven         reports     on     football

matters, four on survivors and the bereaved and three on the

police.           The Guardian ran ten reports on football                     matters,

three        on survivors and the bereaved, two on the police                            and

one     on     Lord Justice Taylor.           It is     instructive           that       the

reports on survivors and the bereaved focused on the                                 human

interest'          potential      of their grief, rather than                 on     their

accounts of the Disaster and why it had happened.                             Only       the

Independent             gave an account of the anger of three                  families

at    how      they had been treated, and this amounted                       to     eight

column inches only.              The reports on the actions of the South

Yorkshire          Police       gave police statements          greater        emphasis

than     comments          by    other    interested        parties.         The        Rally

Tel fsgraph        gave     extensive and sympathetic coverage                     to     the

police version of events.



                                            106
What     the above examples illustrate is how,                        overall,           those

deemed     'officials'              or 'experts' were provided               with        ample

space     by        the     media to pass comment         and     opinion           on     the

Disaster            while       survivors,    the   bereaved           and        football

supporters were quoted in terms of their capacity to provide

'human interest'.               The greater emphasis on           football-related

issues     illustrates the 'London' category of                        newsgathering,

while     'Sheffield' featured through the police                        reports           and

hospital        coverage.            'Liverpool'    was       represented           in     the

reports        of     people's grief,         through      survivors'          accounts,

quotes     from           the    social services,       and     the     City        Council

Leader, Keva Coombes.



The above comparison also illustrates the                        'standardisation'

of     coverage           between different newspapers.                This       had      the

effect         of        creating     a   unified   version       of     events            and

priorities           which was not shared by many of the                     people        and

agencies        directly involved with the                Disaster.           Subsequent

events have demonstrated clearly that there was considerable

diversity           of     opinion yet this was not represented                     in     the

coverage.            Because        newsgathering focuses around                  the     same

individuals and organisations, who are reported in the                                    same

way, who provide the same quotes in different newspapers and

also on television and radio, a common picture of events                                    is

drawn     which           eliminates diversity and replaces                  it     with     a

false     universality or media consensus.                     While this           example

reflects        coverage in three of the             heavier-weight                national
newspapers        on just   o n e   day, it is a good representation                 o f


the     dominant     direction        and   trend    within        the     'serious'

coverage.        Through the structuring of news production around

geographical        location,        official versions        of     events,        and

'legitimate'        experts a standardised, universal                    version     of

the     main     issues concerning the Hillsborough                 Disaster       was

created.



Within     the     context of categorisation            the    production           and

presentation of news developed around specific news                          themes.

The     most prominent theme concerned the search for the                          main

cause     or     causes of the Disaster.            Much of    this        coverage,

however,       did not set out to broaden the discussion                     of     the

possible reasons, but rather attempted to lay blame by using

crude commentary and inflammatory language.                    The targets for

this     moved during the first week from the failures                       of     the

police, to the behaviour of the fans, with the                       contribution

of perimeter fences also being prominently featured.                              Other

issues     raised were the failures of the emergency                       services,

ground safety and the responsibility of football clubs,                             the

Football Association and the Football League.



The sources of information used within the news reports were

overwhelmingly 'officials' or               experts .     The amount of time

and space afforded to individuals or spokespersons                          favoured

the police, politicians and football 'experts', with medical

professionals,        survivors and the bereaved              given        secondary
emphasis.        In many cases survivors and the bereaved families

were     quoted giving information about their injuries or                         the

impact of the Disaster on their lives.                    They were identified

as     sources      of      'human interest'       information         rather     than

people with informed opinions on the cause of the Disaster.



The     'human interest' theme formed the other major                       approach

for     news     stories.         The   numbers      of       injured,     personal

experiences         of the Disaster, and the memorial                  services     in

Liverpool        featured       prominently.       The way such          information

was    presented differed between local and national                        reports,

the     latter      presenting information in             a    voyeuristic        way.

Individual          grief    and suffering was presented in                the    news

media as simply another element of 'the story'.                          It was this

form     of    approach       which     produced     intrusive         journalistic

behaviour,          discussed     later, and which            caused     substantial

trauma adding distress to the suffering of those bereaved by

the Disaster.            Hillsborough was turned into a 'media event',

which for some journalists was clearly 'just another story'.

The reporting of the events which preceded and followed                            the

Disaster were reconstructed into a media version of tragedy,

as     will    be     developed through a content               analysis     in    the

following section.
'What the Papers Said': Reporting Hillsborough

'Blaming the Fans'

On    the Wednesday following the Disaster Ths                           Sun     published

the     most        controversial            coverage       of     the         events      at

Hillsborough.         Its front page was presented to shock:


            The Truth; some fans picked pockets
            of victims; some fans urinated on
            the brave cops; some fans beat up PC
            giving kiss of life. [60]


The     headlines          and   the        main    article        created         outrage

throughout      Merseyside.            The Sun's rival tabloid, the                     Daily
Star.    ran    the        same story and as            a    result       the     'boycott

campaign'      was launched against the two offending                            tabloids,

successfully         producing          a    massive slump in            sales     in     the

Merseyside region [61].                 It is important to note that                    while

these newspapers presented particularly offensive                                articles,

the     sentiments         of    both       can be    found      elsewhere         in     the

coverage       of     the disaster.           The suggestion          that       Liverpool

supporters          were    entirely         to blame for the            deaths     of     95

people     at the Leppings Lane end, or at best                          culpable,        was

not     confined       to the excesses of             tabloid       journalism.            An

analysis       of the immediate coverage of the Disaster                           reveais

several     problematic           areas.        By the time the           Sim     ran     its

inflammatory           headline             there    had    been    three        days      of

reporting       the        Disaster, news coverage               which     carried        the

underlying message of 'blaming' Liverpool fans.



The earliest news reports to take this theme were                                on the day
the Disaster, when initially it was suggested that Liverpool

supporters forced their way into the stadium through a gate.

At   3.40pm BBC Radio T w o 's sports coverage presented a report

which      suggested    the primary cause of the     problem      at    the

ground.      Although recognising’that there        was   overcrowding

and crushing, causing what were thought to be injuries, Alan

Green at the ground stated that there were:


                  unconfirmed   reports that a
            door was broken down at the end that
            was holding Liverpool supporters.
            [62]


By 4.15pm deaths were reported but no numbers were confirmed

and Alan Green interviewed Graham Kelly, the Chief Executive

of   the     Football Association, and asked if gates          had     been

opened      or broken down.     Mr Kelly responded that the          police

had not given the impression that they had ordered the gates

to   be opened.        A short while after this,    at    approximately

4.30pm, Alan Green gave a crucial report.           He stated that on

information obtained from Graham Mackrell, the Secretary                 of

Sheffield      Wednesday     F.C., who had spoken    to    "the      police

officer in charge", events were as follows:


             ... at ten to three there was a
             surge of fans at the Leppings Lane
             end of the ground    ... the surge
             composed of about 500 Liverpool fans
             and the police say that a gate was
             forced and that led to a crush in
             the terracing area - well under
             capacity I'm told, there was still
             plenty of room inside that area
             [63]




                                   111
His report stated clearly that the "police say" fans                            forced

a    gate,        and     yet      this     gave the     first      indication       that

Liverpool's             supporters     were       to blame   for     the     Disaster.

Later     in       the bulletin it was            stated that       the    gates     were

"broken        down" and          that "large numbers of            ticketless fans"

had arrived at the                ground.       By 6pm BBC Radio 4 News stated:


               Many reports speak of people without
               tickets having pushed their way in.
               [64]


The two suggestions regarding Liverpool supporters'                            actions

combined          to     give the basis to an early construction                   of     a

'conspiracy'.             This was that Liverpool fans, aggrieved at an

unfair ticket allocation had arrived in substantial                            numbers

to    cause aggravation outside the ground and had forced                               the

police         to       let     them   in   -     with    tragic      consequences.

Variations on this theme appeared in a number of                            subsequent

news reports.             Reports on the evening of the Disaster varied

in      emphasis          concerning        the    'conspiracy       theory .           The

following account was typical:


               It's clear that many hundreds of
               Liverpool    fans    travelled    to
               Hillsborough even though they didn t
               have tickets for the game.   Shortly
               before the match started it appears
               that these fans were able to get in
               into the ground through a gate at
               the Leppings Lane end. One report
               says   the gate was kicked      down
               another that it was opened by ground
               staff. [65]


Later        in     the       bulletin it was stated         that         thousands      Oi

unauthorised              Liverpool       fans     had forced       entry     into      th€-
ground.       The        origin    of this claim           concerning          numbers       of

ticket less fans was never acknowledged.                          It is possible that

it     came       from     statements made by Grs.ham              Kelly,       who        uhat

afternoon         commented        on   EEC     Radio— Merseyside,              that        the

overcrowding was due to                 people coming in at one end of                     the

ground        who were unauthorised" [66].                  The    repercussions             of

this     initial reporting was apparent the following day,                                 but

the above sequence is a good illustration of media                                  reliance

on      'official'             statements.          On     this      occasion           Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield had lied about the opening of the

gates        to    Graham Kelly and Graham Mackrell                     at     an    initial

briefing          in     the    police control           box,     minutes       after       the

Disaster had occurred [67]. The suggestion that the Leppings

Lane     end       was     under capacity also came                from      the     police.

These        misrepresentations           implied that it was for                   fans     to

take     responsibility            for their distribution                 between       pens.

Such      information was given directly to the broadcast                               media

as the first explanations of the crush and the events                                   wh^.ch

preceded           it     were    therefore         constructed           around        this.

 'Official'            explanations took precedence                over      explanations

from eyewitness whose accounts were given                           secondary status.

Although in much of the news coverage it was emphasised that

 'hooliganism'            was     not   to    blame       for     the     Disaster,         the

behaviour of Liverpool supporters was raised continually                                     as

a key contributory factor in many of the first news reports.



 It     is     instructive         to compare the coverage                by    the      local



                                              113
Liverpool radio stations which                 covered the match, with                the

coverage     by national news bulletins.                iiadlQ— v 1 w.

reports,     by Bill Arthur at the ground, emphasised                          that     it

was not    "crowd trouble' but              crushing    that was the             problem

[68].     Liam O'Donahue, who attended the match as a spectator

and     suddenly found himself reporting on the tragic                           scenes,

interviewed at length a Liverpool supporter who detailed the

bad organisation at the turnstiles and stated thalfc the                              gate

had been opened by the police.                  0 Donahue, clearly emotional

and     under strain , gave a personal account of events as                             an

eye-witness          and    commented that "how this could_ have                      been

allowed     to happen is just beyond belief" [69].                         His    report

clearly     questioned             the responsibility         of     the      organising

authorities.               Radio     City   dropped     its        commercials         and

provided        a    public information service based                    on    telephone

links.      A       special        studio was 3et up         at     Hillsborough        to

facilitate          gathering        information.      The        5pm    special      news

bulletin        on Radio Citv confirmed 84 deaths and 200                        injured

and noted that it had been due to a police decision, and not

crowd violence, that the gates were opened.                             Interviews with

 supporters           and      comments        from     other             eye-witnesses

 particularly Rogan Taylor, produced an immediate account                               of

 events    which       were to concur with the               conclusions          reached

 subsequently by the official inquiry.

station broadcast a special programme which included                                    phone-

ins    from survivors described as "shocked, stunned and                                  also

angry"        [71].           A     reporter,     Sian      Williams,         interviewed

supporters         about           the attitude of police         officers           on    '-he

pitch.        It    was alleged repeatedly that some                     officers          had

been     unhelpful,               had   ignored       the   injured     and     responded

aggressively             towards          Liverpool         supporters        generally.

Throughout this local Merseyside news coverage the                                  opinions

and    views       of     Liverpool supporters               regarding        the       events

leading       up to the Disaster were treated seriously and                               with

concern.       By comparison, from the earliest coverage                             through

to the late evening, the national bulletins concentrated                                     on

offi ni al      statements              and   'expert'       conjecture        about        the

causes.



On     the     evening            of the Disaster the police            held        a     press

conference at which the Chief Constable of South                               Yorkshire,

Peter        Wright,      issued a statement which accepted                     that        the

gate outside the ground at the Leppings Lane turnstiles                                     was

opened on the instruction of a police officer.                            Although this

was      reported extensively throughout the media,                            subsequent

news reports continued to state that                         hooligan     behaviour by

Liverpool          fans at the Leppings Lane end contributed to                             the

disaster.          This assertion was derived from information                             also

 'revealed'         by    Chief Constable Peter Wright                  at     the        press

conference.              In       answer to a question         concerning           how     the



                                                115
crush       had occurred outside the turnstiles he                         replied:       "By

the     late arrival of large numbers of people" [72].                                 During

the     evening              radio    bulletins           reported        this       comment

uncritically             describing          the   central        issue        as      being:

"problems          outside the ground" -[73] or that between,                          'three

and four thousand Liverpool fans turned up just five minutes

before kick-off" [74]. These comments were in sharp contrast

to    the     explanations put forward earlier                       by    eye-witnesses

which        had     centred         on   the      lack     of     organisation           and

'filtering' of people at the Leppings Lane end [75].



What Peter Wright's comment achieved was to consolidate                                   the

construction            of 'blaming the fans'.               It was a       more       subtle

variation on the themes that had been adopted earlier and it

deflected attention away from what eventually were to be the

central       issues          of     crowd    safety       and    crowd        management.

Despite all indications to the contrary 'hooligan                                   hysteria

persisted to dominate the coverage and the agenda was set to

turn     Hillsborough into a public order issue.                             The       'broken

down'       gate        theory effectively was replaced                   by     the     idea,

which       has     remained prevalent,              that        Liverpool       supporters

 'forced'         the        police into opening the              gate.        The     central

elements          of this scenario were: the fans were late,                            either

maliciously             or     because they continued drinking in                      pubs     a

distance          from the ground; ticketless fans in large                            numbers

caused       the over-crowding outside the turnstiles; fans                               were

disruptive              and     uncontrollable,           either     deliberately             or

 through heavy drinking.
The       following day's press and broadcast           reports     persisted

with       the 'hooliganism ' scenario.          The Sunday— Mirror          was

emphatic         in    its description that      "Liverpool    fans    pushed

seemingly uncontrolled into Hillsborough                and that       3etween

3     and 4,000 Liverpool fans had been trying to              force        their

way        through        the   turnstiles".     The       newspaper          was

unequivocal            in its judgement that "the gate was          opened     to

stampeding Liverpool fans" [76].               Similarly BBC T.V. News— &i

One reported that the gate was opened "to relieve a                    massive

build       up    of Liverpool fans shortly before         kick      off"     and

continued         by     commenting that this was common       practice        by

police           "when there's a risk     of    serious trouble       outside"

[77].       The implication was that it was            serious trouble        and

not inadequate facilities and crowd management that was                       the

main       problem        at the turnstiles. BBC Radio      too     made     such

allusions          when     it described "the wait of      impatient        fans

outside          the    ground [78].   The Observer,      in   an    otherwise

balanced report of the Disaster, commented.

                 in truth, no one should have been
                 surprised    when    thousands    of
                 indignant      and       potentially
                 disruptive,  Liverpool fans arrived
                 yesterday, hopefully to cheer their
                 team on ... - [79]

    The    observer also reported uncritically Wright s               statement

    that the "late arrival of 3 to 4,000 fans outside the ground

    had threatened danger to life" [80].
The    TTN    9pm bulletin, in an account of              events,      took     fox-

granted the issue of "late arrivals" and described how "fans

ran    to the tunnel" [81].           Similarly a Newsniaht Special              on

BBC 2, in a reconstruction of events "based on what evidence

we    have", suggested that there was a "massive                 snarl-up"       at

Leppings Lane and           "Liverpool fans are late and impatient               to

catch the 3 o'clock kick-off" [82].              The commentary at             this

point made no mention of the lack of crowd organisation                         and

it was left to an           eye-witness, much later in the report,               to

comment      on     the     police    role and criticise         the     lack    of

filtering         and     organisation of queues.     In     a   diagrammatic

explanation Newsniaht stated:


             ... by 2.58 the crush      outside the
             turnstiles is suddenly translated by
             the opening of the gates into a
             swirl of impatient fans inside the
             stadium and the natural place       for
             them to push forward to see the game
             is through    the tunnel   ... to the
             popular   central     section.     [83:
             emphasis added]


This    quote          illustrates    the presumptions      made       about    the

behaviour         of       Liverpool supporters, which,       it isimplied,

contributed to             the crush in the centre pens.



 Significantly             the basis for the above reports was            further

 information gleaned from             the police press conference and the

 Snndav      Mirror , in particular, made this clear                [84].       The

 effect      was to shift the focus of attention from the                   police

 operation        and      its   consequences   to   an    emphasis       on     the

 behaviour        of      the fans.   These early comments made           by     the
police     and     reported throughout the news                     media,        laid     the

foundation        for     subsequent        news coverage            to     develop        the

'hooliganism' theme and, eventually, to make unsubstantiated

excessive        allegations.            In terms of         'newsworthiness'              the

'hooliganism'           theme    was      a gift not only            because        it     had

become the central issue in news coverage of 'the game'                                    but

also     because        these    were Liverpool             fans     and     the        Heysel

Disaster     had        been    of their making.


A further dimension of              the     'hooliganism'            theme        was      the

persisterit emphasis on a 'surge' or 'rush' of fans into                                   the

ground.          Early         television        reports           on       the         Sunday

interviewed        Joe     Ashton,        M.P., who         suggested        that        after

entering        fans     "all ran to the entrance                  behind     the        goal"

[35].      The     same reports gave details on                     the    sequence         of

events    leading up to the crush in pens 3 and 4, and several

described how the crowd of fans "surged forwards" [86].                                    The

Observer        also     picked     up     on        this   dimension        and        quoted

Graham     Mackrell,           Secretary        of     Sheffield        Wednesday,          as

saying:


            The disaster was caused by a surge.
            Forest supporters were in the ground
            early.  Liverpool's were not. [87]


Again     the     origin of this dimension was                     the     police        press

conference        held by Chief Constable Peter Wright,                           early     on

Sunday 16th April.              He was quoted as saying:


            There    will  be                inquiries    to
            establish exactly               what   happened.


                                           119
             But at this stage I must emphasise
             that I have no information that
             gives a direct connection between
             the surge in the ground and the
             incident  outside.  [88:  emphasis
             added]



Subsequent         news         reports         of-    the     Disaster          took           this

description        from        the       Chief Constable            and    translated              it

uncritically into the evaluation of the cause.                                  The       alleged

connection       between the behaviour of Liverpool fans and                                     the

"fatal       surge",      as        it    was     later       termed,      was        a     common

construction          throughout              the media reports.               These        early,

more     tenuous       statements, however, laid the basis                                for    the

much stronger language used by the national newspapers                                          when

they hit the streets on the Monday, 17th April.



In     the    scramble         to        find    the    cause       of     the        disaster,

although       allegations               of     mistakes       made       by     police         were

reported,       the newspaper coverage formulated reasons,                                      based

on original police information, why Liverpool supporters had

arrived       late.       The local Yorkshire papers were two of                                  the

most     vociferous. The Sheffield Star used the caption                                        "Race

to     Stadium" on its front page, and described how there                                        was

"a crazed surge" of fans [89].                         The report continued:

              up to 40 people died in the tunnel,
              the rest trampled underfoot. [90]


Such     extreme       inaccuracies,               forty-eight           hours     after          the

disaster, could have only stemmed from a motivation to blame

Liverpool        supporters,              rather       than    to     establish            factual



                                                120
proof.    The Sheffield Star continued its report:


           many supporters were still propping
           up the bars in pubs more than A MILE
           from the ground at 2.30 p m .   They
           raced to stadium arriving at the
           Leppings Lane end at the height of
           the crush.   Some of them were the
           worst for drink,    others   without
           tickets were hoping to sneak in.
           [91]

Here     the elements of drunkenness and ticketless          fans     were

added to the already volatile picture which had been                drawn.

The Yorkshire; Post also condemned Liverpool supporters.               Its

description of events included the following comments:


            thousands     of    fans began the   fatal
            charge...
            thousands of latecomers tried to
            force their way into the ground...

            trampling crush.      [92]


The report     extensively quoted an anonymous           Sheffield    man

who "was at the match":
                 he said he was amazed by the
            number of Liverpool fans who went to
            the game without tickets   ... also
            amazed by the number who were openly
            drinking alcohol and said the drink
            contributed to an atmosphere      of
            friction. [93]


 Other    negative   reports which alleged misbehaviour          on     the

 part    of Liverpool supporters were carried in all styles

 newspapers,     from     the   tabloids   to the   qualities ,         rom

 local     to national.     The Manchester Evening Ne&s outlined             a

 "Timetable     of Terror" giving a minute-by-minute account             of



                                     121
events.        The     reports described how, at      2.55pm,     Liverpool




           ... foolishly late getting to the
           game and furious at the prospect of
           missing   the start,    kicked    and
           hammered on the steel gates. [94]


It continued to explain how the gate was opened "with 3 to 4

thousand pushing against" it, and then how:

           The Anfield Army charged on to the
           terrace behind the goal -      many
           without tickets. [95]


The Independent, in its editorial, entered the fray with it3

own brand of moral indignation:

           On Saturday, a mob of 1000'3 , many
           without tickets,   thought it   was
           alright to try to push into the
           ground   and the police    expected
           violence if they were not admitted.
           [96]

The    Daily     Mail        talked of "the    danger of     thousands    of

Liverpool fans pressing outside" which caused the police                  to

open     the    gate       and then, in a diagram,     it    described   how

"Fans,     many without tickets surge through ... drawn by               the

roar ... some fans trampled in tunnel" [97].



The    Evening Standard requires particular consideration                for

its    concise       but    erroneous assessment of what       caused    the

disaster:
               Many Liverpool fans          were believed
               to   have arrived late       after drinking
               in   nearby pubs until       2.30 pm.    As
               the   crush increased        the gate in
               question was starting          to bend on
               the inside. [98]


                                      122
In its editorial,          it continued the theme in its     description

of    f a n s '"impatience   to gain admission" and that "many of the

fans       swarming       outside the ground must have      been without

tickets”         [99].     The   Standard's   columnist,   Peter         McKay,

provided         the most complete account of the 'blame          of      fans

version         of causation [100].     Under the headline        "Why     fans

mu 3 t     share    the     blame",   McKay seemed to    relish     in      his

explanation:


                How       long will   it take for     it
                publicly to be acknowledged that
                fans themselves share the blame?
                         fans are the biggest danger to
                fans and we had better not lose
                sight of that. ... The rear door
                would       not have been opened      if
                keeping it closed had not posed the
                risk of death or serious injury
                among hysterically pushing         fans.
                This catastrophe was caused first
                and foremost by violent enthusiasm
                for soccer, in this case the Iribal
                p a s s ions  of Liverpool supporters.
                They literally killed themselvaa and
                others to be at the game.          [101:

In       case    the reader had not picked up      on    McKay's       central

theme, he restated it:


                       What is    important is   the
                mindless passion, rage and violence
                that soccer attracts.   This is what
                kills;   the rest is nuts and bolts.
                [95]


 If      McKay had doubts about the cause he did not convey                them

 and      two days after the Disaster he considered himself                able

 to make a sweeping assessment with, it appears, no direct or


                                       123
informed knowledge of events.                    The Press Council ruled                that

such     columnists had a right to "express their own                         opinion"

in     what they termed "comment pieces" [103].                     This      ignores,

however,       the      fundamental inaccuracies in             this        piece        and

others,        (e.g.        the     circumstances in     which       thegate        was

opened).       Also, it ignores the effect of such comment pieces

on     the    public's general awareness of 'the                    cause'        of     the

Disaster (as opposed to McKay's "nuts and bolts").                                Further

it     is    important to note that this article, as                       with        other

Evening       Standard            coverage, was written for          a     London-only

readership and few people who attended the match would                                  ever

read it.



The effect of this early reporting and its rush to judgement

was     compounded by those who passed opinion and                         comment        on

the         fans'      behaviour.          For    instance,      Sunday           morning

television coverage had Joe Ashton M.P. commenting that fans

"all        ran behind the goal to see the action" after                       entering

the ground [104].                 Even the interviews with Rogan Taylor, at

that        time    Chair of the Football            Supporters'           Association,

primarily           emphasised         "the      responsibility       of     supporters

themselves           - there were many people there without                       tickets

[105].         Although           Taylor   also mentioned       the        problems       of

ticket         allocation,           perimeter      fences    and     the     lack        of

 'filtering'           at    the Leppings Lane end, he              made     no     direct

criticism           of the police handling of the crowd                    outside        the

turnstiles           and     instead commented that           "we        shouldn t        be
hasty         in    apportioning        blame"      [106].         The

programme          Eve     Wi t,r.ess had. an interview with             Lord     Justice

Popplewell who would not be drawn on discussing the                               reasons

for     the        Disaster and yet still           commented that             there     had

been     4,000        ticketless        arrivals [107].         One      of     the     more

notorious responses came from                  Jacques Georges, President ot

UEFA,     who was reported widely in his outright                         condemnation

of Liverpool supporters:


               One can talk of people's frenzy to
               enter the stadium come what may,
               whatever the risk to the lives of
               others.  ... One had the impression
               that they were beasts waiting to
               charge into the arena.   It was not
               far from hooliganism. [108].


Although           Georges later apologised publicly                  for his         rushed

assessment           of    events, he was not alone in                the      sentiments

expressed.           His comments, although             partly     condemned bv une

television            news        reports,     undoubtedly            fuelled            and

consolidated the anti-Liverpool theme.



Of     particular          concern      is the way in which            the      theme     of

 'blaming the fans’ was so well-established in the                               quality

press     and        what are usually more              in-depth      broadcast         news

programmes.           As well as the examples cited above, a piece j.n

the     fluarnian          on its first day of reporting                 the     Disaster,

 illustrates             the   point.    The article, on           page        three,    was

headlined                Police     helpless       as    fans    died ,          and     the

 description stated:




                                             125
          While their colleagues outside the
          ground sought to contain a. situation
          in which other supporters who had
          arrived late were i.ike 1v— to— c^USS.
          Hisnrder,they unwittingly created an
          i n s o I u b le problem  for  officers
          inside the ground        [109: emphasis
          added]

This   understanding          and   appreciative      description        of   the

'problems'       faced   by     the police    was     constructed        on    the

assumption       that Liverpool supporters were at              fault.        ihis

was emphasised as the report continued:


                    thousands    of    Liverpool
            supporters were arriving at      the
            stadium minutes before kick-off  ...
            an   uncontainable   situation   was
            developing outside the ground. [110]


The    bias of the article'was compounded by the inclusion                      of

the following quote from an anonymous South Yorkshire Police

Federation spokesperson:


             'Many of them would not have had
             tickets, but they were demanding to
             get in. ... It must have looked as
             if   mayhem was going     to    start
             outside.    It was too      late   to
             postpone the kick-off because that
             could have caused disorder inside'.
             [Ill]


 By    Tuesday      18th April most news reports          accepted       without

 question     the    misinformation         already    conveyed     about       the

 behaviour of Liverpool             fans.   Again, of particular          concern

 were the comments in the 'serious' press.                The     Independent,

of   Hungerford, problems         were replicated           as     a     result           of

intrusive      journalism      after Hillsborough.              A year        on,        the

conclusions      reached      previously         by the     producers          of        the

Hungerford      film remain appropriate to Hillsborough and                              its

coverage:



            Everyone is curious about      other
            people's lives. Yet it is possible
            to meet that curiosity in ways that
            do no harm to those lives        but
            positively do them honour.   At any
            rate the attempt is worth making.

Thft Press Councj1 Inquiry


On   Monday      17th April 1989 the Press Council                     announced          it

would hold a general inquiry into the photographic                             coverage

of the Hillsborough Disaster following widespread criticism.

 Subsequently        the Council received a substantial                   number          of

 complaints      regarding      the        general   content       of      newspaper

 coverage      and    behaviour       of     press   personnel          and,        as         a

 consequence,        the    remit of the inquiry was              broadened.              By

 19th    May    there      were 349        written   complaints          from        3,651

 signatories         including        individual members of             the     public,

 M.P.s         representing       constituents            and      a     range             of

 organisations          including       the      Football       Association               and

 Liverpool       City      Council.        Some of    the       complainants             were



                                           203
bereaved or relatives and friends of those injured, but many

were not        affected so directly by the tragedy.               By 28th June

the     Press     Council had also received a          petition       of      7,000

signatories        from the Merseyside Area         Student        organisation

complaining specifically about The Sun article of 19th April

[342].      Itsinquiry into the press coverage               of    Hillsborough

was     completed     in     July   1989   and     constitutes       the       only

'official'        response     to the problems       outlined        above.     The

remit     and findings of the Press Council's report                   therefore

warrant close analysis.



The      Press     Council      procedure    was      that    it      considered

complaints        against      named     newspapers     and        notified     the

appropriate        editor "to enable him or her to reply                directly

to    the    complainant"       [343].      This    procedure        raises     the

question of confidentiality and whether or not                      complainants

 realised       that this would happen.          General complaints           about

 coverage,        in which no specific newspapers were named,                  also

 were     considered       by the Inquiry and all national             and     some

 regional newspaper editors were invited by the Press Council

 to submit:

                     views on their own and other
                newspapers'   approach to   picture
                coverage of the tragedy and their
                general views on press coverage of
                disasters. [344]


 Unfortunately the report did not clarify whether the Inquiry

 assessed        the press coverage In relation to these                editorial

 submissions.         If     this happened it       could     have     influenced
directly the judgement of the Inquiry members.                          Although the

Inquiry report stated that it might publish, at some                                future

date,     the    responses         from   editors        in    a     record        of    the

inquiry" [345], the Press Council so far has refused                                access

to    this information [346].             The Press Council's report                     was

not     lengthy     (approximately         2,000     words)          and      it        dealt

generally       with      points     of   principle           than     with        specific

detail.         There are, however, several issues of                      concern           in

its assessment.


The     report     outlined general principles                  which       guided        the

Inquiry, one of which              mentioned the role of the news                       media

in     reporting       details of tragedies as part of                     the      "public

interest".        It stated:

              There cannot be a comfortable or
              pleasing way of doing that when
              those near to the events will be
              under   deep grief  or   emotional
              stress. [347]


 Here the Council implied that only those people •'near" to                                    a

 disaster would be affected by media coverage.                             Itfailed          to

 acknowledge        the      wider    effects      and        impact       thatgraphic

 descriptions          and    explicit visual representation had                        on      a

 wider     public         constituency.      Its concern was not                   so    much

 with crucial issues of accuracy, reliability and fabrication

 but     of     "comfortable"        and "pleasing"            imagery        within         the

 coverage.        Throughout its report the Inquiry emphasised that

 the     role of newspapers in such circumstances is to                              "awaken
public conscience" as a way of preventing future                          tragedies.

This suggested that sensitivity to the readers, particularly

those directly involved in a disaster, is an issue of lesser

importance.          Further,       in   emphasising      the       necessity        of

"arousing       concern" by publishing certain                photographs,          the

Press    Council          uncritically accepted the           written       accounts

presented       by    editors concerning their            motivations.             This

naive    approach conveniently ignored the use of                        photographs

in     their selling and promoting newspapers.                     Editors do       not

simply     choose         certain     photographs out        of     a    magnanimous

'public information' gesture to the public.                        As commented on

previously,          in    a   climate of        fierce   competition           tabloid

papers     in     particular        want    to     increase        circulation      and

readership by any means possible.



There were similar problems over editorial decisions made on

 the use of photographs.              First, the Press Council stated:


            there was no ethical distinction to
            be   drawn   between   colour    and
            monochrome reproduction. [348]


 Without    explaining          how      it arrived at       this       decision    the

 Inquiry    side-stepped numerous complaints                    from      individuals

 who     considered         that    the use of      colour      reproduction        atas
 particularly         distressing.          The Sunday M irror           used    colour

 photographs         and, notably, a full colour centre-page                     spread

 which     drew       specific public criticism.              It     introduced      the

 issue with a front-page banner headline:




                                           206
             GATES OF HELL; DRAMA IN COLOUR
             PAGE 3 AND CENTRE PAGES. [349]


This      was        an     indication    of     the   ready    use        of     colour

reproduction              in 'the   Hillsborough Disaster         as        a    selling

technique.           The Press Council Inquiry ignored this issue and

failed to consider the use of explicit colour photographs of

the suffering and the dying.                    For many people this coverage,

on     the       morning         after    the     tragedy,      was        the         first

representation              of the Disaster they had seen.             For some             it

was unbearable [350].


The Press Council also decided that the specific placing                                    of

a    photograph            (i.e. on the front cover or inside)                   did     not

warrant      distinction.           This extended to the reproduction                       of

certain         pictures         (i.e. the next day or later           that        week).

Again      this ignored the purposeful use of photographs                              as    a

 device         to        promote   and   sell     newspapers         by         'grabbing

 attention' and the appeal to morbid curiosity.                            It failed to

 recognise           the     differential impact endured by                people       with

 contrasting              experiences.      People     cannot     easily            avoid

 images which are distressing to them if they scream out from

 the front-page of a newspaper.                    The repeated use of             certain

 photographs              also   prolongs the distress felt and                  the     fact

 that some editors clearly revised their use of certain items

    over time is significant to the broader debate.



    Additionally the Press Council decided that it would conduct
    "a     general inquiry" into the picture coverage                  rather       than

    make     "separate       findings on each [351].            This decision was

    problematic     on       several levels.       First,    it     meant    that     no

    assessment was made of the juxtapositions of photographs, to

    each     other, to written reports or to particular                    headlines.

    Consequently       the     cumulative      impact   of      the    photographic

    coverage     and     its     location alongside         other     material       was

    ignored [352].           Second, adjudications made on the misuse                 of

^   certain     photographs       were   not       attributed         to     specific

    newspapers.         It     seems ineffectual for an Inquiry              to     pass

    negative     comment yet not require retractions                  or    apologies

    from     individual        newspapers.     If specific        newspapers        were

    identified     in        complaints it was reasonable to              expect     the

    Press     Council        to have considered them fully,           specifically

    and in keeping with 'normal' procedure.


    The     Press Council Inquiry made specific reference                     to,    and

    adjudicated         against,     certain       coverage.        The      'general'

^   assessment     of photographic coverage was divided into                        three

    categories.        First:


                broad   pictures,   taken   from   a
                distance, showing a large section of
                the crowd through a high       steel
                fence, the front row crushed against
                it. [353]


     Second, photographs in which:


                 the focus was on a single individual
                 or very small group crushed against
                 the fence, sometimes with features
                 cruelly distorted by its steel mesh.
                 [354]


                                             208
Third, those photographs which:


             showed single people, often clearly
             identifiable individuals lying on
             the ground, being treated or carried
             away. C355]

Not   only     were     there serious problems with            this    form   of

picture      analysis, but also there were major               contradictions

in    the Inquiry's final conclusions.                 On the first    category

the ruling was that:



             serious public interest was served
             by their publication, which    was
             within the discretion of editors.
             [356]

However, on the second category, of close-ups, the                     decision

stated:
             In the Press Council's view in these
             pictures the intrusion into personal
             agony and grief was too gross to be
             justifiable ... these were pictures
             which editors ought to have chosen
             not to publish. [357]


The significant difference suggested by the latter                      category

was    the     excess       of     'graphic'    portrayal    of     Identif iable

 individuals.         Yet        the   report   also    described     the   first

 category, of crowd photographs taken at a distance, showing.


              many of them recognisable and in
              attitudes of distress, pain and fear
                   there was no means of telling
              how many of those shown died or were
              seriously injured. [358]




                                          209
Thus    it    is     difficult          to understand             how,     in     the     Press

Council's          own assessment, the two "categories" as                              divided

differed.          Both showed clearly identifiable individuals                              in

pain,    anguish and terror, some of whom had died.                                The     only

concrete      difference           seems         the     distance        from     which     the

photographs         were       taken.            Cle&rly this       was     an     arbitrary

assessment of the psychological impact of such                                  photographs.

For those who lost loved ones at Hillsborough, there was                                      no

such     distinction,              given          that     individuals             could      be

identified.              For   those        who survived the             crush      and     were

injured,           the     sight       of     explicit      photograph-            has      been

described as             like "re-living it all over again" [359].



For such individuals, the Press Council's words ring                                      hollow

and,     given       the enormity of the Disaster, a                        more     thorough

 analysis      would have been appropriate.                       The      only     redeeming

 element of the Inquiry's assessment of photographic coverage

 appeared      in its comment on the third category.                               The     Press

 Council      ruled        that     it was an            “error     of     judgement"        and

 "insensitive"            to     use "pictures of men or                  women     who     were

 known       or thought to be dead or dying " but newspapers                                 "are

 free to show the injured being treated".                            Given this           ruling

 it is difficult to see how a distinction can be                                   established

 between       'insensitive'                photographs taken on the                pitch     and

 others       of     the       crush        in    the    pens,      which        also      showed

 individuals who might have been, or were, dead.



  The    Inquiry          made     comments on           several         issues,     also     the


                                                  210
subject     of complaints, other than the use                    of   photographs.

These were: the conduct of photographers; the article in lh£

Sun on 19 April 1989;           'comment' articles and cartoons.                     The

report     stated        that   no evidence had          been     produced      which

enabled the Inquiry to identify particular photographers                              or

journalists        as     "behaving improperly" [360].                The      Inquiry

therefore        did     not    admonish     any      individuals        for       their

behaviour,         but     emphasised      the        responsibility        held      by

photographers            and    editors.         It   suggested       that         those

involved:



            should be aware of the danger that
            photographers   going about    their
            proper work of taking pictures of
            the injured, dead or distressed may
            appear callous or insensitive to
            those involved. [361]


Having     already reprimanded editors for the                    publication         of

photographs        of the       dead or dying, the Inquiry then                 stated

that      photographers were doing their job.                    Perhaps it        would

have      been more logical for the Inquiry to                    have    considered

 the     issue    more fully and publish               precise     recommendations

 regarding       the      role of the photographer at thescene                  of         a

 disaster.        The report's only conclusion on thismatter was

 that the individual's duty:



             generally    in    covering    major
             disasters is to exercise the maximum
             possible care and understanding for
             the feelings of those involved. [362]




                                           211
The    fact is that the Press Council had received                    complaints

that photographers at Hillsborough                  had failed to meet         this

requirement.           It is    therefore of great concern            that     this

issue was not discussed and evaluated more thoroughly by the

Inquiry.


The    report strongly condemned the publication of the                      Sun ...S

article on the 19th April as:



            unbalanced and its general effect
            misleading. The headline THE TRUTH
            was insensitive,   provocative and
            unwarranted. [363]


This     was a severe censure indeed, particularly                   considering

the     general       tone     of the report.       The    Press     Council      had

received        a     substantial number ofcomplaints                specifically

about      this article, but given that the                Sun S own     recently

appointed Ombudsperson had already admonished the                       newspaper

 for     publishing        this article, the Press          Council s     censure

 could     be       seen as inevitable.       The    report    also     commented

 that:


                similar allegations [to the Sun la
                article] were reported,    sometimes
                with a lack of sensitivity, in other
                newspapers. [364]


 The Press Council, however, did not elaborate on this point,

 failing to indicate if complaints had been received on these

 'other     newspapers',          or to name    the       relevant    newspapers.

 This     seems       to     have been an unfortunate         omission       in   the


                                        212



                                                                                        *
                                                                                        I
circumstances.



The report also dealt with certain "comment articles", as it

termed    them.         These were by three authors,         Edward       Pearce

(Sunday TimesK          Auberon Waugh (Sunday Telegraph) and Richard

Littlejohn ( Kvening Standard), about which the Council                         had

received     specific       complaints.     The    Inquiry     ruled           that

because     they    were     "clearly"    articles    which     gave            the

writer's     own    view"     then "as a point       of    principle"          such

authors should have been "free to comment on affairs" [365].

Yet the report also commented that:



            national tragedy or disaster is not
            an occasion for writers to exercise
            gratuitous provocation. [366]




 It   concluded         that the named articles did not         breach         this

 principle but it is not easy to appreciate the criteria used

 to   establish         "gratuitous provocation".         Clearly,       for     the

 Press    Council        to have received    complaints       against          these

 three     authors,       complainants must have been         "provoked           by

 what     they experienced as "gratuitous".           Further, there             was

 no     consideration       of the accuracy of specific         comments          in

 these     articles regarding, for instance, the causes                   of     the

 Disaster.         By    categorising     these   articles     as        comment

 pieces     they were virtually excluded from adverse                    criticism

 on     the grounds that the authors should be free                 to     publish

 their     personal views.       It does not consider the            impact       of
such articles on the reader, especially when the information

imparted      is     inaccurate,     misleading       or   even       fabricated.

Similarly, the Inquiry ruled that newspapers should be                           free

to   publish cartoons which, in their opinion,                    make a        sharp

or   bitter        point"   [367].    Given     the    seriousness         of     the

Disaster      and     the   extensive suffering it            caused,      such     a

judgement        appears to place cartoons outside the                 restraints

applied to other coverage.



Thus the Press Council adjudicated against:



            1. A small number of photographs
            which focused close-up on    single
            individuals or small groups in the
            crush of pens      at the Leppings
            Lane end [368].


            2. The    Sun article            "THE     TRUTH",
            19th April 1989 [369].


            3. The    use of "stylised logos"
            which identified articles about the
            Hillsborough Disaster.   The report
            described       this   practice  as
            "thoughtless" and their use was "to
            trivialise death" [370].



 Given     that       the   report    was the       product     of,      the     most

 detailed and wide-ranging investigation ever undertaken"                           by

 the     Press      Council [371], it seems prudent             to     assess      its

 general role and function.



 Other than resorting to the courts, the Press Council is the



                                       214
only     formal        mechanism available to the public               in     seeking

redress     for abuses of press power.                Set up -35 years ago              it

is     notionally an 'independent' private body, and                        has    been

described as:



            historically,    a product of                    the
            newspaper     industry's  fear                    of
            statutory regulation. [372]


This     conclusion is reached because of the                   Press       Council s

close connections to the industry it is required to monitor.

For the organisation is funded almost entirely by the                             press

proprietors and of its thirty-six members half are directors

or     employees of press organisations, while the                      others      are

'lay     members'         appointed by a commission within                 the    Press

Counc i1 [373].



The     only      independent study of the Press               Council       and    its

effectiveness             shows     clearly    how     its    constitution          has

affected         its     ability to deal with complaints              against       the

press      [374].         On average 96% of          complaints      are     rejected

 outright        or subsequently not pursued by the Press                    Council,

 and     those     that are considered take between                  six    and    nine

 months     to come to fruition [375].                In 1988 only 10% of            the

 1,400     complaints        received      an adjudication           and     of    those

 'successful', many complainants expressed dissatisfaction on

 several       levels      [376].     With adjudications taking up                 to        a

 year and with no effective sanctions available to the                             Press

 Council,        proprietors         and      editors        often      ignore          the
adjudication, even belittling them in print [377].



If       retractions or apologies are printed, and this is                       rare,

complainants usually are dissatisfied because they are given

significantly            less prominence than the         original        offending

article [378].           A further issue for the complainant is                   that

a    complaint to the Press Council denies the right to                           legal

redress.          The    third Royal Commission on the              Press,       which

reported          in     1977,     included    a    detailed      study     of      the

operations         of     the     Press   Council.       Along     with         several

substantial criticisms,it commented critically on the "legal

waiver" rule:



                 The Press Council is more concerned
                 to protect the newspapers from the
                 public   than to raise the standards
                 of the newspapers in the interests
                 of the public. [379]


This        statement encapsulates the main              criticism        concerning

the       existence and operational policy of the Press                     Council.

The fundamental problem lies in its dual role:



                 wearing two hats - defender of press
                 freedom   and punisher    of   press
                 misconduct. [380]


 Consequently it              is not surprising that the inquiry into               the

    press        coverage of the Hillsborough Disaster was inadequate

    and     restricted.         The only other investigation of this               sort

    to    have    been     undertaken by the Press              Council    was      into

    allegations          of     'cheque-book       journalism      in     the      Peter
Sutcliffe ('Yorkshire Ripper') case.                       An assessment of            this

inquiry        found it to be "an unsatisfactory piece                        of     work",

lacking        in    real      investigation         and    relying       on         written

communications           with editors and executives who                      were     never

interviewed            about        subsequent       discrepancies             in      their

accounts.           Notably:

               The report censured newspapers but
               failed to blame individuals within
               newspaper organisations who    were
               responsible for critical decisions.
               [381]

As previously indicated, this was also a substantial failing

in the Press Council's report on Hillsborough.                              The      Inquiry

did    not      deal     adequately           with   the    issue      of       intrusive

journalism,           despite       a     commitment to         this     in    the     Press

Council's "Declaration of Principle".                       On the specific issue

 of    privacy and the practice of journalists the                            declaration

 embodies six policy statements, including the following:


                The Council expects the obtaining of
                news and pictures to be carried out
                with sympathy     and    discretion.
                Reporters and photographers should
                do   nothing   to cause     pain   or
                humiliation    to     bereaved     or
                distressed people ... . [382]


 The    Press Council, however, did not investigate                               thoroughly

 the complaints it received specifically on this matter.                                  Nor

 did      it    deal     satisfactorily with other                issues        raised     by

 complainants               about       the   coverage     of      the        Hillsborough

  Disaster.          Individuals who sought redress, particularly over
intrusions into their private grief, had to look elsewhere.



The    National’ Union of Journalists           (N.U.J.),    through      its

Liverpool branch, forwarded complaints about the conduct                   of

journalists       to   its   Ethics   Council    .[383].     The     N.U.J.

formally    withdrew membership of the Press Council               in    1980

and     since then had discouraged its use, considering it                not

even    worthy of reform.       The unsatisfactory response of             the

Press     Council to the coverage of the Hillsborough              Disaster

came as no surprise given its past history, but it serves as

yet     another    example    of the inadequacy      of     provision      for

"ordinary" members of the public to gain a                right to      reply

when     faced with abuses of press power.          As Ray     Snoddy,      of

the Financial Times, asked:


            can a system in which the papers pay
            the watchdog ever work? [384]
        CHAPTER FIVE

-A TRAGEDY OUT OF A DISASTERl




              219
Introduction
At    the       outset of this Project there was                  no intention            to

develop         the research around the Disaster itself.                     While        it

was    considered          important           to     evaluate   and   critique       the

Inquiry headed b y •Lord Justice Taylor, the events leading up

to the Disaster and the causes/reasons for the Disaster were

outside         the     remit     of the Project.           Further,    it    was     not

considered            necessary     to     interview        bereaved    families          or

survivors in order to develop a post-Hillsborough                            analysis.

On     this basis families were not approached.                        However,       the

Project         was contacted at its inception by the Secretary                           of

the     Hillsborough            Families Support Group and             all    families

were     circulated with information on the Project's work                            and

invited to contact researchers if they wanted to contribute.

Also,       a    written account of the Project and                    its   terms        of

reference         was     published in Intsnlink ■> the journal                of     the

Hillsborough Survivors' Group.



 In    the      early days of the Project it soon                  became     apparent

that     the      circumstances of the immediate aftermath                     of     the

Disaster, through the evening and into the night of the 15th

April, constituted a major problem for many of the                            families

 interviewed.            Their     concerns focused on the              location          and

 operation of the various sites established to respond to the

 Disaster,            the adequacy of the Hillsborough gymnasium                     as     a

 temporary            mortuary,          the        procedures   adopted      for         the

 identification            of the dead, information and                communications



                                                220
concerning missing relatives, the taking of statements after

identification       and the role and function of the                  police    as

the    co-ordinating agency.       As Lord Justice Taylor                excluded

these issues from the remit of his Inquiry and as there                         was

no     other public investigation or assessment of the                    adopted

procedures and their impact on families, it was decided that

such an investigation would form part of the Project s First

Report.


Statements were taken from and interviews held with many                         of

the     bereaved     families who frankly,          and    often       painfully,

shared      their    personal experiences          with    the     researchers.

Interviews were requested with senior officers of the                       South

Yorkshire      Police,     the South      Yorkshire        Ambulance      Service

 (SYMAS),      the    Medico-Legal       Centre,     the      Hospitals          and

Sheffield Social Services.             These were granted, at the               most

 senior     level,    with the exception of Social               Services       [1].

 Each of the personnel interviewed not only held high                       office

 but also had been on duty in a major decision-making role on

 the    day.       Finally, interviews were held also              with     people

 directly involved with the help and counselling of                       families

 throughout         the   night   of    the   Disaster.          The      shortest

 interviews        took two hours with several lasting as                 long    as

 five     hours.     Where possible, and with the agreement of                   the

 This     chapter is divided into three main sections.                     Section


                                        221
    One    deals with the setting-up, operation and                     co-ordination

    of the main sites employed in the immediate aftermath of the

    Disaster.        These were: the Hillsborough gymnasium, its                        use

    as the 'emergency area' and as a temporary mortuary; the two

    hospitals handling accidents and emergencies; the                          Hammerton

    Road    Boys' Club, as the 'holding centre' for those                        seeking

    information       on     missing relatives or friends;               the     Medico-

    Legal    Centre,       incorporating the city           mortuary,          pathology

    unit    and coroner's court; the co-ordination and control                           of

^   the operation; the organisation of counselling.                       The      second

    section deals with the personal experiences of the families,

    and     those     responding     to    their    needs,        as     they      sought

    information,        access      and help to find        the        whereabouts       of

    their     missing        relatives.    Of central importance                here    are

    their     experiences of the identification procedures and                          the

    taking      of    statements.      Finally, the third              section     is    an

    evaluation of the adequacy, effectiveness and impact of                             the

     entire operation.



     finntion One: Ar»r»ommodating a D isaster

     Thft Hillsborough Gymnasium
     The gymnasium at the Hillsborough ground was being used as a

     rest    and     eating     room for the       police    when        the     Disaster

     occurred.        It was cleared of tables and chairs in order                        to

     use it to accommodate the injured and dead.                       This was not an

     'on     the     spot' decision.       The gymnasium was            designated        an

     emergency        area     in   1986   when    senior     police,           fire     and



                                            222
ambulance officers liaised with Sheffield Wednesday Football

Club     in    establishing          the    Major   Incident      Plan         for       the

Hillsborough ground.               Coincidentally, the ambulance                officer

who had initiated the plan was present at the ground on                                  the

day     and     he       was.the first      ambulance    officer         to     respond

formally to the Disaster.                  In evidence he stated:


               We knew the ground pretty well,   the
               Police,   the Fire and ourselves and
               it was obvious from the onset of the
               meeting that the only access to the
               ground    was   via   the   gymnasium
               entrance.   [2]
This     officer          witnessed the scenes on the pitch               after          the

game had been stopped and he agreed with a colleague that he

would return to the duty ambulance, radio control and                                begin

to prepare the gymnasium area.                  In effect he operationalised

the Major Incident Plan.                At that time, however, his request

was     limited to the second standby vehicle and                       he     informed

control        that he was dealing with, a "minor incident" at                           the

ground.


During the first, chaotic moments of the Disaster, effective

 communication            and     co-ordination was lacking.             The        Deputy

 Chief        Ambulance Officer, also at the ground,                received              the

 dead     and        injured      as they were evacuated          from        the    pitch

 directing           them to the gymnasium or to the ambulances as                         he

 considered           appropriate [3].        The police     controlled              public

 access        to     the       gymnasium although      it   is    the        considered

 judgement           of many witnesses that there was              no     officer-in­

 charge.            On    the     pitch, behind Leppings Lane            and        at    the
gymnasium           there was no clear leadership or direction.                    The

Inquiry     evidence          of Deputy    Chief     Metropolitan       Ambulance

Officer     Hopkins          was that on his arrival at         the     gymnasium

there was no sign-of a senior police presence:


               Q.     So you had been there twenty
                      five minutes anyway before you
                      saw a police officer?

               A.     Well, he was the only one I
                      recognised I hadn’t seen anybody
                      else I recognised.  [4]


As the full realisation of the extent of the Disaster became

apparent the Head of South Yorkshire C.I.D. Detective                         Chief

Superintendent Addis, took overall charge of the                       operation.

He stated that the use of the gymnasium,                 "was quite right in

the     circumstances as there was nowhere else with the                       room"

[5].      He        travelled to the ground and         briefed       the     police

officers present at the gymnasium as to their roles and                            the

procedures           which    would   be    adopted.     This     was       done     in

accordance           with the Association of Chief          Police      Officers

 (ACPO) nationally agreed plan.                  He stated emphatically            that

it     was his decision to use the gymnasium as                 the     temporary

mortuary            and to carry out the identification of the                bodies

at the gymnasium.             He stated:


                I saw it as an ideal situation,   if
                you don't mind me saying, to put all
                the eggs in one basket.  [6]


 This     is        disputed, however, by the Deputy         Chief      Ambulance

 Officer who also was present at the gymnasium.                       According to



                                           224
him,   Detective Chief Superintendent Addis arranged to                           have

the    dead   bodies       transported from       the     gymnasium       to       the

Medico-Legal        Centre before 6 p.m. on the Saturday                 evening.

Accordingly, ambulance workers were sent to the Medico—Legal

Centre to assist in the operation and twelve ambulances were

deployed at the ground to transport the bodies.                      The initial

plan was that two ambulances each would take three bodies to

the Medico-Legal Centre at fifteen minute intervals in order

to facilitate staggered arrivals.                It was projected that all

bodies would have been transported by 7 p.m. [7].



The    Medico-Legal         Centre    received a phone         call      from      the

police     early     on     which explained that         there     had    been         a

disaster and that the Medico-Legal Centre should be prepared

to receive bodies.              The manager of the Centre stated that it

was difficult to establish whether identification would take

place at a temporary mortuary or at the Medico-Legal Centre.

The    Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer              stated that         the agreed

plan     was altered on the arrival of             the Coroner,          Dr Stefan

 Popper,      at    the     gymnasium.      The        Coroner,      under      whose

 jurisdiction        the bodies were held,was of the opinion                    that

 all   bodies       should       be identified    at     the   gymnasium           [8].

 Ambulances        were    dispatched to collect those            dead       at     the

 hospitals      and transport the bodies back to               the     gymnasium.

 The     Coroner     has stated that the use of the               gymnasium        was

 never     in question as it was already accommodating the                         dead

 and     therefore        was    operational as    a     temporary       mortuary.

 Further, he stated that the decision to return bodies to the
gymnasium       "was my decision" [9].            He agreed with           Mr     Addis

that     it was imperative to hold all bodies at                    one        location

and    to have moved bodies to the Medico-Legal                     Centre        would

have caused further delays to the identification                          procedure.

Dr Popper concluded:


           We   weren't going to break      our
           procedure,  we would have been in a
           worse mess than we were already.
            CIO]

The extent to which the Coroner's decision was influenced by

the    Home Office pathologist, Professor Usher, has been                           the

subject    of      speculation.        Dr Popper stated that              he     worked

closely    with      Professor Usher and it has been                 stated        with

reference to Professor Usher's authority that "His word                             was

law" [11]. As the temporary mortuary became                    operational the

police consolidated their co-ordinating, communications                             and

organisational roles as central to the procedure.                          A     social

worker present in the gymnasium stated:


            Information towards the later part
            of the evening was startiug     to
            become more heavily controlled -
            about who it went to. [12]


The    gymnasium was segregated into three areas.                         The     first

area     housed     the     dead,      the    second   accommodated              police

officers     on     standby       to deal with the         bodies        and     handle

identification            and    the    third    was   set    up     to         provide

counselling        for and to take statements from                 the     bereaved.

Sheets     were     hung        from the     gymnasium's      nets        to     ensure

screening.        Detective Superintendent Addis stated:
           It would have been too traumatic for
           relatives to be expected to walk
           along rows and rows of bodies.  [13]


For continuity,a police officer was assigned to each body

and then remained with that body until eventually it was

handed over at the Medico-Legal Centre after identification.



Mr    Addis stated that he sought the approval of the             Coroner

for    what     he considered was the appropriate       procedure        for

identification.          It was agreed that the facial area of          each

victim    would be photographed using a Polaroid camera.                 The

photographs       were     given   a   number,   corresponding    to     the

bodies, and were displayed on boards in the entrance area to

the    gymnasium.         Before being photographed     each     face    was

washed by police officers who were provided with buckets                  of

water and sponges [14].            The bodies were laid out in rows on

the floor.


Those     waiting to identify bodies had to wait outside,               some

sitting       on buses, for a considerable length of time.              Once

 inside the entrance area relatives were shown the full range

 of photographs.         On recognising a face, the number was noted

 by a police officer and the appropriate body was lifted onto

 a    trolley     and wheeled through the gymnasium       to     the    main

 entrance.        The    body bags were slightly     unzipped     and    the

 bodies       were covered with sheets [15].       On viewing the       body

 the     sheet was removed.        Once a positive identification        was


                                       227
made   detectives        took        full   statements.       Detective         Chief

Superintendent         Addis     stated      that       detectives       were    also

counsellors at this stage" [16].                  Social workers, clergy and

members    of voluntary agencies were on hand to                     counsel          the

bereaved        and       provide           practical       assistance.                On

identification, bodies were transported by ambulance to                               the

Medico-Legal Centre.             By 4.30 a.m. Sunday morning,              seventy

four    bodies had        been identified           and    transported          and     a

decision    was        taken     to halt      proceedings.         The    remaining

unidentified bodies            sre    taken to the Medico-Legal Centre.



Thft Hospitals
The    two hospitals used in the emergency response                       were        the

Northern     General       and       the Royal      Hallamshire.         The     Major

Incident     Plan       for the Hillsborough ground                specified      that

casualties should be taken to the Northern General with                               the

Royal Hallamshire in reserve.                 Evidence given to the Inquiry

verified this arrangement:



           Q.     I think the arrangement as^ per
                   the   plan was    that   initial
                   casualties would be taken to the
                   Northern General? - A. Yes.

           Q.     With the           Hallamshire     as      the
                   reserve?          — A. Yes.       [17]


 Although the Plan was operational on the day of the Disaster

 it    is important to note that Senior Administrators at                             both

 hospitals were unaware of the designated order of                         priority.

 According        to     their       statements      the    hospitals      work         in


                                            228
    conjunction with each other and alternate responsibility for

    Accident     and      Emergency    admissions.            Therefore       any      plan

    ideally should have allowed for this standard arrangement.



    The   hospitals           responded   swiftly        to    the     Disaster         and

    accommodated         large numbers of injured and                those    searching

    for   relatives or friends.           In the first hour following                   the

    Disaster the Northern General admitted eighty-eight patients

    injured    at      the Hillsborough ground.               Eleven     people        were

    admitted dead or they died in the accident department.                              Two

    people died in the hospital.              Some of the dead were taken to

    the   hospital        mortuary for a short time.             While        there     was

    considerable space available in the hospital mortuaries, the

    pathologist          at     the   Royal    Hallamshire            considered          it

     appropriate         to return bodies to Hillsborough and all                      those

     certified      as     dead   at the hospital were            returned        to     the

     gymnasium for identification.



     The following table illustrates the numbers of patients who

     attended or were admitted to the two hospitals [18]:

Hammerton Ro^H Bovs'— C lub

A     disused boys' club was the focal point for people                                  trying

to          locate         family       and        friends.        Detective              Chief

Superintendent Addis described it as being a                             holding              area

for      relatives            [19].    The intention was that                people       would

wait        at     the boys' club before being taken                    to     the        nearby

Hammerton           Road      Police Station where they gave                   details          of

those        missing.         Having given the relevant information                           they

returned           to the boys' club, registered as they entered                               and

then waited for information.                        If descriptions given                matched

those        of bodies in the gymnasium they were                        transported            to

the      gymnasium            in   order      to     await     identification.                 The

facilities at the boys' club were poor (e.g. one                                   telephone)

and      the       condition          of the building was             bleak.        Mr     Addis

 confirmed          that       the     boys' club was          used     because          of     its

 proximity to the Police Station.                            He considered that it was

    as, "adequate as it could be in the circumstances...                                      [20].

 A Roman Catholic priest who assisted the bereaved                                  described

    it as, "...like a waiting room for the police station                                     [21].



    Although        it     is not clear who took overall control                         at     the

    boys'        club, it is clear that the actions of those                             involved

    in   helping         in     the club were guided             by    what        the     police



                                                   230
wanted.      The Director of Sheffield Social Services stated:



             The boys' club was not ideal   for
             receiving people    but  it    was
             important that it was close to the
             police station.  [22]


At     the   boys'      club a disparate group     of     social     workers,

voluntary      agency staff, clergy and volunteers were on                  hand

to give comfort and support to people as they waited.



Thft Medico-r.ftgal Centre
The     Medico-Legal Centre in Sheffield incorporates the                   city

mortuary, the pathology department and the Coroner's                      Court.

The mortuary is used to store the bodies of people who                      have

died     suddenly or in suspicious circumstances and also those

who      have died from particular diseases.           On the    day of      the

Hillsborough         Disaster there was one mortuary technician               on

 duty     and one on call.       On notification of the          Disaster     by

 the police a further seven technicians were called in.                      The

 police indicated that bodies would be sent to the                  mortuary.

 The Centre manager, however, had difficulty in                  establishing

 whether      it was intended to establish a            temporary    mortuary

 for     identification purposes.          Fans began to arrive        at     the

 Centre at 4 p.m. following instructions that the dead                      would

 be     transported       from   the   ground.    As     discussed        above,

 however,      a decision was taken at the ground to               deploy     the

 gymnasium         as     a   temporary    mortuary     until      after      the

 identification of the dead.              Consequently the first body did

 not      arrive     at   the Medico-Legal Centre        until     10.06     p.m.
    (Saturday evening).          The last body was received at 6.05 a.m.

    (Sunday       morning).      While the plan was to have            all     bodies

    identified at the gymnasium, the last fifteen bodies arrived

    at the Centre still unidentified.



    The bodies of the dead were transported by ambulance,                          three

    at    a time, from the gymnasium to the                Medico-Legal       Centre.

    The reception procedure adopted at the Centre was to undress

    the     dead,     record    valuables in       their       possession      and    to

®   identify each body with a number.                 The weight and        size      of

    the     body     also was recorded.         The police assisted           in     this

    procedure        following a request for help from the manager                     of

    the Centre.


    Prior to the Disaster the most bodies to be admitted                           in one

    day     was     three.     Although there was        accommodation             in the

    refrigerators for sixty-five bodies, there were only                           forty-

     five     trays until twenty more were sent for two days                       later.

£   The      remaining         bodies    were    laid    out     on    the floor.

     Fortunately,          only a week earlier the Centre             had     installed

     chiller        units which were operationalised over               the    weekend

     and     which     allowed temperatures to be dropped to                  keep    the

     bodies        cool.    The post-mortems began on the Sunday                morning

     and      were     completed        by   Monday     lunch-time.         Teams       of

     pathologists          worked   alongside each other to            complete        the

     post-mortems.

Sgn-Mnn T w o : Kypsrlenclng a Disaster

Although     the       gymnasium       was the       designated          area       for    an

emergency at the Hillsborough ground, on the 15th April                                   the

pitch     itself       and the area behind the Leppings                      Lane     stand

became     'emergency         areas'.         This    was       due     primarily          to

evacuation of the dead and injured from the terraces through

the     tunnel or onto the pitch through the pen gates.                              It    is

important       to     consider the co-ordination of                    the     emergency

services in these areas.



The Pitch
Considerable           evidence was presented to the                   Taylor       Inquiry

concerning        the circumstances of the Disaster including                             the

events     on      the pitch.      There is no intention                 to     reiterate

that     evidence        but there are several issues                   emphasised          in

people's        accounts to the Project.              Many fans          escaped          onto

 the Pitch and most of the injured and dead were carried onto

 the     pitch.        The    police     compilation            of    video         evidence

 submitted        to    the    Taylor     Inquiry         and        other    documentary

 material       [23]     clearly       demonstrates         that        there       was     no

 organised or prepared response by the police when they                                   were

 first       confronted        with     the     Disaster.             They    failed        to

 recognise        the problem in the crowd and reacted                        to     initial

 attempts       to     escape     the    crush       by     preventing          supporters

 gaining      access         to the pitch.       Before the            game     kicked-off

 fans pleaded with police to open the gates in the                                 perimeter

  fencing.        One man, Eddie Spearritt, whose fourteen year                            old

  son had fainted, shouted at a policeman, who was facing                                  him
and   who was less than six feet away, to open the gate                   near

to    him.   The policeman ignored his shouts, "he just              stared

at    me" [24].     In desperation the man pulled and punched               at

the fence.       He stated:

             I was trying to knock the fence down
             with my hands when I realised he
             wasn't going to open the gate.    My
             hands were full of cuts and holes.
             [25]


Eventually he passed out, but survived.           His son died.            His

anger    and     frustration   remains   clear    in    the     following

statement:


             The Perimeter fences have got to go.
             I know that when our Adam     fainted
             I could have thrown him over the
             wall.   He might have had^ a broken
             arm or leg but he'd be alive.   [26]


 Further,      a number of fans were returned to the          pens        after

 they    had climbed the fences.      One man managed to        help        his

 sons    climb     over   the fence and onto     the   pitch.        He     was

 relieved      that they were safe despite his         own    predicament.

 Relief, however, was short-lived.        He stated:



               I saw the gate between the railings
               of the two sections being opened but
               could not believe my eyes when a
               policewoman    grabbed   my    small
               thirteen year old son and pushed him
               through the gate back onto        the
               terraces.   She began to scream and
               shout at people to clear the pitch
               and became almost hysterical.   [27]



                                234




                                                                                  f
A     father      whose        son    died     and     who    was   himself    injured

described           how    he        perceived        the    situation      from    his

disadvantaged position:



               I could see that there' was a narrow
               gate onto the pitch several yards to
               my right.     People were screaming at
               a policeman walking past in front of
               us to open it but he was oblivious
               to      the     request...I    saw   a
               photographer      taking pictures   of
               u s ...  [28]

The       pitch    became        an     area     of     confusion    with     no   clear

organisation or anyone prepared to take charge.                             A nurse who

attended the injured on the pitch stated:

               The   scene  around   me   remained
               completely chaotic with    everyone
               trying to do their own thing,  fans
               and police all mingling together.
               [29]

    Crucially      it     is    clear        from     video    footage,     spectators

    evidence and interviews with senior ambulance officers                          that

    many fans used their initiative                    in responding to the        needs

    of the dying and injured.                 The same, however, cannot be said

    of the police.         As one supporter recalled:



                The control by the police during the
                operation was absolutely negative.
                No-one seemed to be in charge at
                all,  and it was the Liverpool fans
                who took the initiative in dealing
                with the emergency situation.  [30]


    The   fans were the first to tear down the advertising                         boards

    and    put them to use as makeshift stretchers.                         They   pulled


                                          235
people from the pens, administered first-aid and transported

the    injured      and     dead to the Penistone   Road    end      of     the

ground.     His praise was unrestrained:



            Supporters were wonderful          carrying
            bodies. There were twenty          vehicles
            at Penistone Road but they         couldn t
            get in.  [31]

Ambulances        could     not gain access to the pitch       because       of

structural alterations at the ground (a wheelchair ramp                     had

been     built but SYMAS had not been informed).               The   initial

police      response       at a senior level to the Disaster         was     to

send      for    reinforcements and dogs to deal        with     what      they

wrongly perceived to be crowd disorder.             On the pitch police

officers         appeared    to be without direction,      mingling        with

angry      and     frustrated supporters but not equipped            to     deal

with the injured and the dying.            This was in marked contrast

 to    their emphatic response to an order to place a                line     of

 officers across the pitch to prevent Liverpool fans who were

 not dead or injured approaching the Nottingham Forest                    fans.

 A    supporter         in the stands whose son died on     the      terraces

 described        the     reaction   around him to this    scene      on     the

 pitch:


                To say there was a coldness, a fear
                about the place - it was something
                I'd never experienced or ever want
                to again.    People were absolutely
                shell shocked.    You were standing
                there watching people collapse and
                people   who    were dead^  on   the
                pitch..-people being carried off on
           boards every minute... people running
           across the pitch - supporters -
           carrying    boards with arms     just
           flopping down and bodies lying there
           motionless...and right in front of
           your eyes you had about one hundred
           and fifty coppers lined across the
           pitch in front of the North Stand
           doing absolutely nothi'ng. ..and that
           generated a lot of hatred within the
           stand.   [32]

The   Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer described the               scene    at

the     ground    as one of chaos.       He responded by     ordering     an

ambulance to be driven onto the pitch.             He stated:



            My immediate reaction was to get an
            ambulance onto the pitch...to bring
            home    to    them   (the   Nottingham
            supporters)     that    something   had
            happened at the other end of the
            ground.    [33]


While this action could have been interpreted as a waste                  of

a valuable resource, this officer stated that he feared that

the     failure     to communicate the serious        situation      to   the

Nottingham Forest fans was potentially dangerous.



 At. the Rank of the Leppinge Lane Stand
Again,     what     occurred behind the Leppings        Lane     Stand    was

 considered at length by the Taylor Inquiry.               Certain    issues

 remain     unresolved    and   were      raised   again    in   interviews

 conducted for the Project.          The issue of control at Leppings

 Lane     remains contentious.       There is no evidence to         suggest

 that     any    senior   police    officer    took   charge,        although

 officers        retrieved both dead and injured from the            terraces



                                   237
and     placed them behind the stand.         Evidence concerning                the

administering of triage was, and remains, contradictory.



SYMAS evidence to the Taylor Inquiry indicated that                       Leading

Ambulanceman          Litster took control at the back          of       Leppings

Lane.         Other evidence denies that this was the            case.           The

ambulance which transported Ambulanceman Litster arrived                          at

Leppings        Lane at 3.35 p.m., took on board         several          injured

people        and    went to hospital.    Ambulanceman        Yoxall          stated

that     he     went to hospital with      Ambulanceman        Litster.           If

Litster        assumed      Cw..trol, then, it was only for          a    limited

time     following         his return from the hospital.        If       he     took

control        prior to going to hospital it remains            questionable

why     he did not stay at the ground to organise the                    Leppings

Lane area.


The     issue       was confused further by     another       ambulanceman s

evidence        to     Taylor.    He stated that   he     saw    Litster          at

Leppings        Lane       just after 4 p.m., yet he     claimed         that     he

 looked       for     someone in charge and could       not     find       anyone.

This suggests that while Mr Litster had assumed control this

 assumption          had    not been conveyed to   colleagues            who    were

 looking for direction.



 Medical personnel involved in the emergency response                          remain

 adamant that there was no clear leadership at Leppings Lane.

 Dr John Ashton, a Liverpool supporter present at                    the        game

 gave evidence to the Taylor Inquiry which indicated that                          he
took    medical control at the back of Leppings Lane.               He   has

remained     emphatic      that    triage    was    not       employed     in

prioritising transport to hospital.            He stated



           They weren't putting -people in any
           order. They weren't discriminating.
           [34]

A    nurse present at the game submitted a statement               to    Lord

Justice Taylor's Inquiry in which she stated her involvement

at     Leppings Lane.    She criticised the lack of direction              or

leadership     and also the delay in the arrival              of   emergency

services in Leppings Lane.          She stated.



            ... it was becoming more and more
            apparent that firstly nobody among
            the police or stewards had taken
            charge of the situation,   secondly
            the    emergency services had   not
            arrived.   [35]


This statement supported Dr Ashton's assertion that he                   took

medical control at the back of Leppings Lane:



            ...the dead had already been moved
            to this area by the police, having
            been directed to do so by a man I
            took to be a d o c t o r . . . He was telling
            the       police that he wanted             the
            injured to be placed in categories,
            the badly injured to go in the first
            ambulances and not the ones with
            m i n o r i n j u r i e s which at first seemsd
            to be the case.               I was later to
            discover, the following                morning,
            that        the doctor          (John   Ashton)
            concerned was a fellow fan who had
            arrived on the scene a lot earlier
            than I , had summed up the total lack


                                  239
           of leadership and had taken             over
           himself. [emphasis added: 36]


Another doctor involved stated:


           Like Dr Ashton I found no one in
           charge and spent the major amount o f
           my time trying to sort out the
           seriously hurt from those already
           dead, or those with minor injuries.
           [37]

Evidence    from     a   police officer confirms      that     Dr    Ashton

assumed    control       and   that no senior   police     officer        took

charge of the situation:



           The   Dr  [Ashton] was good      too,
           examining    and placing    them    in
           priority for ambulances, in fairness
           his comments regarding      officers
           organising the casualties was partly
           justified.     Certainly no    senior
           officers were in attendance at this
           t ime. [38]

An   ambulance      worker     offered evidence    which     appeared       to

discredit the evidence of Dr Ashton.            In answer to questions

 from   counsel     he refuted Dr Ashton's        allegations       when    he

 stated:


            We had transported a number     of
            casualties   before   that  doctor
            arrived on the scene.  [39]


 However    by     the time Dr Ashton was at       Leppings     Lane       this

 ambulanceman,       according     to his own evidence,       was    in     the

 gymnasium area.

The. Ovmnasium a« a Temporary Mortuary

As    noted          in    the       previous     section     the      gymnasium        at

Hillsborough was the reception area for the dead and injured

carried from the pitch.                  Once the injured had been taken                to

hospital it housed the dead and some time elapsed before                                 it

was     designated             a temporary mortuary          reorganised        for    the

primary        purpose          of    receiving        relatives     and     friends     to

identify        their dead.            For people arriving in Sheffield                via

the hospitals and the boys' club this spartan and                              makeshift

facility        has        become       the     focal point    of     the      pain      of

bereavement.              For the agency representatives concerned                     with

administering              the processes of            identification,        statement-

taking and counselling it was their workplace and has left a

lasting        impression             on all involved       with     these     difficult

processes.                As    its     designated title       suggests         it      was

 'temporary'          and       the     workers had to       'make     do'     with     the

facilities           available.           As Detective       Chief     Superintendent

Addis commented it was:


                 .as adequate as it could be in the
               circumstances.   If you are given
               notice of circumstances you can make
               arrangements.   If there is no such
               notice you have to make the best
               arrangements possible.  [40]


 Unlike    all            that had gone before there was one                 person     who

 assumed       responsibility            for the operation, entrusted with the

 task     of     establishing a "semblance of                  order         [41].     That

 person        was        Mr    Addis.     It was his firm          opinion     that    the

 gymnasium           "was       ideal"     in    the     circumstances.         In      this
location he set about "instilling some discipline"                      [42] into

the proceedings.          Between approximately 5 p.m. and 9.15 p.m.

he     organised     the temporary mortuary ready to              receive       the

first relatives.


            I have always taken the view that in
            a major incident, whether it is one
            or many deaths, you can only have
            one   person in charge.      Divided
            responsibility leads to confusion
            and disagreements.  [43]


The     police take charge in such circumstances                 because       such

deaths are under the jurisdiction of the Coroner.                        Accepted

practice     is     that the agency best equipped           to        assist     the

Coroner     is the police and therefore at Hillsborough it                       was

inevitable        that     the   police    fulfilled      their       duties      in

consultation        with     the Coroner, Dr Popper.            The     following

discussion,        based on a range of accounts taken from                 agency

officials     and the families, centres on both aspects of                       the

use     of the gymnasium: as a reception area for the dead                       and

 injured and as a temporary mortuary.



 Those people involved at the gymnasium immediately after the

 Disaster provide clear evidence that the chaos on the                         pi^ch

 was    mirrored      at the gymnasium.       Nurses      and     doctors       have

 expressed        their    serious concern over the         absence       of     co­

 ordination or direction during the early stages.                      Bodies had

 been laid out randomly and the medics were forced to                       search

 for     people     thought      still    to be   alive    and     in     need    of

 treatment.          Although      Lord    Justice   Taylor        denied        the
allegation     that there was a lack of equipment,          nurses     who

administered     to the dead and injured disagree.           They     have

stated their frustration at the lack of basic equipment.                  A

nurse    who was in-the gymnasium, for example, reported              that

she     could not find scissors to cut an injured man's             jumper

in order to carry out a tracheotomy.           She was given a        blunt

knife     by a policeman.        A nurse manager, frustrated     by     the

lack of equipment on the pitch, found a similar situation in

the gymnasium.        It was:


              .another scene of chaos...I began
            to work with the injured in        the
            gymnasium at around 15.55 hours.     I
            was   conscious of     around    three
            doctors in attendance, but when I
            arrived there was still no medical
            equipment of any sort.   [44]


A     doctor who responded to the public appeal for          assistance

 described the scene in the gymnasium as follows:


             There were bodies everywhere.            Who
             was      alive       and who   was    dead?
             ...Bodies lying higgledly-piggledy
             just inside          the door, the      line
             stretching over to the far wall.
              . . -Whn was gnine to t.qll me what £&
             do?
             Wi t~.hm.it Hi rant.ions I ran along the ^
             lines of crumpled bodies.          TEmphasis
             added;    45.1


 The initial positioning of the injured inside the               gymnasium

 was     unfortunate.         They were placed beyond the dead      and    in

 order to transport them to ambulances they had to be carried

    through the dead bodies.         Once the injured were removed        the



                                    243
dead remained and a short time later a decision was taken to

designate       the      gymnasium the official            temporary          mortuary.

The    wisdom      of this decision has been               questioned          by        many

people        involved,       including      the     Deputy      Chief        Ambulance

Officer.         In     his professional opinion              the      gymnasium          was

entirely         inappropriate         as    a     temporary          mortuary.            He

considered        that "it would have been better to                       identify        in

the     Medico-Legal Centre where there are better                          facilities"

[46].     For:

               At the mortuary they would've been
               washed,   stripped,   hair fixed and
               presented     in    a     humanitarian
               way...not with all their clothes on
               in a chuffin' green body bag..-There
               is no dignity in death and it is our
               duty to bring dignity to death. [47]


Many     people        who were at the match went                to    the     gymnasium

 early     on     to     seek information          about    missing          friends       or

 relatives.            However,     they     did     not   gain       entry     to       make

 identification              of   bodies     until     after          midnight.            The

 experience           of Barry Devonside is one such example.                       He     was

 at     the     match and witnessed the Disaster.                     On   leaving         the

 stand        he was informed that his son, Christopher, had                             died.

 On the direction of a police officer he went directly to the

 gymnasium.             Once      there,    he     gave    the      police      a         full

 description           of    Christopher emphasising that                  probably        the

 most     obvious indication of identification would be a                                Welsh

  International             Rugby Shirt, which bore the Welsh                 crest        and

 motif.        He explained.

                                                                                                 i


                                                                                                 1
               I said to him I don't think anyone
               else in the ground will be wearing
               them today...He left me standing for
               about ten minutes - it seemed like a
               lifetime.    He came out and very
               positively said he s not there —
               there's .nobody of that description
               there     [48]


    It    was after midnight before he identified                 Christopher             in

    the    gymnasium and Christopher was still wearing                    his    Welsh

    International       rugby shirt.       According to the police               no-one

^   admitted     to the gymnasium dead had left the location                      until

    they were transferred to the Medico-Legal Centre.                      The       most

    likely      conclusion     to    be    drawn,     therefore,          was        that

    Christopher        was there when Barry inquired.              Throughout          the

    intervening        period he held out real hope that his                   son    was

    alive.      The     intervening       period    was    described       by        Barry

    Devonside as the worst in his life.               He went back and               forth

    between     the     hospitals,     the    boys'       club    and    the     ground

    searching     for Christopher.           Of further concern is the                fact

    that     Christopher's     friend gave his name and address                      to    a

^   policeman in the gymnasium and informed him that his                         father

    was     present at the game and would be looking for                    him.          If

    this     information     was received it was            never       disseminated.

    Even those people who had been in the gymnasium with a                            dead

     relative    or friend were subjected to hours of                    waiting          and

     being     moved    on before they were allowed to make                 a     formal

     identification.        A man who found his dead wife on the                     pitch

     and     accompanied     her     to the    gymnasium         went    through          the

     procedure of being taken to the boys' club and waiting hours



                                       245
before    he       was        transported back to the             gymnasium     and       at

approximately            10.30 p.m. he identified her body and made                        a

statement.


As    discussed          previously          the    delay   was     caused     by        the

reorganisation            of     the gymnasium into three areas                and       the

establishment            of the procedures concerning                identification.

Polaroid       photographs were taken of the dead because it                             was

considered, "too traumatic for relatives to walk along                                   rows

of     bodies" [49].            The photographs were displayed on                   boards

in      the     entrance             area     and    the    person      making            the

identification            was        asked    to    look    through     the     numbered

photographs             to make an initial identification.                    While       the

intention          of     using photographs was             to    minimise      people's

suffering          the     impact of this procedure               was   considerable.

The photographs were poor quality and some features appeared

 distorted.             Some    people        looked through the        full     set       of

 photographs several times before recognising their                             relative

 or    friend.           As     one father said, "I saw             faces     that       were

 unrecognisable in any shape or form" [50].                          Even the man who

 had accompanied his dead wife to the gymnasium was asked                                  to

 look    through          the photographs and state the number                      of    the

 photograph which he recognised.                      So poor was the quality              of

 the     photograph that he failed to recognise her                          photograph.

 Another       man, looking for his son, stated that he could                              not

 decide       between          two     of the photographs          on   display.           The

 impact       of        this procedure on the bereaved was                  immense,        as

 Barry Devonside stated:

                                             246
           It was so hard to look at the
           photographs because you were looking
           at faces praying to God that Chris
           [his son] wasn't there...We got to
           the end and I said 'he's not here
           he's got to be injured...I went past
           him completely.   I was starting to
           get excited...Odd that it sounds I
           had a feeling of guilt that I was
           pleased •because I was looking at
           photographs   of dead people      and
           feeling happy because I      thought
           Chris wasn't one of them.  [50]


Christopher's photograph was there and a relative pointed it

out    to Barry who, after hours of searching, now                  knew    that

his worst fears were realised.



During     the   preparation    of the gymnasium      as        a    temporary

mortuary       police officers were instructed to wash the                  faces

of the dead using sponges and buckets.            Despite this some of

the    faces     were dirty.   One woman attempted         to       clean     her

son's face with a paper tissue she had in her hand:


            And so I got my handkerchief out and
            of course I wiped the blood from his
            nostrils, I licked the handkerchief
            to take the dust away from his face.
            [52]


Also, a Roman Catholic priest involved in administering                       the

last     rites to victims stated his distress at            seeing          faces

covered     in dirt and vomit.        Evidence from the         Medico-Legal

Centre     indicates    clearly   that     the    bodies    were       cleaned

properly only after they had been admitted and most had been

identified.       Normal practice is that bodies are cleaned                  and

 'presented'      to   the   bereaved    in   a   private       and        caring



                                247
environment.           Close relatives usually are allowed to                      spend

some    time     with the body as part of the                 accepted,     grieving

process.        This    is    necessary        particularly       in      cases        of

unexpected        or    sudden        deaths in   tragic          circumstances.

Experiences       at    the     gymnasium show         that      the      procedures

adopted, exacerbated their suffering.



Following the initial identification of a photograph                            people

were     taken to the inner door into the gymnasium and                         waited

while     the    body     which corresponded to the              number         on   the

photograph was placed on a trolley and wheeled the length of

the     gymnasium.        The treatment of relatives by                 the      police

created         resentment      and     anger,    as    illustrated           in     the

following comment:

            They virtually manhandled us. They
            grabbed our shoulders, grabbed our
            arms and said, "Stay there; Don t
            m ov e!" [53]


Other      families          report     that    they   were      held      back        or

 restrained, that their crucial moment of grief was almost                              a

 public spectacle and that they felt that everything operated

 around    administrative convenience at the direction                          of     the

 police    rather        than the needs of families.              As      the      bodies

 were     in body bags they were presented on a trolley                         with        a

 sheet     over the bag and face.              People's accounts state               that

 the     body bags were opened in their presence to                       reveal       the

 face of the dead person:


                They brought Chris on a trolley.                He
             was  in a bag.   I walked through.
             They unzipped the bag and said,
             "would you just look down?" [54]


It    is    clear that the main objective of the police              was        to

process each identification as quickly as possible.                  Outside

the gymnasium families were waiting on buses and in the car

park.       It    was    late evening and     chilly.        Many   of       those

waiting      were wrapped in blankets.          The procedure       dictated,

however, that identification could take place only one at                        a

time and this lengthened delays.             Mr Addis stated:


             In these circumstances time was an
             unknown quantity. You cannot say to
             people how long they'll have to wait
             as you have to be guided by the
             circumstances.    I took steps      to
             ensure   that a     Chief   Inspector
             addressed all people on the buses in
             terms of procedures.      They    were
             certainly put in the picture as to
             expectations.   It was impossible to
             say how long it would take.    [55]


Thenumbers         of    people waiting outside        the     gymnasium        in

wholly       inadequate      conditions put a heavy pressure             on    the

identification           procedure.     With only one family at          a    time

being       admitted to the gymnasium, each stage of the                 process

 (initial identification from photographs; fetching the body,

 formal      identification) had to be completed before the                   next

 in        line could enter. Consequently the police attempted                  to

 administer the          formal identification with some speed:


                 I was asked by a policeman, "Is this
                 your son?" and I said, "Yes." I was
                 led away to a table.   [56]

                 The    police didn't want me     to    stay


                                      249
              there a second       longer    than     was
              necessary. [57]


While     Detective Chief Superintendent Addis              commented      that

"we     bent over backwards to accommodate families              [58]      this

claim was refuted in interviews with social workers,                    clergy

and     senior ambulance officers.'         One social worker        who    had

been     in    attendance     at the gymnasium       from    early    in    the

procedure       stated that there was a continual            struggle      with

senior police officers to persuade them of the needs of                     the

bereaved rather than the needs of the adopted procedure.                     He

considered       that     the procedure became       "evidential"       rather

than      "identificatory"        meaning     that     the     process       of

identification          was   subordinated to the process        of     taking

statements and gathering evidence.             Clearly the speed of the

identification process led to problems for the bereaved.



              We   had difficulties     with  some
              relatives.   One lady came in to
              identify     her     son.      After
              identification the husband went to
              move on. The wife said, where the
              hell are you going?" She refused to
              move and we had to abide by that
              situation.   We moved them behind a
              partition for a while.   [59]


 Mr     Addis continued that this created a hold-up and                 meeting

 the needs of one person meant that others were having                     their

 needs     deprived.      Many families, however, stated          that      they

 were deeply saddened that they had no time with their                     loved

 ones.




                                   250
         One woman threw herself on       the
         trolley and wouldn't be moved.   Her
         screams    echoed all    around  the
         gymnasium.    The screams were more
         than a human could stand.   [60]


Mrs Delaney who, along with her husband, identified her           son

told   her     story •publicly    on   the   Channel   4   discussion

programme After Dark.

             A Social Worker took us to the
             ground where our son was killed, and
             for my husband and I it was a
             terrible thing that we were taken
             where James was killed. As far as
             we're concerned we feel they didn t
             give, not only our son, but the
             other ninety-four poor people who
             were killed, they didn't give them
             any dignity... surely they could have
             taken     all    those   poor    people
              including     our son either to       a
             church, to a school... covered them,
             even if it was only a white paper
              sheet...When we got to the ground we
             had to look at these photographs to
              try and identify our son. We looked
              and looked, we couldn't recognise
              our son...eventually we did see our
              son...So we were led into the sports
              hall and when we walked in our son
              was lying on a trolley, inside this
              green zipped-up bag, number thirty-
              three , so his Dad and I bent down to
              kiss and to talk to James, and as we
              stood up, there was a policeman who
              came from behind me and was trying
              to usher myself and my husband out,
              straight out of the hall. The total
               attitude    was, you've     identified
               number thirty—three, so go 1 ^ So
               unfortunately... I went hysterical,
               I'm afraid to say, I had to ask if I
               could take our son away from the
               public's eye, again there was poor
               people,    unfortunate people     like
               ourselves being ushered into the
               hall and our James was there, in the
               public's eye, people looking down at
               his poor face.    I also had to scream
               at these police officers and ask


                                 251
           them please to allow us privacy for
           the    three     of    us    to     be
           together... thankfully the policeman
           pulled James over to another part of
           the hall...I started to examine my
           son's body, he had blood in his
           nostrils, blood in his teeth, his
           poor face was hardened with blood on
           the side of his cheek. His face was
           dirty,   his hair was very dirty and
           dusty...And in the meantime I was
           examining our son...My husband was
           ushered to a table to be asked
           questions. At which again I started
           to scream...I know these questions
           have got to be asked but as far as I
           was concerned there is a time and a
           place for everything...I thought it
           was only right that his Dad should
           be with him - we went together to
           look for our son James, and that was
           time that was owed to us, because at
           the end of the day, when you carry a
           child for nine months, and you bring
           them into the world,      it is your
           right to be with your child.        We
           asked if we could possibly -        we
           wanted to stay with James - we were
           told 'no' that we couldn't.     So    I
           asked if we could be allowed to come
           back to see James - we were told
            'no'   it was for     identification
           only...    [61]


Another experience of the identification procedure which was

shared     by    some families concerned positive          indicators     of

identity        either    in   documents    on   the   deceased     or     in

descriptions of clothing, etc.             For example, after      midnight

when Barry Devonside identified his son he was still wearing

the      Welsh     International    Rugby     shirt    which   Barry     had

described to the police at the gymnasium before 5 p.m.                   Bill

Pemberton        also    had given details of his son, Roy,         to    the

police.         He had informed them that he was         wearing    'Lotto

basketball boots and, because he suffered from epilepsy                   and



                                 252
diabetes,          he     was       carrying     identification.           Like           Barry

Devonside, Bill Pemberton had travelled between the                                   several

sites in search of Roy.                     When finally he was admitted to the

gymnasium                he was        asked     to look    through       all        of      the

photographs              to make      an initial identification.                On        making

the formal identification Bill Pemberton noted that Roy                                      was

still       wearing           the    Lotto boots [62].          Another     father           was

instructed               to look through the photographs even though                         his

son     was     carrying a bus pass which included                       his     name        and

photograph.              Mr         Addis    stated     that      possessions              were

discounted          as reliable indicators to establishing                           identity

because        it was common knowledge that                     football       supporters,

particularly             Liverpool supporters,             "swapped"       documentation

and     tickets           [63].       It was not clear          from   this       statement

whether        or        not Mr Addis was employing a metaphor                       in     this

 instance.


 Following a positive identification relatives were                                   escorted

 to     a   table at which they were interviewed                       by       two       C.I.D.

 officers.              Assuming        that    they    were simply         providing              a

 statement          of identification many relatives                     have        expressed

 anger        that the line of questioning was                    more      interrogatory

 then       expected            and, therefore, geared to the               gathering             of

 evidence.              Bereaved        families were          concerned        that         many

 questions              unrelated directly to the               person's        death        were

 asked        of        them.       This     included      details       of theirown          journey

  to    Sheffield, whether they had attended the match, if                                   they

  had consumed alcohol, etc.                    A bereaved parent challenged the
relevance     of these questions and the context in which                they

were     asked.     He was informed that the police were,            "trying

to     build up a complete picture of the day"             [643.     Another

bereaved     father     who   was     at the    match    claimed     that the

officers asked him to recall the events of the day.                  He told

his     story and they listened.          They asked him to repeat        the

story and they wrote down his statement.                He stated that     he

was     prompted from time to         time.    When he read    through his

statement     all,     "critical      statements about the         police had

been omitted" [65].


A social worker who had assisted in the organisation of                   the

gymnasium     as     a temporary mortuary stated that          the     police

priority was information gathering.


            They     wanted to       take    statements.
            That     was their       primary    concern.
             [66 ]
Detective         Chief Superintendent Addis stated, however,            that

his intention was simply to gain a short statement from                   the

bereaved:



             It is normal procedure to ask for
             information concerning the medical
             history   of   the    deceased.     I
             instructed that this should be the
             case as pathologists need all of the
             relevant medical information      and
             that concerning alcohol.     Some of

             immediately because the post-mortems
             started the next morning.      If you
             allowed people to go home how long
             would it take to gain the urgent

              reinforce that at this stage       I
              wasn't aware of any      allegations
              concerning excess alcohol...I was
              there trying to do a job to the best
              of my ability.  [67]


Apart    from        the serious problems            encountered        by     families

concerning       the     procedures adopted at               the    gymnasium,      the

physical       environment,           with     its   three     sections         loosely

segregated       by     sheets        draped     from   nets,       heightened      the

distress felt by families and workers.                       Police officers        had

been    on duty for hours and needed to eat and drink.                            Their

designated area was between the 'counselling and                             statement-

taking' area and the area in which the bodies were laid out.


              At five o'clock in the gymnasium
              there was row after row of bodies
              and all around the walls there were
              police officers sitting down eating
              chicken legs.  [68]


The tension concerning priorities for handling the                             bereaved

emerged when tea and coffee, requested by social workers for

distribution to those waiting outside the gymnasium, arrived

and     a notice was chalked up stating "For police use                          only".

A social worker who intervened was assured that this                             notice

did     not     relate        to    the   situation     and        it   was     removed

 immediately          [69].        There were problems reported               concerning

 telephone       access        at the gymnasium, over the               long     delays,

 over    lack of information and over the 'pressure' of                           police

 control       and     regulation.           These   substantive        and     repeated

 criticisms from the bereaved families were endorsed by other

 agency representatives in attendance [70].

           officers are not trained tj deal
           with the sick or bereaved.    There
           was   a reluctance to   give    out
           information, they were preoccupied
           with dotting  'i's' and    crossing

           To have C.I.D. officers all sat at

           a w f u l . . . you can't go off like that.

           We had to stand for five hours and
           listen to the identification      of
           sixty-odd people. The screams and
           crying could be heard everywhere.
           It was awful and will be with me for
           ever.

Detective          Chief       Superintendent                   Addis was               faced    with    an

unprecedented set of circumstances and agreed that "mistakes

were    made".          Overall, however, he was satisfied                                      that     the

procedures were the right procedures", that "there should be

no     deviation"           and that the "procedures worked                                 very       well"

[71].     He concluded:


             There was very good co-operation
             from the Ambulance Service and they
             transferred    the bodies   to   the
             Medico-Legal Centre. By 4.30 a.m.
             74    of the 94 bodies had      been
             positively identified.    This   was
             first-class...The remaining bodies
             were transferred to the Medico-Legal
             Centre.     Further   identification
             could take place there.     By 5.30
             a.m. all bodies had been transferred.
              [72]

 In this statement Mr Addis attached a high priority to                                                 what

 he     considered                 to      be         a       major              organisational          and

administrative          achievement.         Senior    ambulance         officers,

social       workers     and     clergy, however, did          not    share        this

satisfaction arguing that the gymnasium should not have been

used     a    temporary        mortuary.     A    senior     ambulance     officer

reflected:


              It   was totally unnecessary   for
              people to go through that torment.
              [73]




Tha Hospitals

The    overwhelming response to the medical care and                      personal

attention        given to the injured and their families by                    staff

at     both main hospitals was positive.                Again, in      the     first

hours        of a Disaster the size of Hillsborough the                  scene          at

the hospitals was chaotic.                Many off-duty staff attended the

hospitals        and    the     medical      care    offered    was      excellent

especially given the circumstances.                   Yet there were problems

encountered        by    families      and       friends.      Inevitably,          the

hospitals        were    the obvious places for people to                visit          in

their search of missing friends and relatives.                        Consequently

 a large number of people arrived requiring information.                                At

 the Northern General all visitors were directed to a canteen

 and     asked    to wait.        A social worker, who          responded          to     a

 public       appeal for assistance, recalled how he went                     to        the

 Northern General, was taken to the canteen, given a                          sticker

 marked 'social worker             and was told to          do your stuff          [74].


                                     257
He described the scene in the canteen:


            It was filled with people in various
            states of distress... some    people
            were sitting at tables,   some were
            standing up, some were banging the
            walls, others were just numb.  [75]


Barry    Devonside was one of the people in the            canteen,

commented:

            There must have been a couple of
            hundred people ther-: ..people were
            very distressed, some were fainting,
            people    were     absolutely    shell
            shocked...they were just sat there
            dumbfounded...The Assistant Hospital
            Administrator came in and stood on a
            table     and      started     reading
            descriptions     out of people in the
            mortuary.   [76]


A   social     worker    stated    that   this   man    was     a    hospital

administrator.      Each time he went into the canteen there was

a   silence throughout the canteen and as              people       recognised

descriptions      they    were directed to police         officers.          The

social worker commented:


             He     started    to    reel      off
             information...as he did people were
             collapsing like dominoes...  [77]


 The    social worker was critical of the procedure.                 First     it

 appeared      insensitive   and public for people         to       hear     this

 information      announced from a table.        Second, he         considered

 the    role    of the police to be       inappropriate       arguing        that

 people were in need of personal support and privacy.


                                  258
A     senior social worker arrived late in the evening                                    at     the

canteen and witnessed a mother and daughter giving the                                         name

of        a person to a member of staff at the registration                                    desk.

Another           person,           approaching     -the    desk     from        a        distance

informed             them     that      the    person      was     dead.         The        mother

collapsed                and was carried to a side room to                  be       comforted.

The        social worker asked, "why couldn't she have been                                    taken

into the side room in the first place?" [78].



A further issue concerning the hospital was the role                                        played

by        the        police.         The Detective         Chief    Superintendent                co­

ordinating the emergency response stated that he,                                         arranged

    for teams of police officers to attend all hospitals in                                       the

    area"        [79].      He stated that the police were able                        to       tell

    you     if       a    person      was in hospital but           at     that        point       we

    couldn't say if someone was dead" [80].



    Once     again          there      are    disconcerting         reports          of        police

    insensitivity              at     the hospitals.        Jenny and        Trevor            Hicks,

    whose        two daughters died at Hillsborough, asked to see                                 the

    body        of       one of their daughters.            This request             was       turned

    down        by a police officer.              Jenny Hicks insisted and                     became

    angry        with       the officer who replied that the                     body       was    no

    longer their concern as it was the "property of the Coroner

     [81].           When they persisted with the request they were                               told

     that the bodies of their daughters were not at the hospital,



                                              259
although       Trevor had travelled from the ground with                   one     of

his    daughters in an ambulance.           Clearly this denial led                to

confusion       and no information was presented to              clarify          the

situation.        What had happened was that both              daughters          had

been returned to the gymnasium.



Hammert.on Road Bq v b ' Club
The     chaos at the Hillsborough ground followed the                  bereaved

to     the   boys'   club.   A priest who           assisted    the        bereaved

stated:


             We got to Hammerton Road and things
             just went from bad to worse...I just
             could not believe Hammerton Road - a
             disused    boys'  club   with    on&
             telephone.   [82]


A     social    worker who responded to a television               appeal         for

assistance       described the scene at the boys club as                    chaotic

and confusing.        He stated:


               It didn't seem to me that it was
               under the control of a        clearly
               functioning management group.   [83]


 The    system     of registering at the boys' club             added        to    the

 confusion:

               You   had to register     when   you
               arrived, then you had to go over to
               the   police station to     make   a
               statement, then you had to come back
               to the boys' club and re-register.
               [84]


 Re -registration,      however,         depended     on   proof      of     initial


                                   260
registration.       Obviously    as more people   arrived     and     the

numbers      inside the club increased the inefficiency        of     the

procedure grew steadily worse.



A    social worker who travelled 'from Liverpool        to    Sheffield

raised      the   problem   of communication   and    the    giving    of

information to those waiting:


             Some people in the boys' club were
             kept waiting even though people in
             charge knew their relative or friend
             was dead.  [85]


Detective Chief Superintendent Addis gave a clear             assurance

that people at the boys' club were not informed of the death

of a friend or relative.        This is denied by one account of a

man       being informed by a policewoman that his son was          dead.

This occurred while he sat at a table in the waiting area.



A further problem concerning information was that it was not

necessarily       accurate.     Two people who were     searching     for

their friend and his son were present in the boys' club when

 the son's name was read out as being alive and well.


              A policeman in uniform stood on a
              chair   in   the   boys      club...He
              announced that the only list they
              had was one of people who had— fossn
              reported missing at— H^nfflisrton— Road
              Police Station and were known i n — ba
                    *nd well. There were about
              eight to ten names on the list and
              Adam Spearritt was included.     [86]


    The   friends then telephoned the boy's mother to inform           her
that     hs    was on a        safe and wsll    list.      Thsy went       to     uhe

police station as requested but there was no information                          on

Adam      nor     of     the    list   on   which    his      name     appeared.

Additionally,           the    co-ordination    of       information       between

Sheffield        and     Liverpool resulted         in    false   expectations.

Hilda     and     Philip Hammond were visited by              a   policeman        at

their     home      in Liverpool and asked to             telephone    a     number

regarding their son, Philip.                He said to them       No, he s        not

dead'.        Incredibly, this comment was made three hours                     after

Mr     Hammond's        brother had formally         identified       Philip      and

after     another brother had been informed of Philip's                      death.

People        have spoken of the frustration of being                 denied      any

information         and of having to wait for long periods of                    time

not     knowing        what was happening or what           plans     were      being

made.


A Social worker's impression on walking into the boys                            club

was      that,     "it    was hard to say who was           in    charge        [87].

According to Detective Chief Superintendent Addis the                           boys'

club      was the designated "holding area to                house     relatives"

 [88].        Social workers became involved at the club, but their

 primary role, according to the Director of Sheffield                        Social

 Services,        was     to "support" the police [89].              Although      he

 acknowledged           that the boys' club was not ideal he               defended

 the decision to use it:



                 I am sure it was the right decision.
                 [88]
The Medicn-T.ftga 1 Centre
The    manager     of     the Medico-Legal Centre      stated     that   the

Centre ignored police requests by allowing families who were

identifying      or visiting the dead, to stay with them for              as

long    as they required.        He stated that the police         position

was that if bodies had been identified formally, it was                  not

necessary        for      them   to    be   viewed   again.       Families'

experiences       at     the Medico-Legal Centre,      however,     contest

this official version of events.              Janet Spearritt, mother of

Adam, identified him at the Medico-Legal Centre because                  she

had been informed during Saturday evening that he was alive,

safe and well.          Her suffering was exacerbated by being           told

that she could view his body only through a glass divide:


            I wanted to hold him, hug him for
            the last time, to put my arms around
            him and they wouldn't let me.      I
            cried,  and I begged and I pleaded.
            [91]


 She was told:

            "When       you get him home you can      hold
            him."       [92]

 Mrs    Delaney,        who had struggled to be with her son        at    the

 gymnasium found similar barriers existed at the Medico-Legal

 Centre.

            We went home to see our      other
            children.  James' sister Catherine
            wanted to come back to see her
            brother.  We went to this medical
            centre we had to sit over three


                                      263
          hours...When we finally got to see
          our son James we weren't allowed any
          privacy.   James was behind a glass
          screen - we weren't allowed to touch
          or kiss James, and when I mentioned
          to   the doctor, why weren't      we
          allowed to touch and kiss our own
          son and the reply was, when the
          autopsy's done you can touch and
          kiss your son as much as you like.
          We    weren't   asked   about    the
          autopsy...we were told.  [93]


It    was not until her son was brought home that       she    could

finally hold him.      Although the condition of her son's         body

caused great distress:


           At the end of        the day when we
           eventually got our son home on the
           Wednesday...we brought James home to
           the warmth of his own house, before
           that we weren't even allowed to
           visit dur son...if we were allocated
           half an hour each day it would have
           been some consolation to us.       We
           were sitting in Ellesmere Port, our
           son was down in Hillsborough - our
           hearts were eaten away for the fact
           that he was lying there on his own.
           When we got our     son home, our son
           was    completely    stripped of  his
           dignity. Our son's head had a hole
            in the back of his skull, his    top
            teeth were taken away from him, his
            chest was completely padded,        I
            examined my son like I did when I
            went to see him the first time.
            That again is a mother's or father's
            right to do so.  [94]


The    justification    for this imposition was      that    the   room

available for viewing was next to the main storage area              for

bodies.       Consequently, during the initial period the          staff

 considered     it   inappropriate   for people to    have    to    pass

 bodies which were stored on the floor.       Even on the      Monday,



                              264
when     Eddie        Spearritt, Adam's father,              visited     the    Centre

restrictions on access were still imposed.




nn nn in a t o n :   a Tragedy out of            Disaster


               It was a complete     carnival.    I
               didn't see anyone who was drunk
               I saw people out for a bloody good
               day. [95]

For many people who went to Sheffield and contributed to the

carnival atmosphere the day ended with them identifying dead

relatives            or     friends.     Throughout the        intervening       period

they spent tortuous hours searching for their loved ones                                or

 seeking        information.           The frustration and        suffering          which

 they experienced are well-documented in the previous section

 of this chapter.              These experiences, together with those                   of

 the     professional and voluntary workers, are typical of                            the

 mass        of      research       material      gathered     for     this     Report.

 Inevitably           the     discussion has focused           critically       on     the

 response of the agencies involved, particularly the                            police.

 There        is     no     doubt      that    many   individuals       involved        in

  responding          to     the    needs of people during            and     after    the

  Disaster           demonstrated             considerable      courage,        personal

  strength           and    warmth.      Further, it is recognised             that    the

  harrowing           experiences        endured,     by    workers    on     that    day,

  regardless              of their professional role or status, will                   stay

  with       them for ever and will continue to present                       them    with
d e e p    e m o t i o n a l      p r o b le m s .




A    research             p r o j e c t ,    however, has          t o   move   b e y o n d    the    p e r s o n a l


a n d     d e v e l o p     its analysis             o f    the broader structural                    contexts

and social arrangements which prevailed on the day and                                                        into

the         night.               It         is only by a           critical       appraisal             of      the

context and the procedures adopted that it becomes                                                    possible

to        make        sense            of personal               experiences,         to       endorse          the

 legitimacy                 of        feelings of injustice and                     to        validate          the

 range          of        criticisms levelled by the bereaved                                      towards      the

 appropriate                   authorities.                 The debates over                  liability         and

 responsibility                       for the Disaster have                  been        well-publicised

 and         Lord Justice Taylor's findings connecting cause                                               (over­

    crowding)              to reason (policing) are firmly                             established               but

    not uncontested.                        Certainly the proposition that policing at

    such venues remains dominated by an ideology of control                                                      and

    containment rather than by a priority of care and safety was

    well-illustrated by the police response to the early moments

    of the Disaster. They failed to recognise the warning signs,

    misinterpreted                    the       actions          of dying fans            and        were       ill-

    equipped              to react quickly to the demands of the                                     situation.

    Not       only          was this apparent in the actions of                                    officers         in

    direct control at the Leppings Lane Terrace but also in                                                       the

    initial reaction of their controlling officer in calling for

    reinforcements and dog-handlers.                                     Despite the large                numbers

    of      police present on the pitch it was left                                           to     lay-people,

    the        fans,           to respond by administering                         first-aid,             placing



                                                           266
people     in the recovery position, attempting to             resuscitate

or     carrying bodies on makeshift stretchers.          Vide?        footage

shows several officers responding in this way but most stood

by     apparently frozen by the seriousness of          the     situation.

This     raises serious questions not about the          characters          or

attitudes of individuals but about the adequacy and emphasis

of their training.



A     strong     argument has been put forth that       many     who     died

would     not have been saved by access to better equipment                  at

the     scene.     However, people were resuscitated,          some     after

they had been taken to the gymnasium, thus it is                reasonable

to     assume that others could have been saved.             Whatever     the

parameters        of   the debate, however, an      emergency       response

should not operate on principles of pessimism and should                     be

provided       with the support of the best available           equipment.

Further, written statements from nurses and doctors recorded

their     frustration at being given empty oxygen cylinders                  in

response to their urgent request for oxygen.             However,        Lord

Justice Taylor accepted the position submitted by SYMAS:



               It would have been professionally
               irresponsible to have taken them
               (defibrillators) on the pitch. [96]


Had      the   police    who    formed   a   line   across    the      pitch,

 ostensibly to prevent possible crowd trouble, been                 deployed

 to     form a circle to cordon off an area, then the use               of    a

 defibrillator          might   not   have   been   problematic.         This
argument       has been supported by the Medics           at    Hillsborough

Working Party (MAHWP) who argued that if a casualty clearing

area had been established on the pitch,                "it would then          have

been     possible       to have used a defibrillator           3afely"       [97].

Also it would have made it possible:


              ... to have drawn on the skills of
              more of the 33 South      Yorkshire
              Paramedics who were available for
              disasters than the few who were
              actually used. [98]


As     has    been     noted, the Major      Accident     Vehicle      was      not

summoned until 3.29pm.            It arrived at 3.45pm.         The fact that

such     vehicles       are equipped to deal      with     major      incidents

suggests that its deployment should have been a priority.



The     lack of any co-ordinated response behind                the    Leppings

Lane         stand     clearly     created     difficulties           concerning

treatment,           triage and evacuation of the dead          and     injured.

There were "no police officers m              attendance       [99] and there

remains        confusion     as   to who     co-ordinated      the     Ambulance

Service        operation.     The ambulance worker designated             as     in

control        left the scene and despite his role was not                called

 to    give evidence to the Taylor Inquiry.              Medical       personnel

who arrived from within the crowd presented severe                       accounts

 of    the     organisation       of   the   medical    operation        and    the

 availability          of resources and equipment.        Dr    John      Ashton,

 whose       evidence was discredited by Lord Justice Taylor,                   has

 received considerable support from rthers involved including

 a police officer.          Clearly this accumulation of inter-agency
evidence       cannot      be ignored and it is          apparent          that        Lord

Justice       Taylor      was unduly severe in his criticism                     of        the

evidence       presented by the doctors and nurses                   who     attended

the dead and injured.



The     initial      period in which the gymnasium was                 used           as     a

clearing-area             inevitably    was   chaotic.           Confusion                 and

spontaneity,             however,    cannot   be   used         to      rationalise

inadequate          resourcing      or lack of     co-ordination.                That        a

major public event at an established venue could take                                 place

without       even basic first-aid equipment being to hand is                               an

indictment          of    the licensing authority, the               Club    and           the

event's organisers.               Clearly the gymnasium was            ill-equipped

to deal with even a limited incident.                    Once the injured                  had

been      taken to hospital and the gymnasium had                     been       cleared

 the bodies of the dead had their possessions removed by                                   the

 police       and    were put into body bags by            ambulance         workers.

 This     process took one hour and twenty minutes.                         By        4.30pm

 those     bodies behind Leppings Lane had been                  transferred                 to

 the gymnasium and by 5.00pm police officers were sitting                                    in

 the     gymnasium         eating chicken legs.      Dr     Ashton          criticised

 further       the speed of this operation.              Certainly it             was        m

 marked       contrast       to     the slowness    of    the        procedure             that

 followed.


 The use of the gymnasium as a temporary mortuary remains one

 of     the    most controversial issues in the aftermath                         of        the



                                       269
 isaster.        Certainly         it exacerbated the suffering                      of      uhe

bereaved      and, as discussed earlier, it has been                            criticised

by workers, from all the caring agencies, who were                                  involved

directly.        The       transfer      of    bodies       back         from       hospital

mortuaries, the decision not to use the Medico-Legal                                    Centre

and     the   makeshift           arrangements       at     the     gymnasium              were

decisions apparently geared to professional convenience than

to     the    consideration          of the bereaved.              They         were      clear

examples       of     how easily         professional            judgement          overrides

personal        needs.            Further,     there        is      no        satisfactory

explanation           as     to    why    it   took        over     four         hours         to

operationalise             the    gymnasium     as     a     'working               temporary

mortuary.       Time was of the essence and many of the                              bereaved

were forced to wait over seven hours before they could                                       make

even an initial identification.                  For them this was the first

concrete information they received.



The     process       of     identification,          especially              the    use       of

Polaroid        photographs         and the lack of time                 or     privacy        on

 identification,            the    presentation        of the        bodies          and      the

 taking of statements exacerbated the pain and                                suffering        of

 the    bereaved.          Given the professional and                human          resources

 available          each of these elements could have been                          resolved,

 as     far    as     possible, to 'normalise'               the     procedure.               The

 failure       to     categorise photographs by                  gender,         and,      where

 possible,          age-range added further to the                   suffering.              This

 was     inexplicable in those cases where relatives or                                 friends

 had     been       with     the dead person earlier.                    Clearly        it    was
unnecessary       to        remain     rigidly committed        to     the    adopted

procedure in these cases.                  The denial of time and privacy              -

an initial grieving period - was a serious oversight in                              the

procedure       which        has     had long-term      implications         for     the

bereaved.         Without           that    time   available        there    was      no

opportunity for people to come to terms with their                           emotions

and     in the same moment they had to answer questions                        which,

to      them,    sounded           interrogatory     rather     than        simply     a

statement of particulars.                  Their lasting impression was that

this was the first stage of the police investigation of                              the

Disaster and not, as it should have been, the last stage                              of

the process of identification.



Both     major hospitals responded swiftly and                      efficiently        to

the     Disaster.          Unlike most other disasters there were                    many

relatives and friends to be accommodated at the same time as

the     injured.       They arrived at the hospitals within                    minutes

of     the ambulances.             All accounts stated that the              treatment

of      the injured was thorough, considerate and                     caring.         The

kindness        and        personal support by the        hospital          staff     was

 experienced          by     visiting families as well as by                those     who

 were     admitted.           The    major    problem    encountered          at      the

 hospitals       related           to the dissemination of           information       to

 those     waiting in the out-patients at the Royal                     Hallamshire

 and,     especially,          in the canteen at the           Northern       General.

 The      public       announcement,          shouted   by     an      administrator

 standing on a table, was both insensitive and inappropriate.
There     was        some confusion as to who was                  co-ordinating             the

reception        areas       especially         given    the       police           presence.

Again, the role of the police was not clear ■ especially                                      in

their     dealings          with families who had been                 bereaved.             The

denial     of access' and insensitive remarks made to Jenny                                  and

Trevor     Hicks        were       callous.       As     a    direct      response            to

Hillsborough the hospitals have revised their disaster                                     plan

acknowledging              that    mistakes were made.              At    the        Northern

General this not only includes a more integrated use of                                      the

key     hospital           areas    but   also     the       use    of    high        quality

photographs           to     ease the problem of identification                       of     the

injured.



As    a   'holding           area' for      people       seeking         information          or

searching        for        relatives the        boys'club         was     ill-equipped,

spartan     and        unwelcoming.             Chosen       for   convenience,              the

priorities of good communications, sound information and co­

ordinated responses were neglected.                           Father Towey, a              Roman

Catholic        priest, stated that, "any kind of                        emergency          plan

which      could           have    maximised       communication              would         have

minimised        the confusion" [100].                 He saw portable phones                 in

use at midnight but those were only used by the police.                                      The

 information          provided was not always accurate,                        occasionally

 with     tragic       consequences.            There has been           no        explanation

 offered        as     to how false information came to                       be     given     to

 families.


 Throughout           the     period of the Disaster               and    its        immediate


                                          272
aftermath     the      inter-related     issues       of         co ordination,

communication        and information supply gave rise                  to     serious

problems.     Clearly it is accepted that the very nature of                            a

disaster     means     that    its sudden     and    specific           impact          is

unexpected.       In hours, sometimes minutes, emergency services

and     back-up     agencies are compelled to respond to                     a    whole

range     of unpredictable and volatile contingencies.                           It     is

essential that clear co-ordination, unambiguous                        information

and     effective     communication evolves quickly to                  meet          both

pragmatic     and     personal     demands.     Just       as         lack       of    co­

ordination        creates     serious   problems      so        does         direction

without     sensitive       consultation.      Just        as     misinformation

contributes        to the confusion, so does lack                of     information

add to      people's worry and pain.          It has become clear that in

 the management of the          crowd, the setting-up of                thegymnasium

 as a temporary mortuary and the initiation and operation                               of

 the process of identification the police assumed control.



 In terms of arrangements at the temporary mortuary Detective

 Chief     Superintendent       Addis was in no doubt that                   after      he

 arrived he was the person in charge.               He stated:


             It is the coroner's jurisdiction and
             he    is in charge and in       every
             incident      he    delegates-----tbfi
             reiRPonpihilitY to the police. [101]


 As     the procedures for the identification of the                         dead,      the

 process of accounting for 'missing persons' and the task                                of

  'keeping    order' are the responsibilities of the                         police      it
was accepted operational policy that they would take overall

control.      Consequently, while the responsibilities                     of     the

emergency     services, the hospitals and the Coroner are                        xaid

down   in law or in codes of practice, the                 co-ordination           of

all agencies, the- accommodation of bereaved families and the

dissemination of information were left to the discretion                           of

the police.        It was concerning these broader functions                     that

criticisms began to emerge.



The    previous discussion of events on the pitch, behind                         the

Leppings Lane stand and at the gymnasium focused on people's

accounts     of     the early chaos and confusion.             It    was        clear

that      while      there    were     many      individual         acts        which

demonstrated        personal courage and initiative there                  was     an

absence     of     leadership    and       a   failure    to   take        control.

Clearly     the     agreed emergency plan did not              function.          The

Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer, for example, stated, "I went

to the agreed rendevous point but I was the only one                         there

 [102].    His counterparts from the other services either were

unaware of the rendevous point or failed to meet as                         agreed.

Once      the initial stage of the Disaster had passed                     and    the

 injured     had    been     taken to      hospital      the   procedures          for

 administering       the temporary mortuary, organising the                      large

 number of people searching for missing relatives of                        friends

 and   gathering and disseminating information fell under                          the

 co-ordination       of Detective Chief Superintendent Addis.                       On

 taking charge he set up an incident room, activated the Home



                                     274
Office Inquiry System, appointed an office manager to direct

communications, set up the casualty bureau, liaised w i t h ' -

Coroner and "briefed officers on the basic set of procedures

to    be adhered to".            With a police presence        established           at

each of the venues and with communication between the police

straightforward            their     co-ordinating      role       was     readily

apparent.



            The people who had control of the
            situation were the people who had
            the communications.  The people with
            radios were the police.   It was as
            straightforward as that. [104]


Clearly,       as    the statement from the Sheffield               Director         of

Social     Services         indicated,      the role    perceived        by       other

agencies     was         that    of supporting the       police.         This       fait

accompli       was not shared by all grass-roots workers                      and     it
                                                                              \

was    clear        in    interviewing      social     workers,     clergy           and

ambulance officers that their experience was that all                             other

needs,     personal and professional, were subordinated to                           the

police     function.            Social workers, praised by Mr Addis,                 who

had    been involved from 4pm onwards stated that                    there          were

real     problems         in negotiating with senior           police      officers

over matters of professional dispute.



            How can a basic grade social worker
            with less than a year's experience
            argue with a senior police officer
            who's in control? [105]


 While     the      police did liaise with           representatives          of     the



                                      275
other    agencies it was clear that their                 adopted     procedures

and their priorities would not be changed.                   This high degree

of organisation and control at the gymnasium was not matched

by an equivalent provision of information to those waiting.



In    theory the purpose of opening up the boys                 club     was     zo

provide a holding-area for people waiting to be                     transported

to    the     temporary mortuary.           In   practice    people     received

little      information of note and, as one person stated,                      no-

one seemed to know what was happening ... there was tea                         and

biscuits       but    no     information"        [106].     Consequently       many

people      decided        to travel to the hospitals or back            to     the

gymnasium          in an attempt to find more information.              In     many

minds       the    boys' club has remained a potent symbol               of     the

feelings          of frustration and neglect felt by families.                  The

denial        of information contributed to the              misunderstandings

and      to       extended    periods       of   disillusionment      with      the

procedures.



This     was compounded by the next stage of the                 process.       the

 transporting         of     people   on     double-decker     buses    to      the

 gymnasium         where the waiting continued.            In replying to       the

 question as to why many people waited outside the                     gymnasium

 in the cold Detective Chief Superintendent Addis stated:


               They didn't have to wait outside -
               they were asked to sit on the bus
               and wait until called, but they
               didn't do that. [107]




                                      276
Those    waiting on the buses claimed that there there was                   no

apparent        logic     or   rationale    to     the        sequence       of

identification.         Two people who had to wait at the gymnasium

have described their experience:



           We have to say that these two hours
           were disgraceful and that people —
           some old, some young - were left to
           fend for themselves and      shuffle
           about in damp, noisy, cold and dark
           conditions. [108]

A social worker at the gymnasium stated:


           There was this horrible period when
           people were simply being stacked
           outside in this yard. At times you
           felt like an apologist for what was
           going on ... . It was very difficult
           to bring a sense of purpose to what
           the proceedings were. [109]


The social worker, involved at the gymnasium throughout                     the

evening, stated that there was a number of changes to                     plans

during the evening and less information was forthcoming from

the     police    as    the hours passed.     He   stated:         "We d    ask

questions and we'd get stonewalled            [110].     During the early

stages     he    was    consulted by the police        over    a    range     of

matters but increasingly he and his colleagues felt excluded

 from    important decisions concerned with the care                and     help

 offered to the bereaved.        He stated:



            The point at which people were to be
            allowed into the room was exclusive
            to the police. [Ill]
 Clearly    there was equivocation over the plan to                deal     with



                                 277
the dead bodies and the procedure for identification.                              Early

in     th     afternoon '.nstructions were conveyed to the                       Medico-

Legal       Centre        concerning the imminent          arrival        of     bodies.

This        plan    was    verified      by     the    Deputy     Chief        Ambulance

Officer:


               It was agreed to start moving the
               bodies to the Medico-Legal Centre.
               I instructed 12 ambulances into the
               Directors'     car     park      (at
               Hillsborough)   ... my concern was
               for the staff and I briefed them as
               to what would happen.    They would
               set off at 15 minute intervals in
               batches of two with three bodies in
               each ambulance. We'd have done the
               job by 7pm ... but the Coroner
               intervened. [112]



Finally, there are questions concerning the co-ordination of

the social services input at Hillsborough and at the various

locations.           Appeals were made via the broadcast                   media     for

social workers to attend the ground or the hospitals.                              Teams

arrived        from areas outside Sheffield, including                     Liverpool,

but the initial work was done on an ad hoc basis by a                              range

of     people       who     helped with the           bereaved     and    distressed.

Local        social       workers   worked       alongside        voluntary       agency

workers,           the    clergy, nurses and others who              offered       their

services.           A social worker who went to the Northern                     General

found        himself moving bodies at             the mortuary.          He was      then

 advised       by the police to go to the ground and he was                         taken

 there        in an ambulance which was returning three bodies.                            A

 relatively              inexperienced        social    worker,     he     set      about

 establishing             arrangements and facilities for families.                    He


                                      278
reported       no co-ordination of the caring agencies'                      work and

no     direction from senior officers.              The Assistant Director

of Sheffield's Social Services visited the gymnasium but did

not adopt a decision-making role.                 Consequently the           workers

from     the     'caring         agencies', all    volunteers         on      the day

despite        their professional status, were under                  the    overall

co-ordination of the police.                 For some this relationship was

difficult        as   broad        decisions, with      which    they         did not

concur, were taken and the consequences on the bereaved were

difficult for the counsellors to defend.



Because the Director of Social Services stated publicly that

he considered the primary role of social workers to be                             that

of     supporting the police [113] and because                  social        workers

and     other     agencies involved reported             problems          with     this

position,        the Research Project requested an interview                       with

the     Director      or his senior colleagues.              Sheffield            Social

Services,        unlike all the other agencies, refused to                        comply

with     the     request until they liaised with                the    police        and

other     agencies involved and secured their agreement                           [114].

This response is unusual in that it appears to sacrifice the

professional          autonomy vested in the local authority                      agency

 and    allow other agencies to dictate its                  policy.         Further,

 the    Director       of    Social Services        stated      soon       after     the

 Disaster       that, "the lessons from the disaster would be                        put

 down     on paper" [115].              The decision was that a full              report

 on     the    events       of    the     forty-eight   hours     following          the
Disaster    would be compiled.      In March 1990, a   year    later,

this    report was not completed nor had the Sheffield         social

workers involved been interviewed [116].



There     are many issues to be considered in the wake        of   the

Hillsborough     Disaster.   An observation, made prior       to   the

Disaster, raises the issue of broader strategies:



           At the moment the U.K. seems to have
           no co-ordinated strategy for coping
           with major disasters.   Each health
           authority    works    under    broad
           guidelines, but very much on its own
           ... The picture is a very disjointed
           one with no central control. [117]


A   starting-point   would be to ensure that the basic        medical

facilities/resources including full emergency service cover,

should     be   compulsory at all organised sports     and     leisure

events.     Clearly there is required regular and      co-ordinated

working practices between the agencies as a foundation             upon

which       larger-scale     responses    can   be     built        and

institutionalised.      The Medics At Hillsborough Working Party

stated:



            A first step to ensuring an adequate
            emergency response in the event of a
            disaster is to have an effective
            system    with    clearly    defined
            responsibilities in place to cope
            with   more likely smaller     scale
            problems ... It is important to give
            consideration as to how a local
            domestic emergency response might be
            co-ordinated with a large      scale
            disaster response. [118]



                              280
Certainly        the issues of planning and co-ordination are        not

new.      Following the Bradford Fire Disaster SYMAS          attempted

to     take the initiative over the grounds in its          area.    Yet

its approaches were met with complacency and indifference by

the     Clubs.     Other agencies did not appear prepared for         the

Disaster     and the police priorities and decisions          dominated

the events through the night of the 15th April.             Mike Walsh,

in     his   work     on   disasters,   had   established    the     main

priorities when he stated the obvious:



             There must be adequate preparation
             and    planning    between   all the
             services involved, and the results
             of such work must be known to all
             grades    of staff.     Training and
             communication are the two words that
             matter here.    [119]


Yet     it   was precisely the lack of        planning,   training    and

communication between and within agencies which             contributed

to     the   deaths of ninety-five people        at   Hillsborough    and

added to the distress of the injured and the bereaved.

       CHAPTER SIX

THE DISASTER APPEAL FUND




              282
The   Appeal,        launched on the evening of the              Disaster,       was

sponsored by the City Councils of Sheffield, Nottingham                          and

Liverpool      Cl] and Liverpool Football Club.                  Each     sponsor

nominated      one Trustee and subsequently a Fund                 Manager       was

appointed.       Initially      the Trustees chose to set up              a     non-

charitable       'discretionary trust'.           The main advantage of            a

discretionary         trust     is that it provides greater             scope     to

assist    a wide range of people but a major drawback is                        that

all   investment income is liable to taxation.                    The    Trustees

have overcome         this problem by also setting-up a                 charitable

trust,    through which the tax paid on investment income                        can

be recovered from the discretionary trust.



The   Appeal now stands at approximately £11.6m                     illustrating

clearly        the     overwhelming       generosity       of     the      public.

While the Fund undoubtedly has helped a great many people                          a

number    of     problems have arisen over           the        distribution      of

awards.        It is important to consider these problems in                     the

hope that the experiences of the Hillsborough Family Support

Group will benefit the administration of future funds. Areas

of concern include: the effect of payments from the fund                          on

benefit      entitlement;        initial confusion over the              issue    of

 'means-testing';             apparent    disparities in the            amount    of

 money    paid       out   to families;     the    difficulties          faced    by

 families      in     receipt    of   payments      (i.e.       media    coverage;

 civil/corporate liability; further damages, etc.).
First,     is the issue of welfare entitlements.                 Questions          on

the     recovery    of benefit procedures         were        raised      at        an

early      stage        by     Frank   Field,   M.P.     in     the    House        of

Commons     [2].    Although no clear answers were given at                    this

stage, a few days- later a very clear response was given when

the     issue was raised again by Gerry Bermingham, M.P.                       in     a

question     to    Nicholas Scott (Under-Secretary of                  State        for

Social Services):



             ... let us have it straight for the
            record so that we know exactly where
            we   stand.    Will   the   Minister
            intervene again and confirm that
            there will be no claims for the
            recovery of benefit against money
            paid from the Hillsborough trust -
            whether or not it is a charitable
            trust?


Mr Scott replied:


            The    answer is an        unequivocal     yes.
            C3]

This     assurance, however, has not been borne out and it                          has

become     evident that there are a number of cases                    [4]     where

beneficiaries           of   the Disaster Fund, upon          disclosing        this

information        to        the Department of Social         Security       (DSS),

have lost their entitlement to income-related benefits                          [5].

Under the DSS rules a person loses entitlement to any Income

Support and Family Credit if her/his capital exceeds                         £6,000

 [6].     The     capital       cut off point for      Housing        Benefit        is

£8,000 [7].



                                       284
Average initial payments [8] from the fund have amounted                                  to

approximately            £35,000            for    the loss    of    a    child,         and

£25,000 for the loss of a "wage earner",                            plus an additional

payment       of between £20,000 and £35,000 placed in trust                              for

each       dependent        child [91- Consequently under                 the       present

regulations          anyone        in receipt of           income-related           benefit

loses entitlement once a payment of this kind has been                                   made

from the Fund.


The Prime Minister, in correspondence with Frank Field, made

the following comment in respect of income related                                 benefits

 [ 10] :

                     The existing rules already
               provide significant scope for the
               Fund   to   help   people   without
               affecting their benefits. [11]



 The situation, however, is certainly not so straightforward.

 The       Hillsborough Family Support Group, with the support                              of

 Frank       Field,       has been lobbying M.P.s to                  highlight,         among

 other       issues, the problem of loss of                    benefit        entitlement.

 Meetings          are     on-going          but    as   yet   no     changes       to     the

  regulations or 'exceptional circumstances' have been agreed.



  It       would    be     possible for the              Government      to    exempt      all

  Disaster Fund            payments from            the calculation           of   benefits.

  Recently         a number of              precedents have been set.              The   first

  concerned        h a e m o p h ilia c s    infected with the H.I.V. virus after
they had been treated with contaminated blood products.                 In

this case the DSS stated that there would be:



           ... full disregard of any payments
           made from this (i.e. the Macfarlane
           Special Payments) trust to H.I.V.
           infected haemophiliacs and    their
           families. [12]


Additionally,    in     the instance of the £40     increase     to    War

Widows' pens ions:



           The payment announced by Mr King is
           tax free, and with the agreement of
           the Social Services Secretary,    Mr
           Tony Newton, will not be counted
           when judging whether widows should
           receive poll-tax rebates,    housing
           benefit,  or other    income-related
           benefits.  [13]


These     two   cases    show   that   exemptions   to   the    existing

regulations are possible.         The Government, however has          made

its position clear on the issue of the H.I.V. sufferers in a
                                                    \

further     letter from the Prime Minister to Frank            Field     in

which Mrs Thatcher stated:


            While I have enormous sympathy for
            those who were injured or bereaved
            in   the Hillsborough     tragedy,the
            Government     could  not     justify
            treatment   on    the  same    wholly
            exceptional basis as applies       to
            payments made from the Macfarlane
            Trust. [14]



 The only comfort offered by the Prime Minister to the "small

 minority" who have lost benefit is that.


                                   286
              ... it    does mean that they no
              longer require the same degree of
              financial support from the public
              funds as before. [15]


In    other    words         the Government remains            content      with      the

proposition that the 'public pttrse' is protected by reducing

the     'burden'        of   welfare spending.              Rather     than      people

benefitting        in    real terms from the Disaster Fund                    they    are

obliged        instead        to    live     off     that    money,     donated        by

individuals        many        of    whom     made     personal       sacrifices       to

support the appeal [16].                  As one member of the          »iillsborou.sh

Family Support Group said:


              It is the people who are unemployed
              who need the money the most. [17]



Also,     there          is no indication as to             the   length of          time

covered       by   Disaster              Fund payments or a       point     at which

benefit       entitlement            could be reinstated [18].              This      has

increased the anxiety of those affected by this                           ruling. One

family     informed the DSS that                   they had received a          sum     of

money from the Fund                and    were asked to return their payment

book.      They     have had no further communication from the                        DSS.

The     family          has not felt able to distribute               the     Disaster

Fund     award     between          family members asthey fear              that      they

will lose their only                source of income.


              We are trying to keep as much back
              as possible at the moment,  because
              we need it to live on. [19]
Again this illustrates the uncertainty and vulnerability                   of

those    who have lost benefit entitlement.          There       should    be

guidance    available as to how long a payment is expected                 to

last,supported       by     information   as   to    how       the      money

'reasonably' may be spent or distributed.



Further, when a person eventually         makes a fresh claim there

is the added concern that some may lose their entitlement to

'transitional additions'       [20].    This could mean that in           the

long-term some people may lose financially because they have

received a payment from the Fund.



There is an argument here for greater involvement by welfare

rights     advisors when payments are being made,              rather     than

relying solely on DSS        officials to explain the regulations.

This     would   ensure that potential      problems       are    addressed

fully     and    advice   services could be     arranged         for     those

encountering       problems with the DSS.      The Trustees have           not

taken a position on this issue, seeing their role very                    much

in     terms of operating within the existing legal               framework.

They     have    taken some steps to minimise problems            with     the

DSS.     These    being: placing money in trust          for     dependents;

making 'capital' payments rather than income [21]; obtaining

a    "sympathetic response" [22] from the DSS in circumstances

where     the    named    beneficiary   decided     to    distribute       the

payment     among    members of the family; informing             those    who

have     received a payment in respect of an injury claim                 that
advice        is     available     for anybody who may          be    claiming      an

income-related benefit.


It     is     clear, however, that the current             situation           remains

very        unfair     because those on income related               benefits      are

penalised by losing their entitlement. Within this                            argument

the     Treasury       i nriirsr.tlv   becomes the beneficiary           of     public

money        which was donated on the understanding that it                      would

go     directly        to benefit those who suffered             most      from    the

Hillsborough Disaster.                 For these reasons pressure should be

kept        on the Government to ensure that the                regulations        are

changed,            once compensation has been agreed in                respect     of

civil        and     legal claims.        For it is a    problem        which     will

recur.


      further        problem encountered        by the Hillsborough             Family

Support        Group resulted from confusion concerning the                       issue

of 'means-testing'.              Although interim payments were made                 at

an     early        stage,      agents acting on behalf of           the      Trustees

visited        bereaved         families, part of their         brief      being     to

ascertain            "further     immediate need"       [23].        Families      were

 asked       questions relating to: employment                 status,     earnings,

 details           of any other income/assets [24].             No clear       reasons

were        given      at    the time as to     why     this     information        was

 required           or whether it would effect the final Disaster Fund

 assessment.            Although the Fund's Manager, Mike                Reddington,

 is     adamant that it was never the intention of the                        Trustees

 to 'means—test' families, he has commented that.
             I can understand confusion       over
             information — we . :uldn't be certain
             in our minds as to which aspects of
             information would be crucial. [25]


Whatever      the intention, however,    it is clear that         families

were upset by the- procedures.        As Barry Devonside (Secretary

of the Hillsborough Families Support Group) commented:



             Ninety-five people have died - they
             are equal in death. What has their
             occupation got to do with the Fund's
             managers? [26]


After    a    number of families had experienced        this      form    of

questioning the Hillsborough Family Support Group reached                  a

common agreement that they were not prepared to             participate

further in the procedure.          As a result of pressure from          the

Support Group      further attempts to 'means test' were dropped

[27] .



This problem is connected to a general confusion               concerning

the criteria applied by the Fund's administrators in                making

payments.      There is a feeling within the Support Group               that

claims       are   assessed   in    different   ways.      Even      though

representatives from the Group met with the Fund s                Manager,

Barry    Devonside     remains     of the opinion   that     there       were

 "major gaps" in the information they received.             He stated:



             Even with the obvious cases, there
             are people who got £35,000 and other
             people who got far less and nobody
             can get down to an answer on this.
             [28]
When asked about this, Mike Reddington was clear                            about

the position of the Trustees:


             We positively announced that    we
             never and will never say what our
             criteria-were. [29]


He    went        on       to explain that some     information         did     affect

payments but that it was noi based on the means of families.

Also he acknowledged that there were                     •'many judgements where

there    is no right answer", or many "Judgements of Solomon

[30].    The clearest indication of the policy adopted by                            the

Trustees          was that where there was equality of                 circumstance

without       msans-testing then there was equality of                       treatment

(i.e.    families            in the same 'category'        receive           the    same

treatment).




The     criteria applied to injury claims (of which there                           have

been     some          eight    hundred     to   date)    is    less        confusing,

depending primarily on the medical assessment of physical or

psychological               damage.    The assessment is         carried       out    by

 three 'independent' assessors, whose findings are passed                             on

 to     the Trustees.           They then make a judgement             of     "relative

 weighting"            and a "monetary value" is assessed [31].


 While       acknowledging            the   complexities        surrounding          the

 question          of      criteria, and the      need    for     confidentiality,

 there       is        a   genuine concern that      different         criteria      are

 applied to cases in which circumstances appear similar.                             The
only    avenue     open to people who request an                   explanation          of

their assessment or revision of their payment is to convince

the         Trustees       that        there      has      been          a       factual

misrepresentation:


              The   principles   have   not   been
              reviewed  ... we would review in a
              situation where the facts were wrong.
              [32]


The    difficulty here relates to                how the beneficiaries                know

whether       or not their payment has been                assessed           correctly.

Clearly this is not possible if they have no guidance as                                to

which facts influence the decision-making process.



The main issue turns on whether it is possible to achieve                                 a

better balance between the complexities and                        confidentiality

surrounding        individual         payments and a sensitivity                 to     the

needs       and feelings of the families who need assurance                            that

they        are being treated equally. It is a complex problem                           to

which there is no easy solution, but it would help                               families

to     be     given guidance by the Trustees on                  their        method     of

categorisation.                In     turn    this would      assist          people     to

decide on the need for a review of the payment received.



Finally,        there     is     clear       indication     that        families       have

suffered         'stigmatisation'            because      they         have      received

relatively        large        sums    of    money     from      the     fund.         This

situation was exacerbated by an Ian Hargreaves article                                 [33]

 in which he criticised relatives for initiating legal action
against     bodies such as the Sheffield Police Authority.            He

commented further:


                  With the Hillsborough appeal
            having already raised the best part
            of £9.3 million, and many of the
            victims ■having been young people
            without dependents, T can see not
            the slightest justification for such
            action.   ... the pursuit of money
            which cannot be genuinely needed
            adds up to nothing more or less than
            sheer greed. [34]


The     response    of the Hillsborough Family Support     Group      to

these statements was one of utter dismay.          Mc.ny letters from

the     families were published in reply to the       article     [35],

one of which stated:


             ... Ian Hargreaves'   remarks have
            hurt and upset me more than anything
            else I have read since the disaster.
            [36]


The     letters repeatedly made the point that the       reason     for

initiating       civil action was not for personal gain.        Rather

it    was   to     bring those responsible   for   the   Disaster     to

account, and to ensure that adequate safety improvements are

carried     out to prevent a similar occurrence. The fact           that

families have received awards from the Disaster Fund - money

which was donated voluntarily by the public - should have no

bearing     whatsoever on an individual s right to take         out    a

 compensation claim [37].



 From     talking    to families, it has become evident     that      far



                                  293
from people acting out of self-interest, there is instead                               a

marked reluctance to spend the Disaster Fund awards for fear

of public criticism.            As one member of the Support Group has

said, "You're scared of what people are going to be                         saying'

[38].          Some    families    feel     they      have    become         'public

property'        and    somehow are expected to be            accountable             for

the way in which they choose to spend the money.                       Donations

were    made to alleviate distress yet people suffer from                             the

fear of public scrutiny or rebuke.



The     time     will come when the business of the Fund                   will        be

wound     up.         In Mike Reddington's opinion,           this     will       take

place between eighteen months and two years after the Fund s

inception [39].           The Trustees published their first                 interim

report     in     April 1990.      An article in        the    Liverp.ao.1— Efihfi

dated 10th April 1990, states that a total of £10m has                            been

paid     from the Fund to the bereaved and injured.                    A     further

£1.5m has been put aside to deal with one-hundred and eighty

outstanding           claims   and any further claims which                are    made

before the June 'deadline'.               Once, however, the direct needs

of     the bereaved and injured have been met fully, it may                            be

the     case     that     a    'residual sum'      will      remain.        If    this

situation        does arise, the Trustees will be faced                    with       the

decision        as     how best to dispose of this money, bearing                      in

mind     the 'spirit' in which it was given and the                    wishes          of

the     bereaved        and    injured.    In this situation,          there is a

need     for      the Trustees to lay down clear guidelines                      as    to

what     use      'residual      money'    may   be    put     in    the     future.
Hopefully,        this would      minimise   any ill-feeling over          its

distribution.



The Disaster Fund represents a very positive contribution to

the     aftermath     of Hillsborough. It has shown        clearly        the

extent to which people wanted to offer practical assistance.

Just     as the achievements of the Fund should be              recognised,

so should every effort be made to overcome the                 difficulties

which       have arisen.     Mike Reddington has      acknowledged        that

those       involved with the management of the Hillsborugh               Fund

have     benefited       greatly from the    experiences       of   previous

disaster       funds, particularly Bradford and          Zeebrugge        [40].

It     is    important     that   this   expertise    continues      to      be

developed       and   that    the views of the       Support    Groups      are

represented       fully in the discussions concerning the             future

organisation of such funds.

        case' when several national n ew spapers offered blood money to relatives and
        friends of the mass m ur derer Peter S ut cliffe (the 'Yorkshire Ripper'), The Press
        Council conducted an inquiry at the time which o cc upied one of its complaints
        committees for two years, It produced a report 'Press Conduct in the Sutcliffe
        Case' which c en sured seven n ew spapers for bre ak i ng the D ec laration of Principle

 61      In April/May 1989 sales of the Sun. in the M er seyside region d ropped by 50* as a
         result of the boycott, The boycott campaign was a spontaneous occurance
         initiated by o ut ra g ed individuals who arranged a public meeting in Kirkby town
         centre on the 19th April, Local councillors and r epresentatives from campaign
         groups assisted in org an i si ng the demonstration, w here people p ub li c ly burnt
         copies of the Sun. A p et ition was s tarted a nd n ew sagents were asked not to stock
         the Sun. and the Daily S t a r . Many newsagents had voluntarily r emoved the papers
         from display to prevent causing offence, Liverpool Trades Council published
         leaflets about the boycott and resolutions were passed by local trade unions and
         community groups, The latest figures for sales of the Sun. and Daily Star, show;

CHAPTER SI.X,.
1,      Liverpool City Council was acting as the representative of all District Councils
         on Merseyside

2,      Hansard, col, 802, 25 April 1989,
3       Question raised by Serry Bermingham, M.P, (St, Helens South)during the report
         stage on the Social Security Bill, reported in Hansard, col, 1040, 26 April
         1989, Also reported in the Suardian. 27 April 1989, p, 7, and the Financial
         Tines. 27 April 1989, p, 14,
 4      The cases of two families have been highlighted by Frank Field, M,P,in the
         gnndsv Times. 19 November 1989, and in a letter to the Prime Minister 7 November
         1989, We have also been in contact with various advice centres in Merseyside
         and whilst they are unable, due to confidentiality, to give us any detailed
         information, it is clear there are a number of other cases in the area, One
         member of the Hillsborough Family Support Sroup who lost his son at
         Hillsborough, and who himself has not been able to return to work since the
         Oisaster, lost his entitlement to income-related benefits upon receiving a
          payment from the fund, (personal interview, member of Hillsborough Family
          Support 6roup),
 5,      Income-related benefits include Income Support, Family Credit and Housing
          Benefit,
  6,     Capital cut off for Income Support and Family Credit was £6,000, From April
          1990, thisfigure was increased to £8,000, Capital under£3,000 is ignored then
          £1 for every £250 above first £3,000 is counted as income set against benefit,

  7,      From April 1990, this figure was increased to £16,000,

  8       At the end of March 1990, a second smaller award was madeby the Oisaster Fund
           to bereaved families. Although we do not know at the present time, if all the
           families received a second award, we are assuming that this is the case,

    9    Qnnriay Times 19 November 1989, article by Frank Field, M.P. (Birkenhead)
          entitled "Hillsborough Families 'robbed' of compensation"; Payments which have
          been placed in trust are ignored for 2 years, or in the case of a child for as
           long as s/he is a dependent,
10,     This was in response to question nised by Frank Field, M.P, (HansJLLl, Col 802,
        25 April 1989),
11, Letter dated 11 May 1989, fromPrime Minister to Frank Field, M.P,

12, This ruling applies to Housing Benefit (General; Regs, 1987 andthe Housing
     Benefit (Community Charge Rebates) Scotland Regs, 1988, Regulations relating to
     Income Support and Family Credit will similarly be amended as will the Community
     Charge Benefit Regs, 1989, which largely come into effect on 1 April 1990
     (HB/CCB(89)25),

U,      Letter from Prime Minister to Frank Field, M.P.

15, Ibid,
16,     Frank Field has received correspondence from a large number of people expressing
        their horror at thethought of their contributions resulting inthe
        disqualification ofthe families from benefit entitlement, One unemployed man
        in Liverpool donals- £20 from his weekly benefit to the Fund and was
        understandably “distraught" at this situation, (letter to Prime Minister from
        Frank Field, M.P,, 7 November 1989),

20,     Transitional additions were introduced under 1986 Social Security Act to help
        those who lost money in the switch from Supplementary Benefit to Income Support,
        If sombody subsequently comes off Income Support, and has to re-claim at a later
        date, there is the possibility that this transitional protection will be lost,

 21,     Capital is treated differently from income, It is added together and will not
         effect benefit entitlement in any way up to £3,000 (CPA6 National Welfare
         Benefits Handbook, 1989/90, pp, 44-48)

36,    Ibid,
37     The families are currently involved in a number of compensation claims, These
       include; a claim in respect of the pain and suffering the victims of the
       Oisaster underwent whilst they were dying, These claims have been submitted to
       the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company, which acts as the insurers of the South
       Yorkshire Police, Once compensation is agreed the South Yorkshire Police will
       be taking action against Sheffield City Council; Sheffield Wednesday Football
       Club and Eastwood and Partners, to ensure that liability is apportioned,

       A further claim has been submitted under the Administration of Justice flLt
       (1982), This is in respect of those who died, who were under 18 years of age,
       for which the defined statutory award is £3,500, The parents of those who died
       who were over 18 years of age with no dependents, receive nothing, The rules on
       loss of a wage-earner are more complex,
       Finally, solicitors acting on behalf of some families have submitted claims in
       respect'of post-traumatic disorder against the South Yorkshire Police and
       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, In this instance no statutory awards are
       laid down, therefore awards are negotiable,

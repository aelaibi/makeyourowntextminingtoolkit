   I am writing further to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s letter to you of 12 December, which
   concerned alterations to statements or ‘recollections’ written South Yorkshire police officers
^jpfiter the Hillsborough disaster, and the part which your firm played in these.

   2.      You told me over the telephone before Christmas that you planned to consult Counsel
   about a reply to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s letter. He has asked me to ensure that you have
   the opportunity, before you do that, to see the attached letter from Detective Chief
   Superintendent Foster of the West Midlands Police.

   3.     I am sure you will recall that Mr Foster was the officer who was in day-to-day charge
   of the West Midlands investigation of the disaster. We sent him some examples of changed
   statements or recollections’ by South Yorkshire officers and asked for his comments on
   them.

   4.      I think it is fair to say that Mr Foster does not seem too greatly concerned about most
   of the changes which we pointed out to him. But you will see from his comments that this is
   not altogether so in all cases. It may be that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will wish to amend
   the relevant section of his report to take account of Mr Foster’s comments, and he would like
   to know of any views you might have on them before he does so.

  5.     In order to help (but I hope without overburdening you with paper) I am also
  enclosing copies of the relevant parts of the statements which Mr Foster is talking about. It
  might be useful for me to go through these one by one. For Powell. I attach the first four
  pages of his recollections in their original version, with the deleted part of pages 3 and 4
  marked in pink. There is also the relevant pages of the final version of his statement.

  6.      For Ramsden, I enclose pages 6 and 7, and 10 and 11 of the original version of his
  recollections, covering the parts of it Mr Foster mentions. Deletions are marked in pink.
  There is also a copy of page 6 of the revised version (but I have not included the amended
  version of pages 10 and 11, which would not add anything to what you know).

   7.        I have not included any statements by Huckstep as Mr Foster says the West Midlands

   G: |H IL L S B O R |M A IN \ M E TC A LF E .2 2 7
police investigators had access to both versions of his material.    For Woodcock I attach
page 5 of his original - deletions shown in pink. For Groome and White I attach the original
versions of their statements, with the changes Mr Foster iff'talking about marked in pink.

8.       If you would like parts of these statements which I have not included, or any further
clarification, please let me know. We look forward to hearing from you.

  The Hillsborough Scrutiny

    I have now considered the documentation forwarded to me on 3 December 1997 (Audit trail and
    examination by Superintendent Hepworth) and I have researched the statements forwarded on
    12 December 1997.

    In order to respond to you I have spoken by telephone to Mr J M Jones (retired Chief Constable
    of Cheshire) and sought his view and assistance on the process agreed for the early part of the
    Hillsborough Investigation.

    It might be easier if I try to put this response into numbered format as follows:

    1.     There was agreement shared by South Yorkshire Police (SYP), West Midlands Police and
           by Treasury Solicitors acting for Lord Justice Taylor (Mr Collins QC) that the recollections
           forwarded to the Judicial Inquiry by South Yorkshire Police via West Midlands Police
           would be the 'final versions'. It was accepted that Counsel representing SYP would advise
           the Force on the removal of expression of opinions to keep statements factual.

    2.     It needs to be understood that at this time West Midlands Police were serving Lord Justice
           Taylor and ALL such agreements would only have been entered into after consultation with
           Treasury Solicitors and particularly Mr Whalley who served Lord Justice Taylor.

    3.      West Midlands Police accepted that those same statements would be used for the basis of
            any other investigations (eg Coroner / DPP or Complaints).

                                                                                                  Cont./..
4.    One primary reason for adopting this process was the constraint on time to obtain the
      necessary evidence for the set date to start the Judicial Inquiry proceedings. It would have
      been too cumbersome to use West Midlands Police Officers to take statements from SYP
      officers in those early stages.

5.    Later in the investigation (Coroners and DPP) further statements were taken in the
      traditional way and you will find them usually with a letter prefix, eg first recollection
      SI234, further statement re body identification S1234A, third one S1234B etc.

6.    West Midlands Police were not party to the Vetting' of the SYP statements but would have
      expected all factual evidence to be retained in the final version. We did not to my
      knowledge dip check or sample to ensure this was the case.

n xi, The Policy File entered onto HOLMES is, I understand from SYP, no longer viewable and
      as such I am unable to check any of my policy decisions in this area.

ttjk It is possible West Midlands Incident Room on occasions received both the original and
^    vetted copies of statements. Indeed my check in respect of PC Brian Huckstep shows we
     received both and they have been retrieved off the HOLMES system as S863 and S863A.

Moving on to the sample statements forwarded to me, I have examined them using the following
process. You forwarded to me two sets of statements / recollections for comparison. As a check,
I have searched the HOLMES system and had sent to me those officers statements. Clearly two
of them match, but the third should not. Using two other officers, I have 'proof read' them and
identified the changes made. I have then read and considered the content of those original
recollections and the 'extra' material. My observations are as follows:

1.    Powell, Raymond Lloyd

      Page 3, Line 23 "The first thing" to Page 4, Line 1 and Cordon.

      I would have expected this to be left in especially where it refers to previous games and the
      forming of the cordon.

      Comment: This was investigated and I recall the issue of policing in previous games being
      pursued, particularly in the questioning of Senior SYP officers.

2.    Ramsden, Alan Andrew

(a)   Page 6, Line 26 to end of page (Coventry City).

      Similar to above. I would have expected this to be left in.

      Comment: As for 1. above.
                                                  3

(b)   Page 10, last paragraph and to end of Page 11.

      This is perhaps opinion on the part of the officer.

      Comment: The investigation teams asked these same questions.

      NOTE: In the statement of PC Ramsden on Page 6, the final sentence was removed from
      the original recollection, ie "I also felt" until "Coventry City". It also appears to me that the
      removal of this totally changes the next sentence which clearly refers to 1987 in the original
      recollection, but the edited version would refer the reader to 1989!

3.    Huckstep, Brian Robert

      Comment: We had both statements.
aiu
4.    Woodcock, John Howard

      Page 5, Line 9 to end of page.

      I can understand this being seen as opinion and hearsay, but of course it may have been
      valuable to the Investigation team in respect of Inspector White and his observation if that
      were not already known. I question t h e objectivity here of the person vetting. In fairness,
      a legal representative would not look at this as I would.

      Comment: The issues raised were all considered during the investigation.

5.    Groome, Maxwell Deryck Charles

(a)   Page 2, Line 6, starting "This was" to Line 10 ending in "waste"; and Page 2, Line 24 to
      Line 26, starting "An Officer" and ending "ground".

      This is opinion.

      Comment: Not issues of importance to the investigating team.

(b)   Page 4, Lines 8 and 9 "The control room" ending "paralysis".

      I see no reason to take this out; it may have been a factor.

      Comment: All activity of the Control Room was investigated.

(c)    Page 5, First full paragraph.

       Such identification issues could have been important in establishing who was where. It
       should have remained in.

                                                                                                Cont./..
      Comment: The investigation teams examined the movement and actions of all senior
      officers and this would not have caused a problem by being taken out.

(d)   Page 5, Line 16 (1) to Page 6, Line 1, ending "pressure".

      If correct, such specific information on policing arrangements could have been crucial in
      examining 1989 against other matches.

      Comment: This was in any event done by the investigation team and the editing out is not
      a cause for concern.

(e)   Page 6 - all of Paragraph numbered (5).

      This could be opinion, but if de-briefs recorded these facts such information was useful.
an

      Comment: Such aspects were in any event looked at and examined by the investigation
      team.

(f)   Page 6, Paragraph 6, last line taken out.

      I would have said this was important as it deals with supervision, control and safety in one
      paragraph but removes the fact it did not happen in 1989.

      Comment: All aspects in relation to the command duties and activities of Chief
      Superintendent Duckenfield were examined thoroughly.

(g)   Pages 6 and 7, Paragraphs (7), (8), (9) and (10).

      This is opinion and I can understand it being removed if the purpose is to produce a factual
      account only.

      Comment: I can say all these issues raised were considered and looked at by the
      Investigating team.

6.    White, Harry

(a)   Page 1 - 10 am "Short and sharp" removed.

      I can see no reason to remove this.

      Comment: We looked and examined all aspects of all of the briefings for the match so this
      removal made no difference.

(b)   Page marked Additional Points Arising, and to end of Page 2, same paper.


                                                                                           Cont./..
                                                  5

       Some of this is opinion and some thought provoking, but some may have been valuable
       eg second paragraph "During etc" and referring to the tunnel and control of crowd.

       Comment: The issues raised here were all examined by the Investigation Team.

 Conclusion

 Although the West Midlands Investigation Team did not have access to the majority of original
 Z      k    ’ fU confident not only from examining these sample statements, but from the
 thoroughness of the investigation, that this has not had any bearing on the evidence gathered and
 presented to the Coroner, the DPP or the Police Complaints Authority.

 On reflection, it seems to me the original Vetting' was focused on producing factual statements
 although from the examples sent, the omissions generally centre on police officers and their
 actions or lack of action. I imagine this was based upon Counsel for SYP representing the best
 interests of the Force and individuals.

As far as the Investigating Team were concerned, the objective of the Investigation was to seek
the truth about how the disaster happened. Few officers have experienced such investigations
but ALL relevant information can be of value, whether it is factual or opinion and much depends
on the direction given by the Senior Officers to determine the content of statements. It is exactly
tor this reason that the questionnaire was designed to offer, at Questions 53 and 54, the chance
to give views, observations and opinions.

I hope this has answered the main points for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. If I can be of further
assistance, 1 can be contacted until 23 December on \              ] However, from that date
our office closes administratively until 5 January 1998. My home number is                 I or

At abo u t        12 m i d d a y      as    we a p p r o a c h e d       the    junction              of M i d d l e w o o d        Road

and W a d s l e y       Lane,        our a t t e n t i o n       was     caught        by P o l i c e        Sergeant              1948

Miller      who        was     on m o b i l e       Transit       pat r o l .         He    stated          that     one       of       the

pubs    situated              further       up W a d s l e y      Lane       was      full       to    capacity           and       that

there     was a          large       number         of    people       outside         on       the    frontage           and       road

drinking          beer.         He    appeared            concerned          t ha t    they may             get     out       of    hand.

Also     s i t u a t e d at        this     j u n c t i o n are        a number            of    shops       where        a    large

number      of L i v e r p o o l        supporters              had    gathered            for    what       can     only          be

d e s c r i b e d as a d r i n k i n g          session.              There     were        numerous             cans     of       beer

and    lager       b e ing      and     had     b een      consumed.            I continued                 to w a l k        along

Middlewood Road and                     into        the    shopping          c e ntre.           Whilst          walking           along

this     road      I again           saw      large       groups         of y o u t h s         drinking          from        cans of

beer     an d     lager. T h o s e         t h at         I did        not     see     drinking             I could           h e a r pass

comments          as     to    "Where       is the         nearest         public          house?”

Once     TDC O ' B r i e n a n d           myself         had     patrolled           the       precinct,           we    decided             to

visit      Parkside            Section        House        via     the     park       grounds.              At    about

1.00     p.m.      -     1.15        p.m. w h i l s t     walking         along       Parkside            Road,          I was

approached             every         five y a r d s       by a L i v e r p o o l           supporter          asking           for a

ticket.           On     eventually           reaching            Parkside          Section           House,        I saw a

large      numb e r       of y o u t h s      standing            behind       the S e c t i o n         House       and        around

vehicles           in the          parking      bay       situated         adjacent             to    the S e c t i o n         House,

the m a j o r i t y       of w h o m w e r e         drunk        and were           subsequently                removed.               Again

by the a c c e n t            I believe         t h e se    to     be L i v e r pool            supporters.

I recall           that       whilst       inside         the     box/Section              House        I heard           footsteps

 on the          roof.        On     inspecting           t his       I saw about            four       youths       to        be

 standing           on top          of    the P o l i c e        Station           Station          drinking           cans      of    beer/

 lager.          Needless            to    say,        I took       prompt          and     necessary              action        and

 rem o v e d     the y o u t h s          w ho    were       again       from       Liverpool.                Whilst        engaged             in

 this     I saw one y o u t h                emerge          from       the     rear      of      the    building           holding             a

 can of        lager         in one        hand and           holding           his      exposed         person        in     the      other,

 int e n d i n g     to w a l k          along     the       road       in t h i s       manner.           This      youth        was

spoken         to a n d a d v i s e d            accordingly.

TDC     O'Brien and myself                        thought          it    best       to    inform         ground        control             of

the     situation              at    the S e c t i o n        House,          so    t hat       further        attention              could

be     paid to           it.

We w e r e      some         fifteen        minutes           at    the       box     before          resuming         patrol          in

Middlewood               Road.

At     2.15     p.m.         TDC     O'Brien           and myself             returned           to     the    Police        area          at

erf route           we w e r e       again approached                    by     dozens          of L i v e r p o o l     fans         looking

At a b o u t        2.45       p.m.       I resumed           patrol          together           with      TDC     O ’B r i e n     and

              9.40      a.m.        At    this       time        there     appeared          to     be       very    little       activity

    made       our    way        along        Middlewood            Road        in t he         direction             of    the      hospital.

    When       nearing           the       Texaco        petrol      station              we    decided          to    walk         back       in    the

    opposite           direction              towards           Hillsborough               shopping             centre.

    At    about        12 m i d d a y         as    we     approached               the    junction             of    Middlewood               Road

    and       Wadsley           Lane,        our    attention            was        caught       by P o l i c e         Sergeant            1948

    Miller       who        was       on m o b i l e       Transit            patrol.           He    stated          that     one        of    the

    pubs       situated              further        up W a d s l e y       Lane       was       full       to     capacity           and       t ha t

    there       was     a       l a rge      number        of     people        outside          on    the        frontage           and       road

    drinking            beer.             He a p p e a r e d      concerned           that       they m a y           get     out      of      hand.

    Also       situated              at    thi s     junction         are       a    number           of    shops w h e r e            ala rge

    number          of L i v e r p o o l         supporters           had       gathered              for       w h a t can    only       be

♦described               as      a     drinking           session.             There       were        numerous            c an s    of     beer

    and       l a ger    being             and   had      been      consumed.                  1 continued            to      walk       along

    Middlewood               Road          and     into     the     shopping          centre.              Whilst          walking          along

    this       road       I again             saw     l a r ge     groups       of    youths           drinking            from        cans      of

    bee r a n d         lager.              Those        t h at    I did       not        see    drinking             I could          hear         pass

     comments           as       to       "Where      is the        nearest           public         house?"
                                                                           nat r o l l e d       the       precinct,           we      decided          to
     Once      TDC      O'Brien             and myself             had     patroliea

     visit       Parkside                 Section        House      via       the     park       grounds.

     , .00      p.m.        -    -1.15 p.m.           whilst        walking           along           Parkside             Road.       Iw a s

     approached                 every        five     yards        by a L i v e r p o o l             supporter            asking          fo r a

     tic k e t .        On       eventually               reaching         Parkside             Section           House.       I saw a

     large          number           of    youths         standing            behind       the       Section          House         and     around

     vehicles            in      the        parking        bay      situated          adjacent             to     the      Section          House,

     the       majority               of    whom were             drunk       and    were       subsequently                  removed.              Again

     by       the     accent           I believe            these        to    be    Liverpool              supporters.

         I recall        that whilst                 inside         the       boK/Section              House          I heard          footsteps

         on   the     roof.            On     inspecting            t his      I saw           about       four       youths        to     be

lager.   Needless to say, I took prompt and necessary action and

removed the youths who were again from Liverpool.    Whilst engaged in

this I saw one youth emerge from the rear of the building holding a

can of lager in one hand and holding his exposed person in the other,

intending to walk along the road in this manner.    This youth was

spoken to and advised accordingly.

TDC O'Brien and myself thought It best to inf on. ground control of

the situation at the Section House, so that further attention could


be paid to it.

We .ere some fifteen minutes at the box before resuming patrol in


Middlewood Road.

At 2.15 p-m. TDC O ’Brien and myself returned to the Police area at

 the rear of the North Stand via the Penistone Road entrance.      Whilst

 en route «e were again approached b, dozens of Liverpool fans looking

 for tickets.    On arriving at the gym I mealed.

 At about 2.U5 p.m. I resumed patrol together with TDC O ’Brien and

 together with Police Constables Hiles and Moulding «e made our «ay

 along Penistone Road into Vere Road and into Leppings Lane.      This was

  the first and only time during the day that I visited this side of

  the ground and to be honest, I .as taken back by the sight.      The

  crowd appeared to be solid from the turnstiles 1 - 1 6 , to near the

  centre of Leppings Lane.

  It did not however cross my mind that people may be injured

 We    escorted          him     over      to      PC    Rose        and       PC       Morton      and       they      t o o k over.           I

 believe       they m a n a g e d          to      get h i m        into       the       gro und.

 T h ere     seemed a general                    complaint            from       Liverpool             supporters              of     the

 size       of the       cro w d s     gathering              and     the       slowness           in b e i n g         dealt       with

 entering          at    the     turnstiles.

 One    middle          aged     Liverpool            supporter                came      up    to me        and     mentioned           in

 relation          to    th^crowd              gathering            that       they        had     the      same        attendance

 e v e r y week         ^/Liverpool                and manage             much          better.          In       reply       to    this      I

 pointed       out       that      they        d o n ’t a r r i v e       all       at    the      s am e     time.

 The    y          now a b o u t       H.50        pm. I was             surprised            to    see       a    largea mo un t          of

 s^j^Vters              c 1 imbing'"ont"o the w all                      above          the    turnstiles.                I mentioned

Othis       to PC       Cammock,          and also            t hat      they        seemed        to w a i t        several          seconds

 before       jumping          off        the wall           into     the       ground.

 A Police          Officer         I believe             an    Inspector                 then a p pe ar ed           on   the        wal l      the

 climbing          ceased        but       he was        lifting           s m all        children          from        the        developing

 c r ush to        safety.

 Again myself              a n d PC        Carnmock w e n t           to       g ive      what      assistance            we        could,

We     escorted        him        over    to     PC     Rose       and     PC M o r t o n        and    they    took        over.

I believe         they       managed            to    g et     him    i n to     the       ground.

There      seemed          a general            complaint            from       Liverpool             supporters           of    the

s iz e    of    the    crowds           gathering            and     the    slowness             in    being    dealt           with

entering         at    the        turnstiles.

On e     middle       aged        Liverpool           supporter            came       up    to    me    a nd   mentioned             in

relation         to    the        crowd    gathering               th at    t he y     had       the    same    attendance

every      week       at    Liverpool            an d    manage          much       better.            In    reply     to       this       I

pointed         out    that        they     don't        arrive           all    at    the       same       time.

The      time    now       about        2.50     pm.         I was        surprised          to       see    a large        amount

of      supporters          climbing            onto     the       wall      above         the    turnstiles.               I

mentioned         this        to    PC    Cammock,             and    also       that       they       seemed        to w a i t

several         seconds           before        jumping         off       the    wall       into       the     ground.

A Police         Officer           I believe            an     Inspector            then     appeared           on    the       w al l ,

the      climbing           ceased       but     he     w as    lifting           small      children           from       the

developing             crush       to     safety.

Again      myself           and    PC     Cammock           went     to    g iv e     what       assistance           we    could,

and      I myself           could        feel    the        force     of     the      crowd       and       I withdrew

further         back        towards        the       road.

I seemed          to    recollect              earlier         hearing          a radio          message        requesting

Public          transport           to    be    stopped            from     travelling            along        Leppings           Lane

 bu t    I saw        the    buses        were       still         moving       through          the     crowd,        forcing

 them      over       towards        the       turnstiles            in     the      bottleneck             area     outside

 Leppings         Lane.

 On      this    occasion           we    kept        the    crowds         back       outside          th e   metal        railings
                             I Q O O P O O O W                        -         o S ity .n J A .                                                 R3Z

  instead          of    moving           people        away,             getting           lots       of    abuse          in    the     process.

  I never          actually              went     into       the          ground          until        we    were       all       called         in     f or

 de-briefing                 in    the      North       Stand.              I w a s n ’t a l l o c a t e d              a    body       to    deal

 with        outside             the     ground.            I d i d n ’t k n o w              the      full       extent          of    what       had

  Happened          until          I saw         the    news          on    TV       .later       that       night.              I felt       so

 helpless,              in       that     I ’d    been       there          and          d i d n ’t f e e l       as    though          I'd      done

 enough        to       help.            I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r             seeing           any     Club         Stewards          on    my

 arrival           at    the       ground.

  i remember             thinking              when     moving             fans      away         from       the       scene          that    we      had

 to     be    very       careful           and        diplomatic                as   one         slight          incident             could      have

 sparked           off       a    riot,        which        we    w o u l d n ’t h a v e            been         able       to    h a n d 1e .

 I saw        Inspector                Harry      White          at       the     de-brief.                 He    told       me       that    his

 serial        usually             got      the       job    of       putting             the     crowd          in    the       different            pens

 at     the    rear          of    the      goal       mouth,             working           from       the       outside          to    the

  centre,          but       for       some      reason          h e ’d     been          told      to      let       the    fans       find       their

 own     level,          on       this      occasion,                resulting              in    too       many       going          into    t he

 area        immediately                 behind        the       goal.            I could           teil         he    was       really

 distressed              by       what      had       happened.

 The     personal                radios        I could           hear       were          going        non-stop.                 If    I ’d   had       one

  I w o u l d n ’t h a v e             been      able       to       get    on       air,        but     then         again       I wouldn            C

 have        had    anything              to     say.

 What        caused          this        incident?               1    can't          really         say,         too    many

  circumstances                   a ll    happening              at       the     same        time,         at    the       wrong       time       and

  place.           How       many        would        have       died       outside              had     the      gate       not       been      openeu?

  Who    knows,          it       may     have        been       more       than           died     inside            the    ground.

  Perhaps          fans          without         tickets             should          have        been       segregated                from    those

  with       tickets             before        they     got          anywhere              near     the      ground.              If    only       it

  had    gone       so       smoothly            as    19 8 8 .           It's       a     day    I'll       never          forget!

             Forest     at    the       Hillsborough          football           ground,       Sheffield.

             I am a     supporter             of   Liverpool        F.C.        I have      been a     fan all          my    l ife    and

        that       I could              only       see         the      heads         in     front         of   me.           I couldn't                    turn

        around          or    even           move       my      hands          afiout.            I could            still        breath            but       it w a s

        becoming             more        difficult.

        I would          also           like       to      say         that      at     this         point          I could           see       several

        mounted          P o l i c e m a n at             the          side      of     the       gate      that        was       eventually                  opened,

        they       did       not        appear          to      be      assisting               in    the       control           of       the      crowd          at    all.

        Also       at    this           t ime      some         of      the      people          within          t he      crowd           we re        s ens i ng

        that       a serious                 problem was                 developing                  and    started             to        try    to         extract

        themselves                from        it    and         return           into        LEPPINGS           LN      but       they          couldn't            move

        an       inch.

        Whilst          I was           in    still            in the          crowd,           I could          see         people            climbing            over

        the       wall       into        the       ground.

        Suddenly             the        crowd        just         serged            forwards              carrying            everyone               including

        myself          with       it.          As .we m o v e d               forward            the      pace       quickened,                 there         was

        just       a sea          of     people           moving             forwards             p ast     th e      turnstiles                 and         threw       a

        gate       on    the       right           hand         sid e .

        Once       threw          the        gate,         I could             see      the       tunnel         entrance                 under         the    West

        Stand.          At    this           time       I thought                the       layout          of   the        ground           had         been

        changed          and       there           must         be      turnstiles                further            on.        As        I moved            closer

        to       the    tunnel           I could               see      the      other          end and         onto         the          pitch.             I could

to    go    threw           a large             gate         on     the      left         hand       side        which           1    knew        led     to

P o n S a ,an<i         7   .        I knew            this       from       my     previous               visits           to       the    ground.

There       was        no w a y           I could            get       myself          out      of       the     crowd           I was         just       being

taken       along           and       i nto       the        tunnel          still         all       the       time         the       p ac e      was

getting           faster             and      faster.

Once       inside           the       tunnel             1    was       lifted         off          my     feet       c ompletely after

about       the         first             c o u p l e of      metres,             I could            hear        screams             and       shouts          but

couldn't              understand                what         was       being         said.

Just       as     I neared                the      end       of     the      tunnel                 Iwas    spun around                    and     carried

along       backwards                 ou t        of    the        tunnel           and    onto          the     terraces.                   I have

looked           at     a       plan       and         it w a s        Pen    4 t hat           I was          carried               into, s t i l l

backwards               with          my     feet            off       the    ground.               I went        for          several metres

onto       the        terracing                 before           I stopped             up a g a i n s t          a     barrier.                I was       then

able       to     put       my        feet        onto        the       ground.            While           I was           being           carried        along

my      f e et    were          about           six      inches           off       the    floor.

 When       I hit           the       barrier            it         was      just         the       end     of       it     and 1 was             then

 turned          side        ways,           so    t ha t           I was         now      facing           Pens          5,     6   and     7.       I h a d no

 control          over           my       movements               at    all.

 I would          estimate                 that        from        the       tunnel            entrance           to       where           I stopped           on

 t he      terraces              took        only        five          seconds.                At    t his       stage           I saw         Alan       JONES

 along          side        of    me       to     my     right          which          meant         that        he    would           have       normally

 been       in        front          of    me.          He       was    facing          the         correct           way.

 At     t hi s        point          I came        to        a      stop.            I could             not     move          at a ll,        therewere

moved           away          in    the        cro wd,        I don't          know        what        happened            to     him,         I have

 not       seen          him       again.          I would              describe           him        as    follows.              White           m a le,       19-

 SOyrs,             6'0       tall,       stocky          bui l d ,       fat        faced       with           a moustache*

 Behind             me     jammed          up    against            the        barrier          still           facing        backwards,                 was

 another              m an*         I would           describe            him        as    follows,              White       male,           40     to 5 0

 years,             5*10       tall,           medium         build*            I think           he w a s        wearing            a suit           type

 jacket             and       open        necked        shirt.

 This           m an was           being        bent      over          th e    crush           barrier           backwards*                 He     was

 facing             up     into          the    West      Stand.               The     way       he    was        bent       it   appeared               to me

 that           his      back        must        have      been          broken,           it    is    just           impossible               to   get

  into          that       position             without             seriously              injuring              yourself*              He      first

 went           grey       and       then        blue      in       the    fac e ,         he w a s         like       that       for      a    couple           of

  minutes*                 During          this       time          I managed              to    turn around                 fully         and      face

  the          correct             way    so     I was         adjacent           to       the    barrier              and      this       m an.          I let

  go       of       Alan       and       tried       to    push          this    man        back           up    straight            but       I couldn't

  and          by    this          time    he     was         coughing          and        choking              and    died.          I was          then

  pushed             forwards             myself          and       had    to        let    go    of        him*       The      people          all       round

  me       told          me    to    leave        him         as    he    was        gone.            I believe            he     then went               o ver

    the        barrier             and    onto       the       floor*

 We    were        still        being          pushed          forwards          and       I could              now    f eel      people         on

 the     floor           under       my       feet,       the       crowd       were        just       walking           all      o ver     them

 there        about           3 of       them,        I    could          not    describe              any       of    them.

 - have           seen        the    Liverpool             Echo       and       there        was       a    picture          in      it of       the

 man      that          died    next          to ms,       his       name       is    Henry           BURKE.

 Eventually               we    moved          down       near       to    the       fron t ,         suddenly           there        appeared

 t0     k9    2n        opening          to    my    right , there               was       man        half       on    the     floor       with

 someone            behind          him       was    trying          to    pull       him        up    by       the    shoulder,             Alan

 gr 3 h b o d      at     his       t r o u s e r wai s t b a n d           and       a 1s o t r i e d           to    pul 1 h i m         up.

 They        got        him    to    about          waist       height          t h e n we        realised             he    was      already

 dead        so     they       let       him    qo    and       ne    j ust      disappeared                    under       people's         feet,

    iuc.t, 3 f t o r      that        I sudden!v               went       backwards              but       my    feet       remained         where

 they        were.            I was       about       a f oot         off       the     ground             and    the       gap      had    closed

 over        me     and       it was          dark.        I was          down       for     a    couple          of     seconds           when

 someone            behind          me    pulled          me    up    by m y         jacket.               If    t his      person         hadn't

  pulled           me    back       up    I would          have       been       trampled              on       and    killed.

 After        several           more          minutes          we    reached           the       fence          and    climbed            over    it.

  It    took        us    every          ounce       of    my       energy       to     get       over          the    fence         as    I was

  pxhausted.                  Alan       got    over       before          me    an d was             screaming             encouragement

  at me        to       get    me     o ver.

  Once       on     the       pitch       I sat        down         for    about        a minute.                 I was         serverly

  shocked           and       although           I didn't            realise           it    I had          a number            of    injuries.

  Once        I was       on    the       pitch        I could            hear       the     Nottingham                fans       booing         and

  then        it    was       anouncsd           over      the       loud S p e a k e r           System,             “Do      get    off    the

  When        I got       onto        the      pitch        I remember               looking           at       the    cl o c k ,     the    time

  was        15E5       hrs.

    I then         sawl                                                                                    in P e n      7“       They      then

    c ame     onto       the        pitch      and     led      us a w a y        to    the        refreshment                 bar    where       we

sat    on a w a l l -            We     remained          there         for     about          ten minutes,                   when    we    then

left     the       ground         and walked             back       to the           coa c h .      We       left    the       ground            of

offence.

After      gams       was       stopped,          when        I was       on     the      pitch,             I saw       an    off     duty

p,t1 i ,-offi.ar]   .30    up     to a S e n i o r       Officer             policeman,             he       was    waving           his

i.ia r rant     rare       about         and      shouting          at       hi n't to    get th e r e s c u e            organised.

t    think       the      Senior         Policeman            jus t      ignored           him.

Some     of      the      policeman            were      helping              pull     people         out       of the          c r o w d but

manv     of      them       were        wandering            around          disorganised,                   t hey m a y well         have

been     in      shock          themselves.              I did          not     see      any     stewards assisting                         the

but     they        did    not        a p p e a r to    be    doing          anything          to a s s i s t .

I would         describe              m y s e l f as    follows,             White       m a le,      19 y r s , 6 ’4 tall,

stocky         build,          weighing         15      stone*           My    hair       is     short         and       brown       in     colour.

I was        wearing        a    black         leather            and    canvas          bomber          style       jacket,           blue

jeans        and     black       training              shoes.

When      I arrived             home        I found          that       the    top       of    my     left         leg    was     grazed

and     very        badly       bruised         and      swollen.               I also         had       pains       and       bruising           to

my     ribs.

On Sunday            the       16th      my m o t h e r       called          the     doctor,            a    locum       came       out     and

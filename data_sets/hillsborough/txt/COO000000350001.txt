H Committee this morning considered a helpful paper by Douglas
Hurd and Chris Patten reviewing the state of play on football
related issues.


2.      Proceedings     on    the    Football     Spectators                 Bill          will         resume
shortly.       Sniping by the Opposition and the football authorities
at the     football membership          scheme will           continue.                    Lord Justice
Taylor's final report is expected around the turn of the year,
and although thought unlikely to come out against the scheme, may
seek refinements to it.              Difficult Parliamentary debates on the
commencement      orders      allowing      the   appointment                    of        the    Football
Membership      Authority      and    establishing        the           Football                 Licensing
Authority could follow.             The World Cup in June next year provides
a natural      focus    for hooligan        activity.             And every                      individual
match carries the potential for confrontation.


3.      Much action is, however,            in hand.          The Football Spectators
Bill    has    made    much   better     progress      than            at        one        time        seemed
likely, not least thanks to the efforts of Colin Moynihan.                                                There
is much support for Part 2 of the Bill introducing Restriction
Orders on convicted football hooligans.                        The Holland v. England
match    has    been    cancelled      at   Colin    Moynihan's                         request.              The
exchange of                              of liaison officers between police
forces    is   increasing.          The head      of the new National                             Football

Intelligence Unit takes up post on Monday.                             On safety, the Home
Office is monitoring action by football clubs to implement the
recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor's interim report.

4.     The     Committee        considered      the    possibility          of       withdrawing
passports       from      known      football      hooligans,        but     the       practical
problems in the way of this continue to be immense.                                        For the
moment,      it seems sensible to focus our efforts on making Part^ 2
of    the    Bill    work      and   on    further    improving police enforcement
               -         ——
effort.        The Committee also             looked at the possibility                     of our
seeking      the     abandonment          of the   England      v.    Scotland            match   at
Wembley next spring and the withdrawal of England from the World
Cup.        They felt it would be premature to reach a firm view on
either.             It   appears     that    the     Scottish    Football            Association
privately       favours        cancelling      the    England        v.    Scotland         match,
especially if both countries are in the World Cup.                            So this issue
may resolve itself, to everyone's satisfaction.                             Withdrawal from
the    World       Cup    is    an   altogether       larger     issue.              If    England
withdrew,      the likelihood is that the determined hooligans will
make their way to              Italy anyway and find a different cause to
champion.          In view of this and the irritation which a call for
withdrawal will           cause genuine         football fans,            colleagues saw no
advantage in seeking withdrawal now.                     This is clearly something
we shall, however, need to keep under review.


5.     The Committee endorsed a programme of work over the next 12
months focusing on four main areas:


       i.      completing the passage of the Football Spectators Bill
       and    bringing         the National        Football     Membership           Scheme and
       Restriction Order provisions into operation;


       ii.     bringing the National Football Intelligence Unit fully
       into operation;                        — -- ------ ~— — ”                 '


       iii.    strengthening international cooperation in preparation
       for the World Cup;

        iv.    considering and acting on Lord Justice Taylor's final
        report


6.      On this last,      colleagues recognised that perhaps the most
difficult issue we may face over the coming months will arise if,
in     his    final   report,   Lord   Justice   Taylor   were   to   seek   some
modification to the Football Membership Scheme.               They agreed that
in order to minimize the possible impact of that risk we should
aim,    so far as possible,       to uncouple work on implementation of
the scheme from consideration of the Taylor Report.                   We should
also focus attention as much as possible on the other action we
are taking - on safety, on police liaison and tactics, and on
international cooperation and joint action.               The aim should be to
present our policies as positively as possible, emphasising that
they embrace a broad front.            It will be important for colleagues
actively to assist Douglas Hurd and Colin Moynihan in that task.

of H Committee, Attorney General, Solicitor General, Minister for
Sport and Sir Robin Butler.

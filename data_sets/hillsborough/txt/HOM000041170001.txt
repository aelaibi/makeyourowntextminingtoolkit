        good humour.            This was not a problem.

At    10.00am          (1 0 0 0 )       this    date,       I attended             th e     main      briefing        in the       North

Our    terms          of    reference           was    th e      searching             of    fans     coming       through

noticed          that       there        was    about       six       fans      in th e       centre        N o r t h Pen*

increase          of       fans        coming       into    th e      ground*           The     majority          were     good

turnstile         operators              when          I was          present.              When       that        happened,           the     fans

did an a bo u t         turn and              m i n g 1ed w i t h              the     other        supporters                who     were

queueing         in a n       orderly          manner              outside.               A few         supporters             without

that    a number             of    operators                were         taking           payment..              I therefore            flitted

between A-G            turnstiles/,/ m a n y                     of      whom       had     been         drinking            but      were    not

drunk.           Several          cans       of    beer          and      lager           had     been       'binned'              in the     litter

basket        on e n t r y *           The    mood          of     the         majority           of     fans         had     changed and

they w ere            becoming          more       aggressive.                      The      smell          of    drink        was     becoming

more a p p a r e n t *            At    this       time,            I noticed              radio         reception             wa s    'poor'        and

virtually             non-existent.                     I was           no t    in a       position              to    receive         any

messages          because          of      interference                   on     th e      radio         and      also        crowd     no i s e ,

which       by    this       time       had       been        increased               tremendously.

Our     serial         Inspector,              Inspector                 WHITE,           w as    no t      present           from 2.30pm

I was       unable       to       estimate              the        number            of    fans        on    e n t e r i n g the       g r o u n d wh o

came     to me         and    said,          "Somone               is    going        to     get       killed          out     th e r e.      A   lot

more     were         abusive          and     threatening*                      The       mood        worsened             between 2.30

2.45pm        (1430)-(1435) .                     There            appeared           to     be    a     number          of    fans     having

difficulty             getting          through              the        turnstiles               because          of     the       sheer     weight

of    the     supporters.                    I did          no t    consider              the     seven           turnstilees           adequate

for     the      volume       and        I        did notice               turnstile              *G*       which       wa s the       one

examination,           I saw           that        it was          a     double       turnstile                  which        was    seperated

by a d i v i d i n g    wooden              partition.                   Bolted       on        to    th e       partition was                  la rge

wooden     blocks       directly                facing            th e    turnstiles                 to    prevent            illegal          entry.

The    sheer     weight           on    this           partition           had       distorted                  it a n d      the    blocks           had

jammed against              the        turnstiles                 making        them        inoperative.                      A number           of

fans     had    climbed           over       or        under       the     turnstiles                 at        th e    point.

There    also     appeared              to        be    some       difficulty               with          turnstile            'A'.        A

Police        Officer       who        was        on    duty        outside          turnstile                  'G ' w a s     in d a n g e r         of

getting        crushed and                 I pulled           him        over       th e       turnstile               into    the       ground.

I wa s    subjected              to    threats              and     obscenities                 from        a     number       of L i v e r p o o l

fans     who    were        shouting,              "Get       fucking           out        there          and      get     something             done

before        someone        gets          killed."           Their         mood          was    aggressive                and       it w a s

obvious        they     had       been          drinking.

A   large      number        of       approximately                    twenty         fans       had        climbed           o ve r      the

perimeter        wall        onto          th e    turnstile               roof .          Several              were     caught           and

ejected.         Whilst           ejecting              one       of     these        fans           I saw a           fattish Liverpool

supporter        hand        a    bundle           of       ticket         stubs          to    one       of      the    fa n s      on    the

turnstile         roof,          who       in     turn       threw         them       down       to        th e    crowd        at       the    other

side     of    the     perimeter                wall.

About     2 . 4 5 pm    (1445),             Gate        ’C ’ o p e n e d            and     about          fifty        fans        burst

through        th e    gate.           I ran           to    th e      gate         with       Police           Constable            1278 LANG

and managed            to    secure             th e    gate,            together           with          the     stewards.

Despite        losing        radio          contact,               I was       aware           that        the     situation              was     bein*-

monitored         by    the       CCTV          camera         positioned                  in t h e        South        side        of    the     West

Stand.

The    noise      was       tremendous,                 the        mood        of    the       fans        near        kick     off       time        was

getting        worse        as    they          came        through            the    turnstiles,                  many        of w h o m       would

have     been     ejected              normally             for        their        attitude              caused        through           drink,

but    the     situation              at     this       stage            was    not        practicable.

Suddenly,         Gate        'C        appeared             to        burst        open again,                  approximately                 2.50pm-

2,55pm         (1450)— (1455),                      a    large       number           of         fans     ra n       through         into       the

centre         tunnel       of    the           Leppings             Lane          end.

It wa s        noticeable             at        this         time        that        the         situation             had     quietened            down

cons i de r a b l y .

Shortly         after       3.00pm              (1500),             there          was      a     radio/tannoy                 message          that         all

Officers         were        required                   on   th e     perimeter                  track*

I took my            serial        onto             th e      perimeter              track         via         the     rear     of       the    Police

Control         into    the       South                 Stand and              over        the     wall*             I instructed               them         to

stay    together             as    a serial                   because           of        th e    number          of      Police         Officers            who

were    on      the    field              at    that          time       and        I went         straight               to   perimeter            fence

a t P e n 3.          I saw           a    large             bunch        of       people         piled          on t o p      of     each       other

against         the    wall        and          up against                 the       security              fencing*             The       number         3

gate     was     partially                 open           and    had       been           wedged          by a n u m b e r          of    bodies.             It

w as   apparent          that             the       situation              was       serious              at     t hi s     stage        and     speed

was    essential.                 I was              unable          to    get        through             the     gate         because         of    th e

b o d i es ,    therefore,                 I climbed                 onto          th e     security             fencing         and      pulled

several         fans        from          the        mass       and       over        the        fencing,             together           with       my

serial*          The     majority                    of      these        appeared               in s h o c k         but      were      conscious*

I then went             to      the        gate           with Chief                Superintendent                      NESBIT        where,         with

difficulty,            managed                 to        pull    a       number           of     bodies          away       from      the      gate

until      it    could           be       opened             fully.

We     organised            a    chain              of    Officers             and        dragged           a great            number       of      bodies

from     this        area*            where              there       was       a    sign         of     life       by     checking          the

       or a b u s e ,        but    I did       see       a    number          of      flare-ups            mainly        by f a n s wh o           had

       bean     drinking            and    were       wandering                about         aimlessly*             This        was

       understandable                 under        th e       circumstances.                    I did        see    a number           of    co ins

       being        thrown         onto     the     field*             A   lot         of    Police         Officers,           St J o h n      s

       Ambulancemen                were     engaged            in     resuscitation.                    Many       were       shouting          for

       o x y g en ,    which        was     no t      forthcoming*                     Initially,            my    feelings           were      of

       frustration                 because       I was         unable          to      get     to     the    people         because         of the

       security          fencing*               Perhaps         if     I could              h a ve,    we    may     have       been able            to

       save     a     lot     more        lives.          The       actual          gates       were        wholly         inadequate           simply

       because          there        was    not       enough and                th e    ones        which     are        there are          too

       s m a l 1.

       When      the         ground       was    eventually                emptied,            I escorted               the L i v e r p o o l       f a ns

       with my          serial        out       the    Leppings                Lane     end      to    the       main      roundabout           on

       Penistone              Rd    before         returning              to    th e    gymnasium,               where       three      Officers

       on m y       serial          were    involved                in t h e     sudden          death       reports.

       At 7 . 2 0 p m         (1920),        I returned               to       Claywheels             Ln    where        some     of     the    serial

        had a meal             as    we    waited             transportation                  to B a r n s l e y *         Police Constable

       2887      GRANT         was    the       only      Officer              still        engaged         at     that      time      with     his

        * body * *

        At 8 . 0 0 p m        (2000)       I retired                from       duty.

        Understandably, a                    number            of    my    serial           were      upset        by     the    situation            but

        all    credit          to    them       they          did    not       show         their     emotion           during        the    incident

        a n d all       performed            creditably.

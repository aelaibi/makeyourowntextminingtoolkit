Dear

I have been asked to reply to your letter of 5 December to the
Minister for Sport, about Lord Justice Taylor's report into the
Hillsborough tragedy. These issues are principally matters for
the Home Office.

Lord Justice Taylor concluded that he could not support a
national membership scheme because he did not believe that the
type of technology envisaged in an invitation to tender document
would work well enough to avoid the danger of congestion and
disorder. In the light of his report the Government therefore
decided not to proceed with the establishment of the Football
Meembership Authority which would have had the responsibility for
drawing up and implementing a detailed scheme.

Lord Justice Taylor recognised that there is no panacea which
will achieve total safety and which will cure all the behaviour
and crowd control problems at football matches. However, he was
satisfied that seating does more to achieve these objectives than
any other single measure. The Government has accepted that view.

The cost of introducing all seated accommodation may not be as
great as it might first seem. Attendances at many of the clubs
in the lower divisions are well below capacity. Redevelopment of
only part of the ground to provide seating could be sufficient.

Football clubs are responsible, just like any other commercial
venture, for the comfort and safety of their customers. Financial
assistance is available to football clubs. The Football Trust
expects to be able to provide £75 million over the next 10 years.
This will be on top of other sources of finance which will be
available to football including sponsorship, advertising and
television fees. In addition, the Government will make a further
£100 million available to clubs over the next 5 years through a
reduction in the pools betting tax.

Yours sincerely

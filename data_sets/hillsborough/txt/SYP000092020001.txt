                    played at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, and I had obtained a £6

        We set off about 9.30 am (0930) for Sheffield,                                               was driving

        ahead of us in his girlfriends                          car, which he was leaving for her to

        parked the car                                        and joined us in                 car



                       then drove us all to Sheffield without stopping.                          We did not

        travel along the motorway routes.

        occassion.                                            and I both had tickets for the Leppings

        Lane terraces,                    this being the Liverpool         supporters end of the ground,



                                  and I went         into the    ’S P O R T S M A N ’S' public house for a

        drink.          I had prepared sandwiches to eat.                      I met quite a few people

that I knew inside the pub all       locals from the area I live in.           It was

a good happy atmosphere     inside the pub, with the/fans all          looking

forward with anticipation and excitement to thf match.



        and I left the   ’S P O R T S M A N ’S' at abo utV 1 .45pm (1345) and we were

joined on the walk to the football ground with another             lad from

Liverpool.     I don't know this lads name and he left us outside the

football    ground.



It took us about half an hour to walk/to the L eppings Lane terrace of

the football ground.      It was a dry .not, sunny day.        On the walk to the

ground the crowd making its way there, were in a happy mood.



It was packed outside the entrance to the ground, you just could n’t

move.     It was just a big crowd, with people pushing.           There were no

recognisable queues to join.        I remember seeing one mounted Policemen

in the middle of the crowd,      there were also a few further back in the

area of the road.      I was frightened outside the ground.           It was the

worst crowd problem I have experienced outside a football ground.

You just could not move as ypu wanted to.                   and I got seperated

outside the ground in the/mass of people.



I got in through a turnstile about 2.40 pm (1440) a nd handed over my

ticket,    having the stub returned to me.        I saw men in front of me,

being searched by the Police as they passed through the turnstile.                    I

w a s n ’t searched.



Once    inside the ground,]_______ [and I joined up again.        We then entered

the tunnel    leading to the terracing.       There were no Police or stewards

in this area,     that I seen.   I c an ’t remember seeing signs directing

          you onto the terracing.        I could remember from the year before that I

          had used the tunnel to get onto the terrace and had found a good

          viewing area.



          There were       lots of fans going down the tunnel, and                 and I walked

          along the tunnel onto the terracing.



                   and I had to push our way into the crowd toykrds the left
     NA
          side and the front area,       into an area known asS          >n 4.   At about 2. 45pm

          (1445)            and I took up a position in Pen 4 and I have indicated

    vX    this as position number 1 on a seperate grid sheet, which I produce
A
          (Exhibit No          )(Case Ref No     )   I could n’t see the pitch from this
1
          position and asked             to come with me towards the front of the

          te rr aci ng.



                   and y then jostled our way towards the front of Pen 4, at about

          2.50pm (ftff50) I took up a position directly in front of the perimeter

          fence and            stood behind me.      I found that when I first got there

          I had more room to move and because no-one was standing                 in front of

          me,   I could see clearly.



          Again on the seperate grid sheet           I have indicated this position as

          position number 2,       (Exhibit No        ) ( C ^ e Ref No      ) and this sheet

          I produce.

          In this position I remember hea/ing Alan H A N S E N ’S name being announced

          on the loudspeaker system,             I couldn't hear all the announcements

          clearly.        By now the area I was standing      in had filled up with people

          I saw c e o p l e o n the perimeter track, who had obviously c>1[mbed o v e r

Officers standing on the perimeter track looking into the terracing

where I was,



I remember hearing a cheer go up.      I was next aware of the players out

on the pitch, although the match had not yet kicked off.        I was aware

of terrific bodily pressure from behind and this had caused my body to

be in direct   constant contact with the wall,     beneath the perimeter

fencing   I was in pain with this pressure,   which did not ease up.        My

hands were gripping the front fence.      I was shouting,   telling the

Police to open the gate at the front.



      had his arms outstretched as he stood behind me, and he too was

gripping the fence,           was yelling at me,    telling me to climb over

the fence onto the pitch.



Although I did not see the kick-off,     I was aware from the crowds

cheering,   that the game had started.    I could not follow the play

during the game,    due to the extreme discomfort    I was experiencing,



      kept urging rne to climb out of the pen over thLs fence,

managed to drag myself up the fence onto the top of/the wall        ledge and

      was pushing me upwards.     1 managed to climb t/he fence and once

on the top I jumped jiown the other side onto the parer imet/S r track.

The game was still/being    played.   A St John's lady carrye up to me,     to

ask if I was hur>      I stood there and waited for          and I saw him

climb over thevfence.     Once we were together we tried to walk onto the

area at the side of the Liverpool goal but the Police pushed us back

from the field.



      next took me to the side of the pitch,       in front ojX'the North

 At this point I knew that a disaster was unf o ld in g.

 and later that afternoon I found that he was safe.



 After a while            returned to me,   he told me he couldn't take

 anymore and that he had been carrying dead bodies.                     and I stood

('''together in front of the North Stand, and left the ground about 4.30pm

 (1630).    I can't remember getting out the ground but I know I did not

 use the tunnel.



 I had no involvement with any of the deceased,



 Once           and I walked back to the car, we found              and

 were waiting for us,



 I managed to phone my mum about 4.50pm         (1650)   from someones house in

 Sheffield.

  South Yorkshire (West District) Coroner
  Medico-Legal Centre

  SHEFFIELD S3 7ET

  Dear Mr Popper

  Resumed Inquests 19th November 1990 - Chief
  Superintendent D G Duckenfield

  We refer to your letter of the 19th September together with our
  subsequent telephone conversation on the 27th, wherein you helpfully
  indicated that you would be prepared to allow us to draw to your
  attention the names of any witnesses whom we would like you to call after
  the end of September.

  To avoid un-necessary duplication we have written to Hammond Suddards who
  represent South Yorkshire Police, and their Insurers, and asked them for
  a copy of the list of witnesses which we understand they have sent to
  you. Subject to sight of that list we may wish to submit further names.

  We can say, however, that we would wish you to consider evidence from the
  following:-

  1.               J D Phillips BA, the Deputy Chief Constable of Devon & Cornwall
                   with regard to his inquiry and report into the Hillsborough Stadium
          ~        disaster. We understand that you have a copy of this substantial
                   200 page document already.

  2.              P F Hayes and J D Tattersall of the Health and Safety Executive
                  Research and Laboratory Services - produced a report entitled
                  "The Hillsborough Incident 15 4 89; examination of crash barriers
                  from pens 3 and 4".

                  We have only received a draft copy of this report and therefore
                  requested a full copy from the South Yorkshire Police. Upon receipt
                  we will forward a copy to you, as we would wish the authors to give
                  evidence.

  3.             South Yorkshire Police Consulting Engineer. We have written to
                 Hammond Suddards asking for a copy of the report and authority to
                 send to you a copy as we anticipate we will wish you to call
                 evidence of its content.

            I am a Police Constable                    in the South Yorkshire Police Force                         currently

            stationed in the Barnsley Division.



            At     1535hrs on the afterno on of Saturday 15 April                                     1989 (150489)/ I was

            on duty in a marked                police vehicle,                     when as a result of information

            received,        I attended at the Sheffield Wedne sd ay Football G r o u n d at

            Hi 1isbo r ou gh, in response to                         *Ope rat i on Support *.



            On arrival        inside the ground I attended on the main playing field of

            the stadium towards the S pion Kop end of the ground.                                           It was at this

            point that I saw a male                    person laid on his back who appeared to be

            unconscious.                I would describe the person as follows?                              male,    white

            6*0 t a l 1, short brown receeding hair, and was                                       clean shaven.      He was
                                                                                                       PAGE       i
                                                                                                       S794

                    approximately 35 to 40 years of age.               He was wearing a blue crew neck

                    T shirt,      a blue and white striped ccWtrtTon shirt,                            stri ped

                    underpants,      and blue denim j e a n s .   He was also wearing two

                    light blue ankle spiffs' and one grey          ’Hi TfH^/training shoe,      on his

                    left foot.



                    All      relevant vital   signs we re checked for on the person but he

                '   responded to none.          He was   placed on a temporary s t r e t c h e r and

          ^ ;       carried to the Gymnasium within the ground where he was                  placed.      He

                    was again examined for any response to his vital               signs and still


    V%
                    responded to n o n e .      It was quite apparent at this time that his

                    fingers and hands were now coloured blue and he appeared deceased.



                    At 1559hrs on the same date, whilst again in the gymnasium, I was
                                                                    '       /v^3G

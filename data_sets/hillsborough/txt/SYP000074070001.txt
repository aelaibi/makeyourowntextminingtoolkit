             I am a season ticket holder of^VlTve r poo 1 Football Club and I attended

             the FA semi final         cup match at Sheffield Wednesday ground Hillsborough

             on 15th April         1989.

             I travelled to Sheffield by Amberxl/fie Coaches together with

                                                                      We all had tickets for ^Lg#t?inqs L a ne

             terraces.

             There were trafxf             d          ups ori^yKe M62 w h ich delayed us for some time

             and we arrived in Sheffield shortly after                         1prn.

             The       coach was parked on an industrial                   estate.     When we got off the

             coach,      because we had time to kill, we walked around the area before

             going       into a pub on the corner of Claywheels Lane for a drink.                           We
                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                              S 1833

          arrived outside the ground it was just a mass                         people nothing was

            g a n i sseeody^ mthe
                               erere was no queues.     I noticed a b o u t 3 or 4^t&«funted

          Policea^n
            tlicfjjren within the mass of people,            it was tightly packed and they

          were having     little effect on the crowd.

          I had a vague idea of where I had got to enter the ground because I

          had been to this same ground before but when I got into the mass of

          people   it was just a matter of going with the crowd.                         ind I had

          become separated from the other two                      and          , as we made our

          way up to the turnstile.          It was a large crowd but I w a s n ’t feeling

          particularly uncomfortable.
                                                  5 o e
          When we reached the turnstile          I noticed that a/'gate had been opened to
     C_
■?
          my righ^f, I told          we had better go through the turnstiles which we

          did.     I handed my ticket in as I went through the turnstile.                    Once

          inside the ground I saw the tunnel and the players on the pitch and we

          both made our way towards the lUyrinel there w a w                    large amount of

          people making the same direction.               I d i d n ’t ^ e e   any signs directing to

          the standing area but I wasn't              really looking for any.          I could see

          the tunnel    led towards the pitch.           As we got to the end of the tunnel

          into the terraces       I could see that it was very packed.                 We made our

          way into the crowd and took up a position only a couple of yards from

          the wall behind us and near to the wall which extends from the end of

          the tunnel.      I d o n ’t know if the match had started or not,               I was more

          aware of something happening          in the crowd.            There were people standing

          outside the perimeter fencing and I was aware of people in trouble by

          the fencing and they were trying to get out.                     I was getting pushed and

          shoved but I d i d n ’t feel     I was getting excessively crushed.               I d i d n ’t

          sense any crowd surge because I was being protected by the walls but

          it was certainly looking very uncomfortable at the front.                       I didn't

          take any notice at all        of the match and was not aware that it was

          stopped because people        in the crowd were getting very distressed and
                                                                                        PAGE             3
                                                                                        S'1833

I was helping to lift them up              into the stands above m e .       I have no

idea for how long I was doing              this but it was for a few minutes.

Whilst    I was passing       people up to the stands I became aware that

people were being carried out from in front of me back towards the

tunnel,    one in particular       looked blue and in a bad way.                       ind a

mate of his grabbed hold of me and persuaded me to get out of the pens

because    it was obvious that something very serious had happened.                            We

made our way back up the tunnel and when we got out into the enclosure

I saw bodies lying everywhere.                     rid the friend he met inside the

terraces are Firemen they have some first aid experience and they

began looking at the bodies lying on the ground.                   I followed behind                to

see if I could     hj*   of any help       to tijjem.   They tended to several          people,

I was with a ^ e l l a who was s e m i c o n s c i o u s they had shown me how to

hold his head in a certain position and told me to keep talking to

him.     I did this for a short time until he was taken away by

Ambulancemen.      I then rejoined                nd        who were still tending to

the people    lying on the       ground.      While all this was       ’going on I did
                          _     *\c^v       Co     %,
notice a lot of p o l ic emen around but they / f r e          doing n o t h i n g .     I do

remember the Fire Service and Ambulance Service arriving at more or

less the same time.           The Firemen were going        round looking at the

bodies    lying on the ground,         one came to me as I was holding the

f e l l a ’s head but I told him he was alright and to go to someone else.

It was only just after this that the ambulance men took the fella away

from me to the ambulance.           I was by this time        in some state of shock

myself and what     I was doing        is a bit vague but I do recaj.                  rying a

out to the^ay ^u la nc e s .     This must have been        for some    45 mins to an

hour.     I remember at one stage walking along a roadway at the side of

the ground with 3 beaker fulls of water offering a drink to people who

were    injured.   It started to quieten down a bit.               I was having a smoke

                                                                                      SI 833

         by the turnstiles and I noticecj                and      by railings by the river

         and I went and joined them.           There were still a fair amount of Police

         about and        and         spoke to a senior officer.        They made a number

         of complaints to the Policeman,           one in particular was when a Policeman

         refused to use his coat to cover a dead body and they complained of

         the whole general attitude of the Police to people who were assisting

         the injured people in the enclosure area.             We then left the ground and

         made our way to the coach.           We did stop on the route back to the coach

         when a couple insisted we use their telephone to phone home.                We left

         Sheffield at between 5.15 and 5.30pm.

         I. went to tha/same game         l a s t X e a r and Police were checking tickets

         some 2-300 yards away from the ground.             This d i d n ’t happen this year,

         there seemed to be as many Police on duty but most seemed to be behind

         barriers which were blocking off the side roads.              Also last year the

         coaches were checked by Police as they were leaving the motorway for

         drink,    but this d i d n ’t happen this year.       It appeared to me that the

         game was PolicedvcTompletely different this year to last year.               Last
                                   1? .
         year when I went to the same match I was dipyfted to the side

         terraces,    I c a n ’t recall    seeing the tunnel   but this year when I went

         through the same turnstile          it was the first thing     I saw.

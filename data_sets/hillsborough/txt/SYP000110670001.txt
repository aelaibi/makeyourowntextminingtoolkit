AUTHORISED: CHIEF CONSTABLE

FROM THE CHIEF CONSTABLE
TO ALL MEMBERS OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE
 THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF MY REPORT TO THE POLICE AUTHORITY THIS MORNING,
 FRIDAY 21 APRIL 1989, REGARDING THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.

 A mbers will be aw ar e of the major tragedy wh ic h oc cu rre d at hillsboroush
 FOOTBALL GROUND ON SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989, AS A RESULT OF WHICH 95 PEOPLE
 DIED, 140 WERE TREATED AT LOCAL HOSPITALS AND FIVE ARE* STILL IN INTENSIVE
 CARE.
 BECAUSE THIS FORCE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY FOR LAW AND ORDER IN THE AREA AND
 ASSISTED THE SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB WITH THE CONTROL OF THE EVENT,
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG FOR THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE TO HAVE GATHERED
 THE EVIDENCE AND COME TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE CAUSE.        THEREFORE I ASKED
 MR. GEOFFREY DEAR, CHIEF CONSTABLE OF WEST MIDLANDS, TO CARRY OUT THIS TASK
 AND HE AGREED.
 THE HOME SECRETARY HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WILL BE AN INQUIRY LED BY LORD
                                                                        *   PAGEi02
 JUSTICE TAYLOR.   THE TERMS OF REFERENCE ARE:-
            ■TO INQUIRE INTO THE EVENTS AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY
             FOOTBALL GROUND ON 15 APRIL 1989 AND TO MAKE
             RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE NEEDS OF CROWD CONTROL AND
             SAFETY AT SPORTS EVENTS".
 MR GEOFFREY DEAR WILL BE SUBMITTING THE EVIDENCE HE GATHERS TO THE HEARINGS
    BE HELD BY LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR.    THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE WILL GIVE ALL

 t  ■ORMATION IN THEIR POSSESSION TO THOSE CONDUCTING THE INQUIRY.
 I CAN INFORM MEMBERS THAT THE PLANNING PREPARATORY TO THE EVENT WAS ON THE
 BASIS OF THAT APPLIED TO PREVIOUS SIMILAR MATCHES.    THE NUMBER OF POLICE
 OFFICERS ON DUTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE EVENT BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE
 GROUND WAS 1,111 OF WHOM 257 WERE AT THE GROUND.
 IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THIS EVENT HAS ATTRACTED IMMENSE MEDIA ATTENTION
 AND I MUST INFORM MEMBERS THAT MUCH OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID BY THE MEDIA IS
 INCORRECT.
 ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE ACTIONS AND DECISIONS OF INDIVIDUAL
 OFFICERS.   THOSE INVOLVED AT THE MATCH FOUND THEMSELVES FACING THE POSSIBILITY
 OF A DISASTER OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND TOOK ACTION WHICH THEY CONSIDERED
 APPROPRIATE TO RESOLVE THAT SITUATION.
 I MUST SAY THAT THOSE OFFICERS WERE APPOINTED BY ME TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS
 AND IT FOLLOWS THAT I ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE POLICE ACTION
CONNECTED WITH THE EVENT.                                            *   PAGE:03
I WELCOME THE INQUIRY WHICH IS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE AND WHICH WILL
UNDOUBTEDLY REVEAL THE TRUE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THIS TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.
I BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT IS COMPLETED THE ACTIONS OF THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE
POLICE WILL BE SEEN IN A VERY DIFFERENT LIGHT.
I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE TREMENDOUS
SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE PROVIDED DURING AND AFTER THIS TERRIBLE TRAGEDY
BY CHURCHMEN, THE STATUTORY AND VOLUNTARY AGENCIES AND MEMBERS OF THE
PUBLIC TO THE VICTIMS, THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS AND TO THE POLICE

                SUBJECT:      HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY - SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989




                    I would like to take this opportunity of thanking you sincerely
                    for your considerable efforts whilst a member of the Casualty
                    Enquiry  Bureau  Team  over  the  weekend  of  the  tragedy  at
                    Hillsborough.

                    The efficiency of the Bureau was due to          the   dedication   and
                    conscientiousness of all the staff involved.

                    I sincerely hope that such a need for the Bureau does not take
                    place in the near future, however, we must continually seek to
                    improve the running of the unit.   It is appreciated that there
                    were difficulties with such things as the size of the room,
                    communications with hospitals and the mortuary and these will
                    be re-appraised.

                    I shall be pleased if you will consider what other areas should
                    be looked at and return the attached proforma to me with your
                    observations.    Should you prefer to discuss this matter with
                    Mr            in the Communications School, by telephone, he will
                    be available on extension 206.

                    Thanking you again for your considerable efforts.

           - 15 -

          Chief Superintendent, Staff Services

           I refer to the attached correspondence regarding the above training which will
           take place in April and October this year for 6 x \ day sessions each time (i.e.
           3 consecutive days each time). Concern was expressed regarding the cost of
           telephone calls from various locations in the Force to the Bureau and Mr
           and Communications have looked carefully at this problem. Now that the
           new Voice and Data Network has been installed at Ecclesfield, it is
           possible for internal lines within Training Department to be used to provide
           calls in the Casualty Bureau. This would considerably reduce costs, but would
           also require all helpers to work frcm the Training Department. Mr             |
           agreed to civilians helping with this training and a draft report
           is attached for signature by Assistant Chief Constable, Staff Services, requesting
           volunteers to attend Training Department on each of the 3 days.

           When all the Force is equipped with the Voice and Data Network there will be no
           need for than to travel to Ecclesfield, therefore this is only a provisional
           solution.

    Chief Superintendent - Staff Services

    The Casualty Enquiry Bureau is now fully operational after refurbishment
    the voice and data network now being fully functional.


        It appears likely that the new telephone configuration makes it possible
        to keep the training of Casualty Bureau personnel totally within the
        Training Department, thereby incurring no telephone charges. It will however
        require the support of civilian volunteers being deployed with Training
        Department on the three training days ( 17 18 19 April 1990 ) This training
        session will be very much experimental and will test our updated capacity.
        An appropriate minute sheet is attached for your consideration, and if
        approved signature,please.


        I would seek permission to defer the use of Special Constables within the
        the Bureau until the October 1990 training session and at this time give
        some thought to utilising Special Constables within any World Student Games
        Casualty Bureau practice.

CASUALTY BUREAU TRAINING

There is of course no contractual obligation for civilian staff becoming involved in
this training ie by acting the part of concerned relatives or police officers with
details of casualties. Nevertheless I am certain that a trawl for volunteers will
be well supported and the civilian staff who take part will have an enjoyable break
from routine and know they are providing a valuable contribution to police training
for major incidents. As you know I am involved in Casualty Bureau training and can
vouch for the necessity of having a constant stream of calls making demands upon the
officers in the Bureau: the Special Constabulary is no longer able to provide the
number of volunteers essential for realistic training.

If the civilians are thoroughly briefed they will fit the bill admirably.

of the contract is to replace equipment, at an early stage, at
Ecclesfield.   The anticipated completion date at Ecclesfield is
April 1990.   This will enable a greater number of facilities to
be available within the complex      (ie sub-division, DHQ and
Training) and a larger number of telephone extensions.    It will
not increase the number of lines on the internal network to
locations away from Ecclesfield.   The final completion date for
the full network is anticipated to be 30 November 1990, when this
has been achieved a greater number of lines will be available to
the Casualty Bureau on the private network.


If use is made of the public network and the mean call charge is
ten pence,  it follows that the cost per thousand calls is one
hundred pounds  (this equates to less than ten man hours of one
police constable at overtime rates).


I understand that during the period of time the Casualty Bureau
was operating in response to the Hillsborough Disaster (April
1989) 1,300 calls were received from the public and some 400 from
hospitals.

  SUBJECT      CASUALTY BUREAU       TELEPHONE EXPENSES




  3

  Chief Superintendent Ball, Staff Services,


  May I refer to the attached papers which have been sent to this
  office with a request to address the costs of telephone calls.


  There are 16 exchange lines in the Casualty Bureau.    These are
  conventional telephones which are not connected to the police
  internal network.   Any outgoing call is charged at BT's current
  charges;  any incomming call is charged to that particular
  subscriber's account.   If use is made of these telephones then
  BT's standard charges will be incurred. Telephone charges are
  based on two parameters - the duration of the call and the time
  of day (or day of week)     on which the call is made.    It is
  obviously cheaper to use these telephones outside normal office
  hours or, for example on a Sunday.


  There are 10 lines in the Casualty Bureau on the internal police
  network.   These are not dedicated to the Bureau in that they are
  'paired' with other telephone extensions at Ecclesfield (this is
  known technically as a Plan 1A).     This can be illustrated by
  example    - a telephone which currently exists in an office at
  Ecclesfield is shared with a line into the Casualty Bureau. When
  the Casualty Bureau is activated the instrument is removed from
  the particular office and connected to the identified line in the
  Bureau   -     any incoming call is then received only in the
  Casualty Bureau and not in the office from where the instrument
  has been removed. Use of the internal lines to other internal
  extensions is free and not subject to any additional charges;
  when making external calls (the '9 line'   facility) the standard
  BT charge rates apply. Making use of the internal lines will
  cause disruption to other users within Ecclesfield sub-division.
  Any calls made on the internal network to locations on another
  switchboard (ie locations away from Ecclesfield) will engage the
  private line and obviously prevent other callers using that line.

                                      CASUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU TRAINING
    SUBJECT


    Chief Superintendent, Staff Services

    In previous years   the total  number of telephones    in the Casualty
    Bureau numbered 8.    As from February 1990, a removeable partition
    wall will be inserted across 2 classrooms and the number of telephone
    lines has already been increased to 16 (plus 2 FAX lines).        This
    building, together with 'F' Division have a restricted number of
    internal extensions as we are awaiting the installation of the new
    telephone   system.    The previous method    of Special Constables
    telephoning   the Bureau   from internal   telephones,   with various
    messages would be impractical.    Even when the new telephone system
    is installed, it will be difficult to use enough telephones in the
    building to make the Casualty Bureau Training realistic.

    The Casualty Bureau during Hillsboorugh succeeded mainly due to
    training and I consider it important that this training is as real
    as possible.

    The suggestion is that one person from each Sub-Division be required
    to telephone the Bureau - on external lines - between approximately
    10.00 am and 3.00 pm each day (including the lunchtime period) for
    a total of 6 days per year      i.e. 3 days in Spring and 3 days in
    Autumn.  Three days together  are most convenient as   work is required
    to 'set the       room up' which would be        difficult for1 day'straining
    in view of the new screen walling.

    Perhaps this             report    could be   passed   to Mr              in the first
    instance.

                SUBJECT:      CASUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU




                     As you are aware, some difficulty has been experienced recently
                     in   correctlyservicing  the  Casualty  Bureau    during   training
                     sessions.    Since 1983, members of the Special Constabulary have
                     devoted considerable time assisting with training and indeed it
                     has been possible to train a small number of Special Constables
                     to function operationally within the Bureau.    However, the number
                     of Special Constables volunteering has been reducing mainly due
                     to the fact       that it has been necessary to employ    available
                     volunteers in the 'RINGING IN' role.      I believe that it is now
                     necessary to re-define the role of Special Constables within the
                     Bureau and suggest that any volunteers for this duty are mainly
                     utilised operationally within the Bureau.

                     In addition, a further problem has to be resolved.    The telephone
                     capacity within the Bureau has been increased by some 60% and
                     in order to ensure constant servicing many more incoming calls
                     are required.      In thepast, training has been achieved by using
                     the internal network.  This is no longer practical.

                     I suggest that the role of 'RINGING IN' the information during
                     training periods be now carried out by volunteer civilian personnel
                     at the rate of one per Sub-Division and two Headquarters using
                     'live' telephone lines.    This system would have the benefit of
                     constant incoming calls and placing the Bureau telephone system
                     under some stress in a controlled environment.    The civilian role
                     although of a repetitious nature is nonetheless of such importance,
                     that, without these calls, the training is of no value.

                     This recommendation is submitted for consideration and consultation
                     with Divisional Commanders and Mr             [ Principal Personnel

SUBJECT:      CASUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU




     O n Friday 28 April 1989, I attended a meeting in Chief
     Superintendent Nesbit's Office, together with representatives
     from Operations Division and those involved with the mortuary
     facilities during the Hillsborough Disaster, to ’examine our
     post-disaster procedures - and' ^consider any recommendations
     for the future*      The minutes of that meeting will be
     circulated   in  due  course,, but    I was  asked  by Chief
     Superintendent Nesbit to submit a report identifying the
     main, areas involving the Casualty Bureau's role as a result
     of the incident.

     I list the’ following points:'

     1-      TRAINING

            Despite all the comments which follow there is one
            area which should be brought to your attention and
            that is that, on the day, the manual system worked
            and was efficient.     This is down to the training
            that has taken place over the years both in Casualty
            Bureau   operation  and   for the  Hospital  Liaison
            Officers and that we should continue training on
            the current system until such time as the following
            suggestions are considered.

    2.      S1ACE.

            The location of Ecclesfield was very good.    There
            was plenty of peripheral space for ad-hoc meetings,
            rest   areas, canteen facilities and car parking.
            I would suggest we retain this building for the
            Bureau.

           The classroom in Communications School was obviously
           too small and had a number of drawbacks;      we ran
           out of space on the wallboards and finished up
           writing on the Venetian blinds. The total number
           of injured and dead was approximately 240 and we
           should, allow for at least 500 in total.  Wall space
           would not be required with a computerised system
           (see later), but additional space would still b e
           needed for the computer.
      .The., excess of persons in the room, and the        noise
?      generated created difficult working conditions.

    • “ Tlie position, of the door- and access onto the computer
       floor tended to allow persons to congregate at a
       point    near    the  door, -obscuring    some   of  the
    ■ wallboards. .

  The. 'use of     Ecclesfield reduces the. options '.for.
. increased '. room . size ; te» ■ that..'- building. It ■was
  originally suggested that the current Seminar Room
  should be converted,, but this .does not have computer
  flooring and the number of wires for telephones,
  computer, wiring etc, would l^e.    .excessive-' without such'
  flooring. . A.     suggestion      has     been    made. . that
  consideration b e ‘-.given.'to. knocking 2 of the computer
  classrooms    into    one    and   redividing     it with     a
  sound-proof partition. This would create double the
  space and also provide the necessary floor.             I have
  already arranged for buildings to attend with an
  architect     to    assess     the    feasibility     of this
  suggestion.

     COMMOHICAIIOHS

     Communications were the main problem.      At the time
     of   the  incident   we had    3 exchange lines into
     Ecclesfield Training Centre     and additionally there
     are 2 links with Force Headquarters,      The Casualty
     Bureau has provision for 4 exchange lines for members
     of the public and 4 exchange lines for police use
     only from the incident site, mortuary and hospitals.
     O n each of these groups of 4, calls ’hunt' until
     a vacant instrument is found.    We have a contingency
     whereby   British   Telecom   will  provide   us  with
     additional lines, .and on the day of the incident
     4 of these were requested at 4.15 pm and installed
     at 7.00 pm.      Additionally, at this time, 2 fax
     machines were provided direct with the hospital.

    Now that   'F' Division and 'F2' Sub-Division have
    joined the Training Centre, although the number of
    exchange  lines  and Headquarters lines have been
    increased we all channel through one switchboard.
    Had the incident occurred after the 'F' Division
    move, and the Incident Room set up at 'F' Division,
    there would have been very little, ability for persons
    within the Force to speak to the Casualty Bureau.
3time difficulty occurred with communication between
t h e hospitals and the Casualty Bureau, due mainly
fear Che number of calls which were being received
a t the hospital, jamming their boards.         This was
i»vtsiitually solved by the Casualty Bureau keeping
art open line. to. their officers at. hospitals, not
a satsifactory solution for both ourselves and the
hospitals. . When the fax machines were .installed
tKammunication was considerably better and there was -
no: need 'to,.verbally        details.' over.  telephone,,
 Hwnt improving.''.'accuracy, There still needs, however,
 t«x be some verbal communication, in addition to fax.

 Gcasmmunicaicibn#".with':'\ :;the-' temporary . :mortuary, at
  ttOJLsborough also proved difficult.            They had one
: pcnrtable telephone which needed an electrical socket,
  t a a same socket’ was being used for a photocopying
  machine.   '

 Titsa noise level in the room has been mentioned, as
 thsa telephones currently used are hand-held handsets,
 witich create difficulties when writing and with noise
 Levels.     There needs to be some, method of headset
  provided   and   this would   be essential following
 computerisation,    as the operator would need both
  ha-nds free for the keyboard.

 We   need to look carefully at telephone lines -
 increased space would provide facilities for a larger
 number of telephones which in turn need more lines.
 Tit* number required for the public is a very unknown
 quantity.     With a crowd of 54,000 at the Hillsborough
 ifacch, there was a potential for at least 54,000
 calls from Nottingham and Liverpool, but no system
 could cope with this number in the first 10 hours,
 there is an argument to §ay that increased telephone
 capacity will generate eXcessfve ’work and that some
 delay in getting through will give the Bureau some
  time to take fewer calls in a more orderly manner.
  If computers are used (see later) every telephone
  line would require a V D U .        I personally consider
  that 10 lines for the public are required, although
     |             | who has been responsible for the Bureau
  for a number of years, would argue for a higher
  number.    Certainly the fax machines at the hospitals
  are a ’m u s t ’, but whether these should be permanently
  installed or be provided on standby with the hospital
  stationery is an area for discussion and finance.
COMPTOBRISAIIOH
The West Yorkshire Police offered us the use       their
portable ‘Crisis* Casualty Bureau ^ u t e r

running by approximately U . G O pm.      At c
 they commenced a back record conversion on all ot
 the dead and injured persons notified to       Casualty
 Bureau and     they followed this by inputting the
 enauiring relatives and friends details.       the main
 workload in the Bureau lasted until Sunday
    r=.                                                    ^

    and thus there was no need to switch £r®      however
    system to the computer.    The computer did
    provide us with management, information and was, able
    to sequence the information it beld xn any
    we required.    This facility was later used,_ after
    the computer team ,had left, through West * orJ sh*f®;
    to   provide  details   of  700  persons   about  whom
     enquiries had been made and who were not ca*“ a1^ ® ;
     (These details were subsequently passed to other.
     Sees    for them to confirm that the p e r s o n were
    safe, and well).

    One difficulty with computerisation               s°“ '
    entry errors, whereby I H            _ _ L   £ron che

    whereas the manual system would have clarified       ^
    n^ition     Due to this, at one time the computer
    produced" a total of 99 dead when it was known there
     were 94.

     no doubt that we could have been even more efficient.
     This    would   have    been   particularly    noticeable
     we encountered identification problems such as                the
     Bradford     Fire   where   identification    took   place
     dental records.
The HOLMES Computer used in. the Incident Room set
up at Hammerton Road was used to identify the dead
and details of descriptions were entered onto that
machine.           A number of names were not released to
the Casualty Bureau until positive identification
had been              made via the relatives,      thus both the
Casualty           Bureau       and  the   Incident    Room   were
d u p l i c a t i n g 'work. ■■   On Tuesday 25 ■ April 1989.,. I
attended-         a meeting.' chaired       by.. Detective   Chief
Superintendent: Addis, which was also . attended by
2 persons who are writing a Major Disaster flan on
behalf of ACPO a n d ,the Home Office.             Their view was
that the Casualty Bureau should deal with casualties
only and                the dead be dealt with     by a-, separate
Incident Room as evolved in our situation.

I believe we should have some link into the HOLMES
System as against a 'stand alone' system like West
Yorkshire’s 'CRISIS', in order that Casualty Bureau
and   the    Incident   Room   can  access   the  same
information.     Details of the injured are required
by the Incident Room for use as subsequent witnesses
and the Casualty Bureau need access to details of
the dead.     I would recommend looking towards such
a system     with data lines from the Mobile Incident
Room to the fixed Casualty Bureau.     At present many
people can be trained to take telephone calls and
complete Casualty Enquiry Cards by hand.    A computer
system would require trained keyboard operators over
and above those dedicated to the HOLMES System. We
would need to keep these trained personnel separate.

DOCUMENTATION

This force uses the Green and White Cards (APPENDIX
'A') in. the Casualty Bureau for enquiries from,..the
hospital and relatives and friends.       The officers
at the hospitals complete the paper duplicate form
(APPENDIX ’B ’) and these should also be completed
at the Mortuary.     During the printing, these forms
should have been printed on NCR self carbonating
paper,, but were not.    It appears that these are not
the forms which are provided in the Major Incident
Boxes   at   Divisions   and   consequently  were  not
Initially used at the temporary mortuary.
      There is clearly a need- to have one form

       Should Che major incident be international, the forms
       for the dead Ihould be the pink form 3136A - approved
       by INTERPOL.      This has index numbers on the left
     . hand side which are the same irrespect^e of the
       language in which the form is printed ( A P P MD I X C ).
•      T h i s form has been reprinted by West York8hire ®
       is used by them for b o d y identification at theJ^ene.
       A      copy of the West Yorkshire Form is _ in the
       possession     of   Chief  Superintendent  Nesbit.      I
       recommend     consideration be given to us *si*S
       similar form for the dead in ^constabulary who
       purchase these from Leicestershire C°a sC**u1* ^

       When West Yorkshire attended they requ,=sted that

                 SUBJECT:


                I submit the following observations as requested on the communications element
                in the report by Superintendent Torr.

                FINNINGLEY AIR DISPLAY

                I have arranged for additional telephone lines, fax machines and cellphones to
                be installed or available. More detailed arrangements are in hand in respect
                of facilities being provided by the RAF. We have the necessary communications
                contingency in hand from which to deal initially with a major incident and
                escalate as necessary.

                CASUALTY BUREAU

                1.       Telephones - As a result of the planning for Finningley the following
                         will    be in place   by 23rd September 1989, and these will be left in
                         place   as part   of thestandby arrangements. These lines     arededicated
                         for the Casualty Bureau and are in addition to the routine telephone
                         connection through Ecclesfield switchboard.

                          a.      1 0 exchange lines for incoming public calls, all on the same
                                  number   (570800) which is given out at the time of an incident.
                                  Calls 'hunt'      for a    free   telephone to  avoid   operator
                                  intervention.

                         b.       5 exchange lines, all different numbers,  to allow calls to be
                                  made out of the Casualty Bureau..     These numbers are not
                                  publicised.

                         c   .    2   exchange lines for use with fax machines.

                         Any additional lines identified for particular incidents as they
                         develop will be installed by British Telecom with a delay of 2/3 hours.
                         I suggest the arrangements at (a),       (b) and   (c) are adequate for
                         contingency purposes.

                         Operator Headsets - There is a need for operators in the Casualty
                         Bureau to use headsets for telephone working. This is in hand within
                         the Communications budget.

                         Fax Machines - Hillsborough showed the advantage of transferring
                         information from the hospitals and mortuary by fax. Long lists can be
                         dispatched in far shorter time than by telephone.  The intention is to
                         pursue the purchase of fax machines for Divisional use so that there is
                         a readily available stand-by to meet the need of Casualty Bureau.    It
                         is difficult to justify the purchase of machines         to stand idle.
                         Unfortunately when the Police Authority were asked to approve purchase
                         earlier this year the item was rejected.          It will be pursued in
                         1990/91.  At the present time the Force has 3 (2 at Headquarters and 1

             at Rotherham) with access to a fourth which is owned by   the   A.A.   and
             located in Force Operations Room.


      4.     Cellular Radio - As issue not raised by Superintendent Torr but
             connected with Communication support for major incidents is the
             provision of cellphones.     The Force owns 15, 3 of which are fitted in
             cars.   The 1990/91 budget submission includes the purchase of a further
             17,   mainly for Divisional use.       We should then have a sufficient
             reserve, subject to Police Authority approval.

             Borrowing cellphones at the time of a -major incident is of little'
             value.    There is a limit to the number of calls which can be
             accommodated by the system and because of the media interest in such
             events congestion quickly develops.       There is however a facility
             available to the emergency services which allows them priority access
             but in order for it work the sets have to be coded beforehand which can
             only be done if we own them.

      5.    Computerisation - The Force HOLMES system is BULL HN (Honeywell)    and
             they have a Casualty Bureau package which is a sub set of the main
             application.  Hillsborough showed the need for interaction between the
             major enquiry and the Casualty Bureau databases.

             As part of the planning for the World Student Games it is intended to
             upgrade our HOLMES capability to take on board the extra needs of
             vetting,  and include the Casualty Bureau package as part of that
             procurement.  The cost is in the order of £150,000 and will be in the
             1990/91 capital submission.

             Building Work - I support the need for the building work proposed by
i     6
             Superintendent Torr.  The present room was inadequate for         the
             Hillsborough tragedy.

     7.     Forms   - I have no experience of the forms used for Casualty Bureau and
             cannot comment.

          CASUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU - POST-HILLSBOROUGH
          RECOMMENDATIONS



Following a number of do-briefing meetings regarding the above,
I submitted the attached report dated 3 May 1989 identifying a
number of areas which needed attention in the light of running
the Bureau following the disaster. These are divided into three
areas, the short term, the medium term (approximately 9 months)
and the long term (approximately 12 months).
Since submission of this report, a number of these areas have
received 3ome attention and the current situation is as set out
below. I understand you would wish to discuss the communication
aspects at a further meeting.
The following action has been taken on the recommended items:
1.        IN THE SHORT TERM
(a)(1)   New Casualty Enquiry Forms have been supplied to
          Operations Division for replacement of the current forms
          In the Major Incident Boxes throughout the Force.
(a)(11) This is a communications based recommendation which you
         may discuss at your meeting.
(a)(ill) I understand that telephones with headsets have been
          ordered by Communications Department - no doubt you would
          wish to raise this also.
(a)(lv) The Communications School is providing a skeleton Casualty
         Bureau staff for the RAF Finningley Display, but it Is
         unclear whether this is the result of a directive from
         Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) or the result
         of informal discussions between Casualty Bureau and
         Doncaster.    I am unable to trace a clear directive
         regarding this matter, perhaps you have some knowledge?
         If It has not been done, I would suggest it is still
         required.
2.       IN THE MEDIUM TERM (Approximately 9 Months)
(a)      At a meeting attended yesterday, a Chief Inspector from
          the Home Office Police Requirements Support Unit (PRSU)
          advised us that a new INTERPOL Form was being produced
          and I now recommend that we await for the production
          of this before these are used, in the intervening time
          we continue to use our existing forms. This Home Office
          Officer also indicated a meeting would take place to
          attempt to identify national standard forms in November
          of this year at Lancashire Constabulary. I now recommend
          persons from the Communications School and Operations
          attend this meeting.


                                          o
(b)     we shall continue to use our green forms until either
        a national standard is approved or computerisation takes
        place.
(c)     This is an item that I ani concerned is not apparently
         receiving the necessary priority. A survey has been
         undertaken on the work involved and I understand that,
         as the final figure was under £12,000, this is not
         Included in the Strategy Plan. Approval needs to be
         sought from the Home Office prior to work being commenced
         and it is unlikely that finance will 'be available until
         after April 1990. I would suggest that this item requires
         more urgency to enable telephone systems, when installed,
         to be connected into the enlarged room.
f(j)    Additional telephone lines are still needed and
         Communications Department are aware of this. These will
         be provided when the new telephone system is approved
         by the Police Authority but, if this is not the case,
         urgent provision needs to be made for these lines for
         Casualty Bureau use. Although we have 8 lines (4 for
         hospital use and 4 for public use)into the Casualty
         Bureau, all other communication is through the current
          <F< Division switchboard, which has limited number of
         lines and these are of course used by 1F' Division, 'F2'
         Sub-Division in addition to ourselves, whereas in April,
         Training Department had exclusive use of this switchboard.
         This matter is also therefore one of seme urgency.
3.       m THE LONG TERM (Approximately 12 Months)
(a)      I understand that steps are being taken to computerise
         the Casualty Bureau in time for the World Student Games.
         I see a need for Casualty Bureau personnel to be trained
         separately from HOLMES personnel and we will need to
         commence this training some timebefore the games
         commence. The quicker this system is installed, therefore,
         the more efficient the operators will be.
One further additional matter has arisen since the original report,
and that is the question of an emergency generator being provided
for the Casualty Bureau. I understand that steps are in hand to
linkthe Casualty Bureau Classroom only to theemergency generator
at 'F'Division.      It is considered that theprovision of power
to this one room only will be insufficient to provide power for
a computer system and also that other areas of the Training
Department will require power to function for any length of time.
You will recall that West Yorkshire set up their additional system
in another classroom, and it could be that a HOLMES System might
be used in one of the other classrooms. Perhaps consideration
could be given to a separate emergency generator for Training
Department use.

SUBJECT:     CASUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU




     On Friday 28 April 1989, I attended a meeting in Chief
     Superintendent Nesbit's Office, together with representatives
     from Operations Division and those involved with the mortuary
     facilities during the Hillsborough Disaster, to examine our
     post-disaster procedures and consider any recommendations
     for   the future.     The minutes of that meeting will be
     circulated   in   due   course, but  I was  asked   by Chief
     Superintendent Nesbit to submit a report identifying the
     main, areas involving the Casualty Bureau's role as a result
     of the incident.

     I list the following points:'

     1.     TRAINING

            Despite all the comments which follow there is one
            area which should be brought to your attention and
            that is that, on the day, the manual system worked
            and was   efficient.     This is down to the   training
            that has taken place over the years both in Casualty
            Bureau   operation   and   for  the   Hospital  Liaison
            Officers and that we should continue training on
            the current system until such time as the following
            suggestions are considered.

    2.      SPACE

            The location, of Ecclesfield was very good.    There
            was plenty of peripheral space for ad-hoc meetings,
            rest  areas,  canteen facilities  and car parking.
            I would   suggest weretain this building    for the
            Bureau.

            The classroom in Communications School was obviously
            too small and had a number of drawbacks;      we ran
            out of space on the wallboards and finished up
            writing on the Venetian blinds. The total number
            of injured and dead was approximately 240 and we
            should, allow for at least 500 in total.  Wall space
            would not be required with a computerised system
            (see later), but additional space would still be
            needed for the computer.
 The excess of persons in the room and the             noise
 generated created difficult working conditions.

 The position of the door and access onto the computer
 floor tended to allow persons to congregate at a
 point          near  the door, obscuring some of  the
 w a l l b o a rd s .

The   use   of   Ecclesfield reduces the options for
increased    room     size  to   that   building.     It  was
originally suggested that the current Seminar Room
should be converted,, but this does not have computer
flooring and the number of wires for telephones,
computer wiring etc, would be excessive without such
flooring.     A.    suggestion    has    been    made    that
consideration be given to knocking 2 of the computer
classrooms     into    one  and   redividing    it with     a
sound-proof partition. This would create double the
space and also provide the necessary floor.            I have
already arranged for buildings to attend with an
architect    to     assess   the    feasibility    of    this
suggestion.

COMMUNICATIONS

Communications were the main problem.      At the time
of   the  incident   we  had 3 exchange lines into
Ecclesfield Training Centre and additionally there
are 2 links with For.ce Headquarters.     The Casualty
Bureau has provision for 4 exchange lines for members
of the. public and 4 exchange lines for police use
only from the incident site, mortuary and hospitals.
On each of these groups of 4, calls 'hunt' until
a vacant instrument is found.    We have a contingency
whereby   British   Telecom   will  provide   us  with
additional lines, and on the day of the incident
4 of these were requested at 4.15 pm and installed
at 7.00 pm.      Additionally, at this time, 2 fax
machines were provided direct with the hospital.

Now that    F'  Division and 'F2' Sub-Division have
joined the Training Centre, although the number of
exchange  lines   and Headquarters lines have been
increased we all channel through one switchboard.
Had the incident occurred after the 'F ' Division
move, and the Incident Room set up at 'F' Division,
there would have been very little ability for persons
within the Force to speak to the Casualty Bureau.
Some difficulty occurred with communication between
the hospitals and the Casualty Bureau, due mainly
to the number of calls which were being received
at the hospital, jamming their boards.       This was
eventually solved by the Casualty Bureau keeping
an open line to their officers at hospitals, not
a satsifactory solution for both ourselves and the
hospitals.    When the fax machines were .installed
communication was considerably better and there was
no need to verbally give details over the telephone,
thus improving accuracy.   There still needs, however,
to be some verbal communication, in addition to fax.

Communications   with  the   temporary   mortuary  at
Hillsborough also proved difficult.     They had one
portable telephone which needed an electrical socket,
the same socket was being used for a photocopying
machine.

The noise level in the room has been mentioned, as
the telephones currently used are hand-held handsets,
which create difficulties when writing and with noise
levels.   There needs to be some method of headset
provided   and   this would  be essential following
computerisation,   as the operator would need both
hands free for the keyboard.

We need    to look carefully at telephone lines
increased space would provide facilities for a larger
number of telephones which in turn need more lines.
The number required for the public is a very unknown
quantity.   With a crowd of 54,000 at the Hillsborough
Match, there was a potential for at least 54,000
calls from Nottingham and Liverpool, but no system
could cope with this number in the first 1 0 hours.
There is an argument to say that increased telephone
capacity will generate excessive work and that some
delay in getting through will give the Bureau some
time to take fewer calls in a more orderly manner.
If computers are used (see later) every telephone
line would require a V D U .     I personally consider
that 1 0 lines for the public are required, although
Mr |         |, who has been responsible for.the Bureau
for a number of years, would argue for a higher
number.   Certainly the fax machines at the hospitals
are a 'must', but whether these should be permanently
installed or be provided on standby with the hospital
stationery is an area for discussion and finance.
COMPUTERISATION
The West Yorkshire Police offered us the use of their
portable 'Crisis' Casualty Bureau Computer System,
which was accepted and their team, consisting' of
7 operators, plus 4 HOLMES operators from our Force,
arrived at approximately 9.30 pm and were up and
running by approximately 11.00 pm.       At this time
they commenced a back record conversion on. all of
the dead and injured persons notified to the Casualty
Bureau    and they followed this by inputting the
enquiring relatives and friends details.      The main
workload in the Bureau lasted until Sunday evening
and the manual system coped with this sufficiently.
 It was about this same time that the back record
 conversion onto the Crisis Machine was completed
 and thus there was no need to switch from the manual
 system to the computer.   The computer did, however,
 provide us with management information and was able
 to sequence the information it held in any format
we required.     This facility was later used, after
 the computer team had left, through West Yorkshire,
 to   provide  details  of  700  persons   about  whom
 enquiries had been made and who were not casualties.
 (These details were subsequently passed to other
 Forces for them to confirm that the persons were
 safe and well).

One difficulty with computerisation was due to some
entry errors, whereby I                     from the
incident site and                         ' from the
hospital, were identified as 2     separate persons,
whereas the manual system would have clarified this
position.   Due to this, at one time the computer
produced a total of 99 dead when it was known there
were 94.

Had the computer been used from the commencemept
of the Casualty Bureau and operators typed details
from telephone calls directly onto the VDU, I have
no doubt that we could have been even more efficient.
This would have been particularly noticeable had
we encountered identification problems such as    the
Bradford Fire where identification took place from
dental records.
 The HOLMES Computer used in. the Incident Room set
 up at Hammerton Road was used to identify the dead
 and details of descriptions were entered onto that
 machine.    A number    of names were not released to
 the Casualty Bureau until positive identification
 had been made via the relatives,         thus both the
 Casualty   Bureau    and    the   Incident   Room    were
 duplicating work.      On Tuesday 25 April       1989, I
 attended    a meeting     chaired by   Detective    Chief
 Superintendent Addis, which was also attended by
 2 persons who are writing a Major Disaster Plan on
 behalf of ACPO and the Home Office.      Their view was
 that the Casualty Bureau should deal with casualties
 only and the dead be dealt with by a separate
 Incident Room as. evolved in our situation.

 I believe we should have some link into the HOLMES
 System as against a 'stand alone' system like West
Yorkshire's 'CRISIS', in order that Casualty Bureau
 and   the   Incident   Room   can   access   the  same
information.     Details of the injured are required
by the Incident Room for use as subsequent witnesses
and the Casualty Bureau need access to details of
the dead. I would       recommend looking towards such
a system with data lines from the Mobile Incident
Room to the fixed Casualty Bureau.      At present many
people can be trained to take telephone calls and
complete Casualty Enquiry Cards by hand.     A computer
system would require trained keyboard operators over
and above those dedicated to the HOLMES System. We
would need to keep these trained personnel separate.

DOCUMENTATION

This Force uses the Green and White Cai?ds (APPENDIX
 A ) in the Casualty Bureau for enquiries from the
hospital and relatives and friends.        The officers
at the hospitals complete the paper duplicate        form
(APPENDIX 'B') and these should also be completed
at the Mortuary.      During the printing,    these forms
should   have been printed     on NCR selfcarbonating
paper,, but were not.    It appears that these are not
the forms which are provided in the Major Incident
Boxes    at  Divisions    andconsequently      were not
initially used at the temporary mortuary.
             There is clea rly a need to have one form.

              Should the major incident be international, the forms
              for the dead should be the pink form 3136A - approved
             by INTERPOL.      This has index numbers on the left
             hand side which are the same irrespective of the
             language in which the form is printed (APPENDIX 'C').
             This form has been reprinted by West Yorkshire and
             is used by them for body identification at the scene.
             A   copy  of   the   West Yorkshire Form is in the
             possession   of    Chief  Superintendent Nesbit.     I
             recommend   consideration be given to us using a
             similar form for the dead in future.         We could
             purchase thes'e from Leicestershire Constabulary who
             I understand hold the national stock of INTERPOL
             Forms or print our own.

ft           When West Yorkshire attended they requested that
            we    use  their   yellow   card   (APPENDIX   ’D') for
             completion by the telephone operators speaking to
             the public.   This was done to assist their computer
             entry, as the information it requested was similar
             to our manual, green card.    It was evident, however,
            that morale in the Bureau dropped due to requiring
            them    to complete   a card with which       they were
            unfamiliar.   The West Yorkshire card is used mainly
            as an index reference and any person still reported
            missing is followed up by a visit from a police
            officer completing a yellow form (APPENDIX ’E ') taken
            from the INTERPOL yellow form 3I36B (APPENDIX 'F1).
            I have reservations regarding the yellow forms which
            need to be considered carefully against our existing
            or possibly, revised documentation.

     I make the following recommendations in relation      to   the
^    Casualty Enquiry Bureau, in order of urgency:

     1.     IN THE SHORT TERM:

                     That the current manual system be initially
                     retained with the following amendments:

            (i)     That the forms in the Major Incident Box
                    for the dead be replaced by the Casualty
                    Enquiry Forms attached at APPENDIX ’B ’ and
                    the carbon paper supplied with them, by
                    Operations   Division.     (These   are now
                    available at Training Department) .
         (ix)     That telephone and fax links with hospitals
                   are urgently reconsidered by Communications
                   and Computers.

         (iii)    That telephones with headsets be provided
                   instead of the current' hand-held receivers
                   by Communications Department.

         (iv)     Consideration     be given to identifying a
                   skeleton    staff   situated  in the Casualty
                   Enquiry Bureau on all major events e.g.
                   RAF   Finningley,    Semi-Finals  etc.    This
                   should   be    written   into  any Operational
                  Order.     This would minimise time taken to
                   physically set up the Bureau.        This fact
                   should be circulated to appropriate persons
                  by Assistant Chief Constable (Operations).

2.      IN THE MEDIUM TERM (APPROX 9 MONTHS):

         (a)     The current   'body forms' (a(i) above) be
                  replaced  by   the  Pink INTERPOL Form or
                  similar and these used in the mortuary,
                  to be attached to the body.

         (b)     That we continue to use our Green Forms
                  for public enquiries until computerisation.

         (c)     That work commence on knocking through 2
                  classrooms to form one large room in the
                  Communications  School,  with a soundproof
                  removeable partition replacing the wall.

         (d)     That additional telephone      lines   into   this
                  new room be provided.

3.      IN THE LONG TERM (12 MONTHS):

         (a)     Consideration should be given to
                  computerising the Casualty Enquiry Bureau
                  with an extension to a HOLMES System and
                  operators (separate from HOLMES operators)
                  be   trained  to   work  the   system.     The
                  installation,   training   and   accommodation
                 must be completed before the commencement
                  of the World Student Games.




I submit this report for your information and consideration.
You may wish Detective Chief Superintendent Addis to have
sight for his views.

           NO. 2 (N.E.) REGION ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLES’
           (OPERATIONS) CONFERENCE




 Following our attendance at the meeting at Bradford Police Station,
 West Yorkshire, on Wednesday 6 September 1989, you requested that
 a 'Note for File' be produced covering what occurred.
Together with yourself. Superintendent Parker (Communications 5
Computers), Mr           (Communications Training School) and myself
attended the above meeting. The first half was devoted to the
West Yorkshire Police demonstrating their Casualty Enquiry Bureau
System which is run on the MacDonald/Douglas 'CRISIS' Computer
System. As this was the portable system brought to South Yorkshire
immediately after the Hillsborough Disaster to assist our manual
Casualty Bureau, we were fully aware of its capabilities.
The same difficulties were identified then, as now, in that this
is a 'stand alone' system and is not linked in any way to the HOLMES
Major Incident System and any transfer of data has to be undertaken
manually.      In reports submitted immediately following the
Hillsborough Casualty Bureau it was identified that this Force
should aim towards a computerised system which is linked, or at
least compatible with, a HOLMES and I understand from Superintendent
Parker that this is being actively considered in time for the World
Student Games. Our HOLMES is manufactured by Honeywell — Bull
and they do produce a linked Casualty Bureau package compatible
with their HOLMES.
The second part of the presentation was by Chief Inspector Peter
Todd of the Home Office Police Requirements Support Unit (PRSU).
This officer, together with another person, has been given the
task by the Home Office of attempting to standardise Casualty Bureau
Systems throughout the country. His work appears to cover the
following areas:
          Volume of Calls from the Public
         They are researching methods of accepting a high volume
         0^ Public calls as the result of major disasters by use
         of British Telecom personnel, 'laying off' calls from
         one Force to other Forces in the Region and other similar
         methods.
2.       Transfer of Data to Host Force
         The above would require transfer of the information back
         to the host Force and inclusion on a HOLMES Investigation
         System. They are considering this could be done by a
         new generation of PNC amongst other possibilities.
3.           Standardisation of Forms
             All Forces througout the country have their own variation
             of Bureau and Casualty Forms, although sane are dictated
             by computer systems already in use.
             It was pointed out at the meeting that the standardisation
             of a neational form was of more Immediate importance
             than computerisation but It was accepped that all Forces
             considered they required different Information and a
             definitive agreement would be difficult. To this end,
             however, it Is understood there will be a meeting at
             Hutton Hall, Lancashire Constabulary, in November to
             attempt to devise a national form. I would suggest that
             we have representation at this meeting from the Casualty
             Bureau and possibly Operations Division.
Chief Inspector Todd and his colleague are touring all Forces to
discuss these matters and arrangements have been made for him to
contact this Force in the near future and It Is suggested that
Communications and Computer Training School attend these meetings.
In Informal conversation, a suggestion was made that perhaps PRSU
may like to use the World Student Games as an experimental base
for trying out some of their Casualty Bureau ideas in the future.
This possibility will be explored.
I attach hereto a report submitted on 3 May 1989 which suggests
various amendments to our system In the light of Hillsborough.
I am still satisfied that we should continue with our system as
at present, but move towards the situation Indicated in this report
and that we should not deviate from this until such time as a way
forward is clearer nationally.
Chief Inspector Todd did Indicate that a new pink INTERPOL Form
was In the process of being produced anc1 I would therefore suggest
that Item 2A on the attached report recommending that we commence
the use of this form be delayed until such time as a new form is
identified.
This Note for File has been compiled by myself and is being passed
to Superintendent Parker for any additions or amendments he would
wish to make prior to being passed to you.

C A SUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU - H I L L S B O O R U G H INCIDENT


1.     I was tel ephoned at home at about 3.20 pm and was the last
        in a line of 'call outs'.   A number of those 'on call' were
        already at the match.    We need a more structured assurance
       for being able to contact someone who knows how to physically
        set up the Bureau. Civilians?
2.     I found' the equipment c on fusingly labelled which resulted
        in the wrong telephones being inserted in the wrong sockets
       until the at tend a n c e of Mr     |.

3.    I had some d i f f i c u l t y in e s tablishin g the number for the public
       to ring and this should be promin e n t l y displayed in the room
       concerned.

4.    It was clear the room was not big enough. People were falling
       over each other in the c onfined spaces and the movement of
       f u r n i t u r e i.e. tables and desks and students' books added
       to the confusion.          A purpose built large room with all the
       equipment already installed is the ultimate answer, but such
       a luxury wou ld p r o b a b l y never be used for a number of years,
       other than for training purposes.          It would gradually be used
       as a 'spare room'.          I would suggest the current Seminar Room
       be converted to the Cas ua l t y Bureau.

5.    The        above           sugges tion would   occur   whether   there    is
       co m p u t e r i s a t i o n or not. If there is to be a delay in acquiring
       a computer then urgent provision needs to be made for boards
       around the walls for the operation of the manual system.
6.    I was happy with our cards on the manual system, however,
       they did take some time to fill in which restricted the number
       of calls. With 95 dead at this stage, out of a crowd of 54,000
       there was the potential of at least 54*000 telephone calls
       within the first 2 hours and no system could cope with this
       type of volume, unless it was arranged by British Telecom
       themselves using their operators.     Perhaps this 'contracting
       out' should be considered as a filter.

7.    The limitations of the room meant we ran out of wall space
       to wr ite out names of casualties and also that an important
       board contai n i n g descriptions only was situated near an
       en t rance door w here it was m ask ed by visitors and supervisors.
8.    The T r a inin g Cent re is a good location.              The Canteen and
      w e l f a r e facil ties and its location away           from Hillsborough
      we r e good.
If we are to be linked to the Ecclesfield Switchboard in future
and a n o t h e r m a j o r incident occurs in this Division, however,
that s w i t c h b o a r d m a y not be capable of handling the incident
and the C a s u a l t y Bureau.        We need to reconsider the use of
s e p a r a t e switchboards.
T h e ’hospital n u m b e r 1 appeared to be released to members of
the p u b l i c as was the Training Centre number. This was evident
due to the calls received on these lines. How this occurred
is u ncert a i n , but it prevented the hospital officers providing
us w i t h details of the casualties.       The ideal answer to the
hospital situation is the installation of fax machines at
all the hospitals linked to the Ca sualty Bureau and the paper
p r o d u c e d by these machines used as Casualty Cards - can they
be p r i n t e d on card?

T he c o n f u s i o n at the temporary m o r t u a r y is appreciated and
d e t a i l s of identified dead did start to come through in the
m i d d l e of the night.       It seems, however, that when the bodies
w e r e m o v e d to the m o r tua ry that information flow ceased and
we         had a situatio n on the Sunday when the Casualty Bureau
b e l i e v e d about 40 bodies were still needed to be identified,
y e t it is und erstood the position was that only 9 were unknown.
T h e r e needs to be some link from any computer used to index
the bodies back to the Casualty Bureau, in order that
d e s c r i p t i o n s and eventually names are known, as soon as
possible.
It   was due to this lack of information that we were          unable
to pass anything concrete to Liverpool Casualty Bureau and
at the e a r l y stage of receiving information we did not have
the s taff or facilitie s to do this.          In retrospect we were
not aware that Liverpool had set up a Casualty Bureau and
they could have p r o bably been used m o r e effectively. However,
the p a s s a g e of information from Liverpool to the central point
of   Sheffield, which would have been m a inly enquiries could
not have been satisfied by the lack of information and the
staff and resou rces to receive this enquiry information in
the early stages would have been wasted.

The situat ion regarding meals etc was good, the canteen staff
p r o v i d i n g a good service.     Difficult y was found in getting
the heating switched on for the night time, it now being
c o n t r o l l e d from the new Ecclesfield Station where the Janitor
was not found.             This required the installation of portable
heating.
The Crisis C o m p u t e r S ystem comm enced w o r k i n g approximately
11.00 pm to 11.30 pm on a back record conversion and this
e x e r c i s e took them until the e v en ing of S unday to start running
parallel w i t h the manual system.                    The e n q u i r y (missing from
home) cards used by We st Y o r k s h i r e w e r e not                  liked by the
t e l e p h o n e opera t o r s , they consid ered there was insufficient
information.             T h e y did, however, r educe the length of time
taken by each t e l e p h o n e cal 1.             Their cards are backed up by
m o r e d e t a i l e d m i s s i n g f r o m home forms.' We need to look more
c a r e f u l l y at these a dminis t r a t i o n proce dures to identify which
is the m o s t e ffect ive.
S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Ray Evans           of West York s h i r e and his team
e s t a b l i s h e d e x c e l l e n t relati o n s h i p s with our Force and the
e x e r c i s e of w o r k i n g together was worthwhile.
The u l t i m a t e should be a computer.            This m u s t be capable of
input of i n f o r m a t i o n direc t l y onto the VDU's by trained
operat ors. T h i s woul d have e l i m i n a t e d a back record conversion
and would have not neces s i t a t e d the completion of cards.
This m a c h i n e needs to be linked in some way to HOLMES, in
o r d e r that .details of injured (who will subsequently be
witnes ses) and d e t a i l s of dead for C a s ualty Bureau use can
be i n t ercha nged.         Such   a syst em would require dedicated
officers as is c u r r e n t l y     the case with the HOLMES System.
I would           suggest, however, that the C a s ual ty Bureau remains
in one p l a c e and d a t a links esta bl i s h e d to a portable HOLMES
System.
C o m m u n i c a t i o n s w e r e diffic ult.   There        appeared to be only
one v o d o p h o n e to the m o r t u a r y and diffi c u l t i e s at the hospital.
C o n tac t with the hospital was establish ed by leaving the
t e l e phone line open. This would, not have helped the hospital.
We need to e s t a b l i s h other methods.
Four lines f r o m the p ublic appear insufficient, however, more
would r e q u i r e m o r e operators. The number of lines required,
however,      can never be estimated. I consider we should have
at least       8 or 10 for m e mb ers of the public. (Liverpool have
10) .

All the staff w ork ed t r e m e n d o u s l y under c o n siderable pressures
and I have no c r i t i c i s m w h a t s o e v e r of any of the personnel
that were involved at Ecclesfield.                    It was clear that in
addition to the actual Bureau staff, there was a need for
peripheral staff to arrange f u t u r e manning, food, welfare
etc.
Some perso ns enter i n g hospital w e r e m issed by the Hospital
Teams. I s u spect they were, rushed through into Theatre without
full adm ission being completed at the time of entry.         This
resulted in us not identifying persons critical ly ill until
        after the m a i n     bulk of enquiries. .Conversely we found on
        a 'sweep u p 1 we     had been given the names of 2 persons admitted
        to hospital at        the time of the disaster patients who were
      : not in fact f r o m   that location.

21.    It took s o m where in the region      Of 5 hours for British T e l e c o m
        to install the additional lines into the Seminar Room.             This
        needs to be speeded up in some w a y - cannot the lines be laid
        and m e r e l y connected, as required?

22.     T h e tele phones want amending to purpose made telephones having
        fa c i l i t i e s for plu gging in earphones, as the noise level and
        the need to hold the handset caused problems.             These would
        be essential if we computerised.

23.    T h e r e is an urgent need now to provide boards in the Seminar
        R o o m which have been used for              other purposes over the yea rs
        and to e s t a b l i s h t elep h o n e lines to that room in addtion to,
        or in place of, the other Bureau - could the lines be switched
        from one room to another by one simple switching device?
24.     Errors w e r e m a d e in the transcri ption of information f r o m
        cards to lists and messages, pa rtic u l a r l y when p e ople were
        tired.            The placin g of the information onto a compu ter or
        word p r o c e s s o r w hich would guarantee there was no need to
        t r a n s c r i b e would reduce this problem.    It was found, however,
        that the West Y o r k shire S y s t e m was not as accurate as was
        hoped, it identified 99 dead when it was known m a n u a l l y there
        w e r e 94 and this was done due to dupli cation w h e r e a name
        did not EXA C T L Y match i.e.             ||          |       as against
                              A similar si tuation occurred   with regard to some
        casualties.

          CASUALTY BUREAU - TRAINING EXERCISE 23 OCTOBER 1988




The following points arose from the above exercise when the Casualty
Bureau was activated at Ecclesfield Training Centre:

1.        The Casualty Bureau 'call out ' system worked well, with
           the Bureau up and running within one hour.     (Add on 45
          - 60 minutes for Training Staff to be called out).

2.        It soon became evident that operators will require multi-
          role training in future instead, as in the past, being
           trained to do just one job.

3.        The Fax Machine which had been installed as an experiment
          worked well, providing communications between Ecclesfield
          and Doncaster Royal Infirmary.       This was connected to
           the night bell from the telephone exchange which may cause
          problems if a major incident occurs on a weekday, when
           all Training Staff will be working.      Can a Fax Machine
           be fitted to a separate outside line with a bell?

4.        A Command and Control Terminal logged onto the live file
           was installed in the Bureau as an experiment.     It became
           evident that several names of casualties had been entered
           onto the extended incident on Command and Control PRIOR
           to the Casualty Bureau going live.   These names were never
          passed to the Bureau when it became operational contrary
           to Section 23, Page 4, of the Major Incident Manual.

5.        The requirement for a Command and Control Terminal needs
           consideration, as the officer in charge (Inspector Dews)
           did not use it, preferring to act only oa naiuea entering
           the system in the normal manner.       If it is felt that a
           terminal is required, it may have to be sitec. elsewhere
           and be monitored by a trained operator who will also be
           responsible for sending/receiving He...sage Switch messages.

6.        If rdore British Telecom lines had utea necesyaty who would
           the Bureau staff have contacted as all Connaunicatione
           Staff were at the scene?

7.        The officer in charge (Inspector Dews) stated that although
          comiaunications were good the liaison with Doncaster Royal
          Infinaary was    poor,  with  little information flowing,
          resulting in little pressure being applied to the Bureau
          staff.

8   .     The new Casualty Forms used for the first time did not
          present the staff with any problems except for one question
          which was considered to be ambiguous.
I request that this report be forwarded to the Chief Superintendent,
Operations and Traffic Division, so that the points can be discussed
at a de-briefing to be held at Headquarters on Thursday 10 November
1988.

                      (for Superintendent Anderson)

                 SUBJECT:     CASUALTY BUREAUX




                 I have been made aware that Mr Dyer, the Chief Constable of Bedfordshire
                 is heading a Working Party on 'Emergency Procedures',

                 An area of particular Interest to us is that of computerisation of Casualty
                 Bureaux. The British telecom facility which could cope with 3,400 calls at
                 any one time is being evaluated and the possibility of Home Office funding
                 for the relevant research is being pursued. I will keep you informed of
                - developments.

                 On reading the last minutes clearly there needs to be co-ordination with.
                 CID.  In view of that I have asked Detective Chief Superintendent Addis
                 if he could make arrangements for Detective Superintendent Burdis to be
                 involved in the work of your Group, and I have forwarded a copy of the

a    Superintendent Anderson welcomed everyone and went on to explain the purpose of
W    the meeting and the interests of the particular departments represented.
     Whether it be major incidents, emergency or contingency planning, it is the
     responsibility of Operations Room to see that our plans are correct, working and
     updated.

     Superintendent Anderson stressed that we were all working together as a team and
     he hoped that an input from all departments would produce a well planned system
     for Casualty Enquiry Bureau.

     The s i t u a t i o n o f t h e F o rc e t o d a te

    Discussion started with a de-briefing over the serious road traffic accident at
    Silkstone, Barnsley.   Chief Inspector Hepworth said that this accident had given
    the Force a chance to test the present system and a number of problems had been
    encountered. As a result of the incident, we have already amended our previous
     call out procedures and these have been circulated to Operations Room.   It was

•   also realised that the training given to operators in the past was not
    necessary in respect of recording calls from members of the public or police
    officers at hospitals.   It was also realised that the forms in use were far too
w   complicated and asked for too much detail in the first instance.   By shortening
    the form it would be possible to reduce the amount of time spent on each phone
    call.

    Superintendent Parker referring to obtaining sufficient details on first enquiry
    expressed doubt at whether in an International incident, we could phone people
    back and he said that we should be careful how much we cut out of the initial
    form.  Inspectors Edmundson and Powell explained that, having read the reports on
    the Bradford Fire Disaster and Zeebruge Ferry Disaster, it was apparent that
    there was no necessity to ask the caller for lots of information in the first
    instance and that if detailed descriptions were required, this would be done by
    a victim identification team.   It had been found that information given over the
    telephone could be wrong in the heat of the moment but, nevertheless, in good
    faith.  This information could then be very misleading and it was better to
    obtain information face to face from relatives.   Superintendent Anderson agreed
    and said that during the Zeebruge Disaster the average telephone call at first
    was 7 minutes duration and they reduced that rapidly after cutting the amount of
    information required.  They found much of the information they had initially
                                     - 2 -


gathered was inaccurate and had been a waste of time.   The initial phone call
should be short and sharp.

P S a g r e e d     andmentioned a training film produced after the Mount Erabus
Disaster and said it was a superb film for training purposes. Chief Inspector _____
Creaser agreed.

A dicussion then took place as to what the terms of reference for the Casualty
Bureau should be, in the light of the fact that Sheffield will host the World
Student Games in 1991.  Superintendent Parker said that the Bureau was to
satisfy the public when making enquiries.  It was not toidentify the dead, that
was a function of the victim identification team.  It was agreed that the
Casualty Bureau was there to receive calls from the public and from the
hospitals etc, but it was not their job to tell enquirers whether or not their
relatives were dead or injured. The Bureau could inform callers that relatives
were safe and well, if this had been verified.

Superintendent Anderson said that we had to be careful that the Bureau did not
run the major incident.    The Bureau is an important part of any such incident
but there would be much   more going on at the scene, etc. The Bureau was there
to take part of the load away from Operations Room and the Control Rooms
involved.

A discussion continued about the Bureau's role and that of victim identification
teams. P S m e n t i o n e d the Bradford Fire Disaster where the two teams
worked closely together and as the Casualty Enquiry Bureau began to wind down,
the victim identification teams' work began to grow; they did, of course, use
the same data. P S w e n t        on to say that detectives had been used to
see relatives for an in-depth interrogation and completion of the Interpol
form. More accurate information had been produced by a personal interview
rather than a telephone conversation.  It was agreed that this was the avenue
that we should explore.

Inspector Powell said that Kent Police had hand picked personnel to do this type
of duty and she hoped that we would do the same. PS            said that
experience had shown that the uniform branch had been heavily committed in and
around the scene of the incident and CID personnel would be ideal and a benefit
to the Coroner. He believed that this was one of the areas where training could
be given.

Superintendent Parker disagreed and said that if the major incident was a crime
the CID would be heavily committed themselves.

 Inspector Edmundson agreed and said that it had been mentioned previously that C
 & V Squads might be suitable for this task, rather than CID. PS             said
 that in his report on the Bradford Fire Disaster he had recommended C & V Squads
 take an active part in any incident and receive some training about attending
 the scene of disasters and preserving evidence.   In the Bradford Fire a lot of
 evidence was lost as police officers did not know how to protect evidence at the
 scene, particularly in respect of badly burned bodies.   Superintendent Parker
 said it seemed to him the C & V Squads were ideal because of their expertise in
 interviewing people. They were a sort of in-between post between uniform
 officers and detectives.   Inspector Powell wanted to clarfiy what we expected C
 & V Squads to do, go to the scene, or do follow up enquiries regarding
 identification of victims.
                                     - 3 -


Inspector Edmundson stated that where there were only a few casualties then they
could do both jobs as they had done at Bradford.  The one body/one officer
system which seemed to work well.  If, however, there were many dead then we
should have to decide which job they should do.  Superintendent Parker said he
had reservations about CID doing Victim Identification because of their
involvement with the investigation itself.

Superintendent Anderson wanted to recap and asked the meeting the question that
if a plane crashed today could the Casualty Bureau cope as it is at present.  PS
     '    replied saying our present training was sufficient to cope and we would
open up a bureau and work it as trained.  He accepted that as a result of visits
to West Yorkshire and the Silkstone accident there were a number of areas which
we know are inadequate not least of which was communications. A much bigger
room on the first floor at Ecclesfield had now been set up with 4 telephone
lines, he was under the impression that more lines could be put in a very short
notice but Superintendent Parker said he thought we could have difficulty having
tried to get assurances for another contingency.  He said he would take it on
board and establish a contact with British Telecom with a view to getting
assurances in writing.

PS           continued that he believed the bureau could cope but Inspector
Powell said the problem would be getting sufficient staff to man it.  In the
daytime there was no problem because there was always a ready pool of officers.
They learnt from the Silkstone incident that you could ask anyone to man the
phones and fill in a form so long as the person running the bureau knew what he
was doing.  The problem would arise in the evening and night.

Superintendent Anderson asked how long it would take to set    up the bureau at
night.  Chief Inspector Hepworth said it would not matter if it took an hour or
so at night as there would be hardly any calls.  Inspector Edmundson disagreed
saying that the public and press would, in fact, find out very quickly and the
Bureau needed to be set up as soon as possible to relieve Operations Room which
would be heavily involved in running the incident itself.   Superintendent Parker
agreed and said that the problems at Barnsley from the Silkstone accident had
highlighted this. He said the pressure must be taken off the Ops Room and local
police stations as soon as possible - it was a must.

Superintendent Anderson said that we could set up the Bureau within 20 minutes
during the day but at night it would take up to an hour.   Inspector Powell said r;
we should put this into perspective and if a plane fell out   of the sky now Ops ^1
Room would not think about setting up a Casualty Bureau for   at least two hoursi y
Inspector Edmundson disagreed, the whole purpose of our major incident procedure
was to lay down what each person/departments responsibility was.   It was laid
down what the Inspector in charge of the Ops Room had to do so and one of his
tasks very high in priority was to call out the Casualty Bureau. This would be
within minutes not hours.

Superintendent Parker said that going back to communications he believed that 4     (
lines were not enough and we needed more - a figure of 10 was suggested. He
would endeavour to get assurances that these would be put in immediately.  It
might be that we would have to pay for this service but it was vital to have
more lines or written assurance that we could get them immediately on demand.
At Kent and Kings Cross they had used 30 lines and these were not enough. We
accept that our force is unlikely to get a disaster of those proportions but we
would need at least 10 lines.
                                                             - 4 -



R e v ie w o f p r o c e d u r e s i n t h e l i g h t o f r e c e n t d i s a s t e r s

Superintendent Anderson said we had already covered certain points but what did
we need to look further at and what lessons had been learned from recent
disasters.

PS           said there were areas where more training was needed and one of
them was the next of kin clerks and the index clerks.  From the Zeebruge
disaster they had 10 and 12 such clerks because of the volume of calls.
Inspector Powell said that they had not all been trained and there was some                j
difficulty although they tried to handpick them. They did use a lot of                     /
civilians and Special Constables in their bureau but we do not use either of
them.

PS           explained that he was to blame for this; he said when he first
started the training he did have a heavy commitment from civilians in the
Force.  It was a problem when it came to actually getting them to the training
and it was frightening to think that we might have an incident at night and we
would not get a response from civilians.   It worried him that he had no control
over the civilians. He accepted that they could do the job and some of them
were very good but the uncertainty of getting them to come was such that a
decision was made   to go over to Police Officers, mainly female, so there would
be a ready source   available on duty 24 hours a day.  So far as Special
Constables are concerned, ACC Mr Anderson was very keen a few years ago that
they should be employed in the Bureau and with that in mind they were utilised.
However, it was found this last year that it was a struggle to get them to
attend.  They came the first year and gradually dropped off.    I know there are
difficulties with   most of them working during the day but once when we asked for
8 we got 1. Due    to these problems, it was decided not to use Specials or
civilians.

Inspector Edmundson said that during a major incident Police Officers would be
at a premium and we should seriously consider using civilian staff.
Superintendent Parker agreed saying it would be considered.  Training Department
still had reservations and were asked by Superintendent Anderson to liaise with
Kent to see if they had any problems with either Specials or civilians.

Another problem at Kent was that all the lines from the hospitals were blocked
and the only way to get the information to the Bureau was to use police motor
cyclists as dispatch riders. PS          said it was written into the new manual
that motor cyclists should be considered for dispatch duties.  Superintendent
Anderson said the trouble was that there was only 30 of them and they could be
tied up with escorting ambulances, etc.

Superintendent Anderson then summed up by asking if there was anything else
which had been learned from recent disasters.  Inspector Powell said that we
certainly needed to revise the forms and review the trainining needs.  She also
said that Kent had found it necessary to put a Superintendnet in charge of the
Bureau.  This was mainly to keep out unwanted visitors, it was found with the
Zeebruge disaster that their bureau was beseiged by senior officers asking what
was happening and interfering with the running of it. The rank of Inspector was
not enough to put them off so a Superintendent would now take command. The
meeting thought that with our Bureau being on a limb at Ecclesfield we would not
get the same problem and therefore an Inspector would be a high enough rank to
                                                  - 5-



  take charge.  It was also agreed that the Inspector should have absolute
  authority to stop anyone from entering or interfering with the running of the
  Bureau irrespective of rank.

  C o m p u te ris a tio n

  Superintendent Parker outlined to the meeting that HOLMES were producing a
  package which would be available in the New Year for use on our existing
  equipment.  The cost would be £2,000 for the software but we would need to
  purchase some more hardware to supplement what we already have and this would
  increase the cost to around £8,000. He accepted that we already had a HOLMES      A
  system used for major crime but if we used their hardware it would greatly
  reduce their capacity and therefore their effectiveness.  He believed it was
  vital to purchase this equipment and saw no problems in getting the money from
  the Authority to pay for it in view of the forthcoming Student Games in 1991.
  It was, he said, essential that by then the Force had the best equipment
  possible to deal with any major disaster.  It was agreed that computerisation
                                                                                        >lsr
  was a must for the Casualty Bureau.

  Mr        described roughly what the package would include and said that early
  in the New Year there would be a demonstration of the equipment which he
  suggested that members of the meeting should attend.  The only problem he sees
  is who is going to work the system. He discounted the present HOLMES team
  running it as they might be involved in any investigation into the cause of the
  disaster.  The best idea would be to train a fresh team possibly the present
  training personnel involved in the Casualty Bureau.  This was agreed by the
  meeting.

  A discussion then took place about what information would go onto the computer
  and PS           produced the Interpol Form used for all major disasters.  He
  explained that although it may not fall within the duties of the Casualty Bureau
• •




  he ought to point out that we had only ten of the forms in the Force. More are
  available, but have to be obtained from Leicester.  He asked whether we ought
  to have our own stock and it was decided that it would be expensive to get a
  stock of these forms and as they could be obtained at short notice from Leicester
  we should leave it at that. Mr Anderson agreed saying that we could have a
  stock in the Force within two hours.   This would be in plenty of time as they
  were not used immediately but by the Victim Identification teams at a later
  stage.

  F u tu r e T r a in in g R e q u ire m e n ts

  This had already been discussed at some length earlier in the meeting.
  Superintendent Anderson summarised what had been discussed regarding training
  Inspectors and Sergeants and HOLMES teams.   It would have to be left for the
  time being until we had seen the HOLMES package that would then dictate what
  training was required.   The role of Hospital Liaison teams was mentioned and
  the fact that they had now been increased by bringing in Crime Prevention
  Officers.  There was a difficulty keeping pace with the movement of officers
  and the training of them. PS             said he sent out literature to them and
  attended their meeting to check if they had any problems with the hospitals.   It
  appeared adequate on paper but when tested all sorts of problems arise as they
  did at Barnsley with the accident at Silkstone. Community Liaison Officers had
  been asked to check with their respective hospital to see that they had got a
                                           - 6 -



    room and phone available in the case of a major incident but hospitals are
    cutting back and we are very much in their hands as to what facilities they
    provide for us.

    PS           said if a major incident was near to the boundary of our Force then
    some casualties  would go to hospitals in another Force area. Did we    send
    officers to the   hospital or did the Force in whose area the hospital was
    situated send their own officers on mutual aid to us, the answer to this question
    was not known and Inspector Edmundson was asked to contact surrounding Forces
    and check with them as to the correct procedure.

    Also mentioned was the value of    the caring services at any disaster.   The Red
    Cross were of tremendous help to    Kent and relieved officers of all sorts of

•   tasks.  We did not know exactly
    organise a meeting with them in
    with.
                                       what they could do and it may be of value to
                                       the future to see just what they can help us


    Finally, there was no other business and Superintendent Anderson went over the
    points he had asked people to look at and said he would not fix the date for the
    next meeting until we had been to look at the HOLMES computer package in the New
    Year.

    The meeting closed at 12.15 pm and Superintendent Anderson expressed his
    pleasure at the   progressthat had been made and thanked everyone for attending.

                  SUBJECT:    CASUALTY BUREAU



                     On Tuesday, 20 October 1987, the Casualty Bureau located at the
                     Training Centre, Ecclesfield was activated to deal with enquiries
                     relating to a serious road accident.

                     The Hospital Liaison Scheme was also brought into operation. As
                     a result it was found that certain features of the Hospital Liaison
                     plan were incorrect, i.e. the external telephone point had been
                     removed from the designated room.

                     Your attention is drawn to minute sheet dated 21 January 1986 from
                     Chief Superintendent Staff Services to Divisional Commanders
                     requesting that Hospital Liaison plans be reviewed and any amendments
                     or updates be dealt with (a copy of the minute sheet and details of
                     the Hospital Liaison plan as relates to your Division is attached).

                     I would be grateful in the light of recent experience if your plans
                     could once again be validated and any amendments completed as soon
                     as possible in consultation with the Hospital Administrator or his
                     representative.

                     The updated plan should be returned to the Training Centre, Ecclesfield
                     as a matter or urgency, please.

                        THE BRADFORD FIRE REPORT




I respectfully report in relation to the attached 'Bradford Fire Report'
and make the following observations:-




PART IV of the report deals with Casualty Handling and commences at
Paragraph 12.




PARAGRAPHS 12.1 TO 12.11 sets the scene of the incident and describes
the difficulty the Ambulance Service had in getting ambulances actually
to the scene due to being stopped by casualties who had escaped from
the ground.




It is noted that one ambulance carried 10 injured police officers to
Bradford Royal Infirmary.




It is also noted that due to pressure upon the Ambulance Service,
police transit vans were utilised to convey injured persons to
hospital.




The report indicates that Bradford Royal Infirmary reached saturation
point in 7 minutes and other hospitals were utilised.




In all, 12 ambulances were used and they conveyed a total of
241 incident related patients to several hospitals.
COMMENTS


Although the Casualty Bureau would obviously have concern regarding
the movement of patients, the above paragraphs deal mainly with the
operational problems experienced by the Ambulance Service and the problems
of transporting large numbers of casualties to hospitals.     This problem
will always exist when dealing with major fires, train crashes and the
like, but would probably not exist in a 'Big Jet' air crash.
We have practised a simulated incident in the Casualty Bureau
dealing with large numbers of casualties from a fire and the subsequent
transfer of casualties from one hospital to another.     It is interesting
to note that it took only 7 minutes for the major first line
hospital to reach saturation point, and other hospitals were very quickly
brought into action.




Training Department have Disaster Plans for the 5 main hospitals within
South Yorkshire, but it seems apparent that minor injuries could be
treated at 'cottage' type hospitals and even health centres.     It might
therefore be of value to list all the hospitals within the county and
to ascertain their capability and the major health centres.     If other
centres were utilised it would affect the number of officers trained
in casualty reception at the locations.     It is probable looking at
the number involved at Bradford, that more officers should be
trained in casualty reception and consideration given to providing
these officers from non-operational departments.




PARAGRAPH 13 deals with the hospital procedures and the forming of
teams at the hospitals.     It states that a Sergeant and five Constables
were sent to Bradford Royal Infirmary to operate as a 'hospital documentation
team'.     On arrival at the Casualty Department, the officers were
deployed into a crowd of about 150 people to obtain their
particulars.     The West Yorkshire Form MD1 was completed.   The forms
when completed were transferred to the Casualty Bureau at Bradford
by police motor cyclists.     The report makes comment that the Form MD1
was not adequate.




Difficulties experienced with the form are itemised as follows:-


(a)    Being in book form they tended to bend when written
        upon.


(b)    Requirement to use carbon paper proved cumbersome and
        inefficient.


(c)    The books had a tendancy to fall apart after original
        copies had been detached.


(d)    Each     book consecutively numbered with the same numbers
        1-50.




Comment is made that the police and hospital authorities were
recording situation details and by consultation between the
two, better recording was achieved.




Note is also made of hospital transfers and the need to establish
liaison teams at each hospital.




Problems noted were:-


(a)    Size     of casualty reception team too small to cope with
        numbers of casualties.


(b)    Poor     communication between the hospital and the
        Casualty Bureau.     (Insufficient telephone lines etc).
(c)        No member of hospital staff specifically nominated as
           Liaison Officer for the team.


(d)        Several hospital officials were demanding a variety of
           information from members of the team.


(e)        There was a definite need to standardise the documentation    used
           by the police, the hospital and ambulance services, in order
           to avoid duplication of effort.




COMMENTS


The procedures we have adopted require each Divisional Community Liaison
Inspector to utilise his staff for hospital liaison duties.        It is the
responsibility of the Inspector to train his team and maintain
liaison with his hospital.     Each hospital has provided an area
near to the Casualty Department for police officers to perform their
tasks.     It is likely that police staff would have to be increased to deal
with such a large number of casualties.      It is very doubtful whether
one Community Liaison Team would cope.




I make the following comments regarding the difficulty with
(a) the forms AND (b) procedures.     We would no doubt have similar difficulties
with the forms, ours being in book form and needs carbon paper.        However, our
books are numbered individually and the problems of duplicated numbers would
not arise.     The books we already have will suffice, but where a report is
required consideration should be given to producing an upgraded form.
(To be itemised later).




The South Yorkshire Police Hospital Liaison Teams all have experience within
the Casualty Departments of our hospitals.      These teams were deployed during
the NUM Dispute and considerable expertise was accumulated in both the
processing of casualties and liaison with hospital staff.      In my view it is
an unavoidable situation when both police and hospital staff are recording
particulars, each service having different priorities.      The report states
'a definite n e ed 1 to standardise documentation between the hospital,
ambulance and police.   It is appreciated that the West Yorkshire Police
have experienced problems with documentation, but I would argue that each
organisation has different priorities and our forms are likely to be more
comprehensive than either the hospital or ambulance would require.
The responsibility of identification rests with the police service and our
forms should be of a greater identification value.




The question of communication will always be a problem, in that our
hospitals have provided a telephone for police use.    However, only one telephone
is provided and if the incident is to be protracted then consideration
should be given to liaison with Communications Department for the
installation of further telephone lines.    (Bearing in mind that the
Casualty Bureau can only cope with 4 incoming calls at any one time).
Should this problem arise, then consideration should be given to transferring
documentation by using police motor cyclists.




The problem of interference by hospital staff in the duties of the
Casualty Liaison Team is recognised, as with the NUM Dispute, but with
patience and understanding this problem was largely resolved.     In this
regard the benefits of having an Inspector in charge of the team was
noted.




The procedures relating to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau so far as
South Yorkshire is concerned are practised regularly every year.     All training
documentation is retained for inspection.   After each training session
the list of trained personnel is produced and circulated to Training
Department and Force Operations Room.   The call out procedure of staff
for the Bureau is clearly stated and in the event of an incident, the Force
Operations Room would call out personnel, in accordance with pre-arranged
procedures.   The last update of trained personnel was produced in
December 1986.   By way of exercise, the Bureau is activated every
year to deal with casualties from the Sheffield Marathon.    This enables
training staff to practise and validate procedures as far as is possible.
It has been noted that the Bureau could improve its efficiency by having
two operators to one telephone and in the event of an incident, this
policy would be adopted.




MORTUARY ARRANGEMENTS


PARAGRAPH 15 deals with Mortuary arrangements and sets out the Temporary
Mortuary facilities which were provided, also the use of Coroner's
Officers at the Temporary Mortuary Site and deployment of identification
teams and detectives.




COMMENTS


So far as Training Department is concerned the actual choosing of
Temporary Mortuary Sites would fall within the operational control of the
incident.   However, due to our responsibilities to provide teams for
identification purposes, it is possible that staff would have to be
provided for this duty.     It was thought that the Community Liaison
Department would fulfil this role, however, it is now apparent that
there would be insufficient officers from that source.




The West Yorkshire Police attacked the problem of identification the following
day.   A team of 49 Constables and 6 Sergeants were assigned to the task.
Each officer being allocated a body.     All the bodies had been removed to a
Temporary Mortuary.     The bodies were then removed to the Mortuary by
independent undertakers and Post Mortems were performed, each body
being accompanied by an officer.




A similar procedure could be adopted within South Yorkshire.     These officers
being drawn forcewide.     However, it may be that consideration should be
given to the training of other non-operational staff in the role of assisting
both the Casualty Teams at the hospital and assisting and working under the
direction of Coroner's Officers at Mortuaries/Temporary Mortuaries.
These officers if prior trained, would be available to assist in the
role of Identification Teams.     These officers could include Crime Prevention
Departments, Data Protection, Firearms/Underwater Search and Constables
and Sergeants in Headquarters Administration Departments.       These officers
could be brought together and trained along with Community Liaison
Officers in this role.




I have spoken to PC             Coroner's Officer (Sheffield) who feels
that prior trained staff acting under his direction would be a
definite asset.    With consultation this could be operated forcewide.




Detectives were deployed to assist their uniformed colleagues to
suggest lines of enquiry etc.    These detectives were not prior trained
and it does not seem likely that they need any formal training.




PARAGRAPH 28 deals with the use of computers.


It notes that the following systems were available


(a)     Command and Control.
(b)     Major Incident Computer Application      (MICA).
(c)     Casualty Bureau and Identification Routines.
(d)     Word Processing.


It makes the following observations on each:-


Command and Control facilities available


1.         Incident Logging.
2.         Resource Monitoring and Deployment.
3.         Street Index.
4.         Reminder Systems for both Incidents and Resources.
5.         Management Information System.
6.         Major Incident Facility.


It notes that only about 30% of all messages were recorded on the
Command and Control System and taped radio messages provided a more complete
account.
Major Incident Computer Application (MICA)


This system was sited in the Major Incident Room and was used to assist in the
storing of information from any document.




Casualty Bureau


The report states that no facilities were immediately available, but
during the day following the incident, an ad-hoc system was
provided by the Force Computer Development Team.




Word Processing


A system was used and it was found particularly useful in the preparation
of a comprehensive report for H.M. Coroner.




COMMENTS


We have all the computer systems available to West Yorkshire, perhaps
in slightly different forms.




Our Command and Control System has the extended incident facility and
is available for any terminal to add information.




Our Major Incident Computer is the Burroughs Auto Index and would no
doubt be used within the Major Incident Room.




The Burroughs System would be used within the Casualty Bureau.




Word Processing facilities are available within the Force and could be
utilised in whatever sphere.
We have experimented within the Casualty Bureau in a training situation
in the use of the Burroughs Auto Index.      The test results were
encouraging and scope for increasing use of the Burroughs within the
Casualty Bureau exists.    A programme has been written specifically
for Casualty Enquiry Bureau duties and is now incorporated in the

training role.




PARAGRAPH 3^ sets out the recommendations and makes many operational
suggestions.     Many of these could be viewed alongside our own major incident
procedures.




Those recommendations which involve the Training Department are as

follows:-




PARAGRAPH 3^.5 deals with casualty handling and states:-


(a)       Casualty Bureau operating procedures i.e. siting/staffing
          and documentation should be regularly reviewed.


(b)       Up-to-date list of suitable premises for Temporary
          Mortuaries should be maintained.


(c)       The policy of allocating one officer to one body is to be
            commended.


Other recommendations fall outside Training Department and form
points of consideration for the Major Incident Manual.




COMMUNICATIONS


The Casualty Bureau should be equipped with additional telephones.


Consideration should be given to the installation of a direct line
between the major casualty receiving hospitals and the Casualty Enquiry
Bureau.
I submit the following points for consideration


(a)    Increase the number of trained staff to assist in Hospital/
       Mortuary Liaison Teams.


(b)    Divisional Support Units to be trained in the recovery
       of bodies from   scene of incident to mortuaries,
       in order to preserve identifying features.


(c)    Improvement of Casualty Recording as follows


       (i )     Retain current documentation for casualty
                recording, where incident involves many
                casualties, but few deaths.


        (ii)    Print and maintain stocks of 'INTERPOL' type
                casualty recording forms,     (See attached copies), for use
                where   identification by normal means     will
                prove   difficult.   (This form MUST be used if the incident
                involves foreign nationals).    Our Burroughs Computer
                has been programmed in line with this form
                and has the advantage of passing from the scene
                of the incident with the body to its destination.
                The form also includes basic requirements of a
                Post Mortem examination.


                The principles of the INTERPOL Form are exactly the
                 same as the current South Yorkshire Police Forms,
                but are far more comprehensive.     We maintain a small
                 stock of INTERPOL forms, but these would be totally
                 inadequate for a disaster of major proportions.
                 Further stocks would have to be obtained from the
                 Leicestershire Constabulary.     The forms comprise
                 the following


                 1.     Pink Forms - to record information regarding an
                        unidentified victim (prabably at the site of the
                        incident).
                              2.         Yellow Form - to record information regarding
                                         a missin person, believed to be a victim.


                               3.        White Form - Dental Comparison Report.


(d)          Develop the use of the computer within the Casualty Enquiry
              Burea.


(e)          Investigate with Communications Department the possibility of
              rapid installation of direct telephone lines from Major
              Casualty Reception Centres and the Casualty Enquiry
              Bureau.


(f)          Investigate with Communications Department the possibility of
              rapid installation of further telephone lines into the
              Casualty Enquiry Bureau.


(g)          In consultation with Stores Department increase the amount of
              protective suits to Community Liaison Teams.


(h)          Community Liaison Inspectors to ensure continued training of
              their staff in the role of Hospital/Mortuary Liaison Teams.


(i)          Request Superintendent Rand to visit our Casualty Bureau and
              give his presentation.

     3•       Matters Arising

     3(a)     Urban Action Monies
              The current situation regarding the availability of Urban Action monies for

              the year 1986/87    was   discussed.   Subject to availability and agreement,

              Divisions were asked how they would like to see the money allocated.            Chief

               Inspector Mordew outlined the current financial state and asked Divisions to

               continue to submit monthly schedules.       Divisions were reminded that VAT can

               be claimed back,   ie £500 could buy £575 worth of goods.          After a general

               discussion it was recommended that the ad hoc system should remain, with less
  *



       money allocated than as at present and that monies be divided between

       Divisions and Headquarters.


       ACTION:   Superintendent Pratt would communicate at the earliest possible
                 opportunity the level and distribution of Urban Action monies.



3(b)   Outdoor Projects
       Superintendent Pratt said that consequent upon a meeting in D e c e m b e r , a

       working party of police officers experienced in project planning would shortly

       be circulating guidelines on the rules to be adhered to on all police related

       outdoor projects.    The aim was to give guidelines that would benefit the

       individual police officer and safeguard the participants.


       ACTION:   Chief Inspector Mordew to provide a framework of guidelines for

                 consideration by mid-February.



3(c)   Winter Activities
       Chief Inspector Mordew said that after meeting representatives from Divisions

       the following winter activities for 1986/7 were being considered:

       Superstars competition;   indoor cricket; Supersplash competition;      pool.



       ACTION:   Chief Inspector Mordew to report progress to next meeting.



3(d)   Revision of Annual Competitions
       After discussion it was agreed that with the exception of boxing,         the remaining

       competitions were worthwhile.     Superintendent Pratt said that police sponsored

- ”    boxing would not continue in the same form as previous years.         A discussion

       took place on the games included in the annual Superkids competitions,            it

       was agreed that they were long-standing and that each Division would make

       any suggestions for different games to the next meeting.



       Following present practice in one Division, the use of YTS workers and the

       voluntary sector in police sponsored competitions was recommended.



       ACTION:   Chief Inspector Mordew to continue his discussions with the Amateur

                 Boxing Association and recommend future involvement,        if any.


                 All Divisions to bring to the next meeting their recommendations

                 for games to be included in the County Superkids competition.

       objectives for 1986.     All recognised in various ways the need to work towards

       resources did not allow all requests or needs to be given attention.



       ACTION:     Objectives to be reviewed at the next meeting.

       structure.



       ACTION:     Divisional Community Liaison Inspectors to be kept informed.



7.     Recruits One Day at Divisions

       Overwhelmingly, Divisions felt this exercise was worthwhile, with a minority

       view expressed that recruits should only come into Community Liaison after

       initial training.     Superintendent Pratt received a suggestion that all officers
should be attached to Community Liaison.    This matter to be discussed at

the next meeting.


ACTION:    Superintendent Pratt to inform Community Liaison Inspectors of any

           further recruit days at Divisions.    Discuss attachments at the next

           meeting.

unresolved problems had been encountered.       Divisions were asked to check

whether they required more supplies and if the forms were adequate.       An

up-date of call-out rota on a weekly/monthly basis and the contact point was

required to be supplied.


ACTION:    All Divisions are to ensure that the liaison with hospitals and

           the training of staff was of a level of readiness that an incident

           would be given an immediate response.



Any Other Business
Superintendent Pratt stated that equipment in the Cadet Store at Headquarter

was available for use by Divisions.



A letter from the Joint Educational Trust indicated that finance could be

provided for children who required financial support when family life was

disrupted.    Divisions to note.

                     SUBJECT:      HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY - SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989




                         I would like to take this opportunity of thanking you sincerely
                         for your considerable efforts whilst a member of the Casualty
                         Enquiry  Bureau  Team  over  the  weekend  of  the  tragedy  at
                         Hillsborough.

                         The efficiency of the Bureau was due to          the   dedication   and
                         conscientiousness of all the staff involved.

                         I sincerely hope that such a need for the Bureau does not take
                         place in the near future, however, we must continually seek to
                         improve the running of the unit.   It is appreciated that there
                         were difficulties with such things as the size of the room,
                         communications with hospitals and the mortuary and these will
                         be re-appraised.

                         I shall be pleased if you will consider what other areas should
                         be looked at and return the attached proforma to me with your
                         observations.    Should you prefer to discuss this matter with
                         Mr|           in the Communications School, by telephone, he will
                         be available on extension 206.

                         Thanking you again for your considerable efforts.

CASUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU            H I L L S B O O R U G H INCIDENT


      I was telephoned at home at about 3.20 gjnC and was the last
      in a line of 'call outs'.        A n umber of u t b s e 'on call' were
      already at the match.      We need a more structured assurance
      for being able to c o ntact someone who knows how to physically
      set up the Bureau. Civili a n s ?
2.    I found' the e q u i p m e n t c o n f u s i n g l y labelled which resulted |L,
      in the wrong teleph o n e s being inserted in the wrong sockets
      until the a t t e n d a n c e of Mr                 I
3.    I had some d i f f i c u l t y in e s t a b l i s h i n g the number for the public
      to ring and this should be p r o m i n e n t l y displayed in the room
      concerned.
                                                                                                /(As'
      It was clear the room was not big enough.                    People were falling
      over each other in the c o n f i n e d spaces              and the movement of
      f u r n i t u r e i.e. tables and desks and s t u d e n t s 1 books added
      to the confusion.               A p u r p o s e built large room with all the
      e q u i pment a l r e a d y installed is the ultimate answer, but such
      a luxury would p r o b a b l y never be used for a number of years,
      other than for t r a ining purposes.               It would g r a d ually be used
      as a 'spare r o o m 1. I would s u ggest the current Seminar Room,
      be converted to the C a s u a l t y Bureau.

      T he        above           sugge s t i o n w o u l d occur w h e t h e r there is
      c o m p u t e r i s a t i o n or not. If there is to be     a delay in acquiring
      a computer then u rgent p r o v ision needs to be made for

      I was happy with        our cards on the manual syftem, however,
      they did take some time to fill in which restricted the number
      of calls. With 95 dead at this stage, out of a crowd of 54,000
      there was the potential
                           iiiuiai  of

      out' should be c onsidered as a filter.

     --TRe limitations of           the room m e a n t we ran out of wall space j
      to w r i t e out names        of c a s u a l t i e s and also that an important ^

                                       and the C a s u a l t y Bureau. We need to reconsider the use of
                                       se p arate switchboards.

                                       due to the calls received on these lines. How this occurred
                                       is uncertain, but it prevented the hospital officers providing                l& r

                                       It was due to this lack of information that we were unable

                                       was not found.       This required the installation of portable

                       exercise took them until the evening of Sunday to start running
                       parallel with the manual system.         The enquiry (missing from
                       home) cards used by W e s t Yorkshire were not liked by the
                       telephone operators, they considered there was insufficient
                       information.       T h e y did, however, reduce the length of time
                       taken by each telephone call.         Their cards are backed up by
                       m o r e detailed missing from home forms.' We need to look more
                       carefully at these administration procedures to identify which
                       is the most effective.                                           ^

                       addition to the actual Bureau staff, there was a need for
                       peripheral staff to arrange future manning, food, welfare

                                             MAJOR INCIDENT - HILLSBROUGH 15 APRIL 1989



                                                      LIVERPOOL v NOTTINGHAM FOREST




        RUNNING OF THE CASUALTY BUREAU


        The   actual    running   of   the    Bureau           went       very       well.         ALL        those     involved          quickly        got       into    the
        system, got on well with each other and worked                               flat out.


        I believe the system would           have possibly                run better              had    it NOT been            running a l ongside the West
        Yorkshir e     Crisis   System.      (This        is    not       a    criticism           of    the West           Yorkshire           System       but    the    two
        DO NOT appear compatible).


        STAFFING                       Not enough staff overall.
                                       Certain ly         sufficient                to     man     the       telephones         but       could        have    d one      with
                                       half    as     many          again       (reserves)              to     act    as     reliefs        (for       meals,       smokes,
                                       etc,) and runners.


        TELEPHONES                     Certainly          not       enough           for    an     incident           of     this     size       but    obviously          the
                                       room    was        not       big       enough        to    take        more.        Whilst         other    telephones             were
                                       quickly       installed                in a nother          room,        this       served     only       to comp licate            the
                                       actual       running          as       'actions'           were        being    made     out        in    that        room without
                                       having       had    'sight'             of    the     incident          boards,         possible         less actions would
                                       have    been       made        out       if       these     operators           had     had    the opportunity                   to see
                                       the list of who was dead or                           injured.


        LIST OF DECEASED               Whilst       the        94     deceased             were        ALL     identified            in    just        over        24    hours
                                       (excellent),             details of                those    identified were very slow                           in being passed
                                       to     the    Casualty             Bureau           from        the     Medico         Legal       Centre.             This       again
                                       resulted       in       a    number           of    actions           being     made     out       unnecessarily.                 (This
                                       is not       a criticism of                   the C I D Officers                engaged        at    the Mortuary                in the
                                       identification as they probably had the worst job of the lot).


        LIST OF INJURED                The     list        in       the        main        was         accurate        BUT      there           were     a     number       of

                                       also    appeared             to    be        people        in    hospital        wh o    the hospital             had       on    their

                                       towards       the end of the enqui ry                            the hospital didn't seem as enthusia stic
                                       (obviously          they          too    would        be        inundated       with     telephone          calls).              Whilst
                                       we had Police Officers at                            the hospital              in the early part of the enquiry
                                       they    MAY     have         been        released           too early           (on     the Sunday          16 April             1989),
                                       we    were     unable             to    get        through        on    the     telephone           until        after       9.00    am

                   Obviously           Senior      Officers,             (above           the    rank        of   Inspector)             will    oversee
                   the    whole        operation         BUT        it    is     important             that       the    Bureau          Inspector       is
                   allowed        to       run    it.         If     more        than       ONE        is    seen       to     be    giving       Police

                   Bureau       is wound down.                 In this way we will AT ALL TIMES have a contact
                   to update the Bureau.

                   the major hospitals,                  the bureau/mortuary,                         the bureau/incident room.
                   There        should        also      be     FAX       facilities              at     the       same       locations.            It    is
                   important           that       all        updated           information             is made available                   to ALL those

 I refer to our telephone conversation of today’s date and would
 confirm as follows:
 The West Midlands Police are wishing to have a copy of the
 Operations Roan Racal Audio Tape for a period of 24 hours over
 the Hillsborough Disaster period. There are 27 channels on this
 tape and consequently 1,000 x 45 minute cassette audio tapes will
 be required to record this. These will, of course, be purchased
 by West Midlands for their use and Mr            will assist them
 in the technical copying process.
 Chief Superintendent Mole has stated that the Chief Constable
 would also wish a similar copy of the tape which will also take
 1,000 x 45 minute cassette tapes, costing approximately £400.00.
 South Yorkshire Police have such tapes 1n stock and I confirm
 that permission 1s granted to take 1,000 tapes from our tape
 recording interview stock and that you will make arrangements
 for these to be replaced at the next Bids Meeting.

                 SUBJECT:     CASUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU




                     On Friday 28 April 1989, I attended a meeting in Chief
                      Superintendent Nesbit's Office, together with representatives
                     from Operations Division and those involved with the mortuary
                     facilities during the Hillsborough Disaster, to ‘examine our
                     post-disaster procedures and consider any recommendations
                     for    the  future.    The minutes of that meeting    will be
                     circulated   in   due  course,. but   I  was asked   by Chief
                     Superintendent Nesbit to submit a report identifying the
                     main, areas involving the Casualty Bureau's rale as a result
                     of the incident.

                     I list the following points:'.

                     1-     TRAINING

                             Despite all the commentswhich follow there is one
                             area which should     be brought to your attention and
                             that is that, on     the day, the manual system worked
                             and was efficient.     This   is down to the training
                             that has taken place over the years both in Casualty
                             Bureau   operation  and   for   the  Hospital   Liaison
                             Qfficsrs anc* that    we should continue training on
                             the current system until such time as the following
                             suggestions are considered.

                     2.     SPACE

                            The location of Ecclesfield was very good.    There
»   •                       was plenty of peripheral space for ad-hoc meetings'
                            rest   areas, canteen facilities and car parking.
                            I would suggest we retain this building for the
                            Bureau.

                            The classroom in Communications School was obviously
                            too small and had a number of drawbacks;         we ran
                            out of space on        the wallboards and finished   up
                            writing on the Venetian blinds. The total number
                            of injured and dead was approximately 240 and we
                            should, allow for at least 500 in total.     Wall space
                            would not be required with a computerised system
                            (see later), but additional space would still be
                            needed for the computer..




Gen/2




                                                                a
  The., excess of .persons in the room and the         noise
  generated created difficult working conditions.

-w The position. o£ the door and access onto the computer
   floor tended to allow persons to       congregate at a
   point   near-  thedoor,  obscuring   some   of      the
   wallboards.

 The   use   of     Ecclesfield reduces the options for
  increased      room    size   to that  building.   It  was
 originally      suggested that the current Seminar Room
 should be converted,, but this does not have computer
 flooring and       the number of wiresfor telephones,
 computer wiring etc, would be excessive without such
 flooring.        A    suggestion has    been made.     that
 consideration be given to knocking 2 of the computer
 classrooms     into    one   and redividing     it with   a
 sound-proof partition. This would create double the
 space and also provide the necessary floor.          I have
 already arranged for buildings to attend with an
 architect    to     assess    the   feasibility   of   this
 suggestion.

 COMMUNICATION S

 Communications were the main problem.         At the time,
  of  the  incident       we  had 3 exchange lines into
 Ecclesfield Training Centre and additionally there
 are 2 links with Force. Headquarters.        The Casualty
 Bureau has provision for 4 exchange lines for members
 of the. public and 4 exchange lines        for police use
 only from the incident site, mortuary and hospitals.
 O n each of these groups of 4, calls 'hunt' until
 3. vacant instiruiiieiit is found.  We have a contingency
 whereby*  British       Telecom  will  provide   us  with
 additional l i n e s , and on the day of the incident
 4 of these were requested at 4.15 pm and installed
 at 7.00 pm.         Additionally, at this time, 2 fax
 machines were provided direct with the hospital.

Now that    s   Division and 'F2' Sub-Division have
joined the Training Centre, although the number of
exchange  lines   and Headquarters lines have been
increased w e all channel through one switchboard.
Had the incident occurred after the 'F ' Division
move, and the Incident Room set up at 'F‘ Division,
there would have been very little, ability for persons
within the Force to speak to the Casualty Bureau.
^anne difficulty occurred with communication between
tfcrse hospitals and the Casualty Bureau, due mainly
ter the "number of calls which were being received
      the hospital, Jamming their boards.      This was
bw n rua l ly solved by the Casualty Bureau keeping
arr. open line to. their officers at hospitals, not
i satsifactory solution for both ourselves and the
hospitals.      When the fax machines were installed
cannmunication was considerably better and there was
titr need to verbally give details over cite telephone,
tkms improving accuracy.     There still needs, however,
fccr be some verbal communication, in addition to fax.

Camunications     with  the   temporary  mortuary   at
KULLs borough also proved difficult. • They had one
pccrtable telephone which needed an electrical socket,
taa same socket' was being used for a photocopying
machine .

Thsa noise level in the room has been mentioned, as
     telephones currently used are hand-held handsets,
wirich create difficulties when writing and with noise
Labels.    There needs to be some, method of headset
provided   and   this would   be essential   following
computerisation,   as the operator would need both
hazsds free for the keyboard.

We    need  to look carefully at telephone lines -
increased space would provide facilities for a larger
number of telephones which in turn need more lines.
T h e number required for the public is a very unknown
quantity.    With a crowd of 54,000 at the Hillsborough
Jtacch, there was a potential for at least 54,000
calls from Nottingham and Liverpool, but no system
could cope with this number in the first 10 hours.
There is an argument to say that increased telephone
capacity will generate excessive work and that some
delay in getting through will give the Bureau some
 time to take fewer calls in a more orderly manner.
 If computers are used (see later) every telephone
 line would require a V D U .     I personally consider
 that 10 lines for the public are required, although
 Hr              who has been responsible for the Bureau
 for a number of years, would argue for a higher
 number.    Certainly the fax machines at the hospitals
 are a 'must', but whether these should be permanently
 installed or be provided on standby with the hospital
 stationery is an area for discussion and finance.

       There is clearly a need co have one form-

       Should che major incidenc be international, Che forms
       for che dead should be Che pink form 3136A - ^ p r o v e d

     . hand side which are che same
       language in which che form is princed         h4,-e and
       This form has been reprinced by West Yorkshire

                                         and Computers.

                           (j_.j_.j_)   That telephones with headsets be provided
                                         instead of the current'■hand-held receivers
                                         by Communications Department.

                           (iv)         Consideration be given to identifying a
                                        skeleton   staff   situated in the Casualty

                                        should   be   written   into   any Operational
                                        Order.    This would minimise time taken to
                                        physically set up the Bureau.       This  fact
                                        should be circulated to appropriate persons
                                        by Assistant Chief Constable (Operations).

                                        replaced  by   the Pink INTES.POL Form or
                                        similar and these used in the mortuary,
                                        to be attached to the body.

                            (t>)        That we continue to use our Green Forms
                                         for public enquiries until computerisation.

                            (c )        That work commence on knocking through 2
                                         classrooms to form one large room in the

                                         removeable partition replacing the wall.

                            (d)         That additional telephone     lines   into   this
                                         new room be provided.

                    3.      IN THE LONG TEBM (12 MONTHS):

                            (a)         Consideration should be given to
                                         computerising the Casualty Enquiry Bureau
                                         with an extension to a HOLMES System and
                                         operators (separate from HOLMES operators)
                                         be   trained  to   work  the   system.     The
                                         installation,   training   and   accommodation
                                         must be completed before the commencement
                                         of the World Student Games.

          NO. 2 (N.E.) REGION ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLES'
          (OPERATIONS) CONFERENCE




Following our attendance at the meeting at Bradford Police Station,
West Yorkshire, on Wednesday 6 September 1989, you requested that
a 'Note for File’ be produced covering what occurred.
Together with yourself, Superintendent Parker (Communications &
Computers), Mr           (Communications Training School) and myself
attended the above meeting. The first half was devoted to the
West Yorkshire Police demonstrating their Casualty Enquiry Bureau
System which Is run on the MacDonald/Douglas 'CRISIS’ Computer
System. As this was the portable system brought to South Yorkshire
immediately after the Hillsborough Disaster to assist our manual
Casualty Bureau, we were fully aware of Its capabilities.
The same difficulties were Identified then, as now, in that this
is a 'stand alone' system and Is not linked In any way to the HOLMES
Major Incident System and any transfer of data has to be undertaken
manually.     In reports submitted Immediately following the
Hillsborough Casualty Bureau It was identified that this Force
should aim towards a computerised system which Is linked, or at
least compatible with, a HOLMES and I understand from Superintendent
Parker that this Is being actively considered in time for the World
Student Games. Our HOLMES Is manufactured by Honeywell - Bull
and they do produce a linked Casualty Bureau package compatible
with their HOLMES.
The second part of the presentation was by Chief Inspector Peter
Todd of the Horn Office Police Requirements Support Unit (PRSU).
This officer, together with another person, has been given the
task by the Hone Office of attempting to standardise Casualty Bureau
Systems throughout the country. His work appears to cover the
following areas:
1.        Volume of Calls from the Public
          They are researching methods of accepting a high volume
          of public calls as the result of major disasters by use
          of British Telecom personnel, 'laying off' calls from
          one Force to other Forces In the Region and other similar
          methods.
2.        Transfer of Data to Host Force
          The above would require transfer of the information back
          to the host Force and inclusion on a HOLMES Investigation
          System. They are considering this could be done by a
          new generation of PNC amongst other possibilities.
3.       Standardisation of Forms

         All Forces througout the country have their own variation
         of Bureau and Casualty Forms, although sane are dictated
         by computer systems already in use.
         It was pointed out at the meeting that the standardisation
         of a neatlonal form was of more immediate importance
         than computerisation but it was accepted that all Forces
         considered they required different Information and a
         definitive agreement would be difficult. To this end,
         however, It is understood there will be a meeting at
         Hutton Hall, Lancashire Constabulary, in November to
         attempt to devise a national form. I would suggest that
         we have representation at this meeting from the Casualty
         Bureau and possibly Operations Division.
ChiefInspector Todd and his colleague are touring all Forces to
discuss these matters and arrangements have been made for him to
contact this Force In the near future and it Is suggested that
Cotmunlcatlons and Computer Training School attend these meetings.
In Informal conversation, a suggestion was made that perhaps PRSU
may like to use the World Student Games as an experimental base
for trying out some of their Casualty Bureau ideas in the future.
This possibility will be explored.
I attach hereto a report submitted on 3 May 1989 which suggests
various amendments to our system In the light of Hillsborough.
I am still satisfied that we should continue with our system as
at present, but move towards the situation indicated in this report
and that we should not deviate from this until such time as a way
forward Is clearer nationally.
Chief Inspector Todd did indicate that a new pink INTERPOL Form
was In the process of being produced and I would therefore suggest
that Item 2A on the attached report recommending that we commence
the use of this form be delayed until such time as a new form Is
identified.
This Note for File has been compiled by myself and Is being passed
to Superintendent Parker for any additions or amendments he would
wish to make prior to being passed to you.

          CASUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU - POST-HILLSBOROUGH
          RECOMMENDATIONS



Following a number of de-brieflng meetings regarding the above,
I submitted the attached report dated 3 May 1989 identifying a
number of areas which needed attention in the light of running
the Bureau following the disaster. These are divided into three
areas, the short term, the medium term (approximately 9 months)
and the long term (approximately 12 months).
Since submission of this report, a number of these areas have
received some attention and the current situation is as set out
below. I understand you would wish to discuss the communication
aspects at a further meeting.
The following action has been taken on the recommended items:
1.        IN THE SHORT TERM
(a)(1)   New Casualty Enquiry Forms have been supplied to
          Operations Division for replacement of the current forms
          In the Major Incident Boxes throughout the Force.
(a)(11) This is a communications based reconmendatlon which you
         may discuss at your meeting.
(a)(ill) I understand that telephones with headsets have been
          ordered by Communications Department - no doubt you would
          wish to raise this also.
(a)(iv) The Communications School is providing a skeleton Casualty
         Bureau staff for the RAF Finningley Display, but it Is
         unclear whether this Is the result of a directive from
         Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) or the result
         of informal discussions between Casualty Bureau and
         Doncaster,    I am unable to trace a clear directive
         regarding this matter, perhaps you have some knowledge?
         If it has not been done, I would suggest it is still
         required.
2.        IN THE MEDIUM TERM (Approximately 9 Months)
(a)       At a meeting attended yesterday, a Chief Inspector from
          the Heme Office Police Requirements Support Unit (PRSU)
          advised us that a new INTERPOL Form was being produced
          and I now recommend that we await for the production
          of this before these are used, In the intervening time
          we continue to use our existing forms. This Heme Office
          Officer also Indicated a meeting would take place to
          attempt to Identify national standard forms In November
          of this year at Lancashire Constabulary. I now recommend
          persons from the Communications School and Operations
          attend this meeting.
(b)      We shall continue to use our green forms until either
         a national standard is approved or computerisation takes
         place.
(c)      This Is an item that I am concerned is not apparently
         receiving the necessary priority. A survey has been
         undertaken on the work involved and I understand that,
         as the final figure was under £12,000, this is not
         Included in the Strategy Plan. Approval needs to be
         sought from the Heme Office prior to work being commenced
         and it Is unlikely that finance will be available until
         after April 1990. I would suggest that this item requires
         more urgency to enable telephone systems, when installed,
         to be connected into the enlarged room.
(d)      Additional telephone lines are still needed and
         Communications Department are aware of this. These will
         be provided when the new telephone system Is approved
         by the Police Authority but, if this Is not the case,
         urgent provision needs to be made for these lines for
         Casualty Bureau use. Although we have 8 lines (4 for
         hospital use and 4 for public use) into the Casualty
         Bureau, all other communication is through the current
          'F' Division switchboard, which has limited number of
         lines and these are of course used by 'F' Division, 'F2'
         Sub-Division in addition to ourselves, whereas In April,
         Training Department had exclusive use of this switchboard.
         This matter Is also therefore one of scmte urgency.
3.       IN THE LONG TERM (Approximately 12 Months)
(a)      I understand that steps are being taken tocomputerise
         the Casualty Bureau In time for the World Student Games.
         I see a need for Casualty Bureau personnel to be trained
         separately from HOLMES personnel and we will need to
         commence this training seme time before the games
         commence. The quicker this system is installed, therefore,
         the more efficient the operators will be.
One further additional matter has arisen since the original report,
and that Is the question of an emergency generator being provided
for the Casualty Bureau. I understand that steps are in hand to
link the Casualty Bureau Classroom only to the emergency generator
at 'F' Division. It is considered that the provision of power
to this one room only will be insufficient to provide power for
a computer system and also that other areas of the Training
Department will require power to function for any length of time.
You will recall that West Yorkshire set up their additional system
in another classroom, and it could be that a HOLMES System might
be used in one of the other classrooms. Perhaps consideration
could be given to a separate emergency generator for Training
Department use.

        SUBJECT:     CASUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU




             On Friday 28 April 1989, I attended a meeting in Chief
             Superintendent Nesbit's Office, together with representatives
             from Operations Division and those involved with the mortuary
             facilities during the Hillsborough Disaster, to examine our
             post-disaster procedures and consider any recommendations
             for   the future.    The minutes of that meeting will be
             circulated   in  due  course,  but  I was    asked by Chief
             Superintendent Nesbit to submit a report identifying the
             main, areas involving the Casualty Bureau's role as a result
             of the incident.

             I list the following points:




                    Despite all the comments which follow there is one
                    area which should be brought to your attention and
                    that is that, on the day, the manual system worked
                    and was efficient.     This is down to the training
                    that has taken place over the years both in Casualty
                    Bureau   operation  and   for the  Hospital  Liaison
                    Officers and that we should continue training on
                    the current system until such time as the following
                    suggestions are considered.




                    The location of Ecclesfield was very good.    There
                    was plenty of peripheral space for ad-hoc meetings,
                    rest   areas, canteen facilities and car parking.
                    I would suggest we retain this building for the
                    Bureau.

                    The classroom in Communications School was obviously
                    too small and had a number of drawbacks;      we ran
                    out of space on the wallboards and finished up
                    writing on the Venetian blinds. The total number
                    of injured and dead was approximately 240 and we
                    should, allow for at least 500 in total.  Wall space
                    would not be required with a computerised system
                    (see later), but additional space would still be
                    needed for the computer.
The excess of persons in the room and the            noise
generated created difficult working conditions.

The position, of the door and access onto the computer
floor tended toallow persons to       congregate at a
point   near    the   door, obscuring  some   of  the
wallboards.

The use    of    Ecclesfield reduces     the options for
increased   room     size  to   that   building.    It was
originally suggested that the current Seminar Room
should be converted,, but this .does not have computer
flooring and the       number of wires for telephones,
computer wiring etc, would be excessive without such
flooring.    A     suggestion    has    been    made   that
consideration be given to knocking 2 of the computer
classrooms    into    one  and   redividing    it with    a
sound-proof partition. This would create double the
space and also provide the necessary floor.          I have
already arranged for buildings to attend with an
architect    to    assess   the    feasibility    of   this
suggestion.

COMMUNICATIONS

Communications were the main problem.      At the time
of  the   incident we    had 3 exchange lines into
Ecclesfield Training Centre and additionally there
are 2 links with Force Headquarters.      The Casualty
Bureau has provision for 4 exchange lines for members
of the public and 4 exchange lines for police use
only from the incident site, mortuary and hospitals.
On each of these groups of 4, calls 'hunt' until
a vacant instrument is found.    We have a contingency
whereby   British   Telecom   will  provide   us  with
additional lines, and on the day of the incident
4 of these were requested at 4.15 pm and installed
at 7.00 pm.      Additionally, at this time, 2 fax
machines were provided direct with the hospital.

Now that   'F' Division and 'F2' Sub-Division have
joined the Training Centre, although the number of
exchange  lines and Headquarters lines have been
increased we all channel through one switchboard.
Had the incident occurred after the 'F' Division
move, and the Incident Room set up at 'F' Division,
there would have been very little ability for persons
within the Force to speak to the Casualty Bureau.
Some difficulty occurred with communication between
the hospitals and the Casualty Bureau, due mainly
to the number of calls which were being received
at the hospital, jamming their boards.       This was
eventually solved by the Casualty Bureau keeping
an open line to their officers at hospitals, not
a satsifactory solution for both ourselves and the
hospitals.    When the fax machines were installed
communication was considerably better and there was
no need to verbally give details over the telephone,
thus improving accuracy.   There still needs, however,
to be some verbal communication, in addition to fax.

Communications   with  the   temporary   mortuary  at
Hillsborough also proved difficult.     They had one
portable telephone which needed an electrical socket,
the same socket was being used for a photocopying
machine.

The noise level in the room has been mentioned, as
the telephones currently used are hand-held handsets,
which create difficulties when writing and with noise
levels.   There needs to be some method of headset
provided   and   this would  be essential following
computerisation,   as the operator would need both
hands free for the keyboard.

We need to look carefully at telephone lines
increased space would provide facilities for a larger
number of telephones which in turn need more lines.
The number required for the public is a very unknown
quantity.   With a crowd of 54,000 at the Hillsborough
Match, there was a potential for at least 54,000
calls from Nottingham and Liverpool, but no system
could cope with this number in the first 10 hours.
There is an argument to say that increased telephone
capacity will generate excessive work and that some
delay in getting through will give the Bureau some
time to take fewer calls in a more orderly manner.
If computers are used (see later) every telephone
line would require a VDU.        I personally consider
that 10 lines for the public are required, although
              , who has been responsible for the Bureau
for a number of years, would argue for a higher
number.   Certainly the fax machines at the hospitals
are a 'must', but whether these should be permanently
installed or be provided on standby with the hospital
stationery is an area for discussion and finance.
COMPUTERISATION
The West Yorkshire Police offered us the use of their
 portable 'Crisis' Casualty Bureau Computer System,
which was accepted and their team, consisting of
 7 operators, plus 4 HOLMES operators from our Force,
 arrived at approximately 9.30 pm and were up and
 running by approximately 11.00 pm.       At this time
• they commenced a back record conversion on all of
 the dead and injured persons notified to the Casualty
 Bureau and    they followed this by inputting the
 enquiring relatives and friends details.      The main
 workload in the Bureau lasted until Sunday evening
 and the manual system coped with this sufficiently.
 It was about this same time that the back record
 conversion onto the Crisis Machine was completed
 and thus there was no need to switch from the manual
 system to the computer.    The computer did, however,
 provide us with management information and was able
 to sequence the information it held in any format
 we required.     This facility was later used, after
 the computer team had left, through West Yorkshire,
 to   provide   details  of  700  persons   about  whom
 enquiries had been made and who were not casualties.
  (These details were subsequently passed to other
 Forces for them to confirm that the persons were
  safe and well).

One difficulty with computerisation was due to some
entry errors, whereby |                   [ from the
incident site and                        ' from the
hospital, were identified as 2 separate persons,
whereas the manual system would have clarified this
position.   Due to this, at one time the computer
produced a total of 99 dead when it was known there
were 94.

 Had the computer been used from the commencement
 of the Casualty Bureau and operators typed details
 from telephone calls directly onto the VDU, I have
 no doubt that we could have been even more efficient.
 This would have been particularly noticeable had
 we encountered identification problems such as    the
 Bradford Fire where identification took place from
 dental records.
The HOLMES Computer used in. the Incident Room set
up at Hammerton Road was used to identify the dead
and details of descriptions were entered onto that
machine.    A number of names were not released to
the Casualty Bureau until positive identification
had been     made via the    relatives, thus   both the
Casualty    Bureau  and    the   Incident    Room   were
duplicating work.     On    Tuesday 25 April    1989, I
attended   a meeting    chaired   by   Detective   Chief
Superintendent Addis, which was also attended by
2 persons who are writing a Major Disaster Plan on
behalf of ACPO and the Home Office.      Their view was
that the Casualty Bureau should deal with casualties
only and     the dead be    dealt with by a     separate
Incident Room as evolved in our situation.

I believe we should have some link into the HOLMES
System as against a 'stand alone' system like West
Yorkshire's 'CRISIS', in order that Casualty Bureau
and   the    Incident   Room  can  access   the   same
information.     Details of the injured are required
by the Incident Room for use as subsequent witnesses
and the Casualty Bureau need access to details of
the dead.     I would recommend looking towards such
a system with data lines from the Mobile Incident
Room to the fixed Casualty Bureau.    At present many
people can be trained to take telephone calls and
complete Casualty Enquiry Cards by hand.   A computer
system would require trained keyboard operators over
and above those dedicated to the HOLMES System. We
would need to keep these trained personnel separate.

DOCUMENTATION

This Force uses the Green and White Cards (APPENDIX
'A') in the Casualty Bureau for enquiries from the
hospital and relatives and friends.       The officers
at the hospitals complete the paper duplicate form
(APPENDIX 'B') and these should also be completed
at the Mortuary.    During the printing, these forms
should have been printed on NCR self carbonating
paper, but were not.    It appears that these are not
the forms which are provided in the Major Incident
Boxes   at  Divisions   and   consequently   were  not
initially used at the temporary mortuary.
       There is clearly a need to have one form.

       Should the major incident be international, the forms
       for the dead should be the pink form 3136A - approved
       by INTERPOL.     This has index numbers on the left
       hand side which are the same irrespective of the
       language in which the form is printed (APPENDIX 'C ').
       This form has been reprinted by West Yorkshire and
       is used by them for body identification at the scene.
       A   copy  of   the   West   Yorkshire Formis in the
       possession   of    Chief  Superintendent Nesbit.      I
       recommend   consideration be given to us using a
       similar   form for the dead in future.         We could
       purchase thes'e from Leicestershire Constabulary who
       I understand hold the national stock of INTERPOL
       Forms or print our own.

       When West Yorkshire attended they requested that
       we   use  their   yellow   card   (APPENDIX   'D') for
       completion by the telephone operators speaking to
       the public.   This was done to assist their computer
       entry, as the information it requested was similar
       to our manual green card.     It was evident, however,
       that morale in the Bureau dropped due to requiring
       them   to complete   a   card with which     they were
       unfamiliar.   The West Yorkshire card is used mainly
       as an index reference and any person still reported
       missing is followed up by a visit from a police
       officer completing a yellow form (APPENDIX 'E') taken
       from the INTERPOL yellow form 3136B (APPENDIX 'F').
       I have reservations regarding the yellow forms which
       need to be considered carefully against our existing
       or possibly, revised documentation.

I make the following recommendations in relation      to   the
Casualty Enquiry Bureau, in order of urgency:

1.     IN THE SHORT TERM:

       (a)      That the current manual system be initially
                retained with the following amendments:

       (i)      That the forms in the Major Incident Box
                for the dead be replaced by the Casualty
                Enquiry Forms attached at APPENDIX 'B' and
                the carbon paper supplied with them, by
                Operations   Division.     (These  are now
                available at Training Department).
        (ii)     That telephone and fax links with hospitals/'
                 are urgently reconsidered by Communications I
                 and Computers.

        (iii)    That telephones with headsets be provided
                 instead of the current hand-held receivers
                 by Communications Department.
                                         *


        (iv)     Consideration be given to identifying a
                 skeleton staff situated in. the Casualty
                 Enquiry Bureau on all major events e.g.
                 RAF   Finningley,   Semi-Finals  etc.    This
                 should   be   written  into   any Operational
                 Order.    This would minimise time taken to
                 physically set up the Bureau.       This fact
                 should be circulated to appropriate persons
                 by Assistant Chief Constable (Operations).

2.      IN THE MEDIUM TERM (APPROX 9 MONTHS):

        (a)     The current   'body forms' (a(i) above) be
                 replaced  by   the Pink INTERPOL  Form or j
                 similar and these used in the mortuary,
                 to be attached to the body.

        (b)     That we continue to use our Green Forms
                 for public enquiries until computerisation.

        (c)     That work commence on knocking through 2
                 classrooms to form one large room in the
                 Communications  School, with a soundproof
                 removeable partition replacing the wall.

        (d)     That additional telephone    lines   into   this
                 new room be provided.

3.      IN THE LONG TERM (12 MONTHS):

        (a)     Consideration should be given to
                 computerising the Casualty Enquiry Bureau
                 with an extension to a HOLMES System and
                 operators (separate from HOLMES operators)
                 be   trained  to   work  the   system.     The
                 installation,   training   and   accommodation
                 must be completed before the commencement
                 of the World Student Games.

MICHAEL JOHN TORR WILL SAY:




I     am     a    Superintendent             in        the     South      Yorkshire            Police       currently

r esponsible          for     Training           Department.                In     the     event       of     a major
incident          this      Department            is    respo n s i b l e        for     the    organisation           of

a C a s u a l t y E n q u i r y Bureau w h i c h is situated in the Communications

School on the Top Floor of the Ecclesfield T r a i n i n g Centre Building
in    one        of   the     class r o o m s .              The    r e l evant        pages    concerning            the

arrangement r e g a r d i n g this Bureau, which are copied from the Force

Major Incident M a n u a l , are shown at A P P E N D I X 'A'.


The whole of the South Y o r k s h i r e Police Major                                     Incident Manual              is
reproduced on the Command                         and Control Computer,                    accessible to all
officers         at Su b - D i v i s i o n a l     level       and Sections 23 and 24, attached

at A P P E N D I X       1A 1, are       also      a ccessible on Computer File Reference:
XR358 to XR374,              a s ample of the computer printout for one of these

p aragraphs is a t t a c h e d at A P P E N D I X ' B 1.


The c l a s s r o o m d e s i g n a t e d as the Bureau is equipped with 8 telephone

lines,       in a d d ition         to the normal                  3 o u tside lines provided to the

building and also 2 d i r e c t links with Force Headquarters.                                                All the
walls in the r o o m have been fitted with                                   'dry wipe' boards to list

details of the dead and injured received by the Bureau.                                                The function

of the Bureau is for 4 of the telep h o n e lines to be dedicated to
the        incident       site,      hospitals           and m o r t u a r y from w h e r e             information
is    acquired           regarding         dead         and        injured       persons.          A        further     4
telephones        are initially designated to receive calls from m e m b e r s
of the public e n q u iring the whereabouts of friends and relatives.
There      is     an        arrangement     whereby        these   latter     4     lines   can    be

increased,        as required,            by British Telecom.            The details of dead

and   injured are,              w h e rever possible, matched with public enquiries

and     appro p r i a t e      steps    taken    to undertake the neces s a r y warnings.

C a s ualty Cards at A P P E N D I X 'C' are completed by the telephonists.


Members of Divisional C o m m u n i t y Liaison Departments are r e s p o n s i b l e

for m a n n i n g the hospitals who will receive patients,                             and pass the
relevant         information           to the    Bureau.      They take with them to the
hospital        a Hospital         Liaison       Box containing C a s u a l t y Record Forms,

statio n e r y        and     protective    clothing to administer                the scheme f r o m

that location.


A callout system                is in operation for bureau staffing and d e tails

of a v a i lable personnel               are m aintained at Operations Room.                 A copy

of the r e l e v a n t d o c u m e n t is attached at A P P E N D I X ‘D ‘ .


On S a t u r d a y 15 April            1989, at 3.23 pm, I was contacted at home to
the effect that an incident had occurred at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football

Ground which                required    the activation        of the C a s u a l t y    Bureau.     I
attended         at     E c clesfield      and    together with       other officers         set   up

the Bureau and at 4.23 pm, Force Operations Room w e r e advised that
the Bureau was o p e r a t i n g and the appropriate t e l e p h o n e number should

be r e l eased to the public via the media.
At 4.15 pm,           arrangements were m a d e for additional                        telephone lines

to be p r o vided by British Telecom as indicated in the contingency.
As a r esult of this,                 4 additional           lines and 2 Fax Machines were
installed in the building at appro x i m a t e l y 7.00'pm.                          T h e Fax Machines

were        linked     to     the    Halla m s h i r e     and     Northern        General     Hospitals.
At this time there w e r e 15 exchange lines and 2 fax lines to the
Ca s u a l t y   Bureau        in    addition         to     the        d i rect   lines      with   Force
He a d quarters.            T h r e e terminals of the C o m m a n d and Control Message
Switch S y s t e m w e r e linked into the Communi c a t i o n s School and these
w e r e used to send internal messages and r e q u e s t s to other Forces.



At the c o m m e n c e m e n t of the Bureau at 4.23 pm, Hospital Liaison Staff

w e r e a l r e a d y in position at hospitals o b t a ining details of casualties

in c o n j u n c t i o n with the Hospital                 Admiss i o n s Staff.           At this time

the Bureau itself consisted of appro x i m a t e l y 14 staff and this built

up over a short period to a f igure in excess of 32.


West Y o r k s h i r e P olice offered this Force the use of their 'Crisis'
P o r t a b l e C a s u a l t y E n q u i r y C o m p u t e r System.      Their offer was accepted
and they a t t ended at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 9.40 pm, together with 9 staff

and     4    additional        South      Yorks h i r e     operators         assisted       them.   They
commenced a back r ecord conversion of all of the enquiries received
by    South      Yorkshire's          Casualty        Bureau,       with      a view to eventually

placing calls f r o m the p ublic d i r e c t l y onto the VDU screens, when
their compu t e r records m a tched those held manually.                                   In the event,
the back        record c onversion was                   completed S u n d a y evening at a time

when     the    t e l e p h o n e calls     had receeded c o n s i d e r a b l y and there was

no cause to c hange f r o m the manual system to use the computer.


The Bureau received details of 95 persons who died and 140 persons
admitted        to     the H a l l a m s h i r e   and        N o r thern     General       Hospitals.
Additionally, it. is estimated they received in excess of 1,000 calls

f r o m members of the public, 700 of which w e r e f r o m persons w h o did
not have injured friends or relatives.                            The d e t a i l s of these latter

enquiries       were       eventually       passed       to    the    police         forces where    the
enquirers       resided, for them to confirm the s a f e t y of the persons

enquired about.


The telephone operators and Bureau staff w o r k e d under considerable

stress     over      the    first      24     hours      talking       to    anxious      friends    and

relatives, and I cannot praise their c o n s c i e n t i o u s n e s s and response

to these calls enough.


Although       the number        of calls          to the Bureau            had      almost ceased by
early M o n d a y morning,          17 April        1989,       it r e m a i n e d    open until    4.00

pm that day.

                                      CASUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU

    GENERAL

    If a Major Incident occurs within th e S o u th Yorkshire Police area, or if an incident occurs within     XR358
    another police area and num bers o f casualties are received at hospitals within the South
    Yorkshire Police area, it will be th e responsibility of the police to trace the relatives or friends of
    persons injured or killed and inform th em of their condition gnd whereabouts. Allied to this
    responsibility is th e general police d u t y to investigate or assist in the investigation of circum­
    stances giving rise to death o r injury.

    In order th a t these duties m ay be efficiently carried out, the police will set up a Casualty Enquiry
    Bureau to which all enquiries and inform ation relating to persons involved in the incident will be
    directed, in order th a t collation of this information may be undertaken and, where required,
    passed to relatives etc.



•
    The establishment of the Bureau will also mean th at m any telephone calls will be channelled to
    it which would otherwise be m ade to Operations Room, hospitals, etc.

    ESTABLISHMENT

    It will be the responsibility of th e D uty Officer in charge of the Force Operations Room to              XR359
    decide when th e Bureau should be activated and each incident m ust be assessed individually. Con­
    sideration should be given to th e potential numbers of casualties, a nd/or enquiries regarding
    casualties, and it should be borne in mind th a t a long delay in implementation will cause
    unnecessary pressure upon O perations Room personnel.

    It will be the responsibility of th e Training Departm ent to make the following arrangements:—

         (a)     Prepare th e Bureau for use;
         (b)     Call o u t th e necessary personnel;
         (c)     Inform th e Hospital Adm inistrator(s) or other responsible person th at police
                 officers are attending th e hospital(s) to act intheir capacity as Hospital Liaison
                 Officers;
         (d)     Circulate by message switch, a message to all stations setting o u t the arrange-
~                ments for th e Casualty E nquiry Bureau and telephone num ber to be used by

                  i.   th e public, and
                 ii.   th e police.

    CONSTITUTION AND FUNCTION O F TH E BUREAU

    The Casualty Enquiry Bureau is located within the Force Training D epartm ent Communications               XR360
    School, Ecclesfield. The staff consists of one inspector (officer in charge), two sergeants (next of
    kin clerks) and ten o ther personnel who may be police constables or special constables
    (operators). The staffing level of th e Bureau may be modified dependent on circumstances.

    The officer in charge of the Bureau will be responsible for the efficient operation of the Bureau
    and its staff. He will ensure th a t all enquiries are correctly dealt with and all necessary records
    and documents are com pleted and m aintained.
                                                                                         SECTION 23

                                                                                               Page 2


He will also be responsible for th e calling o u t of any relief personnel, bearing in mind the period   XR360
of duty th at Bureau personnel m ay have completed prior to the activation of the Bureau, and the
length of tim e th e y m ay reasonably be expected to operate efficiently. His responsibilities will
also include th e liaison between Com m unity Liaison and Crime Prevention staff at the hospitals,
mortuaries and incident site and the Casualty Enquiry Bureau.

He will also be responsible for informing th e appropriate administrator(s) th a t police officers are   XR361
en route to act in their capacity as Hospital Liaison Officers.

Telephones on both th e       national and internal lines are provided in the Bureau. The national
number to be used by th e     public will be released by the officer in charge of th e Operations Room
to pre-arranged locations,    including the media, when he is advised by the officer in charge of the
Bureau th at he is ready to   receive calls.

External unpublished national exchange lines are also provided into the Bureau for the exclusive
use of hospital, m o rtu a ry and incident site liaison staff. These numbers are held within the docu­
mentation which will be m ade available to officers responsible for hospital and m ortuary records.
It is imperative t h a t these latter numbers are not made public.

PROCEDURES FOR PASSING INFORMATION TO THE BUREAU

Information regarding persons injured or killed in th e incident will be passed to the Bureau from       XR362
three main sources:—

     1       th e incident site;
     2         th e hospitals;
     3         th e Mortuary.

1    The Incident Site

     A casualty record form should be completed in duplicate for all persons treated at the
     scene and allowed to leave w ithout attending the hospital as a patient.

     The Site C om m ander will designate officers to undertake this task at a convenient
     assembly point. The casualty record forms are contained in th e Major Incident boxes
     with further supplies available in th e Casualty Enquiry Bureau. The information on
     these com pleted forms should be passed by telephone to the Bureau. The national
     num ber of th e Bureau for police use only is contained within th e Major Incident boxes,
     b ut in th e event of difficulty it can be obtained from Operations Room.

2   The Hospitals and Mortuaries                                                                         XR363
and
3   Inspectors in charge of com m unity liaison departments at divisions and their deputies
    will call o u t staff in accordance with pre-arranged procedures to man the receiving
    hospitals and m ortuaries when th ey are advised by the Casualty Enquiry Bureau that
    the Bureau is being activated and this action is required.

    The full duties of these personnel are set out in Sections 22 and 24, but briefly they
    will pass details of all injured and dead persons, identified or otherwise, to th e Bureau
    by telephone.
                                                                                             SECTION 23

                                                                                                    Page 3



  PROCEDURE F O R RECEIVING ENQUIRIES FROM THE PUBLIC

 Members of th e public w h o telephone th e Casualty Enquiry Bureau using th e publicised numbers            XR364
 will be asked to supply inform ation to enable a casualty enquiry form to be completed. This
 information is m a tc h e d up with th e information relating to th e casualties provided by officers at
 the various receiving points.
                                                                        tt
 Members of th e public w ho m ake a personal visit to Force Headquarters or any other police
 station to e n q u ire a b o u t a possible casualty should be given the facility to telephone the Bureau.

 If the Bureau is unable to immediately give them the information they require such persons
 should be advised n o t to wait at police stations, but to return home where they will be told of
 any information w hich comes to police knowledge.

 It can be a n ticipated th a t telephone calls will be received at police stations and Force Operations      XR365
 Room and such calls should be channelled to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau either by divisional
 or Operations R o o m staff, giving th e Casualty Enquiry Bureau public emergency telephone num­
 ber to callers. In t h e event of such callers being unable or unwilling to m ake an additional call,
 officers should t a k e details and notify the Bureau via message switch.

  It is for the offic er in charge of th e Casualty Enquiry Bureau to decide whether or not a person
 making an e n q u iry should be given details of a casualty. Where it has been decided to give details,
 but it appears inap p ro p ria te to give them over the telephone, the person enquiring will be asked
 to return to a fixed address, when arrangements will be m ade for th e information to be passed by
 telephone or message switch to th e police station near to th a t address in order th at personal con­
 ta c t can be established.

 No details will be given o u t from the Bureau other than by telephone or message switch on the              XR366
 Command and C o n tro l com puter, to prevent members of the public congregating at Force
 Headquarters or t h e Casualty Enquiry Bureau, seeking information.

Details of persons dead or injured will not be issued directly to the media by any member of the
Bureau. All items f o r publication will be issued through the Force Press Officer.

A detailed plan o f w hat initial action is required by the Inspector, Operations Room, to
com m ence th e Bureau is held by Operations Room. Within this plan is a list of personnel who
may be called u p o n t o assist him set up the Bureau, and further lists of persons trained to operate
the system.

The S u p e rin te n d en t, Training D epartm ent, will be responsible for maintaining the lists in          XR367
Training D e p a rtm e n t and O perations Room of those personnel who may be called upon to set up
and arrange th e Bureau. He will also be responsible for arranging for th e training of personnel in
th e operation of t h e Bureau system and m aintenance of the lists of persons so trained.

 It is anticipated t h a t prior to the Bureau bieing activated many calls will be received at Force
Operations R oom fro m persons seeking information regarding friends and relatives. Where it is
known the Bureau will eventually be activated, callers should be requested to m onitor local/
national radio a n d / o r BBC and IBA Television, where th e appropriate Bureau telephone number
will be b roadcast w h e n th e Bureau comm ences operation. This will assist to clear the 999 tele­
phone lines and t h e British Telecom exchange lines into th e Headquarters switchboard enabling
Operations R oom t o a tte n d to th e requirements of the incident. It is emphasised that the
decision to activate t h e Casualty Enquiry Bureau m ust have been taken before persons enquirinq
are given the above instruction.
                                                                                               SECTION 23

                                                                                                      Page 4



        Prior to the decision to activate the Bureau being taken, enquiries will be recorded by O perations     XR 368
        Room in accordance with normal procedures, obtaining sufficient details for an en q u ire r to be
        contacted later if necessary, and arrangements should be made for all this doc u m e n ta tio n to be
        passed to th e officer in charge of the Bureau if it becomes operational.

                                     - HOSPITAL LIAISON OFFICERS

       In the event of a Major Incident occurring which justifies th e establishment of a Casualty Enquiry       XR370
       Bureau, arrangements have been m ade with hospitals in the County th a t police officers, from
       Divisional C om m unity Liaison and Crime Prevention Departmentss, will go to the Casualty
       Departm ent of th e hospital and there report to the person in charge of casualty documentation.

      Officers attending will take with them the Hospital Liaison box which is kept at their respec­
      tive offices. This box contains casualty record forms and stationery and protective clothing
      required to adm inister the scheme.

      The box also contains a copy of this Section of the manual and the telephone num ber of the
      Casualty Enquiry Bureau. Force Operations Room will supply this num ber in case of any
      difficulty. A lthough there may be a delay in the call being answered whilst the bureau is being set
      up, the officers need take no further action to establish comm unications, other than to ring this
a     num ber from tim e to time. A t some hospitals there may n o t be a telephone available for police
      use and in these circumstances officers will have to use telephones at adjacent premises.

     A casualty record form will be completed in duplicate for every casualty involved in the incident,         XR371
     w hether the casualty is discharged, detained, moved to another hospital, found to be dead and
     moved to a n o th e r m o rtu a ry etc. The information required to complete the form is largely self
     evident but every e ffo rt should be m ade to obtain as much accurate detail as possible.

     This inform ation will be supplied by the hospital staff although it m ay be possible for an officer
     to obtain inform ation for himself. The work of the police officers is of a secondary importance
     to th a t of th e hospital and officers must use their discretion so th a t they obtain information
     w ith o u t causing disruption to the working of the hospital.

     Particular atte n tio n should be paid to the dead and to unconscious persons so th at all details
     which m ay assist in th e identification are obtained and preserved. This includes trying to ensure
     th a t hospital staff do n o t destroy clothing, property, etc., no m atter how insignificant it may
     appear.                                                                                            1

     occurred be obtained, if possible - ie w hether he was the occupant of any vehicle involved, etc.

    Inspectors in charge of divisional com m unity liaison departm ents are responsible for maintaining
    liaison with their respective receiving hospitals, and the maintenance of th e boxcontaining the
    required docum ents. T hey are also responsible for the training of their staff in their respective
    roles at receiving hospitals. They m ay call upon the Force Training Departm ent to assist in this


    The prime task of th e hospital liaison officer at the hospital is to obtain and transmit information
    from the hospital to th e Casualty Enquiry Bureau so th at relatives and friends may be enabled to
    identify and trace injured persons as soon as possible. The second, b u t equally important, task is
    ZnPJ T l 3         ° ! c ° m m unications between the hopsital and Force Operations Room and
    hence to the scene of th e incident.

    The hospital liaison officers will retain th e casualty record form s for reference purposes after the   XR373
    information has been transm itted to th e Casualty Enquiry Bureau. The officers should endeavour
    to obtain u pdated information — eg transfers, deaths, discharges — and it may be that further
    information concerning casualties will come to hand from other casualties, relatives, etc. This
    additional inform ation should be transm itted to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau.

CASUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU - HILLSBOORUGH INCIDENT


1.   I was telephoned at home at about 3.20 pm and was the last
      in a line of 'call outs'. A number of those 'on call' were
      already at the match.    We need a more structured assurance
      for being able to contact someone who knows how to physically
      set up the Bureau. Civilians?
2.   I found the equipment confusingly labelled which resulted
      in the wrong telephones being inserted in the wrong sockets
      until the attendance of Mr        |.
3.   I had some difficulty in establishing the number for the public
      to ring and this should be prominently displayed in the room
      conc er ne d .
4.   It was clear the room was not big enough. People were falling
      over each other in the confined spaces and the movement of
      furniture i.e. tables and desks and students' books added
      to the confusion.    A purpose built large room with all the
      equipment already installed is the ultimate answer, but such
      a luxury would probably never be used for a number of years,
      other than for training purposes. It would gradually be used
      as a 'spare room'.    I would suggest the current Seminar Room
      be converted to the Casualty Bureau.
5.   The    above   suggestion  would    occur  whether    there  is
      computerisation or not. If there is to be a delay in acquiring
      a computer then urgent provision needs to be made for boards
      around the walls for the operation of the manual system.
6.   I was happy with our cards on the manual system, however,
      they did take some time to fill in which restricted the number
      of calls. With 95 dead at this stage, out of a crowd of 54,000
      there was the potential of at least 54,000 telephone calls
      within the first 2 hours and no system could cope with this
      type of volume, unless it was arranged by British Telecom
      themselves using their operators.     Perhaps this 'contracting
      out' should be considered as a filter.
7.   The limitations of the room meant we ran out of wall space
      to write out names of casualties and also that an important
      board containing descriptions only was situated near an
      entrance door where it was masked by visitors and supervisors.
8.   The Training Centre is a good location.        The Canteen and
      welfare facilties and its location away      from Hillsborough
      were g o o d .
If we are to be linked to the Ecclesfield Switchboard in future
and another major incident occurs in this Division, however,
that switchboard may not be capable of handling the incident
and the Casualty Bureau.     We need to reconsider the use of
separate switchboards.
The 'hospital number' appeared to be released to members of
the public as was the Training Centre number. This was evident
due to the calls received on these lines. How this occurred
is uncertain, but it prevented the hospital officers providing
us with details of the casualties.     The ideal answer to the
hospital situation is the installation of fax machines at
all the hospitals linked to the Casualty Bureau and the paper
produced by these machines used as Casualty Cards - can they
be printed on card?
The confusion at the temporary mortuary is appreciated and
details of identified dead did start to come through in the
middle of the night. It seems, however, that when the bodies
were moved to the mortuary that information flow ceased and
we    had a situation on the Sunday when the Casualty Bureau
believed about 40 bodies were still needed to be identified,
yet it is understood the position was that only 9 were unknown.
There needs to be some link from any computer used to index
the bodies back to the Casualty Bureau, in order that
descriptions and eventually names are known, as soon as
possible.
It   was due to this lack of information that we were unable
to pass anything concrete to Liverpool Casualty Bureau and
at the early stage of receiving information we did not have
the staff or facilities to do this.    In retrospect we were
not aware that Liverpool had set up a Casualty Bureau and
they could have probably been used more effectively. However,
the passage of information from Liverpool to the central point
of   Sheffield, which would have been mainly enquiries could
not have been satisfied by the lack of information and the
staff and resources to receive this enquiry information in
the early stages would have been wasted.
The situation regarding meals etc was good, the canteen staff
providing a good service.    Difficulty was found in getting
the heating switched on for the night time, it now being
controlled from the new Ecclesfield Station where the Janitor
was not found.    This required the installation of portable
heating.
14.   The Crisis Computer System commenced working approximately
       11.00 pm to 11.30 pm on a back record conversion and this
       exercise took them until the evening of Sunday to start running
       parallel with the manual system.     The enquiry (missing from
       home) cards used by West Yorkshire were not liked by the
       telephone operators, they considered there was insufficient
       information.   They did, however, reduce the length of time
       taken by each telephone call.    Their cards are backed up by
      more detailed missing from home forms. We need to look more
       carefully at these administration procedures to identify which
       is the most effective.
15.   Superintendent Ray Evans of West Yorkshire and his team
       established excellent relationships with our Force and the
       exercise of working together was worthwhile.
16.   The ultimate should be a computer.    This must be capable of
       input of information directly onto the VDU's by trained
       operators. This would have eliminated a back record conversion
       and would have not necessitated the completion of cards.
       This machine needs to be linked in some way to HOLMES, in
       order that details of injured (who will subsequently be
       witnesses) and details of dead     for Casualty Bureau use can
       be interchanged.    Such a system would require dedicated
       officers as is currently the case with the HOLMES System.
       I would suggest, however, that     the Casualty Bureau remains
       in one place and data links established to a portable HOLMES
       System.
17.   Communications were difficult.       There appeared to be only
       one vodophone to the mortuary and difficulties at the hospital.
       Contact with the hospital was established by leaving the
       telephone line open. This would not have helped the hospital.
       We need to establish other methods.
18.   Four lines from the public appear insufficient, however, more
       would require more operators. The number of lines required,
       however, can never be estimated.    I consider we should have
       at least 8 or 10 for members of   the public. (Liverpool have
      10).

19.   All the staff worked tremendously under considerable pressures
       and I have no criticism whatsoever of any of the personnel
       that were involved at Ecclesfield.    It was clear that in
       addition to the actual Bureau staff, there was a need for
       peripheral staff to arrange future manning, food, welfare
       etc.
20.   Some persons entering hospital were missed by the Hospital
      Teams. I suspect they were rushed through into Theatre without
      full admission being completed at the time of entry.      This
      resulted in us not identifying persons critically ill until
      after the main bulk of enquiries.     Conversely we found on
      a 'sweep up' we had been given the names of 2 persons admitted
      to hospital    at the time of the disaster patients who were
      not in fact from that location.
21.   It took somwhere in the region of 5 hours for British Telecom
       to install the additional lines into the Seminar Room. This
       needs to be speeded up in some way - cannot the lines be laid
       and merely connected, as required?
22.   The telephones want amending to purpose made telephones having
       facilities for plugging in earphones, as the noise level and
       the need to hold the handset caused problems.     These would
       be essential  if we computerised.
23.   There is an urgent need now to provide boards in the Seminar
      Room which have been used for other purposes over the years
      and to establish telephone lines to that room in addtion to,
      or in place of, the other Bureau - could the lines be switched
      from one room to another by one simple switching device?
24.   Errors were made in the transcription of information from
       cards to lists and messages, particularly when people were
       tired.      The placing of the information onto a computer or
       word processor which would guarantee there was no need to
       transcribe would reduce this problem. It was found, however,
       that the West Yorkshire System was         not as accurate as was
       hoped, it identified 99 dead when it was known manually there
       were 94 and this was done due to duplication where         a name
       did not EXACTLY match i.e.                      _       as against
                        \ similar situation occurred with regard to some
       casual t i e s .

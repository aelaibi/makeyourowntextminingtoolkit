               2.                  Myself.

               3.                  Holmes        Incident             Room.        I stayed          there.

               4.                  See     10.

               5.                  Took        charge          of    the    Holmes          Incident       Room.

               6   .               The     information                coming       in       led   me. to    believe          that   a

                                   substantial                 number       of   Liverpool           supporters          were       drunk

                                   and     had       no    tickets,at            S . 30      pm    (1430)    they       were    still

                                   drinking           in       local       public       houses.

               7.

               8.

               9.

               10.                 Although           I doubt          whether          any       Force    could       have    coped       with

                                   an    Incident              like     this      we    should       have    had       proper       contingency

                                   plans.            Areas          that    need       to    be    looked    in t o ;

                                   a)          The    Casualty             Bureau       needs       further       research          and

                                               regular          training.              The    Force       Holmes       system       can    be

                                               adapted          to    cope       with       this.

                                   b>          The    West          Yorkshire          Crisis       System       was    called       in    to   assis

                                               when       it    wasn't         needed.        There       were    a    number       of    Holmes
                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                             R368

Terminals          in   the       Training       Centre          which      could       have      been

used.        The    West      Yorkshire          System          is   not       compatible          to

our    Holmes      and       there       were    in       effect      three       separate

systems       running         when       with    proper          organisation              one    coulc

have    been       implemented.

I turned       out      to    look       after    the       Holmes         Incident         Room

because       both      Detective          Inspector             Gunn      and    his      deputy

were    not    available.                Quite    frankly             this       is   not    t he

first    time      and       we    must    have       a    proper       call      out      system

with    someone         available.              This       comment         is    no   reflection

on    Detective         Inspector          Gunn       who    happened            to   be    on    leave

but    I understand               that    his    deputy          is   on    long      term       sick

leave.        Someone         else       must    be       made    available           to    help

DI    Gunn    cover      this       important             post.       He    must      be    given

proper       support.

                                                "APRIL 1989

On behalf of the Chief Constable, Mr. Wright, I am gathering information to
enable the Force to present evidence to the forthcoming Committees of Inquiry.
This exercise has no connection with the investigation into the policing of

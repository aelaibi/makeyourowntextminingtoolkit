        HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO THE POLICING OF FOOTBALL
        HOOLIGANISM: GOVERNMENT RESPONSE


        You should by now have seen a copy of the recent Report from the
        Home Affairs Committee.           The Home Secretary has written to the
        chairman    of   the    Committee,           Sir       John      Wheeler,             welcoming        the
        Committee's interest in the subject and promising a response in
        due course:      normal practice is for the response to be made
        within two months.


        2.      F8 Division will         take    the lead iri putting                          together        the
        Government's     response        and     in        consulting            ACPO          or     NFIU      as
        necessary.       The     purpose        of       this          minute    is           to    commission
        contributions     from      colleagues.                    I    attach        a       list        of   the
        Committee's      recommendations              (numbered            by    us           for     ease      of
        reference) annotated to show who we think has the major interest.
        In cases where         it appears the recommendation                          is not for the
        Government to respond to, we nevertheless indicate                                          (in square
        brackets) who we think has the supervisory interest.                                          I should

E.R.
   be    grateful   if   any   errors     in    attribution   could   be   brought
   immediately to the attention of Mr Hopley here (Ext 2367).


   3.     For those recommendations where F8 have a joint interest
   with others, we will be in touch separately to discuss the way
   forward.    I assume that the FLA will make a response independent
   from that of the Government and look to Mr Bolton to arrange any
   necessary consultation.


   4.     In order to meet the usual timescale for a response, I am
   afraid    that   I have     to   ask   for   contributions   to    be   sent   to
   Mr Hopley, by Friday 1 March.


   5.     Any queries should be addressed to Mr Hopley or to Miss Pugh
 ^(Ext    2698).

                                We believe that it should be a priority of clubs to provide the police and other organisations
                              such as St John Ambulance with the facilities which they need to discharge their duties efficiently.        Q Q

                                We do not see any need for any further powers to prevent matches taking place. (Para 29)

             j    q            We recommend that the police remain alive to the fact that football matches are intended as            a          ^

                              intelligence is possessed are passed to clubs concerned by the N ational Football Intelligence U nit
                              via the local police force’s football liaison officer.            '                       (Para 31)

                  1          %       believe it would be quite wrong for the police to use tactics against away supporters which
                              had [the intention of extending the Luton experiment [of banning away supporters] by the back

                      co-ordinated on a national basis.                *                                       (Para 47)

                      the performance of all police forces in their dealings with N F IU and ensure that, where there are
                      lapses, they are vigorously brought to the attention of the Chief Constable concerned, since this £ q
                      effective relationship bears directly upon the proper use o f police resources.         (Para 48) f.<g

                         We recommend that the Government meet all reasonable demands made by the N F IU for

                       majority of fans, home and away, are law-abiding and have a right to be treated with respect and                            ^

                       national statement of good practice for police-to follow when dealing with supporters. We further j-  s
                       recommend that individual chief officers should ensure that individual grounds are policed on p
                       different occasions so far as possible in the same way.                                 (Para 55)    1

                             A town cannot be deprived of its soccer club because the bill for policing bankrupts it. It would
                           hardly be conducive to good police/community relations for this to happen since the police would            £ ^
                           be blamed for the closure.                                                             (Para 70)

       31-                   We consider that it would be inappropriate to charge clubs the full cost of policing when that
                           cost can ultimately be determined by one party to the bargain alone. We therefore recommend p {
                           that the costs of policing a football match should be assessed on the marginal costs of doing so.

              the CPS draw the court’s attention to its powers to do so.                                 (Para 96)

                 We recommend that the Government reconsider the Taylor recommendations to extend the

               responsibility for the European Convention on Spectator Violence and Misbehaviour should pass

                of the Football Spectators Act which relate to the Football Licensing Authority (except those

                necessary for the job are provided to the FLA.                                         (Para 121)

confident that the FLA , under its present Chairm an, and with adequate financial backing from

    98.   One problem with the corresponding offences provisions is not easjly^oluble. We learnt
 from the police in Italy that the speedy deportation of offenders was^eeffas a preferable response
 to disorder than embarking on the lengthy and expensive prpeeSsof securing convictions. T h jp
 approach was^'eviderit after the violent disturbances atJSJiifimi when 238 Britons were takep-imo
 custody'before being expelled, but none was clrapgedT It was obvious from our discussions with
 Italian politieiams that the different characteristics of the Italian criminal justjpe-Kystem do not
 allow the speedy justice which is pos§ifel€m the English courts. D espitetJjisfas the Home Office
 argued, ‘the extent to which thg^c6rresponding offences’ provision^edn be brought to bite will
 depend in large p a r tjm tlj&'feadiness o f foreign jurisdictions^kfprosecute and convict British
 hooligans’.1 We reajjnliiend that British Ministers andjafficials continue to apply pressure in
rTREVI to encour?g€'countries with different criminaljiigtfce systems to see the value for themselves
fand other countries of securing convictions o f British football hooligans.

 (iii) Attendance Centre Orders

  99.    Taylor recommended that attendance centre orders should be m ade available to the
courts for offenders aged over 21, and that their maximum length be increased from 36 to 72
hours. The Government rejected this recommendation, arguing that older offenders would be
disruptive, and that the num ber of centres would need to be greatly increased.2 The M agistrates’
Association3 called for senior attendance centres throughout the country, and complained that
the courts in some areas did not have the attendance centre option. The Chairm an of the FA
endorsed attendance centre orders, but accused the magistrates of not using the existing facility.
Similar points were made by the Football League and others within football.4 Sir James
Anderton told us that ‘whilst in principle some kind of use of an enlarged attendance centre system
could be beneficial from the police point of view’, he saw a number of practical problems,
principally the need for attendance centres to open each Saturday and for them to be manned by
people other than police officers.5

    100. We are aware that the Police Federation has long opposed the idea that the police should
 be ‘the rubbish bin to which all ‘awkward’ tasks should be allotted’,6 and we were attracted by
 the view of the Scottish Association of Police Superintendents who argued that:7

              ‘Police are already committed [on Saturdays] on operational policing of football
              matches. Reporting centres independent from police control have merits and there may
              be an opportunity to link a reporting order with an obligation to undertake community
              work’.

 The White Paper Crime Justice and Protecting the Public,8 and the Criminal Justice Bill both set
 great store by community penalties. We believe that the attendance centre order is the most
 appropriate community penalty in the case of football for the simple reason that the centres open
 on Saturday afternoons when most matches are played.                  W e agree with the Scottish,
 Superintendents that there is no need for the police to supervise attendance centres: retired services
 personnel, for example, would be excellent at providing the disciplined environment necessary.
 We recommend that the government reconsider the Taylor recommendations to extend the scope of
 attendance centre orders; that more of these facilities be made available in areas of the country which
 do not at present have them, and that alternative methods of staffing them be explored.

                        Chairman
      318. I think, Lord Ferrers, you have gone as far
  as you can on that and you must clearly await the
  Committee’s Report should the recommendations
  be appropriate in this area. If we can press on, I
  think many would have felt that the Taylor
  recommendation that attendance centre orders
  should be available for offenders over 21 years of age
  made a great deal of sense. Of course, the
  Committee, with its responsibilities for the Police
  Service and police costs and expenditure, fully
  understands the implications for the police and your
  reluctance no doubt to commit yourself to a further
  piece of expenditure which would detain police
  resources. But are there not others who might have
  been thought capable of providing the degree of
  supervision necessary on a Saturday to deal with
  offenders overe the age of 21 ? Was thought given to
  the alternatives?
      (Earl Ferrers) I think the idea of subjecting
  people to attendance centre orders is at first sight
   fairly attractive, but one must remember, Sir John,
   that they are available for people under 21 who are,
   of course, convicted of imprisonable offences and '
   attendance centres are not necessarily, I think, the
   most suitable places for those people who are over
   21. They do not merely impose restrictions on
   liberty, of course; they do constructive work with
   offenders, and I think it would be difficult to say that
   people who were relatively young and convicted of
   other offences would be the right kind of people to
   mix with older hardened ones who are likely to be
   deliberately disruptive. Therefore, on principle, I
   think it would be wrong, if I could suggest it, for
, older people to get mixed with the younger people in
   attendance centres. You then have the other
i problem, that there are not all those many centres,
   covering everywhere. There are about 100 centres
    which cover most of the bigger towns in England
    and Wales. For offenders aged 17 to 20 there are
    about 25 centres. These are usually open on alternate
    Saturdays, normally in the afternoon, for about two
    hours for junior centres or three hours for senior
    centres, and the maximum length of an order is 24
    hours for juniors, and 35 hours for seniors.
    Therefore, you are in the problem of finding that
   there need not necessarily be attendance centres
   throughout the country in the places where these
  .people ought to attend; nor will they necessarily be
   open at the times when they ought to attend. For
   instance, if you had a mid-week match or a Sunday
   match, the attendance centres would not be open
   then.

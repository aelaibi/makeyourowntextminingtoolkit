            On Saturday,        15 April   1989,    <150489)   I wa£ on duty from 0800 am for

            the FA Cup Semi Final          to be held at Sheffield Wednesday Football

            Club. At 0830 am that same day after               inital      parade at Doncaster

            Headquarters        I went by convoy to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

            arriving at 0930 4m.

            At 0945 am I was in the North Stand with Serial No. 59 which
                                               r
            consisted of. PS               'E*   Division, PC 2343 Gardiner,
/L
            PC 8 McDonnell,         PC 3235 Gregson,      PC 422        Slater, PC 2917 Bateman

            and PC 2783 Vailance.

            After the parade which concluded at 1030 am I h a ^ my first meal                        in

            the North Stand which concluded at 1110 amj/Sii was then informed by

            PS _______        to patrol Penistone Road                   Tanfield Road to Lowther

            Road in company with PC 2917 Bateman.                  We were to direct all

            Nottingham Forest supporters to side street parking checking all

            premises and to maintain order and to prevent any clash of rival

            supporters.

            Whilst standing at the junction of Tanfield Road and Penistone Road I

            could see that a large number of cars with red and white scarves

            flowing but of the side windows were heading in my direction.                        I
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     R431

would estimate the time to be 1130 am.                Some of the vehicles         pulled

up adjacent to myself and PC Bateman and requested directions for

iparking facilities.             The supporters at this time were in good spirits

and were eagerly awaiting the match.

By 1200 noon the second wave of Nottingham Forest Supporters arrived

via mini buses and vans.              The majority of them were noisy,           boisterous

and were signing and chanting which could be heard a distance away.

Once the vehicles were parked on Dutton Road and Tanfield Road the

supporters asked myself and PC Bateman where the location of the

nearest public house was.              I informed them that it was some

considerable distance away,             but this d i d n ’t deter them in seeking a

’watering h o l e ’ .       One supporter told me that he w o u l d n ’t enjoy the

match unless h e ’d had a few pints.

By 1.30 pm (1330)           the pavements were beginning to swell with

supporters with the majority,               who were walking   in the opposite

direction of the Club.              I was   called in company with PC Bateman and

PS                to attend Lills Pork Stores,         which was a large sandwich

shop with a bakery attached to the rear,                regarding a report of a

disturbance from within.              On arrival    I saw approximately 30

Nottingham Forest fans milling outside eating sandwiches and

consuming alcohol,           ranging from beer to wine and cider.           I didn't see

anybody at this time drinking spirits.

The majority of the fans o W t h e whole were well behaved,                 but a small

group of approximately             1Cr male youths aged between 18 and 25 years

were being b o i s t e r o u s ^ s h o u t i n g and singing football   songs.     I could

^see that at least hfftf of them were              carrying 4 and 6 packs of beer and

 it re bottles o f S u d e r .       I even saw one youth carjj^ing a three litre

box of C o ^ n t j ^ J l a r ^       where he placed the tap which was

provided into his mouth switched it on and then consumed the wine.

When I questioned him he informed me that he had bought                    it from a
                                                                              PAGE    3
                                                                              R431

 local supermarket on the way to the match and that he had been

 drinking   it since    1100 am that day.

 At approximately 2.00 pm (1400)            the proprietor of the shop came out

 and requested a Police         presence,    to remove 4 male youths who had been

 in for approximately 20 minutes and yere            causing a disturbance.

 After an initial      discussion the youths were escorted o u t .of the shop,

. -and then told to make their way to the g r o u n d .

 I noticed «it this time that there was an aura of tension and

 anticipation in the air.          The crowds appeared to have a mixture of

 emotions   ranging from excitement to lethargy.

 From that time onwards there was a steady flow of supporters

  comprising of families to groups of youths who were walking from

 Sheffield City Centre.         There were still a large number of fans

  carrying some form of alcohol.            I informed a number of them that once

 they had reached the immediate vicinity surrounding the Stadium any

  form of alcohol   present would be confiscated.          Their   replies were to

 the effect that ther would be no alcohol            left by the time they had

  reached the ground,     which was approximately half a mile away.

 By now the crowds were spilling onto the road and some were becoming

 agitated when told to keep on the pavement.             I could see that a

 number of youths had discarded a large quantity of beer              cans   in the

 bins   provided.

 At approximately 2.50 pm (1450)            the crowds were running towards the

 ground.    I could see that the majority of them comprised of young men

 and women who were jeering and shouting towards fellow supporters.

 There was nO animosity towards the Police.

 At 3.00 pm (1500)      I was    informed by PS             to make my way with

 PC Bateman to the ground with the remaining supporters and then wait

 on Penistone Road outside the Spion Hop between gates 77 and 88.

 Whilst walking to the ground PS                    [informed us to attend the
    ground as quickly as possible as there was a report of a disturbance

    within the ground.     The time would be approximately 3.10 pm (1510).

    As I approached gates 77 to 88 I could see a large number of

    Nottingham Forest supporters standing outside showing me their

    bonafide tickets and demanding to be let into the ground.             It became

    apparent to. lit* that there was something amiss when the turnstile

    operators   refused them entry.        By now the atmosphere was electrici           ;

    I then entered the ground by the Spion Kop and walked straightaway

    onto the football    pitch.     I was greeted with a large number of youths

    running around the field ripping boarding from the perimeter of the

    field. } I walked up to the halfway line to see a large number of both

/   sexes/and all ages lying on the ground.          Some were screaming for

    help/ some were    covered with their coats and were obviously dead

    Th y scene was one of total      carnage and to a certain extent      confusion

™   It., was at this point that I helped an unconscious supporter who was

    laid down on the centre       line   in the Nottingham Forest end.

    Approximately, six youths brought him on a piece of boarding and laid

    him on the ground.      I could see that the lad was about        18 years of

    age I quickly turned him on his back and began mouth to mouth

    resuscitation followed by external         heart massage.   After

    approximately 15 minutes the youth d i d n ’t respond to treatment and a

    Doctor,   I d o n ’t know his name,    pronounced life extinct.     This youth

    was then carried by the same team of lads to the gymnasium at the

    rear of the North Stand.

    I stayed with the Doctor and worked on a second youth who was

    approximately the same age.          I could see that he had been



                                                                                     I

    gave mouth to rtVouth resuscitation and external       heart massage but

    unfortunately it was with the same result as the previous lad.             I
                                                                                                                  PAGE    5

         would say that       I worked on this lad for approximately 15 to HO

         minutes.     I then placed my tunic ovejrthe dead body.                                It was at this

jA^      point that a p       h   c   K   ^   ^   s   ^   h   g   j   J    j   ,   ^

                                                                                        a   n   d   ^   g   t    ^   e



         photograph.     I didn't reply as I was too busy with the                                  injured and

   ,     dying.     I did notice however that not one of the photographers helped,

         atiy of the injured,         they were too keen to take                       'action'      photographs.

         Whilst walking towards the Spion Kop end I was stopped by a youth who

         was approximately SO years :of age, who was carrying his friend over

         his shoulder.        He told me that he had just stopped breathing.                                     I

         placed him on the grass and after an examination found that there was

         no pulse.     I began to administer mouth to mouth resuscitation and

         external    heart massage.           Upon a further examination I now found a

         pulse and found that he was breathing.                           I placed him in the recovery

         position and awaited for the ambulance to arrive to convey him to the

         Hospital.     Once    placed in the ambulance                    I then joined others who who at

         this time were standing forming a cordon immediately in front of the

         Spion Kop.     I was     informed by my Sergeant that I was to maintain

         order at this end and to prevent any of the supporters                                     from invading

         the pitch.

         After the crowds were informed that the match would be cancelled I

         followed the Nottingham Forest supporters                         from the ground towards

         Sheffield City Centre for approximately                          1 mile before         returning to

         the ground to be de~briefed and stood down.

 The majority of the fans on the whole were well behaved, but a small group
 of approximately 10 male youths aged between 18 and 25 years were being
 boistrous, shouting and singing football songs. I could see that at least
 half of then were carrying 4 and 6 packs of beer and litre bottles of
 cider. I even saw one youth carrying a three litre box of Country Manor
 wine wheire hg. placed the tap which was provided into h is mouth switched
            jhengonsumed the wine. When I questioned him hi~TriTonhed mi~ that

Re: Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, FA Cup Semi Final - Saturday 35 April, 1989




On Saturday 15 April, 1989 , I was on duty from 8 am for the FA Cup Semi Final
to be held at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. At 8.30 am that same day
after initial parade at Doncaster Headquarters I went by convoy to Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club arriving at 9.30 am.

At 9.45 am I was in the Northstand with Serial No. 59 which consisted of
PS                I
                  E* Division, PC 2343 Gardiner, PC 8 McDonnell, PC 3235 Gregson,
PC 422 Slater, PC 2917 Bateman and PC 2783 Vallance.

After the parade which concluded at 10.30 am I had my first meal in thR
Northstand which concluded at 11.10 am. I was then informed by PS
to patrol Penistone Road from Tanfield Road to Lowther Road in company with
PC 2917 Bateman. We were to direct all Nottiingham Forest supporters to
side street parking checking all premises and to maintain order and to prevent
any clash of rival supporters.

Whilst standing at the junction of Tanfield Road and Penistone Road I could
see that a large number of cars with red and white scraves flowing out of the
side windows were heading in my direction.  I would estimate the time to be
11.30 am. Some of the vehicles pulled up adjacent to myself and PC Bateman
and requested directions for parking facilities . The supporters at this
time were in good spirits and were eagerly awaiting the match.

By 12 noon the second wave of Nottingham Forest Supporters arrived via mini buses
and vans. The majority of then were noisy, boisterous and were singing and
chanting which could be heard a distance away. Once the vehicles were parked
on Dutton Road and Tanfield Road the supporters asked myself and PC Bateman
where the location of the nearest public house was. I informed then that it
was some considerable distance away , but this didn't deter then in seeking
a 'watering hole'. One supporter told me that he wouldn't enjoy the match unless
he'd had a few pints.

By 1.30 pm the pavements were beginning to swell with supporters with the majority,
who were walking in the opposite direction of the Club. I was called in company
with PC Bateman and PS I         to attend Lills Pork Stores, which was a large
sandwich shop with a bakery attached to the rear, regarding a report of a
disturbance from within. On arrival I saw approximately 30 Nottingham Forest
fans milling outside eating sandwiches and consuming alcohol, ranging from
beer to wine and cider. I didn't see anybody at this time drinking spirits.
                                                                   3.   i6u$'


and to a certain extent confussion. It was at this point that I helped an
unconscious supporter who was laid down on the center line in the Nottingham
Forest end. Approximately six youths brought him on a piece of boarding and
laid him on the ground. I could see that the lad was about 18 years of
age I quickly turned him on his back and began mouth to mouth resusitation
followed by external heart massage. After approximately 15 minutes the
youth didn't respond to treatment and a Doctor , I don't know his name,
pronounced life extinct. This youth was then carried by the same team of
lads to the gymnasium at the rear of theNorth Stand.

I stayed with the Doctor and worked on a second vouth whn was annrnximately
the same age. I could see that he had been

                                            [ gave mouth to mouth resusitation
and external heart massage but unfortunately it was with the same result
as the previous lad.I would say that I worked on this lad for approximately
15 to 20 minutes.I then placed my tunic over the dead body. It was at
this point that a photographer asked if I would remove the Tunic and pose
in the mouth to mouth position in order that he could take a photograph.
I didn't reply as I was too busy with the injured a dying. I did notice
however that not one of the photographers helped any of the injured, they
were too keen to take 'action' photographs!

Whislt walking towards the Spion Kop end I was stopped by a youth who was
approximately 20 years of age who was carrying his fri end over his
shoulder. He told me that he had just stopped breathing. I placed him on
the grass and after an examination found that there was no pulse. I began
to administer mouth to mouth resusitation and external heart massage. Upon
a further examination I now found a pulse and found that he was breathing.
I placed him in the recovery position and awaited for the ambulance to arrive
to convey him to the Hospital. Once placed in the ambulance who at this
time were standing forming a cordon immediately in front of the Spion Kop.
I was informed by my Sergeant that I was to maintain order at this end
and to prvent a ny of the supporters from invading the pitch.

 After the crowds were informed that the match would be cancelled I
followed the Nottingham Forest supporters from the ground towards Sheffield
City Center for approximately 1 mile before returning to the ground to be
debriefed and stood down.

         Whether tine Home Secretary should agree to meet Mr Benton and his
         oonstitue:its, Mr and Mrs Church, who lost their son during the
         Hillsboroifigh Disaster. A copy of Mr Benton's letter is attached
         at Annex A for convenience. Also attached, at Annex B, is a
         letter fr om Liverpool city council which similarly requests a
         meeting v ith the Home Secretary (and the Attorney General) . Wc
         understan ii that this latter correspondence was transferred to the
         Departmen of Heritage to consider, but we think it appropriate
         for a Pri^ ate Secretary reply to go to the Chief Executive of the
         Council e:^plaining why this was so.


         Ximlng


         2. Ho dea<iline as such, but it would seem appropriate to reply
         as soon ait possible.


         Summary

        3. Mr Beur.ton has requested the meeting to discuss difficulties
        which hie sonstituents have faced in seeking answers to questions
        about the:.r son Cary's death during the Hillsborough Disaster.
        The Liverj t
                   >ool City Council ask for a meeting to press the case
        for an ind apendent inquiry. Both letters refer to matters raised
        in a rece:     Cook Report" concerning the Hillsborough disaster,
        The Home secretary no longer has responsibilities which are
        relevant t|o what appear to be the areas of concern.

          Recowmtent at-j-on


          4. That the Horae Secretary should not agree to meet Mr Benton
          and Mr tjnd Mrs Church nor representatives of Liverpool City
          council for the reasons given in the draft replies at Annexes c
          and D.


         gonsider;tion


         5. The o:omearns raised by the "Cook Report" programme related to
         the tine of death fixed by the coroner and to allegations that
         some witiiess statements were altered under police pressure to
         conform to» the agreed time of death. The Report alleged that the
         Coroner iresponsible for the inquest into the deaths in the
         Hillsbor^ugh disaster fixed the time of death in the face of
         evidence to the contrary, at least ae far as some victims were
         concerned      It was also alleged that West Midlands Police put
         some pre SB'ure on witnesses to alter their statements to conform
         to the t ime of death set by the Coroner.

         6 , From t nquiries which have been made, we understand that there
         have been no complaints by the Church family against the South
         Yorkshire Police (whose responsibility it was for policing the
         match      it day) nor against the West Midlands Police (who
         investigalted Hillsborough).
         7.   We un<derstand that a number of parents of those who lost
         their liy.es during the disaster have written to the Attorney
         General (     is required) asking him to authorise an application
         to the h :gh court under section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988
         seeking a direction that there should be a fresh inquest.      We
         understani i that the Attorney General declined an application by
         several oif the families (none of which was the Church family)
         of the de<jjeased because he concluded that an application to the
         High Courf would have no reasonable prospect of establishing that
         it was nleuessary or desirable in the interests of justice for a
         fresh inq;uest to be held, since the Attorney General's decision,
         there haV- e been proceedings in the Divisional Court on an
         applicatio n for judicial review in relation to the inquest. The
         Divisional Court took the same view as the Attorney General on
         the centra 1 issues and refused the application.

         8. Foliov ing the "Cook Report” there have been renewed attempts
         by Liverp^ ol MPs to seek a fresh inquest. However, the Attorney
         General    is informed them that there is no basis for a further
         applicatiA:•n to the High Court for this. We are informed that in
         some cases it has not always been clear whether the MPs were also
         raising tlie possibility of a further public inquiry.       It is
         clear, how.
                   •fevesr, from the correspondence from Liverpool County
         Council, ’hat they do wish to press for such an inquiry.
         9. Thougi i the Home Secretary is responsible for coroner's law,
         they are independent judicial officers over whom the Home
         Secretary has no authority. As for the allegations against the
14 JUL '94 IS:55 HOME OFFICE -F8- 071 273 4284                              P.5/23




         police wh lch were contained in the cook Report, the Church family
         should     in the first instance, make a complaint to the Chief
         Officer nder Part IX of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.
         if it is the case, that a further public inquiry is what Mr
         Benton and Liverpool city council seek, then this would be a
         matter f Mr the Secretary of Sate for National Heritage to
         consider since he now has responsibility for safety at sports
         grounds,    (At the time of the Hillsborough disaster this was a
         matter fo r the Howe office and it was for this reason that Lord
         Justice 'Paylor was appointed by the then Home Secretary to
         conduct h is Inquiry.   His terms of reference were “To inquire
         into the •vents at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground..... .and
         to make :recommendations about the needs of crowd control and
         safety at“ sports events.")

         10. '{here is accordingly no case for the Home Secretary to meet
         either Mr Benton «nd his constituents or Liverpool City Council.


         Handling


         11.   Ther; are no special handling issues.

         Joe Bentoji Esq, JP, HP
         House of Commons
         London swlA OAA




         Thank      yotk for   your   letter      of   27   June    on   behalf    of     your
         constituents Mr and Mrs church who lost their son during the
         Hillsborough tragedy.  You asked for a nesting to discuss the
         difficulties which have been faced by your constituents in
         getting answers to questions surrounding the tragic death of
         their son       You did not say what these difficulties have been.


         You also referred to a recent "Cook Report" which dealt with
         events suirounding Hillsborough.              As I understand it, the concern
         of   the    programme    related    to    allegations      that    some     witness
         statement:; were altered under police pressure to conform to the
         agreed tin© of death* Should Mr and Mrs Church have a complaint
         to make concerning police behaviour in this respect, it should
         be made,     in the first instance, to the Chief officer of the
         relevant force under Part IK of the Police and Criminal Evidence
         Act 1984.


         Although     |I am    responsible     for     coroner's    law,    coroners      are
         independert judicial officers and Home office Ministers have no
        power to interfere in their decisions.               The Attorney General has
        power under section li of the coroners Act 1988 to authorise an
        application to the High Court seeking a fresh inquest but I am
        aware that the Attorney General has declined such applications
        because he concluded that they would have no reasonable prospect
        of    establishing     that   it was      necessary    or    desirable       in   the
        interests of justice for a fresh inquest to be held. I am further
        aware that) a number of Liverpool MPs have been in touch with the
14 JUL '94 16:55 HOME OFFICE -F8- 071 273 4284                                  P.7/23




         Attorney General asking him to reconsider his decision and that
         he has indioated that he remains of the view that there is no
         basis roi such an application to the High court,   i understand
         that tile Divisional Court, in considering am application for
         judicial review relating to the inquest, took the same view as
         the Atto;rnley.


         There h a s , as you know, already been an independent inquiry into
         the Hillsborough disaster. Lord Justice Taylor, as he is now,
         was   appointed by the then Hone Secretary to undertake         this
         inquiry because at the time of Hillsborough, the Home Office had
         responsibility    tor   safety   at     sports   grounds.   However,
         responsibility for this matter now rests with the Department of
         National Jteritage and any decision to re-open the Inquiry would
         now be a natter for them to consider.

         I apprecie te the depth of feeling of those like Mr and Mrs Church
         who so tr*.igically lost members of their family at Hillsborough,
         I can only express my sincere condolences to them. I am afraid,
        however, tphat for the reasons given above, there is no action
        which I c* n properly take in this matter and consequently I do
        not think a meeting would serve any useful purpose.

         DRAFT LETTER TO CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF LIVERPOOL CITY COUNCIL Fo r
         PRIVATE 4SdUmURY SIGNATURE



         The Home Secretary has asked ne to thank you for your letter of
         28 June x ©questing a meeting with him following a recent "Cook
         Report” co;incoming the Hillsborough disaster. I understand that
         you wrote in similar terms to the Attorney General and that you
         have rece ived a reply from his Private Secretary on 7 July.


         As I unde rstand it, the concern of the programme related to the
         allegatio’1S that some witness statements were altered under
         police     ssure to conform to the agreed time of death. As far
         as this is sue is concerned, should the families of those who lost
         their reNatives at Hillsborough have new evidence of police
         misdemeano.>rs they should be reported, in the first instance, to
         the Chief Officer of the relevant force under Part IX of the
         Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.


         The Attor ney General's Private Secretary has explained the
         Attorney General's position in relation to this matter and there
         is nothinc the Home Secretary can add to this since it is purely
         a matter for the Attorney General to decide whether an
         applicatic;n should be made to the High court for a fresh inquest
         to be held


        There has, as you know, already been an independent inquiry into
        the Hillebk►rough disaster. Lord Justice Taylor, as he is now, was
        appointed by the then Home Secretary to undertake this inquiry
        because ait the time of Hillsborough the Home Of rice had
        responsibi Lity for safety at sports grounds.            However,
        responeibifL ity for this matter now rests with the Department of
        National alaritage and any decision to re-open the inquiry would
        now be a mftfeter for them to consider. I have therefore passed
        your lette to that Department.

               My ©cnstituents named above tragically lost their
               son    Gary   Christopher    church,   through   the
               Hills borough disaster.   Since then, they have been
               tryin|g to pursue some form of justice through the
               legal system but without success.     By justice/ 1
               mean answers to questions that would bring forth
               th e  reasons for Gary's death and identify the
               cause * and negligence if any/ which brought about
               his d sath.

               My cc nstituents are honourable and worthy people
               genuijviely seeking answers as anyone worthy of the
               name parent would seek to do.

               W ith o u t     going
                                 into any detail at this       stage

                                  frustrations, prevarications and
               lack a£ cooperation they and I have experienced
               from various members of the legal fraternity in so
               many <pirferent ways, I am asking you to consider a

              An Wa terloo, Merseyside.

             This   request  has not just been prompted by
             television's recent edition of the Cook Report# but
             obvio asly that programme does bring many new
             questions requiring answers to the surface.
             The H iatory and details behind that which Mr. &
             Mrs. Jhurch have had to endure are very lengthy, so
             much so, I felt it more appropriate to ask for this
             meetiivig b o as you may hear at first hand the
             dread Iul manner in which my constituents have been
             treats d.

             I do hope in an attempt to seek Christian justice
             you will give my request favourable consideration.

             In co!inclusion/ I take this opportunity
                                             ^ ______      to mention I

      Thank y o u fo r ynnr letter of 27 June about the Hillsborough tragedy.     I wcicomc
      th e o p p o rtu n eny to explain my position a little store fully.

      It was hot my indention to onc/iursg$ the families who you represent towards
      furthPT legal i etion. When I declined the application by several of the families
      of the deceaseid under section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 it was because I had
      concluded that an application to the High CouH would have no reason ab le
      prospect of es u        ® * 1^        ncccssary or desirable in the interests of
      justice for a ficsh
                     t    inquest to be held. Sine© that time, proceedings have been
      heard in Dr* D iviswnal Court on on application for judicial review. Lord Justice
      McGowan deliv■wed the judgment of the court on S November 1983 which included
      the following;


             "1 would hold that the inquisition was correctly completed and the
             coroner1s direction to the jury as to the manner in which they should
             approac i its simpleUon was impeccable.        The proceedings were
             solely di^
                      roctcd to ascertaining whn the deceased was and how, when
             and whe re he came by his death, as they were required to be under
             the stati'
                      nte.  Accordingly* ! have discovered no good reason fur
             ordering * new inquest for merely quashing the existing- verdicts.

             If I had ound such a reason and had to exeroige my discretion the
            following matters would have weighed with me, What would be the
            purpose of fresh inquests? To get a verdict criticising the police?
            Such cr tMifim has already been firmly levelled by the Taylor
            Report.,
            get a ve:i■uivlf    P°!fe ^ave           fault and paid compensation. To
                          m et cnticisuig the emergency services? I ecc no evidence
            to ju s t if y *udh criticism, and in any event it would be irrelevant if
            a ll s ix     f® pwun dead b y 3.IS.pm. To obtain further examination
            o f th e la sltt minutes of their lives? idoubt, that anything won* would
            be le a m f a ,but th* process would be a very harrowing one Involvine

              short Moreover, irrespective uf whose fault, !fanyonee, It is, the
              fact, is that four ftnd s htlf yeans have already puiw<1 *lnce
              tmged? occurred.         As to the alternative suggestion of a mere
              quashln)]jjo f th© existing verdict* leaving nothing in their place, X
              would rsigurd that as absolutely valueless,
              Mr Jane1* KHyK that the families are pursuing this matter because
              they        e a deep instinct to know the circumstances in which their
              relative, died. I am perfectly prepared to accept that that is their
              motive l»d I respect it, but J hr>p» they, for their part* con
              understkind that I have to take an objective view and I have to
              consider the interests of all concerned Including those of all the
              witness*: who would have to come along five years later and. try to
              east the ir minds back to events that they must have been trying- to
              forget      T&King that objective view, and considering the Interests
              nf a!1.co:njieerned. I would in my discretion conclude ttot this was not
              a case in which it would he rigid 1*»order fresh inquests.”

       It is clear f,txiu tli&t passage that only the most cogent and persuasive fresh
       arguments; anc evidence would be lively to result in an order by the High Court
       that there shonpId b» a fresh Inquest. Moreover, the Court would not have regard
       to the ,fCook Report" itself but would wish to see the underlying evidence
       c&refully mars mlled HTiri tn proper form. My position is therefore a simple one:
       1do not at pre ent believe there to be any basis for any further application to the
       High Court. 1 cannot encourage your constituents down that route. I remain
       willing* as is ny duty, objectively to consider any further application under
       section 13 but itwould have to bn supported by evidence in proper and adroisailrtf*
       form.

       It may be lha( you and ymtr constituents have in mind some form of further
       inquiry diatim t
                      .froa the inquest procedure. That would not however be a matter
       forme. It was th* Home Secretary who appointed Sir Peter Taylor, now the Lord
       Chief Justice, to inquire into the tragedy.        Any qnflstirm nf a further
       independent iniquiry would also be a matter for the Home Secretary.

         Mr John Glover,                                         Our ref: IHQ/4/32



                                                                       11 July 1994


         Dear Mr Glover,

         The Attorney General has asked me to thank you for your letter
         of 9 June 1.994 and to reply.     He oncc again expresses his
         Sincere condolences at your Lrayic loss.
        it is not clear from your letter whether you are inviting the
        Attorney Se■tneral to reconsider his decision not to authorise an
        applicationi to the High Court under section 13 of the Coroners
        Act 1988 eediking a direction that there be a fresh inquest or you
        are invitin-!sr the Attorney General to set up some other form of
        independent inquiry.        The laLLei is not a matter for the
        Attorney Ge lersl.     it was the Home Secretary who appointed Sir
        »eter Taylo r (as he then was, now the Lord chief Justice) to
        conduct 1he original public in<juiry.    Any question of a further
        independent xEtejuiry would Also be a matter for the Home
        Secretary.

       As to an ap              tor a fteah inquest, the Attorney General
       declined in 1992 to authorise an application to the High Court
       because he had concluded that it would have no reasonable
       prospect of establishing that it was necessary or desirable in
       the interest!,3 o f justice for a fr«sh inguest to be held* He has

/      since seen the judgment of Lord Justice McCowan when the
       Divisional Court refused an application for judicial review
       relating to the inquest.        The Divisional Court took the same
       view as fch^ Attorney General on the central issues.           The
       Div.i si onal i^ourt also appears to have had before it all the
       material r« ferred to in your letter including that which
       specifically related tc law i.e. the furthRr statement from the
       South i'orfcsltire Police and the comments of Dr Ian West.     The
       Divisional Court made it clear that neither affected its
       unfavourable View of the merits of the ease.

        Tt Is clea r from that judgment that only the most cogent and
        persuasive fresh arguments would now be likely to result in an
        order by he High Court that there should be a fresh inquest,
        Moreover, the court would not have regard to the "Cook Report"
        itself J>ut would wish to sfc* the underlying cvidcnee carefully
        marshalled and in proper £©jtm.    The position of the Attorney
        General on this issue Is therefore that he does not at present
        beli®ve th sre is any basis for an appliraiion to the High Court
        and would not encourage you to embark upon a course likely to
        prove unfr uitful.  He does however remain willing, and it is his
        duty, obj4r.H.vely to consider any further app3 ic?a) ion under
        section 13 supported by evidence in proper and admissible form.

        I am sorry that I cannot be nf more assistance.

        Yours sinosrely

    Pear Mr Eoun is,

    I have been isked by the Attorney General to thank you for your
    letter of 2 8 June 1954 and to reply on hie behalf.            He
    recognises tlie strength of feeling of the families who have seen
    so tragical y bereaved and once again expresses his sincere
    condolences :o all of them.

    it must how4iver be rccognised that the role of the Attorney
    General in r lation t;o this tragedy is confined to that provided
    by section _I': of the Coroners Act 198ft*  That provision enables
    an applicati on t;o be made to the High Court on specified grounds
    by interested parties seeking that the High court direct a fresh
    inctuest.      « making of such an application must be authorised
    by the Afctorrpey General.    The question of any further public
    inquiry is not a matter fox the Attorney General.

   rt will als       be recalled that there has already been an
   independent inquiry into the disaster by Sir Peter Taylor (as he
   then was), nA the Lord Chief Justice, who was appointed by the
   Home Secretai y*    Any question of a further independent inquiry
   is also a autter for the Home Secretary,        The relatives of
   several of th* victims did make s. formal application to the
   Attorney Gem raj. in 1992 for his consent under section 13 o£ the
   1988 Act to a.rJ application to the High Court.  That application
   was carefully and sympathy ically considered but the Attorney
   General cone .uded that this was not an appropriate case for
   consent.

  The Attorney General has mad* it clear in the context of the Cook
  Report that, t
               h ? would consider a renewed application if supported
  by signifies*] t cogent and fresh evidence in proper form.     But
  at present it:: seems likely that the material presented to the
  City of Live;i.'pool Couneil as d«sctibed at paragraph A of the
  minutes, Is substantially rhe same as that examined in 1992.
  Despite the ]>ress and media repox ts to the effect that fresh

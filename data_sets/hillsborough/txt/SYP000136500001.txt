                       over the PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM.

                       over the Public Address System of the apparent area of
                       danger. STAFF in this area should make an initial
                       inspection of their surroundings as far as is
                       practical, and report to the Operations Manager's

                       DO NOT USE LIFTS
                                                                     6.1 (2)


    C                  Sections containing members of the Public are asked to
                       render any assistance necessary to speed the
                       evacuation whilst preventing panic and injury.
                       A responsible member of staff near each toilet block
                       should, at the time of evacuation, check in than to
                       confirm total evacuation, particularly of the invalid
                       toilets.

COLLATION              Each Section must report to its own Reporting Officer
                       who will report anyone missing or unaccounted for to
                       the appointed Departmental Collating Officer for that
                       floor. He/she will, in turn, report anyone missing to
                       the Fire Officer in charge of the incident or any
                       Fire Officer wearing a white or yellow barred helmst.

                       DO NOT RE-ENTER THE BUILDING UNTIL PERMISSION IS GIVEN
                       BY THE FIRE OFFICER.

SMALL FIRES            Small fires may be tackled by staff using the
                       automatic hose reels and extinguishers provided, but
                       no personal risk must be taken. Such incidents must
                       be reported at once to the Town Hall Operations
                       Manager on Extensions 4552 or 4537.

FIRE DRILL PROCEDURE

On evacuation it is the duty of all staff to proceed to the collection point
with al1 possible speed for collation.

On reaching the collection point, staff should group into their sections, at
agreed locations, without delay and Reporting Officers should check the
number in their own section quickly to account for those missing. Missing
persons should not delay the procedure, anyone not present immediately
should be reported as missing - this may always be amended later.

The Reporting Officers should then seek out their own appointed Collating
Officer who should stand in the agreed prominent position adjacent to the
collection point. When all Reporting officers have reported, the Collating
Officer should then report to the Fire Officer and remain with him, or in a
place designated by him, until permission is given to re-enter the building,
when he/she should relay this information back to his/her staff by the
reverse process.

Reporting Officers should know how many of their staff are present and where
they are and Collating Officers should know how many Officers should report
to them. Details of Reporting Officers and nominated Deputies are shown on
the attached list.

It cannot be stressed too greatly that fire drills are not only a
requirement of law, but are of vital importance to the staff's own welfare,
and familiarity with procedures is essential if life is to be preserved and
drill times are to be minimised. .


NOTE

This procedure applies in the event of an actual evacuation of the building
arising from a fire alert or any other cause.

          On the 151h of April         1989 (150489),    I was on duty in my capacity as

          Scenes of Crime Officer w orking S am <0800)           to 4 pm <1600).    At this

          time I was working from Snig Hill and was not assigned to any duty at

          the FA Cup se mi-final„



          At around 3 pm (1500) to 3.10 pm (1310),             I was in the office when,

          quite by chance,       I noticed that the TV was showing what        I thought was

          a pitch invasion at Hillsborough.             It soon became apparent that the

          situation was more serious and there was mention of serious injury and

          possible fatalities.



          I recognised that things were getting worse by the minute and decided

          to contact my immediate supervisors and colleagues.              I contacted,    or

I remained in the office                                            performing necessary clerical work,                                                                    getting

hold of staff and the like.



At about 3.13 pm <1715 ) S I travelled to Hillsborough with DS

On arrival,                     th/fe stadium had pretty well emptied and it was difficult

to comprehend \£j#at such a tragedy had occurred.

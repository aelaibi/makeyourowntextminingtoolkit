             On Saturday 15th April        1989 (150489)      I went to the football match at

             Hi 1Isfcorough between Liverpool and Notts Forest.               I am a Liv e rp oo l

             supporter and I am a season ticket holder.               I got my ticket from

             Anfield,    it was a £6.00 standing ticket for Leppings Lane.                I

             travelled to the match in/a minibus with a group of friends.                     One in

             particular was



             We stopped at the services on the motorway to let the driver have a

             rest.   We were not delayed on the way.



             we arrived in Sheffield at about          1400 hours     (1400) and we parked in a

             slip road off the main road about a mile away from the ground.
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              S3363

I made my way straight to the ground,              I saw quite a number of

officers on the route to the ground.               I saw fans drinking from

cans.     I did not see anyone drunk.        I did jfat see any fighting or

disorder


                                                           (JI
I arrived at the ground sometime b e t ^ e n          14.20 (142Q) - 14.3Q    (143Q)

hours.     There were no orderly queueff just a lot of people.            As I got

nearer to the turnstiles the more squashed I became.               I was glad when

I eventually got through the turnstile.              I did not see any police

officers or stewards by the /Turnstile that I went through.                I did not

see any unauthorised e n t r y to the ground.          Once inside the ground I

saw, tfne of the b ig gatefe/was open about 2-3 feet and people were

f £ 11 i ng through.    I had not seen the gat a/''being opened so I do not

khow who opened it.        I did not see a n y signs telling me where to go,

all   I saw was the tun ne1 and presume}^ that that was the way I had to

go.     At this time I was with]______ [      We had been separated from the

rest.     We had free passage throuj/> the tunnel, at the end of the

tunnel the pens were quite full.



I had not seen anv stewards or police officers by the entrance to the

tunnel.     I did /ot see any fighting or disorder           in the ground.    I did

not see a ny on / drunk.



Once we h^fl gone through the tunnel we went             into pen 3.    It would be

about    14^0   hours   (1450) at this t i m e .    We made our way to the right

and towards the front.         We got to where we wanted to go.         The

pressure of people just got worse and                   was stuck against a

barrier.     I tried to push him off the barrier but I could not move

enough and I was becoming more and more squashed.               I was being pushed

away to the left and towards the front.               I lost sight of           I was
                                                                                         PAGE      3
                                                                                         53363

       concentrating on keeping my feet.              At this time people were climbing

       over the heads of people to the front of the pen and over t/fie front

       fence.       As they came over my head I was being banged.               A ffew times   I

       thought      I was going to go down and 1 was quite          panicky./ I became

       quite da z e d .    Eventually at about 3.SO pm (1520) the vp/essure suddenly

       eased.       I looked to my right and I could see a collapsed barrier and                   a

       pile of      bodies.        I knew then that people were dead.      There were

'b     police officers and fans             pulling them out.     I looked down in front of

       me and I saw a lad lying on the floor face up.                 I shouted to a
3* .
       policeman who was helping someone else.                 He said he would be there in

       a minute.      When he came over he felt the lads pulse and said he was




1      still alive.        We then moved him around so his head was

       the terracing and the police officer said to me to stay with him and

       make sure he was not sick.              1 sat with this lad for about
                                                                                 pointing down



                                                                                    10 to 15

       minutes.      I would describe this lad as white m a l e , early 2 Q vs, quite

 \     tall,    thin b u i l d .    He did not have a moustache or beard,          he had short

       hair,    reddish in colour.           He had a white,    freckly comple;;ion.     He did

       not have a shirt on.            I think he only had one trainer on.           He had

       1ight blue faded je a n s .



       A policeman came over to me and asked if 1 was alright and if the lad

       was a friend of m i n e .        I   said I did not know him.      The poli ceman then

       said we would get him o u t .          Two poli cemen, myself and another fan

       picked the lad up and carried him to the gate and passed him through

       to other     people on the pitch.          All the time I was with the lad he did

       not make any sound,           but I could see that he was still breathing.



       I then sat down on the te r rac ing for a few mi nute s.             I   went to get out

       of the pen onto the pitch.             A poli ceman said to me could I go out the

       tu n ne l.   At this moment I saw               on the    pitch.
                                                                  PAGE      4
                                                                  S3363



I walked out of the tunnel and outside the tunnel there were some fans

who were arguing with the police who were stopping them going back

down the tunnel,     I spoke to them to try and calm them down.

Eventually they calmed d o w n .



I made my way around and back on to the pitch where I met up with

           We then met a few of the others from the minibus and we all

left the ground.     It would be after 4 pm (1600) when we left the

ground.



I did not see anything    inside the ground I considered to be a criminal

o ff en ce .



I think that there should have been either stewards or police officers

on the tunnel to close it off when the/pens were full



The fences that are dividing the Ljrppi ngs Lane up into pens should not

be there.



The whole day was badly orga\i>sed by the police.

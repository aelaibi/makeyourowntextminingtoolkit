                            HILLSBOROUGH FILENOTE

18.9.98

In response to the HFSG letter to Walker Morris (see item 80) re certain archive material
not being deposited with the House Library as agreed by the Home Secretary after the
scrutiny, I gave informal advice, by telephone to Peter Metcalfe, to the effect that whereas
the Chief Constable had the power to refuse voluntary disclosure of the papers in his
possession to the HFSG, that should not be construed as a discretion not to deposit with the
House Library those papers that the Home Secretary had made a public declaration about,
ie, ones from the scrutiny. If in doubt re what papers are involved then to contact C Bone
who was the secretary to the scrutiny.

22.9.98

Telephone call from PM. He had spoken to ACC Daines who accepted that my advice was
only re voluntary disclosure.

                         Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray



15/7/98

Consulted CE on 14/7 re reply to Hammond Suddards letter of 6/7/98. He accepts my draft
subject to any new info from Gordon Etherington re the Lawrence case which might have
had similar disclosure problems.

T/C to GE in London. They had a different problem on the evidence as they considered
that there was a prima facie case and therefore the private prosecution was allowed to
continue. There was no request from the defendants for the CPS to take over and
discontinue. It appears that the police gave copies of all the statements to the prosecutor.
He is not sure what happened to the originals ( Peter Lancaster of the Met Solrs Dept was
dealing). He cautions us about how we give advice to the police and that we should
consider what is appropriate.

Consulted CE again re what GE said. We decided that the advice we were giving was
sufficiently carefully worded and was appropriate.

Dru Sharpling has accepted our Briefing Note of 6/7, re options available, and it has been
passed to the Director.

T/C to Peter Metcalfe of Hammond Suddards acting for the Chief Constable of S.Yorkshire
re our letter to be faxed to him pm today.

T/C to Loma (DS secretary) re my briefing note of 10/7. DS has a g rji it in an e mail to
CE. Consulted CE and agreed that decision is by DS as CCP therefore no req to send it
to the Director for approval. It can be inc in next letter to all solrs if appropriate.

DUTCH FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME

Main Features of the Dutch Scheme
       introduced on experimental basis   at the beginning of the
       1989/90 season;
       only applied to five clubs with a history of hooliganism; -
       AJAX, FEIJENOORD, PSV EINDHOVEN, FC DEN HAAG, FC UTRECHT;
       cards required to obtain tickets for, .and to enter, only the
       away matches of these clubs?
       each of the five clubs to issue its own card and the
       Netherlands Football Association (KNVB) was also to issue
       cards to those who were not supporters of any of the five
       teams but who wished to take part in the scheme;
       the cards were similar, to credit cards with a photograph of
       the holder on the face and a magnetic strip and space for a
       signature on the reverse;
       manual checking of cards and tickets at the gate although the
       card was designed to prevent ^fraud and subsequently be used
       at automatic turnstiles should it become necessary;
       the clubs and KNVB were to offer cardholders exclusive
       reductions and offers including reductions on season tickets,
       a cheap or even free ticket for a friendly match and special
       facilities to purchase tickets for international matches.
       Newsletters were also to be provided and discounts on
       sportswear etc.

Why the Scheme Failed
       the Government wanted to introduce the scheme in the last two
       weeks of the 1988/89 season but instead it was introduced at
       the start of the 1989/90 season without a trial period;
       when the scheme was introduced two of the five clubs in the
       scheme were host to two of the others in the first week. This
       was a major test of the scheme and there had been no benefit
       of a trial period;
       the five football clubs were reluctant participants and DEN
       HAAG FC, in contravention of the scheme rules, sold about
       1200 tickets in Amsterdam to, non-cardholders (mainly AJAX
       supporters) for their match at home to AJAX. This encouraged
       fans of all five clubs in their boycott of the membership
       card scheme.      DEN HAAG'S excuse was that sales to
       non-cardholding AJAX supporters were necessary to avoid
       problems outside their stadium;
       before the match between UTRECHT and FEIJENOORD in Utrecht,
       the police let in many of the away fans even though most of
       them were non-cardholders. Some of the Feijenoord supporters
       had obtained tickets, even without cards, and claimed to be
       "neutrals" who under the scheme rules could be allowed into
      the grounds without a card.     Most of them, however, were
      without tickets but the police decided to let them in because
      of the threat of violence;
       the Dutch scheme was therefore shelved in mid August*

Next steps
       the Dutch Home Secretary has asked the Mayors of the 17
       cities involved to produce a co-ordinated view on how best to
       proceed on measures to counter hooliganism*    They have been
       invited to give their view by 1 November;
       the outcome of this exercise could be that a new membership
       scheme will be introduced.

Bull points                                  *
       the Dutch experiment was doomed to failure since it was a
       partial scheme only applying to away fans of a few clubs and
       those clubs were the five with the worst record of supporter
       misbehaviour. The scheme appeared to identify its members as
       potential hooligans;
       our scheme will apply " to all - Football League clubs, a
       comprehensive scheme reduces the opportunities for hooligans
       to beat the system;
       our scheme is1based on the premise that all supporters will
       be members of the scheme. We want to see only the hooligan
       excluded from membership.
       under our scheme there can be no repeat of the Dutch
       experience of supporters claiming to be "neutrals" or of away
       supporters obtaining tickets from the home club or supporters
       because everyone will have to be a member?
       the timetable for the implementation of our scheme provides
       time for testing at pilot clubs.
       unlike the Dutch manual checking system, the national
       membership scheme will use appropriate technology to minimise
       queing delays and enable rapid identification of unauthorised
       •spectators;
       we have undertaken that the national membership scheme will
       not be put into operation before we are satisfied that the
       technology will operate effectively.
       unlike the Dutch scheme, the national membership scheme has
       legislative backing. It will be a criminal offence to be an
       unauthorised spectator at a designated match.

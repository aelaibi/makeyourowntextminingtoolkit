                Dear Sir,

                Re:   'INFORMER' NEWSPAPER

                I enclose the front page of a local newspaper which gives the account
                of a Mr. T. PLUCK #10 was outside the Hillsborough stadium just before
                the accident which you are investigating.

                You may find his story of interest. Should you wish to interview him
                further at a later stage, I would be only too happy to assist in tracing
                him locally.

                Yours faithfully,

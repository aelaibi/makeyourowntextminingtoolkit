Date:    27 January 1998

To:     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith




Beneath this you will find

a)     the green folder, containing a fully updated version of the report, with a few proof
marks (in pencil) which I put in as I went through today. You may wish to go through it
again, so that I can make any final corrections in order to hand the folder in to the Home
Secretary’s office on Thursday with your completed report inside. I will make up a copy for
you in the red folder you have been using (and I will make up another copy for Home Office
officials - Paul Pugh etc. - all the necessary copying is well in hand).

b)      the previous versions of Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 of your report, with your comments
on.

c)       a draft covering letter from you to the Home Secretary. We need to think carefully
about what this recommends (paras 4 - 8 ) about publishing the evidence you have looked at.
I think that the Home Secretary may well want to publish material from some of the people
you regard as having ‘assisted’ you (especially the Coroner, perhaps). What he publishes is
up to him, but if we wish to dissuade him from going further than the draft recommends we
may have to put up more convincing reasons than I have been able to come up with. The
Home Secretary could well find himself under pressure to publish this extra material and if he
is to resist that pressure he will need a solid line to take.

d)      a letter from Professor Scraton in today’s Guardian (interest only)

e)     letters from Mrs Sefton, ex-inspector Harry White, and Superintendent Hepworth.
None of them add anything to what we already know (Mr White told me what he was going
to say over the phone, and you have my note about that).

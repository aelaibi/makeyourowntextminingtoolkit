 Dear

 1 am grateful for you advising me of your information about the tragic events
 at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.  I have noted the information which has also
 been made available to Secretary of the Inquiry as well as the Treasury
 Solicitor, who is instructing Counsel to the Inquiry at the oral hearings.

 Having considered your contribution I do not intend to arrange a personal visit
 to obtain any further statement.  However, if you have any additional
 information since you last contacted my investigation team or you feel that a
 personal visit is essential please do not hesitate to make contact at any of my
 offices listed above.  Alternatively you can write to the Secretary of the
 Inquiry as below:-

 Mr R M Whalley

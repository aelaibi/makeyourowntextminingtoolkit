                                  Dear Mr Wright, for your information only.*8




    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR‘S INQUIRY IHTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

   I have now been asked by Counsel appointed by Lord Justice Taylor to request
   from a selected number of police officers their recollections, in writing,
   of what happened at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. The reason for my
   request is that I understand that a number of your officers performed duty
   on a mutual aid basis. Counsel are keen to obtain a cross section of
   accounts as soon as possible.

   I would like to make     arrangements as soon as convenient, through a Liaison
   Officer whom you may     care to appoint, to receive these written submissions
   as soon as possible.      There will be no need for ray officers to see yours
   personally, although     a proof of continuity will be necessary, but I would
   hope that this could     easily be achieved through your Liaison Officer.

   The invitation to submit written, recollections is based on criteria that I
   have already adopted with South Yorkshire Police officers. That is,
   there will be no interviews just simple requests to which the officer will
  -■be free to decide what he or she wishes to say. When supplying any written
   submission the officer will be free to keep a copy. I have also been asked
   by Mr P Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, if a copy of
   any submission can be made available; I have no objections nor have Counsel
  appointed by Lord.Justice Taylor.

  In this respect copies of any written submissions can be forwarded direct
  by you to Mr Wright at his Sheffield Police Headquarters.

  It would be helpful if I could arrange for one of my senior officers to
  contact your Liaison Officer in the next few days.

  Attached to this letter is the list of officers who I understand were
  seconded from your Force.

the ground,        we did not att e n d the briefing                     on the day of the match.

During     the    briefing we         both waited at             the    rear of the N orth Stand.

The    briefing     lasted about            half an hour.              At the time      I attended         the

              and do a general              patrol.        We    started our        patrol    at   11am
— t/
(1100)     in the Pen i s t o n e Rd,         at    tfo4s time         I saw a small        number    of

N o t t i n g h a m Forest    fans    in the/area.              They were       sitting a r o u n d eating

a n d drinking      beer,      but t h e / w e r e    reasonably           quiet and not       causing any

trouble.         They were ma i n l y drinking              out    of    cans.      1 then went       into

Mi d d l ewood Rd and Hi 11s bo rough S h o pping Arcade,                         whe r e we m oved    on some

Notts    fans who had been             complained about.                 We   told them to move            on

w h i c h they did without any               problems.           We w a l k e d through the shopping

area    into M i d d l e w o o d Rd    into Catchbar Ln,                by this     time    it was    12 _ m i d ­

day,    and we went          into Lappings Ln.                    this     time    it was    busy and fans

were    sat    on walls       drinking       beer    from       cans    but there was        no trouble.             I

w a l k e d along Leppings           Ln to the       traffic       island and stood outside                 the

bus    garage,     this garage         is in Harries Rd.                 Whilst     stood outside          the

garage     I heard on my            personal       radio    that       public     houses were      closed

because       of the    crowds,       one    of the    public          houses m e n t i o n e d was   the

’Five A r c h e s ’ in Herries Rd.                 Whilst       outside       the garage a large           number
of fans       from N o t t i n g h a m Forest and a few from Liverpool                    a sked us where

they     could get a drink and                I advi s e d them that       public houses          in the

a rea had been             closed, and they should make               their way to the          ground and

go    inside.         It was about       12.15pm      (1215)     by now.

I then made my way to the Niag a r a Sports                          and Social    Club,       this being a

Po l i c e Club.           There was a Special         Con s t a b l e working     the    car    park at

the Club,          together wit h two          regular    officers?       there was       no problems

but    there was           several    Liverpool     s upporters        coaches arriving          to park          in

C l a y w h e e l s Ln w hich       is near   the Club.         I stayed       there until       12.55pm

(1255)      and     then returned        to Leppings        Ln traffic         island.     I then

d eci d e d to      return to flerries Rd to             check       there was    no problems.              I met

rny C o m m a n d a n t                on the junction of Heries Rd and Herries Rd

South.        He    inf cloned me      that the     'Five Arches'         public    house was          very

busy and no one should be allo w e d along                       to the    public    house.           Two

specials who had been a l l o c a t e d duties                  in Herries Rd were             told    this.

I went      back      to Psn i s t o n e Rd again and         carried on into        the       shopping

precinct        at Hillsborough,           it was     very busy w ith          cars and shoppers             but

not m any football             fans about.        There was          quite a number       of    regular

officers        everywhere we went on foot and                   in van serial       patrol.

I carried on around the                 ground a d d r e s s i n g    people?    giving    directions

and a r r i v e d back at Catchbar Ln at 2pm                    (1400).        I carried on into

Leppings        Ln where       it was    very busy?       but    no trouble.        People were

q ueuing and entering                the turnstiles       in L e p p i n g s Ln very orderly?               no

pushing       or    crush.      I saw moun t e d officers             trying    to get    the    people who

had    been sitting           on the walls?       drinking       off    the wall    and    into the

ground.         S.C.                    and myself a s s i s t e d      the moun t e d officers             in

m oving     these         people.    There were       regular        officers also       present.           The

people we moved were                 noisy?   very drunk?        but were       not abusive and did

not    cause any trouble.               As far as      I was aware most           of these       fans

ente r e d the       ground at Leppings           Ln and were all Liverpool                fans..
I went along Leppings Ln and fay t h y r time                            the whole      of the     lane was

full     of supporters walking
                                      r       towa/us        the    ground,     this    time    it was 2,

JOprn.     There was          no way any yfraf ? i c could have                 used Leppings          Ln    in

either     d i rection because^af              the    crowds,           1 saw a few who was            very

d r u n k , t h e r e was a lot/of          chanting,         but they were all              moving along,

causing       no trouble           “'rom there        I made my way            to the N i a g a r a Car Park

to    check    if there was any             problems,         it was all        quiet    but a lot          of

coaches were           still arriving,          these were all               Liverpool       supporters.

There was also a lot of Liverpool                           supporters arriving              in their       own

cars.      I stayed there             until    2. 4 0 p m    (1440)      from where      I walked       until          I

had a view of Pen i s t o n e Rd.               At this        time there was a large amount                          of

supp o r t e r s    coming     from the       coaches       and other         streets making          for

                                /V/IIC0
1 then heard Supt. M A R S H A L L ' S voice corning over the radio saying,

"We've     got      to get     this    gate    oaen" .       At this         stage   it was     just    turned

twenty to three           (1440)       anjjr I did not know what                gate he was        on about,

Whe n he      came     over    the / f i r I could hear a lot of spectators                        noise         in

the    background»



There was          various     other      transmissions            on^t'he    radio and then I heard

Supt M A RSHALL'S         voice again on the i*~itdio saying                     that the gate          has

got    to be opened.            I u n d e r s t o o d / f r o m these messages          the gate had to be

opened to prevent              it being       broken,       this was         something       I just    thought             I

did not know.            I knew Sup? M A R S H A L L was               in charge     of the Leppings              Ln

area     of the       ground.

I also     heard on the          radio      that     people        had got onto        the    pitch at this

time.      I was       standing at        the traffic          island Leppings Ln,              P e n i s t o n e Rd.

Esy this      time     it was about         five minutes            to three and there was              still          a

lot of people making              their way towards                 the ground.         Because       it was

getting       late quite a few of the                 people were            running along Leppings Ln
                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                            S894

towards        the    ground.

At this        stage,    I heard a message              come over        the       radio    that about          two

hundred        peopple were          still      drinking at the          ’Horse and J o c k e y ’ who

w a nt e d    clearing and escorting               to the    ground.           This Public House                is

about, ten to fifteen minutes walk                        to the    ground.           I then heard over

the     radio the       people were            spilling    into the       pitch.

At     this    time    I was walking           along P e nistone Rd and               it came       over    the ai

that     there was O f f icers            in the gym who          could be used             if needed.           I

heard        control    ask    for all a v ailable O f f icers                to    come to the ground.

On hearing           this,    SC                 and myself       ran    into the          ground    togethei

with a large amount                of    regular Officers,          m o u n t e d and dog handlers.                   We

all     lined up near          the      gate    to the ground and an                Inspector a sked mysel

and SC                   escort         some    regular O f f icers w ith            persons    to Hainmerton

Rd Police Station.                 It was       now about    five       past       three    (1303 hrs).

We e s c orted eight           persons         in a van to H a m m e r t o n Rd Police Station.

As we were making              our way         back to the ground             I heard over          the    radio

that a m o r t u a r y would have               to be set    up.        There was at          leas/"one          dead

I could not           believe what         I heard.

As we        neared the ground,            I saw ambulances,             traffic       cars,    making          their

wa y    to the ground.             We event u a l l y     reached       the    ground and made             our way

back     into gate       ’O ’ , the Police          entrance       to the ground.

As     I entered the ground               I saw    people    being       carried on stretchers

towards        the gym.

An     Inspector       then said to SC                       and myself             to get out       into       the

g round and help o u t .                I went out      i nto the       pitch and          could not be 1i eve

my eyes.         There were          bodies      lying all    over       the Leppings Ln end of the

p itch.

I saw two a m bulances               on the      pitch and Police and fans working                         on

people who had been injured.

             uffering         from   injuries      to his      leg*

           As    I got     to the gym,         I saw     people      laid O'ut on the                 ground outside

TO VI      then     returned to the            pitch and brought several people into the gym

           some    dead and others             injured.

           During       this time       there was a numper              of Liverpool                 fans up on the

           veranda       in the N orth S t a n d         1 ooi/i ng down           in to the gym area.                Thes*

           fans were          shouting abuse and jfhr owi ng coins and                           cans at us.          These

           Whe n we had brought all                i/he people        off         the    pitch,       the S p e c i a l s who
 UN        were ava i l a b l e       regrouped and joined              the        regular Officers             in a line

           across       the    centre      line of the ground to keep the fans apart.

           We stood there            for about        fifteen minutes and during                         this time     I saw

            people w a n d e r i n g around the           pitch      in a daze,                SDO                  then asked

           me to try and             regroup all       the S p e cials and move                  to the gym area.             I

           made    my way to the Leppings                 Ln end where              I met a youth who was with

           a girl.         The youth was         injured.          He was          spitting          up blood.

           The y outh did not want               to go for help but                     I persuaded him to go with

           m e to t h e g ym for h e 1 p ,

           As we     neared the         gym    I was     told to place              the y outh         in a Police       van,

           w h i c h was      being used to take the               injured to hospital.

           As    I was     placing      the youth        in the van a y o u t h                came to me who         knew the

            injured youth and said,                "Where      the     *F*        hell    are you taking           him."

            I. explained        that he was        not    being a r r e s t e d          but    going     for   treatment as
                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                      S894

he was    injured.

I helped others who were            injured         into the     van which        then drove away,

I stayed    in the gym area         until      about a quarter to five and other

Specials    arrived.      We were      told    then to go and sit in the mai n                    stand

and await     further     instructions.

During    the time    I was ass i s t i n g     on the       pitch w ith the dead and

injured,    I did not      see anyone         being    crushed      in the       pens    behind the

goal    at Leppings Ln end.            I was    not    close     enough.

At about    1730 hours,        I sat    in the N orth S tand where we were                      debriefed

by Chief    Inspector BEAL.

I sat    in the North S tand        together with regular Officers                      until     about

1815' hours,     when we were       stood down.

I then went      to the gym and handed my               radio     in.

F rom there myself,       SC                   SC              and SC                   made    our way

towards    Wods I ey L.n, whe re we had parked our                  cars .

As we    got to the junction           of Leppings Ln and Catchbar Ln,                     a Liverpool

supporter who was         very drunk      said,       "Hey    pigs,     I talking        to you."

We stop p e d and    I spoke     to him,       I said,       " W h a t ’s your    problem."

He said,    "I'm not your        problem,       y o u ’re my fucking           problem."

We a gain a s k e d him what was wrong and we found                      out     that he could not

find his    brother.

He was    very d r u n k s could hardly stand and was                   very abusive.            He was

a d v i s e d to go on his way and a l t h o u g h still            being abusive,             made    his

way along M i d d l e w o o d Rd.

After    this,   I made my way home,,

I did not know the         names    of any of the            people     I removed from the              pitch

to the    gym,   either    dead or      injured.

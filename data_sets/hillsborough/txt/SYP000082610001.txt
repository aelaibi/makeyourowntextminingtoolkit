            Armthorpe Police Station.                       I d i d n ’t collect a radio as there was no

            instruction for constables to do so,                             and the Section was short as

            some had gone for repair.                       Myself and other            colleague were taken to

on        I^Xts Forest approach side, and had been joined by Insp.

HAYTtMffiNE.    The public houses were soon full.              An Off-li ce nc e we

parked near across the road from a public house was doing a great

trade.     It looked like people got served quicker there so they came

from the pub across to the Off-licences.                The crowd seemed good

humoured and I d o n ’t recal1 any in ci d en ts .         About 2.30pm       (1430)

I remarked that they were leaving it a bit late to get into the

ground,   and someone      replied in the van its only a short walk.                   About

2.45 pm the crowds mainly Notts F o re s t on our side were walking down,

and I saw a few cgaches still arriving in the area. About 3pm                         (1500)     I

heard a radio message on the Sgts and Insp.                 radio that sounded

strained and urgent calling for some gate to be opened.

I believe    it was r e pe a t e d .

We were travelling       towards the ground when a broadcast was made for

officers to come into the ground I believe                 it would be something         like

3 « 0 5 pm (1505).   We arrived a few minutes          later and entered the ground

by the entrance near the g y m .           All the dog handlers were assembled

infront of us.       I could see a small area of the pitch in front of

Motts Forest fans.         On the pitch were Police Officers and f a n s .

People were being brought              past us on stretcher.     I assumed at the time

that a pitch invasion and fight had broken out.                  We were kept there

for a time with other officers.               Then we were taken onto the ground

and lined up infront of the Liverpool              fans.     It was from these that I

l e a r n ’t something of what had h a p p e n e d .   Hav i ng g o t ,7 y e,&r s St John

the line to see if there wa                                                      ed up

towards the end of the ground I saw fans and Policemen.                      No one was

clearing the pitch and some were lying on the gorund.                       I asked groups

of people    if they were      injured if they said         ’N o ’ I requested them

firmly to go to the edge of the ground so we could deal with the
                                                                                    PAGE

         injured.     I then came across a young lad I suspect had broke ribs,             I

         took him to the gym for first aid.         When I returned I was joined by a

         young off duty nurse who asked if there was anything she could do we

         then went along the front        line of injured everyone was being treated

         by officers or fireman,        St. Johns etc.     I suggest she went to the gym

         to see if she could help there.         I then continued comforting      people       ii

         shock and directing the walking        injured.

         At 4.45pm <1645)      I was instructed to stand outside the exit for

         ambulance    carrying away the injured. ^5.30pm       (1730) we were debrief.

         6.05pm    (1805)   sent to Claywheels Ln to await transport.

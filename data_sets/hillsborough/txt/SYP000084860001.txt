When     we       a r r i v e d at      the       turnstiles                   we    initially made                  a mistake            and

We    then went           around            a       fence       and      joined           the       queues        forNthe        L e p p i ngs

I think         that       the . . i n ^ i n ^ c t o r      that     caused         the       deaths          a nd    injuries                 to

the    people         were      the      ferices at          the     front         of    the       terraces,              which           people

were     trapped X^a^nst.                      The    other        obvious          factor          wa s      that        there           were

too    many         people      in the         pens       behind        the    goals          for       the    space            available,,

Everyone            except      for-                           and                                            met     up a g a i n             in

Pen    2 and         we    lef t ’XfteN g o r u n d         together          at    about          4.3Q       pm.

We    left      following           a    loud    speaker           announcement.                    There          were         about          three

announcements               the     first       had a s k e d        people         to       say    in the           ground,              we    left

after         the    announcement              asking        us    to     leave         quietly.

1 d i d n ’t see           anything            throughout            the      day which I consider                        to        be

criminal            offence.                                                                      ^            ^

Once     the        game    ha d    been       stopped         I feel         that       the^^t^riergency y a t e s                       to    the

pens     were        not    opened        saonNqiaugh.                  Nobody          knew what             to     do     and          there
                                                           ----
was    mayhem         within        the    ground          w i t h xa l o t    oT       police          just       standing               around.

    Initially         the     Police       thought           it was'^^^p^tch                  invasion and                  were          pushing

fans     who        were    trying        to    climb        out     of    the terraces                  back        into           the    crush

within         pens       3 & 4.

1 do     believe           t h at   the    fans       carrying            these         dead and           injured              on       the

hoardings            to    the a m b u l a n c e s        a c t e d w e ll .        I also          feel       that         many          lives

were     saved        by f a n s        pulling       other        fans       up    into          the    West        Stand.

I feel        strongly          t ha t    in f u t u r e       all      perimeter             fences          should            be       removed

from     football           grounds        and       be     replaced          with       something             else,            possibly             a

moat.

I would         like       to a d d      that    amongst           the     group         of       people       at                              wno

were     stopped           from     getting          onto      the      coaches          with       cans,          h al f       of       them

were     Everton           fans     catching          coaches           to B i r m i n g h a m          for    the        other           semi

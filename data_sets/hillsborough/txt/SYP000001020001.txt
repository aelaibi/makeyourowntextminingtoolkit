                I am a m arried woman living at the above address with my family.                                   I. am

                self employed in the capacity of ha i r d re s s e r an dr for eight years have

                located       on the

                SHEFFIELD.The shop is open six days a week Monday to Saturday and over

                the years 1 have grown accustomed to football                       fans travelling         to the

                nearby Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground at H I L L S B O R O U G H ,

                along LEPP1NGS LANE.

                On Saturday ,150489 I was on duty at /.h e                 shop from 0730am/unt i 1 1430pm
               h                   /                        K\u   ~    •
                together                  staff                     and a new girl who/I             only know

                a fan of Nottingham Forest Football Glut)/                      I was aware that on this
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             S1Q2

day a major football match was to be played at the HILLSBOROUGH

ground between LIVERPOOL and NOTTINGHAM FOREST.          When I arrived at

work   it was quite   clear that a lot of fans had already a r r i v ed and

in the area of my shop it was clear LIVERPOOL fans were            c o n gr e ga t in g.

At this stage of the day with hot dog sellars and young children was

personally filled with excitement for everyone         in anticipation of

what should be a good day.

By about midday a lot of people had arrived and I noticed that a lot

of people were carrying and consuming a l c o h o l , both bottled and

canned.     People were throwi ng their   litter all   over.     As stated I

have witnessed a lot of matches,      apart from more people being there I

can say I have not seen so much alcohol        being drunk as 1 did that day,

At about this time     I had occasion to go out the back of the shop into

an area whi ch separates my shop from the                                I would

say there must have been at least fifty people         in/their mid twenties

all ur i nat i ng quite openly about the walls,    t tye back of the shop.          It

would be fair to say the area was awash w i t m urine.          It was not a

case of peo pie be i ng caught sho rt they we/e d r u n k .    I tried to ask

them to move but they ignored me

The day continued on.      There we re plenty of police       patrols   passing

who were keeping an eye on the fans drinking.          It would be fair to

say except for urinating the behaviour of fans was not disor de rl y,

they were merely d r u n k .

The area outside the shop was by now overwhelmed with fans of

Liverpool.

I closed the shop/at about      1430pm and together
                                            /       ---- my staff
                                                    with                   left,

drove up HAL IFA^ RD and again I was as/tounded by the number of

persons drinki/ig and carrying     large /quantities of cans and bottles

with t h e m .

As I got to SOUTHEY GREEN RD outside the MAGNET / U B          I saw a white
                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                              S 102

            South Yorkshire double decker bus pull to a halt and about twenty

^           teenagers got off and       ran over to the pub o/fly to find it was

            closed.        This would have been about     143!yhours and the bus was not at            4

            a bus stop.

            I went into the nearby K^RK general                ire in the next block of shops

            and as I was in there I saw the same' groj^ of Liverpool                fans    come

        7 ^ «in.    The store contains an off       licene'e^ facility.     The group of twenty

            went straight for the boose.          The group were d i s o r d e r l ^ , swearing

            pushing.        I saw a couple buy large quantities of a/coho 1 c an s , one

            lad bought sixteen c a n s .      The staff were overwhejfmed, X personal ly

            saw two     lads pick up bottled beers place them within their              c 1othes

            and leave.       They were all v&'ry drunk and it was upse^J^jsTg.             The staff

            said they would not serve any more and tried to push them out the

            shop.     I shouted for them to call /he police and were greeted by

            drunken behaviour and abusive         comments.      These youths were not from

            Sheffield,      had red scarves,    L iverpool a c c e n ts and were   clearly going

            to the match.                                           /

            While they were being pushed out one youtty picked up a bale of/straw
                                                                           /
            and launched it down the length of the / hop                 c
                                                           v
            I couldn't really describe         the youths any further but it was most

            up se ttn g.    The re was as I s a y , far more drinking than normal and a

            massive number of people who         1 believe to be Liverpool         fans were d r u n k .

            I returned to work the Monday following the disaster and I would say

            in the near vicinity of the sfyop there were            probably three o/
                                                                                   0 / more


            skip loads of alcohol       containers    left.     The containers and litter had

            not been collected by Mon d a y evening but had all gone the foilowing

            mo rning.

                                                                              J A ELLIS SIGNED

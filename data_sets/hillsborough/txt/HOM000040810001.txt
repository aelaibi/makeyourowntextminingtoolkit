     1.    I PETER HOWES will say:




 2.        I make this statement further to my statement o f the 15,h September 1989.




 3         I am a fully qualified paramedic with Derbyshire Ambulance Service.

           On Saturday 15,h April 1989 I was on 8.00 am - 4.00 pm duty. At approximately

           15.25 hrs I received a call to attend Hillsborough Football Ground. We were unsure

           why we were called. We were given no information as to what type o f incident had

           occurred, and no Major Incident Call was given.




 4.        Myself and my colleague,                   also a qualified Paramedic arrived at

           Leppings Lane, Hillsborough. There was a SYMAS mobile major incident vehicle

           parked. It is our usual practice to go to this vehicle for information as to the nature o f

          the problem and to enquire as to where we are most needed. We parked our

          Ambulance and I got out and started to walk over when the vehicle simply drove

          away. We still had no information as to what was going on. I approached a PC who

          seemed to be in a dazed state and I asked him where we were needed most. He stated

          words to the effect that the incident was around the next bend whilst pointing in the

          said direction and then continued walking away from the incident. We were in no way

          prepared for the scene that greeted us by the side o f a hedgerow. There were

          numerous bodies which looked like they had been thrown in a heap. Also people

          walking round dazed, people sitting down some with their heads in their hands.




5.        Myself and my colleague walked over to the bodies and I began working on one body

          and my colleague on another. The patient I attended to7had his shirt pulled over his      .
       head. I pulled it down and examined the youth then commenced resuscitation. Two

       police officers offered help and after quickly demonstrating resuscitation they assisted

       me. Then I intubated the patient. A doctor arrived and initiated a defibrillator/heart

       monitor examination. The doctor placed a cannula into our patient and set up a drip

       using haemaccel. The patient was still warm. We then took this patient to the Royal

       Hallamshire Hospital with a SYMAS ambulance and the Doctor. I now know this

       patient did not survive and I have a letter from J Mervyn Jones Msc, Assistant Chief

       Constable, West Midlands Police HQ to this effect.




6.     I have studied the photograph appended hereto and can reasonably identify myself as

       the ambulanceman wearing a white helmet tending to the casualty whom I intubated.




7.     I would like to point out that we received very little help from the Police regarding

       incident location. They seemed to be very shocked and were just walking along with

       the sea o f people leaving the Ground.

       I cannot understand why we did not receive a major incident call. I feel that this would

       have at least helped us prepare for the horrific scene which we faced. Valuable time

       was wasted seeking instructions and working on bodies which were already dead. Had

       we been directed to where we were needed most, immediately we arrived at the

       Ground then I feel that more could have been done for other categories o f casualties.

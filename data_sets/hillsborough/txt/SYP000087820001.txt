          I then        moved                   into     the       terrace            and       split       up       from                   .        She    went            off

          forward             to           position           1,    which          I have            marked          on     th e     grid        attached.                      I

          When        1 got                to    position           1 I found               that        I had          loads         of     room.           I    can

          he    was         wearing            had       a    pocket       on    the       front.

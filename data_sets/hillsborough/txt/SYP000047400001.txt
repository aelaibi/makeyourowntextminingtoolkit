Dear PS Killoch,

Cuttings enclosed are of the picture as it appeared in the Daily Star and
the enlarged version of the picture as we received it from PA. The caption
gives the PA photographers name.

Sorry about the quality but as I explained, copies of the papers that far
back are kept on microfilm. Obviously if you haven't already got it, PA
will be able to help with originals.

Yours sincerely,_________

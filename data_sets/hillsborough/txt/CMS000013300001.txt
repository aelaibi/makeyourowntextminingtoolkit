PRESENTATION TO LORD JUSTICE.TAYLOR: 17 OCTOBER



1.         I have been invited by Lord Justice Taylor to discuss the

national         membership    scheme      with    him   and    his   assessors       on    17

October.           He   does    not      want   any    further      paper    from    us     to

supplement the paper we have already provided on the proposals

for a national membership scheme (at Flag A).


 2.            I intend that my introductory remarks will be along the

 following lines



 Genesis of the National Membership Scheme


         The    Prime   Minister      decided     in   July    1987   to    press    for    the

         introduction of a national membership scheme on a voluntary

         basis     since    earlier      measures      although     worthwhile       had    not

         prevented continuing hooliganism;


     -   in particular all ticket matches have not prevented ticketless

         fans from trying to attend and there has been poor progress on

         partial membership schemes,              by June 1988 only 16 clubs had

         met the target of 50% ground capacity;


     -    the football authorities considerjthat a national membership

          scheme    could     not   be    introduced      on    a   voluntary       basis    and

          therefore the Government decided to legislate.                     As a basis for
    this legislation the Minister for Sport's Working Party was

    set up and included representatives of the police and football
    authorities.                                         "



Central Features of Scheme



-   We propose to designate all matches involving the 92 Football

    League       clubs,     including   their     matches        against      non-League

    opposition,       and    international      matches.          It    has    to     be     a

    comprehensive          scheme    otherwise     its       integrity         would        be

    undermined       by     displacement   of     hooligans        to    matches        not
    designated under scheme;1



-   few exemptions to membership of scheme.                   Only two exemptions

    in     the    Bill,     disabled    persons     in     dedicated          areas        and

    accompanied children under 10 in family enclosures.                        Important

    that only football hooligans are excluded from scheme.                           Scheme

    benefits include closer communication between clubs and fans
    and commercial potential;



    has to secure that only authorised spectators can attend the

    designated matches.             The mechanics     of     achieving        this     is    a

    matter for the FMA but the working assumption has been that it

    will    involve machine readable cards with photos via                           access

    control at the outside of the grounds.                   I    f     take advantage

    of   existing         technology,   avoid    further      queuing         delays       and

    enable rapid identification of unauthorised spectators;



    special arrangements will be required for Wembley to be worked

    up by Wembley authorities, the FLA and the police.
Parliament to take Account of Taylor's Final Report



   Bill amended to enable Parliament to have two opportunities to

   debate   the    scheme     after    Taylor's     Final      Report:     the    first

   before   FMA    is     appointed,    the   second      on    the     Secretary      of
   State's approval of the scheme.



Safety Amendments to the Bill



   Following Hillsborough the Bill amended to give the FLA power

   subject to Parliamentary approval, to supervise the discharge

   of local authority functions in respect of safety certificates

   and stipulate safety conditions.               Parliament will be able to

   take   account    of    Taylor.      The   FLA      will       also    advise      the

   Secretary of State on seating on football grounds.



Introduction of Scheme



   Aiming   to    introduce    scheme    before     the     end    of    the    1990/91

   session but Government will            have    to   be      satisfied       that   the
   scheme will be effective and efficient and that the technology
   is right.

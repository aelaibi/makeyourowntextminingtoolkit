Thank you for your letter of 22 February about your seminar on 11
May.

Now that the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Enquiry has concluded,
I am not proposing to take any active part myself in the follow-up
work. This is now being handled by Peter Bolton, the Head of 62
Division in the Home Office, and I have therefore sent on your
letter to him, so that he can be aware of your seminar and
consider whether he can be of any assistance to you.

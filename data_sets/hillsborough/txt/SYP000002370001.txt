             1    could       see      that      the      people         to m y         left        had     been       pushed          down       to    the

             perimeter           fencing           and     could         see       they were              having        problems             getting          a

             footing.            I could           see     that        they        were        down       backs        bent       forward          and       they

             were       unable         to    regain        a firm            standing.               I wasn't           aware          of    the       matcn

             starting.              I began          to    realise            t hat         people        behind        me    and       to    my       left

             were       experiencing               crushing,                 I thought              to    m y s e l f r d o n ’t p a nic               because

             I was       in f r o n t        of a      barrier           but       I could           see       very     clearly             that       it was

             becoming          very         compacted.                i realised               very       sucidenj.y         that       wnat       was

             s o m e o me     b e hind       say,      "For         go d s    s a ke        d o n *t s c o r e ” .       I t h o u ght            a b o ut

that      knowing             what          th e    half     joke       implied.

Almost            immediately                the     atmosphere           changed .             Someone         screamed        in f r o n t

of me,            possibly             by    the     fen c e .      Behind        me      a man       started       to     groan and

then       shouted               in m y      ear,        "pull     me    over"       by    t his      time      I was

experiencing                     constriction              all     around       me     except         for my       b ack    with    the

barrier            still          at    my       back.       I think        the      man would           be at      the     left    side

of    the         barrier           cross          bar.

I. t r i e d       to      turn        round        to    grab     him    but     I couldn't              I had     no     f r e e d o m at

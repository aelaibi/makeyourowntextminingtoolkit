  A few minutes                     after          1 500    hours       the     turnstiles        began     to     close.             Serial

  5 were         to       remain           on      duty whilst            another       serial     were      refreshed.                We

  were     due        to       be       refreshed           later.



  At    about         1 51 0        hours          one     of    the    turnstile        operators          informed         me       that

  they were               a    lot       of      people         on the     pitch.        At    t his   stage       1' a s s u m e d        that

  there         was       a    public            order      situation.            I walked        up   to    turns tiles              19 -22

  on the         corner             of     the      West        and So su t h Stand.            I went       inside         and       could

  see     peopie              on    the       pitch and           people        climbing       over    the W e s t      Stand

  fencing         and          police            officers         helping        them    over.

  help      clear             the       area       for     ambulances.            Shortly       a f t e r , two     f ir e

  appliances                  arrived            and     I made        sure     that    they were        parked        so    as       to

  enable         access             to a m b u l a n c e s .




  A    f i re    officer                then       i n f o r m e d me     that    some       casualties       would         be    brought

  out     form        the          turnstiles              19-22       to a w a i t    for    ambulances         and    could          I

  maintain            a       casualty             clearing           area.




  As    casualties                  were         brought         from     the    ground       I directed         them       over       to a

  n e a r b y w all            so       t h at     there        was    stil l    sufficient        room      for    ambulances                  to

  turn      round.                 Some       of    these        casualties           were    walking       supported            by

  others,          s om e          on    boards          and     stretchers.

                 At   t hi s    stage     I would     make   one   observation.          That   is   t ha t    it was      some

                 time    before         I fully   realised       exactly what      was    happening,          as   neither

                 myself        or m y    colleagues      working    in t h a t   area    were   in p o s s e s s i o n    of a

    Mr Terence Burkett of
    came to see me at my surgery on Friday.          His son was killed at
    Hillsborough.

    For a time Mr Burkett was a member of the Hillsborough Family Support
    Group but he left them. He preferred to grieve in his own way, and also
    conduct his own research on what actually happened at Hillsborough.

    He is now at the stage of his enquiries where he wishes to read all the
    original statements of the South Yorkshire and Liverpool Police which
    you have made public and which you provided for the Support Group.

    Is it possible please for a set of those statements to be given to my
    constituent? He is anxious to read them most carefully.

    Thank you for your help and I look forward to hearing from you.

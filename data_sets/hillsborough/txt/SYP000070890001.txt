Nottingham              Supporters            to         s om e     apparent              disorder          at    the      leppings            Lane

end     of     the      ground      where          the         Liverpool              supporters              were       standi n g .           I saw

lots      of    people          c 1 i mbjSrng      & '   fe r the          fence          and    onto       the       pitch.            I saw       two

Liverpool            s u p p o r t e r ^ /4'um      ju p       to     the       Spion       Kop and wave                 clenched             fists

at     the     Nottingham           fans .           These            youths          were       chased          bac k     to      the       other

end     by P o l i c e      Officers.                A        cordon was              put       full    length           of     the      halfway

line.          I could          sense        the     Nottingham                  supporters             becoming              agitated          and

wanting         to      know what            was     going            off.           I was       unable          to    tell        them

anything,            but    did     begin          to w o r r y            for       my    safety and             t ha t      of    thge

Liverpool            supporters,              due         to      the      sm a l l       numbers       of       us    segragating              the

t wo    sets       of    supporters.

From      where         I was      standing               I. c o u l d      see       people                          ifted        from       the

s t a n d i ng a r e a      of     leppings               Land        into       the       st-^n^y^ly/j^Ke rea r                   isle       where

people         were      seated.             I also            sa w     people            staggering             about        on    the       pitch

and     c o 1 las pi n g .        There        was            a general              melle       with       people         laid         on    the

floor        and     others        given        first             aid.          It    soon       became          obvious           to    me    t ha t

something            very       serious         had           occured           as    I saw          people       being         brought         to

th e    Spion Hop/North                 Stand             e xit       from       the       pitch who             were      obviously            dead.

A m s s s a ge j^as yfc^jfo^dcast o v e r                         the      publ i c a d d r e s s           system         saying            that

,here        had     b e e n an     incident                  and     to    co-operate               with        the     Police          and

emergency            services.               However              two      of    the       speaker          in the         roof         of    the

S p i o n Kop where              facing         towards               the       pitch and             not     the      supporters,              and
                                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                                 B1515

              it w a s      very    difficult       to    hea r    what      wa s    being       broadcast-             People    were

              ripping        the    advertisement          boards       down        to    use    as m a k e s h i f t    stretchers

              and    when        a Liverpool       supporter        was      brought        to    this     en d    of    the    ground

              dead     the N o t t i n g h a m    fans    would     start       clapping.             This      did     stop    however

              after       a t ime    when    people       in g e n e r a l    began        to    realise        t hat    this    wa s

              serious.            Throughout       this    t ime    the      reception           on m y    personal

              radio       wa s    poor,   however        this     was   my    own        issue    and was         not    fitted with

              an    ear     piece.

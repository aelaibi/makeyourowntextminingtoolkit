             On Saturday,              15 A p r i l ,    1989     (150489)          I was        on       duty    in    company with

             other     officers           involved         in    duties       at    th e      F A C u p Semi           Final       football

             m a t c h at    Hillsborough Football                      Stadium,           Sheffield             between Liverpool

             FC    and Nottingham               Forest      FC.

             I was     part       of    serial       number       34    under       the       supervision              of P S 2 2 4 8

             Sherratt.

             At    10am     (1000)        this     date     we    all    attended             a briefing           in the          grounds

             North Stand           area.

             At    11a m    (1100)        serials        number        34 and       35 were           briefed          by    our

             Commander,           Inspector          Townend.

             At    11.15am        (1115)        we a l l    took       up our       positions              on C l a y w h e e l s       Lane    and

             in    company with            PC    779 Martin            Wheatley,           we    met       Liverpool           supporters

             coaches        which       were     parked         along    Claywheels              L a n e.        Together          we    boarded

             a number        of    coaches,          welcoming          the    supporters                 and    informing          them       that

             entry     to    the       ground     without         tickets          would        be    refused and              that      alcohol

             would     not    be       tolerated         in the        ground.

             These     buses       contained            a wide       c ross    section           of all          ages       of L i v e r p o o l

             supporters           and whilst            in t h i s     location          most        of    them were           well      behaved

             and     they were          in g o o d      spirits.         We    did       s ea r ch a small              number          of    the

             supporters           carrier        bags,      plastic       bags          and     camera          cases              prohibited

articles          and/or            alcohol,

I can      s ay      that        although            nothing             untoward            was       found,       some       of     these

supporters               did     smell         of    intoxicants                 and       I know        s o me     men were

approaching               the       buses       asking             for     any       unsold        tickets,              I ca n s a y          that

two m e n       were       successful                in     purchasing                tw o       tickets          from    on e      of    the

coaches .
                                                                                                                                         ■i
At    1 4 S5    hours          we     were      further             deployed           at        the    junction          of     Claywheels

Lane     with        Penistone                Ro a d North.                We    we re       positioned             outside           a Public

House      called          'The          Gate"       and       ou r      duty was            defined          as    supervising                the

arriving          fans         who       were       walking           down       Halifax           Road       towards          us.

We    were      instructed                to    form a filter                    line        of    officers             and    to     instruct

the     supporters               that         all    alcoholic              drinks           would       be       left    at     this

location.                From       this       location you                 can       see        a good       distance           up H a l i f a x

Road     a n d as         fa r      as    I could           see       there          was     a    continuous             flow       of

Liverpool            supporters                in g r o u p s         of    10— 1E a b r e a s t             on    both       sides       of    the

carriageway.               The        majority            of       these        supporters              were       of    the     l o w e r age

bracket         ( l ess        than       30 years             old)        and       it w a s      very apparent                 at      this

time      that       a    large          amount       of       these        supporters                 had    consumed           alcohol.

A    large      number           of      these       supporters                 were       in f a c t        still       drinking

alcohol         from       beer/lager                cans a n d            bottles           of    spirits          a n d at        this
                                                               /
junction          they         were       stopped ¥nd                 told       to    leave           the    intoxicants                at    this

location.                Some       of    them       di d      leave        their          drinks,           but    others          insisted

on    consuming            the        contents            of       their        can/bottles              before          leaving          t h e m at

the     sc e n e .        Generally             they        were         all     of    good        behaviour,             they were

drunk      but       not       incapable             or     disorderly.

The     thing        that        became         apparent              to me          now     at    this       time       (1443        hours)

w as,    how      late         it was,          for       hundreds              of    them        to    be    still       walking             toward

the     ground,           and       still       further,              what       were        the       queues       like       at     the

turnstiles,               and       how       long    would           it    be       before        most       of    them       would          get

inside         the       ground          to    see    a football                 match.

                    W          |;
At    about         1455       hours        in     company              with        other        officers            I attended               at     ’The

G a t e ’ Public              House        because           a    report            of    trouble          inside*               I made my               way

to    the      external              fire       door       to     the         right       of     the     building               as    seen      from

the    road.             This        door       was     just           being        slammed           sh u t    as       I approached                it

and    four/five               men        stood       nearby            were        part        covered         in b l o o d          on    their

faces         and    obviously              angry          at     being            ejected         from        the       premises.

I ’b a n g e d *         on    the        door     of      the         premises           and     after         a few minutes                   the

door     opened           and        I was        met      by o t h e r            Police        Officers            who        informed            me

that     the        trouble            inside         ha d       been         quelled           a n d we w e r e          not        required

i ns i d e .

I    then      started              to m a k e     my way              back        to    th e    junction            of C l a y w h e e l s          Lane

and    Penistone               Road        North,          when         I again           received another                       report         th&t

trouble         had       flared           up     inside              ’T he    Gate'       Public          House.               this       t i me    I

went      inside          the        premises           by the            front          door      and,        although              I saw      no

fighting            or    trouble,              there        were         about          50-60        people         inside           the      premise

It w a s       then       decided           that        the       bar         be    shut        and    all      persons              requested            to

leave.          This          was      done       and      I left             the       premises,          no w      e mp t y ,       at    about

1510     hours.

3.' m a d e    my way          towards            the      traffic             lights           and    I wa s        then        informed            to

make     my way           to        the    front        of H i l l s b o r o u g h              Football            Ground,           on
                                                                  /
                                                                 /
Penistone            Road           North       and     to 'remain th e r e .                      This        we    did        in a       s er i a l ,

arriving            outside           the       gates        at        1530        hours.         The      first          instruction

given         to me       was        from       Inspector               Townend           to     go    inside            th e    ground         and

stop     people           coming           ou t    of      the         passageway               adjacent            to    the B p i o n         Hop

and    North         stand.               I went        into           the     ground           through         the       gates        and      the

first         thing       I saw was               an am b u l a n c e              parked        near     to        the    metal           fencing

dividing            the       above        t wo    areas          and         behind       this        ambulance                was    two

bodies,         b o t h men,              and     they were               covered          on      their        top       halves           with      bed

blankets,            both appeared                    to     be        dead,        no    one     w as    with           them.

I then         went       to        the    metal        gate           into        the    Spion        Kop      end       of     the       ground         in

                                                                                                                                          R447

     company with              tw o     other          officers          but     the      tide      of    people        wanting           to

     leave       t^e ground             was       far    too       great       for     us    to     stop,       I did         not    know why

     they    wanted          to    leave          or w h a t       had    occurred.               I honestly            believed           at

     this    time       that       there          had    been fighting                 between           fans or a d i s t u r b a n c e

     which       had    caused          the       games        to be      stopped.               I had       no i d e a       of th e s c a l e

     of    the    ensuing          disaster.

     I then       Was       told       to m a k e       my way       onto        the      playing         area and            this    I did

     via    the       passageway             at    the    side       of    the       North        Stand,        as     I walked           down

     the    passageway             I saw          numerous          persons          with minor             injuries,           to

     shoulders,             arms       and       chests.           There       were       people         being       carried         on

     boards,          stretchers,                and also          being       physically              lifted and             placed       on

     the    grassed          playing             area    in f r o n t      of me,

     I d i d at        this       time       assist       a man who              was      limping,          he w a s       assisted            to

     the    ambulance             I had          seen    earlier          near       to     the     metal       fencing         and       I sat

     him    on    the       conrete          and       told    him       help would              be a r r i v i n g .         I then went

     back    onto       the       playing          area and          assisted             another         man who          complained               of

     chest       pains,        he ws         also       being       aided        by a n o t h e r        man.        I di d     ask,

     " W h a t ’s g o n e      o f f " but         all    I was          told was           that       people        had      ’rushed
ft
     them'       and    t h at     a    lot       of    people       were        hurt       at    the     other        en d    of    the

     field,       ie W e s t       stand          (Leppings          Lane        end).           I left        this     man     in    the

     care    of       his    friend          and       I went       to    the      centre         of     the    playing         area       where

     I was       told       by a s e r g e a n t         to    form a          cordon across                the      field      and       to

     move    the       standing           people         towards          th e    West       stand        and     to    let t h r o u g h

     the    injured.              This       I    did    with a number                 of o t h e r      officers,             only

     allowing          the     injured            and    dead passed              us.

     I was       at    this       time       shouted          at    by    supporters              to     the    effect         that       we

     were    murdering             bastards             and    that       we     d i d n ’t g i v e       a toss        to w h a t        was

     going       on.

     1 can       say    that       at     this         time    the       Nottingham Forest                     supporters            were

     cheering          and     this       seemed         to    insense           the      Liverpool            s u p porters         who

             became       ir^re a n d       more      aggressive,              but    eventually          we   di d m a n a g e     to   calm

             and    disperse          some       supporters.

             A    large    number         of     bodies       were       brought       past    me    on    boards       and

             stretchers             and after         about     an       hour    we    were    told       to    resume    from       the

             ground and             return       to   o ur    respective             duties.        This       I did    and    I

             returned          to    Claywheels          Lane       to    supervise          the    Liverpool          supporters

             coaches.

             Even       when    on C l a y w h e e l s       Lane,       the    departing          supporters          were    still

             abusive           to    us   and     giving       us    aggravation             and    taunts,       with    the       number

             of    dead,       saying       "I    hope       y ou are         happy    its    n o w 54".         I had    no       i d e a of

             the    scale       of    the      disaster        was       so    large    in n u m b e r ,

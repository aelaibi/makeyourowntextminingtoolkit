WILL SAY:
                                                      *
My friend and I set off about U.OCk.m. on the coach organised by Barnes Travel.



After being delayed by roadworks on the notorway around Manchester we arrived at Sheffield

where we were stopped by Fblice to search our coach for alcohol.           We then vent about a further

mile down the road where we were again stopped by Police regarding ground regulations (i.e.

infabatable bananas etc.).           We eventually got off our coach about 1.45 p.m. and walked around

to get   s o t e thing   to eat.   While we were walking about to find a chip shop we saw quite a number

of Policemen (all within a mile radius of the ground) making sure people didn't carry cans

of beer near the ground.                                                     .



My friend and I arrived outside the ground at about 2.30 p.m., upon which we split up as he

had a stand ticket and I had a ground ticket for the Leppings Lane end of the ground.          I started

to try and queue up to get into the ground. Alas I found sheer pandemonium, I saw only 2 Policemen

(on horseback) trying to control a really large crowd, I would say well over 1,000 people.

I recognised one of the Policemen as one I think of Merseyside, trying to organise the queues

outside the Kop.



Anyway there was pushing and shoving and no semblence of carder or queuing, just one mass of
                                                                                  «



people trying to get into approximately 6 turnstiles with 2 Policemen trying to control things.

While I was in the middle of these people I looked around and couldN8t see any of the fblicencn.

A number of people were fainting with all the

crush and heat.




I eventually got to the turnstiles where I gave my ticket to the gateman at approximately 4

minutes to 3 (2.56 p.m.) and the gateman just took all my ticket off me, not even giving me

back the part to be retained.            When I got through the turnstiles I saw a few Policemen just
                                                    -   2   -




 leaning on     the other side of the vail by the turnstiles. I vent over to one of the Policenai

 and asked      him What he was doing her, did he realise that there vas absolute bedlam outside

 and peopole     vere getting hurt. He said "What can I do about              it". I said "You have a radio

 why don't you tell scmebody in authority".    I then vent through the tunnel opposite the turnstiles

 marked *2'.    I wanted to got to the right hand side of the goal by the comer flag as my friend

 (who vas at Hillsborough last year) advised he to do, as there would be 'murder' right behind

 the goal.     There were no Stewards at all there so I wait through the only entrance I saw, even

 though it vas behind the goal, because I thought I would be able to make my vay over to the

 right hand side.




When I got through the tunnel and into the standing area, we vere pushed forward and at one

stage I was petrified, there was a girl next to me who collapsed in the crush.                     I tried to

hold her up but found I couldn't move my arms.                  I thought I had my hand broken in the crush.

Everyone around started screaming at the Police                 and First Aid Men to get than out, but     they

were standing on the other side of the perineter fencing and started shouting "ftish back, Push

back", but      ve could'nt move.   Eventually they opened the gates in the fence and let                people

out on to       the cindertrack, but it still got no better, Iremember people shouting to              run .on

the pitch and stop the game.




When the game had stopped and people had all gone on tothe pitch,              the pressure eased off slightly

on the terraces.     I then saw a load of people lying face downon the floor and I thought at

the time they had fainted, also there vere people on the pitch, as well as at the front of
                                                                                     «




the terraces     receiving mouth to mouth resusitation. I then                      over the railing at the

side into a less crcwded area where they were helping people onto                the pitch.   I then got onto

the pitch and then sat downto get my breath back.




I then went onto the pitch to try and help people.                 I saw one nan giving the 'Kiss of Life'

to another and a Policeman just standing there watching him.




Then it was decided to take down the advertising boards and use than as stretchers to help

■as? Did the Police act so irresponsibly.     I heard on a News Bulletin there ucre 1,111 fblicaien

on duty all told, over 200 vere on duty inside the ground, yet only 2 IblicaiEn vere controlling

the people outside the Leppings lane end of the ground.




I have not suffered any physical damage but have suffered a great deal mentally.




Hoping this vdll not all be swept under the carpet and the various Efepartnents shoulder their

share of the blane.

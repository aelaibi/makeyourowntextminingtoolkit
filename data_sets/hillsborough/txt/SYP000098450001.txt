                  Chief Constable,
                  South Yorkshire Police,
                  Snig Hill,
                  Sheffield S3 8LY.

                  Dear Chief,
                                           SEMI-FINAL

                  I attach hereto three copies of letters taken from others received
                  from, in the main, Tottenham supporters at the last Semi-final.

                  I think that they have some justification for complaint in the
                  manner in which the croud control at Leppings Lane end didn*t do
                  what it set out to do.

                  It seems clear to me from investigations I have made since the event,
                  that the major contributory factor was that police turned away many
                  supporters at the Spion Kop end wearing Tottenham favours but producing
                  tickets that they had obtained from the Wolverhampton ground - they
                  were turned back to Leppings Lane to be with the Tottenham supporters.

                  I know it is wise in retrospect, always, but clearly what we should
                  have done was to ensure that part of the Kop end was sealed off if
                  necessary by police, to ensure that the some hundreds of Tottenham
                  spectators with Kop tickets could be accommodated at that end of the
                  ground rather than be funnelled back to the Leppxngs Lane end to
                  cause the congestion that resulted into the spill-over at the fence.

>•                Perhaps you would get your officers responsible to discuss this
                  matter further with Nr England at Hillsborough to see what we can do
                  in the future, because, clearly*, as a Club and you as a police force,
                  we mustn't have this kind of trouble again if it can possibly be avoided.

                  The intent and purpose of this letter is to be in every way conscious
                  of all that you do and have done at Hillsborough; but able to see too,
                  that as always, we can all do a better job if we bend our minds to it.

                   Thank you for all your past efforts.

                   Yours sincerely,



                   H.E. McGee
                     CHAIRMAN

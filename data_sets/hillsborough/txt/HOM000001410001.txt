           WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS


I    was    born         on the                               I am     employed       as     a
supervisor             for



I     have been a steward at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club for
the     last 5-6 years.                 I have always served as a steward in               the
West stand.


I     was a season ticket holder and my next door neighbour was                              a
steward.               I used to talk to him during matches and the                   chief
steward         one      day asked me to stand in as a temporary                 steward.
The     Chief steward, Stuart Thorpe, took my name and address and
asked      me      to be a reserve steward for the rest of the                       season.
I     acted      as a temporary steward on the odd occasion but                        after
the first season I became a regular or permanent steward.


As     a temporary steward, I was told by the other regulars                            such
as                           and                   what to do.       I was      instructed
on where to stand and how to check the tickets.


At     the start of every season there is an open night, or annual
meeting.               There       is    an   annual   meeting   for      the     gatemen,
turnstile          operators,            car park attendants and another             meeting
for all stewards.                  At that meeting we are addressed by a senior
Police Officer, Doug Lock (the club security officer), a                                 fire
service officer, and possibly someone from the Ambulance Brigade.


Instruction             is     given      on any changes in      emergency       codes      or
procedures.              The       evacuation procedures are         explained.          Doug
Lock       or      a    senior Police Officer normally             does      this.       This
season        we       have had two evacuation practices at                Hillsborough.

I       did      not know when they were to take place, but I heard                     the
message             over    the   public       address system.    The    code    for     an
emergency              evacuation       is



As        a     steward in the West            stand my   duties alternate       between
being positioned in one of the gangways to the seated areas, or
alternatively               at    the    bottom    of one of     the    two    staircases
leading up to the seated area.                     During an emergency evacuation,
it is important if positioned on a staircase to ensure that the
gates           at the bottom of the staircase are open and to make sure
that           that      area is kept clear.        Similarly, if positioned on           a
gangway,              the steward's responsibility is to make sure that the
gangway             is     kept clear, and also the entrance or exit              to    the
gangway.

The gatemen are of course responsible for ensuring that the big
concertina               gates are kept open.        The emergency evacuation           can
be called off by another message repeated on the public address
system           which       is



I do know that there is a first aid room under the North stand.
If someone is injured in the crowd, we can only carry them down
the           steps      onto the snack bar area, and we then have to                  carry
them           down      even further to the ground level where they can                  be
attended              to.    The alternative is to fetch a St Johns Ambulance
Brigade             man but that can take a long time.             It has occurred to
many           of     the    stewards        since the tragedy    that    it    would     be
    advisable            to have St Johns Ambulance men available in the West
    stand, and not simply on the perimeter track.


    I     have      not encountered any serious injuries to spectators                    in
    the       West stand .        However, we might well face difficulties                if
    someone           suffered a serious injury such as a heart attack.                  The
    chief steward is not in radio contact with the Police, although
    he        is in radio contact with Doug Lock.

Prior    to any big match, the stewards are normally briefed by a
senior     Police Officer.                For the last few seasjns^it has                   been
the same Police Inspector.                     He is known by his           beard.          This
briefing normally takes place before the turnstiles are opened.


The     Police        Inspector        usually      states    how   many     people          are
expected,        and      whether one or both staircases will be                    opened.
For     most league games, there is only one staircase open behind
1^16 turnstiles.               Noone is allowed up the other staircase and 6
stewards        are       deployed        on    that other    staircase      to        prevent
access.           The       gates are shut but unlocked.             This has           to    be
done     in     the       event       of any emergency       evacuation.          On     these
occasions,        the       gate to the partition wall is also                   kept        shut
and normally there are stewards or police on the gate.


Six     stewards          are     normally deployed on each          staircase.               The
remainder        are deployed on the gangways to the seated area                              and
on the emergency exits to the seated area.


It     is normal practice for the Police at league games to put                                 a
barrier       across        the South West corner.            The North West pen               is
kept     closed and the gate to the partition wall is shut.                                  This
means     that any away fans coming through the A-G turnstiles are
channeled into the centre pens on the terrace.                          When these pens
become        full, the Police then remove the barriers to the                           South
West     pen.         I have seen Police on occasion at the entrance                           to
 the tunnel, and noticed quite a few directing fans to the South
West     pen.         I    have       not seen a barrier in         place     across          the
 tunnel, nor have I seen the doors closed.


 This     practice         I    have described has been in            place        all       this
 season.         If _ necessary,           the     Police    open   the     gate       to     the
 partition wall and allow access to the North West pens.


 At     those     league          games    where     large    numbers      are     expected,
 Police       Officers          are    normally deployed at the bottom                 of     the
                                              - 4 -


staircases to assist the stewards.


I have never seen stewards on the terraces.                      There are stewards
on     the Kop but they are safe there.                I have seen Police in the
South       West pen but not the centre pens, but it is important to
note       that     the West stand does overhang the West terrace,                      and
there       may have been Police at the rear of the terrace.                          There
is     a    direct view of the centre pens from the                 Police       control
box.

I have never been instructed by the Chief Steward or the Police
to     direct or control fans.                If, of course, I am approached                by
any        fan,    I would direct that fan to either the tunnel or                      the
South West pen or indeed the North West pen if open.


The        partition wall was originally built to segregate home                        and
away        fans    in     the    West stand.       The away    fans    went     through
turnstiles A-G to gain access to the centre pens and South West
pen        and about one third of the seated area.                 A railing divided
the seated area which is still in place.


The        remainder of course belonged to the home fans.                  Before the
partition          wall was built, the home and away fans were able                         to
mix        behind       the     stand.   There may have been a          bigger    police
presence           in    those     days to stop the fans from mixingand                to
ensure segregation.                I cannot really      remember.


The        Police       system I have described         of sealing      offthe        South
West        pen     has been in existence for           many seasons. The             system
 has        changed        slightly      as   the   West   stand    became       an     away
 supporters only area some three seasons ago.


 The       steel        gates    to the staircases are         always    unlocked           for
 matches          together with every other exit or entrance to the West
 stand.           The gate in the partition wall is always unlocked.                          I
 have        seen Police Officers go round to check to make sure                        that
 gates are unlocked.
When attending any game, a steward must hand over a ticket from
his    booklet which is issued at the start of each season.                         The
ticket       provided is used as a means of recording attendance                      so
that    payment can be made           before the end of the match.          At      the
back    of this booklet there is a           section entitled "Instructions
for     match     day     staff".      There is also   a     seperate     document
recording       the same       information handed out at the start of each
season,          and     very probably     at   the annual     meeting        of     the
stewards.         I    should also mention that any temporary             stewards
are     always        placed    with an experienced    steward.         The        chief
steward        receives    the tickets and provides a steward's                jacket
which     is     a yellow plastic covering.        All stewards         must       wear
their     photopass,       and    without this photopass, access              to     the
ground cannot be obtained.             The photopass is normally issued at
the annual meeting.


Xt     is impossible to ascertain the numbers of fans in the                        pens
on     the terrace.       It is not possible to see the full extent                   of
the      terrace       from    the gangways in the seated        area,        and     of
course       it is impossible to see from the staircases at the rear
of     the     West stand.       It has occurred to a number         of     stewards
including        myself       at matches that the pens may be full.                 Fans
have     complained       to     us   that they cannot see      or    cannot         get
through         as the pen is full.       Although fans do complain, we are
not     in      a position where we can leave our posts.              The      Police
have     on     occasion asked stewards to direct fans from the                     back
of     the South West area if full, or where fans have come out of
the     centre pens as they cannot obtain a good view or the                        area
is too full.


Including        this     years semi final, there have been four FA                  cup
semi     finals -since 1981.          The first took place in 1981            between
Spurs        and Wolves, and although I was at the match I was not                     a
steward.         In 1987 a semi final took place between Leeds United
and     Coventry.         That was a morning kick off and the start                  was
delayed by half an hour to three quarters of an hour because of
                                         - 6 -


traffic        problems.      For semi finals, the gate to       the partition
wall is always kept open.


I     now turn to my involvement in the events which took place on
the     15th April 1989 at Hillsborough.           I arrived at the        ground
at     11.00     am.        I reported to Stuart Thorpe to      hand   over      my
ticket     and       was     givena jacket in return.    I   was    told         my
position        in that I was deployed on gangway X.            I was also told
that     a temporary steward would also be with me.              Stuart Thorpe
brought the temporary steward to me.             I have forgotten his name
but I think his first name was John.

                                                    b/     .
The     Police       Inspector, the same man with a fertg beard,          gave     a
briefing        to the stewards.       This occurred before the turnstiles
opened.        He explained the three types of ticket by referring to
the     colours.           He told us to be vigulant and     to look out         for
forgeries.           He took the names of the stewards manning thefire
gates.         He told us that both staircases were open and that                we
should make sure that fans do not jump over seats.                  He reminded
us     not to get involved with any trouble.            Reference is made to
this     in the instructions to match day staff.             If there is         any
crowd misbehaviour, we must fetch a Police Officer.


He     told     us     to    keep    the gangways clear. I   did    ask    if      a
programme           seller    could be deployed by the snack bar.         Fans do
try     to go downstairs in order to buy a programme and this                    can
cause     confusion          as we normally tear off the     corners off         the
tickets        to     prevent fans from throwing their       tickets down         to
fans     below.        The programme sellers are normally located on the
ground level.           I thought it would save confusion if a programme
seller        was put in the snack bar area.        The only difficulty           is
that     programme sellers           are normally put behind barriers or in
porta     cabins        as    we have had instances of   programme        sellers
being mugged or hassled.


The     Police Inspector told us to enjoy the match.               I went to my
post.         The     turnstiles opened at about         day.     There    was     a
                                               - 7 -


trickle        of fans to begin with.                They were very friendly.              Many
of     those       who came in early were Liverpool fans but                      were      not
from     Liverpool.             I remember chatting to two Liverpool fans who
lived     very        near the Arsenal football ground.                  Up to      2.15     to
2.20     pm there was a steady stream of fans coming into the West
stand.         I     remember passing comment to the               temporary          steward
that     there       was a good atmosphere, but I could not                      understand
where        all    the fans were.           Normally, the seated area              and     the
terrace        would be filling up but by 2.30 pm the seated area was
half full.          This is very unusual for a semi final.


At 2.20 pm I went to the toilets in the snack bar area and from
that     position I could see down Leppings Lane.                        I was surprised
by     how     many people were outside.                I also noted that           at      last
years        semi final there was a cordon of Police to the forecourt
area and by the edge of the road.                      On this occasion, the Police
appeared to be at the external gates before the turnstiles.


After I returned from the toilets, I noticed that the fans were
coming in a lot quicker. I noticed that many had been drinking.
Some     of        the fans were acting rather stupidly and                   were        being
cheeky.            They were not violent             but there was a great deal               of
abuse.        This is nothing unusual.


At     2.50 pm, there was a big rush at gangway X.                        Some fans          did
not     have        any tickets.         Some had only a stub.           I    asked       these
fans     to        wait so that I could check the tickets but                       owing     to
the     rush,            I    was knocked down the aisle           and    the       temporary
steward            was       knocked     sideways.      Everyone     charged         in      and
scattered.               I     suspect   that some did not have           tickets.           The
stub     part is in fact retained by the turnstile operator.                                Many
may     have        got through without showing their tickets                       and     then
provided a stub to someone who did not have a ticket.


About        100     fans got through during this rush.                   I   was     knocked
over     trying              to stop them.    When this subsided, I             decided       to
check        the     tickets        again.    By this time the           seated      area was
                                          - 8 -


packed.     Many of the fans were sitting or standing in aisles or
gangways        behind the exit.       I noticed that there were many fans.
two to a seat.


There     were also fans who had seat tickets but could not get to
the      seats.          I then noticed people being pulled up                at     the
front of the seated area from the terrace just after kick off.


During     this     period, fans still came up the staircases                  and     I
noticed     more and more people going over the perimeter fence on
the     terrace     onto    the pitch.     At first, I suspected          a        pitch
invasion.         At     this     stage, I was hemmed in by the volume                of
people.


I     then noticed Police Officers attempting to help fans on                        the
terrace up to the seated area.             I saw the players taken off the
pitch.


The     crowd     quietened down.      A woman passed up was           unconsious.
Some of the fans took her down onto the landing where the snack
bar is situated.           I went down to see that she was alright.                  She
was     still     unconsious       and a Police Officer started          to        apply
first aid.        I went back up the steps.          By this time people were
being laid out onto the pitch.


The     attitude of the fans changed.             I was faced with abuse             and
was     thumped a few times.          I was not frightened as such.                I was
very w a r y of those around me.          In fact, I could not          get up        to
the     seated area        as the steps were full of people.              I        could
smell drink from a few people.


I     went to the snack bar area and was approached by a man and a
woman     who said that they were a doctor and nurse respectively.
They     wanted     to     know   where   to go.     I   took   them     down        the
staircase        to a Police Officer who directed us to the pitch.                     I
took     them to the uncovered seats in the South stand from where
access could be gained to the pitch.
                                            - 9 -




I went back to the West stand.


Many     fans        were walking about in a shocked state.                  I    assumed
that     these        fans     were those who had been pulled up                 from           the
terrace.       The girls from the snack bar were giving them drinks.
A    crowd      of Liverpool fans were shouting and fighting                      amongst
themselves in the snack bar area.


I      looked atone person who was suffering from injured fingers.
It      was     not a serious injury.           I should mention that                 I    have
undertaken        a     first aid course as part of my job.              I       directed
them     to the first aid room under the North stand.                 Some of the
fans     were looking for their friends or relatives.                    I told them
to go to the bottom of the staircase.


There    was      still a great deal of abuse being suffered                      by        the
stewards.         Some        fans    were saying that it was our            fault           and
they     should       have had the other end, ie the Kop.            I went                 over
tomy brother-in-law who was in the next                   gangway.    He told                   me
to      take     my jacket off.          The Police told the stewards to                   take
off     their        jackets.        By now it was about 3.30 pm.            I    put           my
jacket in my pocket.


I     went    down the staircase and tried to help those people                             who
were     injured        and     lying near the tunnel.        As I say,           I        am    a
first        aider,     but     I    did not administer any      mouth           to        mouth
resuscitation           or     any other resuscitation        technique.                  Around
this     area behind the West stand, there were still fans walking
about        being     abusive but many were in tears.           I noticed                 urine
cascading        down from the West stand.             The Liverpool fans in the
seated        area were urinating at the rear of the stand.                       This has
happened before.


I then remember hearing an announcement to evacuate the ground.
I     cannot     remember           the exact words.    The   Liverpool           stewards
together        with     the Sheffield Wednesday stewards helped                          people
                                      - 10 -


leave    the    ground.   I was directing people out of      the    exits.
There    were      8-10       Sheffield   Wednesday   stewards     present .
including Albert Marsh.   I left the ground at          5.45 pm.    I   had

                                                 I, like others, did not know,
                                                 Anyone that had to go,
                                                 But we still remember those in the sky,
                                                                                                I hope that it will go.

                                                                                                Surging crowds in my dreams,
                                                 That are seated at God’s right hand on high.   Pushing on top of me,
                                                 We know we will never see them again,          Deaf and dumb policemen,
                                                 But our thoughts are with them all the         Please listen to our plea.

                                                 It was so sad to see them part,                The disaster now,
                                                 But they know love is from the heart.          Was six months ago,
                                                 YOU’ LL NEVER WALK ALONE!                      I’m all stressed up,
I dawdled down the gorge of grief,                                                              I hope it doesn’t show.
And now l’(ti just beginning the end of
   my journey,                                                                                  I can’t do my job,
A stroll down the road to recovery.                                                             My concentration has gone,
                                                                                                I just can’t sleep,
I remember all of those times when I was                                                        I simply can’t go on.

The gate to escape the grief was only a                                                         The disaster now,
   short gap away.                                                                              Was seven months ago,
But as I stopped to take a look at the wall I   One year on, One year on,                       I’ m on a massive downer now,
   was climbing,                                Memories so horrible, all too clear.            I must not let it show.
The grinning gate seemed farther away.          The hurt hasn’t gone,
So, yet again, I was blind unknowing and        Is it really a year?
                                                                                                I’ m really cracking up now,
   uncaring.                                                                                    I think I’ve really gone mad,
                                                One year on, One year on,
                                                                                                These tears can’t stop flowing,
Then eventually my journey led me to a          Won’t forget, can’t forget that awful day,      Why do I feel so bad?
  small town in Berkshire,                      So full of life, so full of fun,
Here I found the gate unbolted, and the road    For you I cry, each and every one.
                                                                                                The disaster now was eight months ago,
  unblocked.                                                                                    But still I’m in a mess,
Even though my steps grew cautiously            One year on, One year on,
                                                                                                I no longer care who knows it,
  smaller, the gate still grew closer.          Everyday I thank God I’m alive,                 And I think that most can guess.
Once I opened the gate and passed thru          The say life goes on,
  the clouds lifted,                            But not for you, God bless the ninety-five.

And the bubble burst.                                                                           Social worker and survivors too,

It was only then I realised that in order to                                                    Oh what the hell can I do?

I had to open the gate to God.                                                                  The disaster now was nine months ago,

       From someone who knows (aged 17)                                                         I don’t care who sees it,

 As the FA Cup is getting near, people shout                                                    My mind’s like sinking sand,
                                                The hurt I felt was nothing

This is surely not the end of an ever tragic                                                    To see if they understand,

    story                                       I would gladly share that too.
This is a day Liverpool won’t forget,                                                           My     words start pouring out now,
 It’s England’s worst football tragedy yet.                                                     My     feelings start to flow,
                                                There is nothing I can offer you,
This should put the FA to shame.                                                                I’m    finally getting back on top,
                                                Except for my heart and prayers,
And as yet no-one’s to blame,                                                                   I’ m   getting better I know.
                                                And I hope that it will ease the pain,
As Forest supporters tried to help,             Just to know that someone cares.
They heard young people scream and yelp.                                                        The disaster now was eleven months ago,
As young and old were suffocating,                                                              I finally have some hope,

Helpless people lay there waiting,                                                              I realise that all 95,
                                                  Hillsborough,
People screamed and went insane,                                                                Would want me to fight and cope.
                                                And did not make it home,
There was a mighty crush at Leppings Lane.      Shanks is there to take care of them,
“ You’ll Never Walk Alone” they say,                                                            As one year approaches,
                                                They will never walk alone.
No-one will ever forget this day,                                                               It comes flooding back again,*

                                                They will never be forgotten,
The friends and family left behind.                                                             For being well and sane.
                                                The Kop will never be the same,
As the mourners prayed and cried,               I will think of them with sadness,
For the love of football these people died,                                                     The disaster now is twelve months ago,
                                                At the start of each new game.
Let’s hope they know that when they die,                                                        I’m looking better everyone says so,

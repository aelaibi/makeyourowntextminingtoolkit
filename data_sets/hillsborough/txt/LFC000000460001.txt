           MINUTES OF A DIRECTORS MEETING HELD IN THE
           CLUB BOARD ROOM ON THURSDAY 24th MAY 1990


Hillsborough Family Support Group

A letter received from the Hillsborough Family Support Group requesting that
it would like the club, as a mark of respect for the supporters who lost their
lives at Hillsborough, not to ever play a match on the date of the 15th April,
was considered. It was agreed that the Hillsborough Family Support Group
be advised that the club will use its best endeavours not to play on this date,
although it must be clearly understood that this cannot be permanently
guaranteed as the club is really not in total control of this particular situation.

                        On    Saturday            15    A p ril     1989       I       commenced          duty       at       9.00am        at    E c cles field

                        P olice         S tation,           from    where          I    was    transported                   w ith    other       O fficers         to

                        the       H illsborough              Football          Ground,          where          a    fu ll      b riefin g         subsequently

                        took       place.

                        I    was    d etailed           to    S erial         19       together       w ith         PS       323     Proctor          and    ten

                        other       constables.                   Our    duties          were       in it ia lly             outside        the       ground,       at

                        the       Leppings          Lane      entrances,                supervising                a rriv in g        Liverp o o l

                        supporters,               receiving             and    searching             a rriv in g             coaches,        and       general

                        public          order       duties.             This       duty       was    in    fact          the       same     as    I    and    many       of

                        my    colleagues               perform          at    most       fo o tb all       matches             at     H illsborough,               has

                        been       w ell      trie d        and    tested,             and    m yself      and,          I    am     sure,       the    other

                        o ffic ers           present,         were       w ell         aware    of    what          was       required.

                        I    arrived          w ith     my    s eria l        at       the    Leppings             Lane       end     of    the       ground       at

                        some       tim e      sho rtly        a fte r        11.00am .          We    were          met       by     Inspector          Sykes       who

                        b riefed         us    on      our    p artic u la r            duties.           We       then       went     out       into       Leppings

                        Lane       and       took      up    p o sitions           in    the    'm outh*            of       the     entry       to    the    ground

                        and       the    Leppings            Lane       tu rn s tile s ,        alongside                Leppings           Lane       road     its e lf,

                        On    reaching            Leppings          Lane       I       im m ediately           noticed             that     there       were

                        already          a    large         number       of    L iverpool            supporters                 in    the    area,          some

                        w alking         around,            some    stood          around       in     sm all         groups.              The    tu rn s tile s
were     not           open       at    this       p o in t.         From     the       outset,          I    had       cause           to    converse

w ith    many           supporters,                a ll    of     whom       at    this       tim e      were          very        am icable.                I

was     con tin u ally                 approached           by       supporters              who    had       a rrived             early          and       who

were     asking              one       of    a    lim ited        number          of    question,             nam ely          -    Where          was

the     nearest              pub       or    beer-off?               Where        could       they       get       som ething                to    eat?

Where         a    p artic u la r            entrance           to     the    ground          was?       Did       I    know        where          any

tick ets           could          be    bought?

A ll    the        supporters                were     in    good        humour,          and       were       dealt        w ith

accordingly.                      They       continued            to    w alk      around          or    gather          in        groups,             the

numbers            building             stead ily          a ll      the     tim e.          More       and    more        fans          arrived

and     it        soon       became          noticeable              that     many       had       been       d rin kin g ,             many       were

in     fact        w alking            around       near        to     my    lo catio n         carrying               several           cans          or

bo ttles           of    beer,          and       openly        d rinking          from       them.           On       ’ norm al’            match

days      I       am    certain             this    in     its e lf         would       not     have         been       to lerated                by    my

s e ria l,         but       the       point       was     reached           where       there          were       sim ply          too       many          of

them     acting              in    this          manner.          There       was       the     occasional               loud           mouth          who

appeared               worse       for       drink,        but       again        as    tim e      went       on,       these           became          more

and     more           noticeable.

I    cannot            recall          the       exact     tim e       that       the    tu rn s tile s            were        opened,             but       I

can     recall           that          when       they     were,        there          was    no    apparent             rush           by    the

supporters               in       the       area    to     get       into     the       ground.              They       were        stood          about

in     groups           of    in creasing             s ize,         and     then       they       began       taking              up    positions

on     nearby           w alls,         s ittin g         and     d rinking            beer     etc.          There        were          many

people            who    had       obviously              a rrived          w ithout         tic k e ts ,      they        were          openly

approaching                  other          people        and     asking          to    buy     tic k e ts .            These           people

were      in       fact       a    continual              nuisance,           and       were       being       repeatedly                    asked          to

move     away           from       the       entrance           to     the    tu rn s tile s .

As     tim e       went       on       it    became        increasingly                 d iffic u lt          for       a ll       o ffic e rs ,

even      the          Mounted          o ffic e rs ,        to      m aintain          good       order       in       the        Leppings

Lane     area.               The       crowds       were        too     p le n tifu l         and       as    the       day        went       on       they
seemed        less       w illin g           to    respond             to     any       P olice         advice.            Very          large

groups        continued                to    stand          around          outside           and       refused           to       enter       the

ground        as       advised.              Because             of    the     numbers             involved,              and       the

re la tiv e ly          sm all         number          of    o ffic ers            present           to       deal       w ith      them,        this

task     soon          became          im p o ssib le.                It    was     not       possible              to    control           the

crowds        on       the    road          or    at    the       entrances              to     the       ground.              Even       the

horses        were       unable             to    control             the     m ajo rity           of     the       crowd.

I    think        that       the       tim e      would          be    about        2 . 00pm         when       Leppings             Lane        was

closed        to       vehicles             in    the       interests              of    safety.               By    this        tim e,      the

crowds,           many       who       were       now       c lea rly         worse          for     drink,          were          f illin g         the

whole        w idth      of       the       road.           It    remained              an    im possible                task       to    control

them.         As       the    k ic k -o ff         tim e         got       closer        more        and       more       fans       attem pted

to    gain        entry       through             the       Leppings           Lane          tu rn s tile s .             It     soon       became

obvious           that       they       were       getting             fru strate d             by      the     slow       movement              into

the     ground.              As    the       crowd          around          the     tu rn s tile s             increased             they

started           to    push       and       shove,          tempers           were          frayin g ,         m yself          and      other

o ffic ers         were       being          verb ally            abused.               There        seemed          l i t t l e     we     could

do.     At    one       stage,          as       requested             by     PS    Proctor,              I    follow ed            him     into       the

crowd        and       trie d      to       approach             the       tu rn s tile s ,          hoping          to        advise        the

crowd        to    stop       pushing             before          in ju rie s           occurred.               I    was       in    fact

separated              from       PS    Proctor             by    a    P olice          horse,          and     I    lost        sight       of

him .        At    this       point          I    repeatedly                shouted           out       at     the       crowd       around           me

to    stop        pushing.              This       was       useless,              nobody          took        any       notice,          and        most

seemed        to       laugh       o ff      the       advice          or     continue             to     verb ally            abuse        me       and

other        o ffic ers           there.           The       pushing           continued                and     in te n s ifie d .               I    made

my    way     nearer          to       the       edge       of    the       crowd,           somewhere              next       to     the      road.         I

could        see       that       the       crowd       near          the     tu rn s tile s            was     very       tig h tly         packed,

many     were          clim bing            up    onto       the       perim eter             w all       of    the       ground          seem ingly

to    escape           the    crush          rather          than          gain     easier           access.              The       pushing

nevertheless                 continued             and       was       at     its       worse        not       long       before          3.00pm .

I can recall a Police officer shouting out over a vehicle loudspeaker

to the crowd, advising to stop pushing, but the advice was ignored.

I    recall           thinking          that        there        was    soon       going          to    be       in ju rie s          if       the

pushing           didn’ t         stop,        although           from       my    p osition            I    couldn’ t               see       if

there        were       any       persons           being        injured          nearer          to    the       tu rn s tile s .

I    can     recall          that       there        was     a    point          when       there       was       a    sudden             surge

forward           by    the       crowd,        obviously              by    movement             near       the       tu rn s tile s .                  I

could        not       see     what       had       caused        this       but       I    assumed          that          a    gate          had     been

opened           to    relieve          the     pressure.               Had       this       not       been       done,          I    do       b elieve

that        serious          in ju rie s        or    damage           would       have          occurred             outside             the

entrances.                  A lso    at    this       point        I    can       re call         large          numbers             of

supporters              rushing           to    the       entrances              from       Leppings             Lane.           I    saw        them

run     across          the       road     from       a    w all       where       many          were       s ittin g           or    stood           near

by.         My    own       b e lie f     is    that       these        people             did    not       have       tic k e ts ,            and

that        on    seeing          the     sudden          rush     into          the       ground,          realisin g               that       a     gate

had     been          opened,        they       too       jo ined       the       rush.           This       obviously                added

considerably                 to     the    numbers           entering             the       entrance             at    the       same          tim e.

Supporters              continued              to    enter        the       ground,          but       sho rtly            a fte r        3.00pm ,               on

hearing           radio        messages             requesting              urgent          assistance                in       the    ground,                I

went        w ith      other        o ffic ers        into        the       ground,          onto       the       pitch ,            near        the

Leppings              Lane     terracin g .

I    f ir s t     of    a ll      thought           that     a    pitch          in vasio n           had    taken             place,          but       it

was     soon          apparent          that        the    in cid en t           was       much       more       serious.                 As    soon

as     it    was       apparent           that       people        were          gettin g         serio u sly              in ju red           in     the

crush        on       the    terracin g ,            w ith       other       o ffic ers           and       supporters,                   I    f ir s t

of    a ll       recall        trying          to    break        down       a    s trip         of    the       perim eter               fencing

to    the        rig h t     of     the    goalm outh             in    order          to    get       to    a    person             who,        if      not

already           dead,        was      very        serio u sly         in ju red .              This       was       eventu ally                done,

the     man       lifte d         through           the    broken           fence.           He       was    carried             onto          the

p itch       and       attended           to    by    other        o ffic e rs .             I    believe             he       was    dead          at

             this       tim e.

             From       this     point          I       assisted          in       helping          a ll     present       in           liftin g      obviously

             dead       people        from          the       terracin g,               and       also     assistin g          in ju red         people

             onto       the    pitch.               I    cannot          say       how       many    dead       bodies         I    helped           remove

             from       the    terracin g,                but       I    believe             it    must     have     been          in     double

             fig u res.          On    three             occasions             I    assisted             other     o ffic ers             who    I    could

             not    name,        in    attem pting                  to    resu scitate               three        people,           two        young       boys

             and    a    man     of    about             25-30          years.           I    can     re call      thinking               that       they     were

             already          dead     but          e ffo rts ,          n evertheless,                  continued         unsuccessfully                     to

             revive       them.            I    eventu ally               assisted                other     o ffic e rs ,          and     also

             supporters,              in       carrying             three          apparently              dead    young           men     from       the

             pitch       at    the     Leppings                Lane       end,          to    the    area       near      to       the     gymnasium.               I

             did    not       stay     w ith            any    of       these       bodies,          other        o ffic e rs            rem ained,          and    I

             could       not     id e n tify             any       of    them.

             I    remained        inside                the    ground,             on    the       pitch ,      u n til    most           of    the

             supporters           had          le ft      the       ground.              I    was    com pletely           stunned              by    a ll    that

             had    happened           and          could          not    in it ia lly             understand          how         it     could       have

             happened.            I    was          not       in    the    ground             when       the    in cid en t         began,           but     it    is

             my    opinion        th at,            being          present          outside          the       Leppings            Lane        entrances,

             it    was    extrem ely                lucky          that    no       serious          in ju ries        had         occurred           outside.

           Oil Saturday 15 April           1989 I commenced duty at 9.00am at Ecclesfield

           Police Station,          from where I was transported with other Officers to

           the Hillsborough Football Ground,               where a full briefing subsequently

           took p1a c e .

            I was detailed to Serial           19 together with PS 3E3 Proctor and ten

           other c on st ab le s.        Our duties were    initially outside the g r o u n d , at

           the Leppings Lane e nt r a n c e s , supervising arriving Liverpool

           supporters,          receiving and searching arriving        coaches, and general

            public order duties.            This duty was    in fact the same as 'I and many of

           my colleagues          perform at most football matches at Hillsborough?                 has

            been well tried and tested,           and myself and,      I am sure,, the other

           officers p r e s e nt , were well aware of what was            required.

            1 arrived with my serial at the L e p p m g s Lane end of the ground at

           some time shortly after 11.00am.                We were met by Inspector Sykes who

           briefed us on our particular duties.                We then went out into Leppings

           Lane and took up positions            in the    ’m o u t h ’ of the entry to the ground

           and the Leppings Lane turnstiles,               alongside Leppings Lane road itself.

           On reaching Leppings Lane            I immediately noticed that there were

           already a large number of Liverpool               supporters    in the area,      some

           walking around,          some stood around in small       groups.    The turnstiles
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             RB4

were not open at this point.        From the o u t s e t , I had cause to converse

with many supporters,      all of whom at this time were very amicable.                I

was    continually approached fay supporters who had arrived early and who

were asking one of a limited number of question,          namely - Where was

the nearest pub or beer-off?       Where    could they get something to eat?

Where a particular entrance to the ground was? Did 1 know where any

tickets    could be bought?

All the supporters were in good humour,         and were dealt with

accordingly.     They continued to walk around or gather         in groups,      the

numbers building steadily all the time.          More and more fans arrived

and it soon became noticeable that many had been drinking, many were

in fact walking around near to my location carrying several              cans or

bottles of beer,    and openly drinking from them.        On ’n o r m a l ’ match

days   1 am certain this    in itself would not have been tolerated by my

serial,   but the point was    reached where there were simply too many of

them acting    in this manner.    There was the occasional       loud mouth who

appeared worse for drink,      but again as time went on,      these became more

and more noticeable.

I cannot recall    the exact time that the turnstiles were opened,            but      I



can recall    that when they were,    there was ?io apparent     rush by the

supporters    in the area to get into the ground.       1 hey were stood about

in groups of increasing size, and then they began taking up positions

on nearby walls,    sitting and drinking beer etc.        There were many

people who had obviously arrived without tickets,          they were openly

approaching other people and asking to buy tickets.            These    people

were   in fact a continual    nuisance,    and were being repeatedly asked to

move away from the entrance to the turnstiles.

As time went on it became increasingly difficult for all officers,

even the Mounted officers,       to maintain good order    in the Leppings

Lane area.     T'he crowds were too plentiful and as the day went on they
                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                   RS4

seemed less willing to respond to any Police advice.                   Very   large

groups    continued to stand around outside and refused to enter the

ground as advised.        Because of the numbers      involved, and the

relatively small    number of officers         present to deal with them,          this

task soon became    impossible.       It was    not possible to control         the

crowds on the road or at the entrances            to the ground.        Even the

horses were unable to control the majority of the crowd.

I think that the time would be about 2.00pm when Leppings Lane was

closed to vehicles       in the interests of safety.          By this time,       the

crowds, many who were now clearly worse for drink, were filling the

whole width of the road.          It remained an impossible task to control

them.     As the kick-off time got closer more and more fans attempted

to gain entry through the Leppings Lane turnstiles.                   It soon became

obvious that they were getting frustrated by the slow movement                     into

the ground.    As the crowd around the turnstiles             increased they

started to push and shove,        tempers were fraying,        myself and other

officers were b e i n q verbally abused.         There seemed little we could

do. At one stage,    as    requested by PS Proctor,         1 followed him into the

crowd and tried to approach the turnstiles,               hoping to    advise the

crowd to stop pushing before injuries occurred.                I was    in fact

separated from PS Proctor by a Police            horse,   and I lost sight of

him.     At this point    1 repeatedly shouted out at the crowd around me

to stop pushing.     This was useless,         nobody took any notice,        and most

seemed to laugh off the advice or continue to verbally abuse me and

other officers there.       The    pushing   continued and intensified.            1 made

my way nearer to the edge of the crowd,            somewhere next to the road.              I

could see that the crowd near the turnstiles was very t i g h t 1y packed/

many were climbing up onto the perimeter wall of the ground seemingly

to escape the crush rather than gain easier access.                   The pushing

nevertheless    continued and was at its worse not long before 3.00pm.

                                                                                                 R84

I    can    recall    a   P olice    officer       shouting    out    over   a   vehicle    loudspeaker

to    the    crowd,       advising    to    stop    pushing,    but    the   advice   was    ignored.

I recall thinking that there was soon going to be injuries                                   if the

pushing d i d n ’t stop,            although from my position I couldn't see if

there were any persons being injured nearer to the turnstiles.

I can recall that there was a point when there was a sudden surge

forward by the crowd,                obviously by movement near the turnstiles.                        1

could not see what had caused this but 1 assumed that a gate had been

0 p e n bd t o reli eve the pr e a s u r e .          Ha d t h is n o t b © & n d o n e , I do b e 1ie v a

that serious          injuries or damage would have occurred outside the

entrances.           Also at this point 1 can recall                   large numbers of

supporter's rushing to the entrances                      from Leppings Lane.              1 saw them

run across the road from a wall where many were sitting or stood near

by.        My own belief       is that these people did not have tickets,                       and

that on seeing the sudden rush into the ground,                              realising that a gate

had been opened,             they too joined the rush.                 This obviously added

considerably to the numbers entering the entrance at the same time.

Supporters       continued to enter the ground,                      but shortly after 3.00pm,                 oi

hearing       radio messages          requesting urgent assistance                 in the ground,          I

went with other officers                   into the ground,          onto the pitch,        near the

Lappings Lane terracing.

1 first of all thought that a pitch invasion had taken place,                                   but it

was soon apparent that the incident was much more serious.                                   As soon

as it was apparent             that people were getting seriously injured in the

crush on the terracing,                with other officers and supporters,                    1 first

of all recall trying to break down a strip of the perimeter                                   fencing

to the right of the goalmouth in order to get to a person who,                                   if not

already dead, was very seriously injured.                             This was eventually done,

the man lifted through the broken f e n c e .                        He was carried onto the

pitch and attended to by other officers.                             1 believe he was dead at
                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                              RS4

         t hi s   t i me .

         From this point           1 assisted in helping all        present   in lifting obvious, 1

         dead people from the terracing,             and also assisting        injured people

         onto the pitch.            1 cannot say how many dead bodies          I helped remove

         from the terracing,           but   I believe    it must have been in double

         figures.            On three occasions   I assisted other officers who .1. could

         not name,           in attempting to resuscitate three people,           two young boys

         and a man of about 25-30 years.                 I can recall   t h :in k i n a that they were

         already dead but efforts,            nevertheless,       continued unsuccessfully to

         revive them.            I eventually assisted other officers,         and also

         su pp o rt er s , in carrying three apparently dead young men from the

         pitch at the Lappings Lane end,             to the area near to the gymnasium.              I

         did not stay with any of these bodies,                  other officers   remained,    and I

         could not identify any of them.

         I remained inside the ground,            on the pitch,       until most of the

         supporters had left the ground.                 1 was   completely stunned by all that

         had happened and could not initially understand how it could have

         happened.            1 was not in the ground when the incident began,            but it is

         my opinion that,           being present outside the Leppings Lane entrances,

         it was extremely lucky that no serious                  injuries had occurred outside.

            Further to my previous reports and statements                concerning Hillsborough

            Football      ground,    particularly R55D dated 19 May 1989, and R55E dated

            16 June 1989.

            I gave evidence to Lord Justice T a y l o r ’s enquiry on 28 June            1989.
                                                                     %
            I have examined 3 items of copy correspondence from the submissions

            to the enquiry by Sheffield City Council,               as follows:

            1.        Copy letter 2.5.85 - SYCC to Eastwood and Partners.

            2.        Letter 8.5.85 - Eastwoods to SYCC.

            3.    Copy letter       10.5.85 - SYCC to Eastwood and Partners.

            In        the first   letter    ( 1) above,   a proposal for new   radial fences,

            mention is made of two gates to be installed, and                  second gates    to be

            installed in existing fences.

            In the letter,         item    (2) this suggestion is resisted on grounds of

            expense of stewarding.

            In the letter item            (3) SYCC say that    "The Police are prepared to

            concede the request for two gates per radial fence". There                  is a note

            handwritten on this copy as follows:               "Agreed over the phone with

            Cl Clive Calvert".

            At this time a considerable number of changes were being
                                                                                   PAGE   2
                                                                                   R53F

         considered by the club.        The idea of extra gates in the radial fences

         was only a small part of the whole.

         The Chief Superintendent       ’F ’ Division at the time was Mr Brian

         Moseley, who died in 1986.        He was very interested in ground

         improvements,    and I would say that it was very much his personal

         decision as to what took place.          The extra radial fence gates were

         his idea.     He took    control at the ground on all major matches,      and

         worked from the control       room overlooking the Leppings Lane

         terraces.     He was therefore familiar with the problems that arose

         there.

         I was the liaison officer,       but on most matters   I would consult Mr

         Moseley, and on a question like this the         police would present a

         single policy,       over which Mr Moseley was the controlling   influence.

         To my recollection,       I was contacted by Mr Vaughan of SYCC about the

         club’s objection to the radial fence gates, and I consulted Mr

         Moseley,    before    replying to him that the police we re willing to

         concede this    point.     There were other   requests which were thought to

         have greater    priority.

         The    reason for originally requesting gates to be installed lower down

         the terrace,    adjacent to the perimeter fence, was two fold.        First to

         allow better access       by the police to the front of the terraces to

         sort out crowd trouble;       second,   to allow easier movement of

         spectator between pens.        In my opinion the first of these two

         reasons was most       important to the police at that time.

          Further to my previous               reports and statements         concerning Hillsborough

          Foo'tbal 1» ground,          parti eularly R55D dated 19 May 1989, and R55E dated

          16 June 1989.

          I gave evidence to Lord Justice T a y l o r ’s enquiry on 28 June                         1989,

          I have examined 3 items of copy correspondence from the submissions

          to the enquiry by Sheffield City Counci I , as follows!

          1.       Copy letter 2.5.85 - SYCC to Eastwood                and Partners.

          2.       Letter 8.5.85 - Eastwoods to SYCC.

          3.       Copy letter        10.5.85 ~ SYCC to Eastwood and Partners.

          In       the first       letter    (1) above, a    proposal for new         radial fences,

          mention is made of two gates to               be installed, and             second gates     to be

          installed in existing fences.

          In the letter,            item <H) this suggestion is resisted on grounds of

          expense of stewarding.

          In the letter item <3) SYCC say that                     "The Police are prepared to

          concede the request for two gates per radial                        fence". There     is a note

          handwritten on this copy as follows,!! "Agreed over the phone with

          Cl Clive C al v e r t ” .

          At   this t i m e    a    considerable    number    of    changes    were    being
                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                R53F

           considered        by    the    club.        The    idea    of   extra    gates   in   the   radial   fences

           was    only   a   sm all      part    of    the    w hole.

           The Chief Superintendent                    'F*     Division at the time was Mr Brian

           Moseley,      who died in 1986.                   He-? was very interested in ground

           i mprovements, and I would say that                          it was very much his personal

           decision as to what took place.                           The extra radial fence gates were

           his idea.         He took       control at the ground                   on all major matches,        and

           worked from the control                    room     overlooking the Leppings Lane

           terraces.,        He was therefore familiar with the problems that arose

           t he re .

           1 was the liaison officer, but on most matters I would consult Mr
           Moseley, and on a question like this the                            po1 i ce wouId present a

           single policy,           over which Mr Moseley was the controlling                           influence,

           fo my recollection,              I was       contacted by Mr Vaughan of SYCC about the

           club's objection to the radial fence gates, and I consulted Mr

           Moseley,      before       replying to him that the police were willing to

           concede this point.                  There were other requests which were thought to

           have greater priority.

           T he reason f ar o r i g i na 11y request 1ng gates to be insta 11ed lowsr down

           the terrace,           adjacent to the perimeter fence, was two fold.                            First to

           allow better access by the police to the front of the terraces to

           sort out crowd trouble?                    second,    to allow easier movement of

           spectator between pens.                     In my opinion the first of these two

           reasons was most              important to the police at that time.

               On Saturday the 15 April           1989 (150489)    I attended at Sheffield on the

               occasion of the F.A. Cup Semi-Final             between Liverpool       and Nottingham

               F orest.



               I was in charge of Serial 42 which consisted of 8 Constables and in

               overall    command of our sector was          Inspector BROOMHEAD.



               Our duties on this date were to patrol Halifax Road from Southey Green

               Road to Browning Road,           the Police Constables working          in pairs.     At

               TO a.m.    (1000)    that morning we were briefed at Hillsborough Stadium

               during which time we had had a packed meal,              and then we went to our

               1o cat ion.



               At   11 a.m.   (1100)      the same morning,    I went with Inspector BROOMHEAD

               to the White Horse           public house where we spoke to the licensee who

               informed us that he intended to remain open until the commencement of

               the match.     He also informed us that he intended to keep an orderly

               crowd and would have doormen on to reinforce this.
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    R419A

At 12 noon    (1200)    the same day I saw that this public house was full

and there was no bother and everything appeared in good humour.                        I

also noticed that the Thresher off-licence               close by was being fully

supported.        Liverpool    fans were queueing up to obtain cans of

drink.     The public house was packed solid and the beer garden at the

si de was a 1 &o f u 11y supported.     Supporter s of Li verpoo 1 ar r ivi ng by

coach and private transport, and at         1 p.m.   (1300)    the same day myself

and Inspector BROOMHEAD had occasion to rebuke only one Liverpool                          fan

who was acting       in a bawdy manner.     We checked this man's ticket,              saw

that    is was in order and warned him about his conduct.                There was no

further repetition of misconduct from this fan or any others,, even

though the majority had taken a good deal            to drink.     All   in    all they

were well    behaved in this particular part         of the town.



At 2 p.m.    (1400) many supporters were still arriving,             Threshers off-

licence closed because they were? sold out           of canned beers.          One fan

had to be removed to hospital          by ambulance when he had sat on the

ground and a piece of glass had cut his buttocks.                 Ihe fans we re

still    in good    humour and there was no animosity.           I spoke toseveral

fans who we re      1 ook i ng f o rward to the game .



During this period a family consisting of two elderly parents,                      their

son and daughter arrived at the White Horse for the purpose of

obtaining    refreshments,        I informed them that only Liverpool           fans

were    present    in the pub and even though they were sporting              the   Forest

colours,    they    managed to get    into the pub without incident.



At 2.40 p.m.       (1440)   the majority of fans started to make their way

towards Hi 1 1 sbo r ou gh „    Those that were   left were drinking off.
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               R4 - 1 9 A

At 2.55 p.m.     (1455) Halifax Road at our point was practically

deserted and I assembled the serial           in order to move towards

C'laywheels Lane     in order   to have our meal and then remain in reserve

until   the conclusion of the game,        whereupon we would take up our

in iti a 1 po s itions.



At 3 p.m.    (1500) we    reached the junction opposite Claywheels Lane

when we saw a number of serials         leaving en mass and heading towards

the ground,,    We immediately followed although it w a s n ’t obvious to

us at this time the reason for the exodus although the way these

serials were moving my initial         reaction was that trouble of some

description had happened either         inside or outside the ground.



When we reached Leppings Lane which was the nearest               point to us we

saw a mass of Police and people,         some fire engines were        in

attendance,    parked outside the main exit gates,           others arrived later,

ambulances were attending.         Saw that the main activity was near the

turnstiles area for the away supporters            (Liverpool).     The number of

P oIi ce in t his ar e a w a s massive a nd th ere wa s a d ou b 1e c o r de n of

officers across the nearside of Leppings Lane.               Many other officers

had already gone      into the ground.      At this stage     I still was not

particularly clear what actually had happened.               One of my officers

had a portable     radio and when he switched it on we heard that there

had been a crush situation inside the ground.              The radio    report went

on to include that a concertina gate had been opened to allow more

people into the ground and that the game had been stopped.



Fans started to leave the ground by their exit gates and I instructed

my serial    that we would remain in our        position to see them leave the

ground.     The officer with the portable        radio kept informing me that
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                R419A

there had been deaths starting from 3 then IE then EC) then 40.                  All

this time the Liverpool      fans were    leaving the ground there was a

torrent of abuse from them blaming the Police for opening the

concertina gate.      The majority of these      people were      in tears and I

instructed my serial     to let the abuse     ride over them unless any

physical action was taken against us,         none was.       Some fans actually

sympathised,    others gave words of encouragement and d i d n ’t place any

blame on the Police,      only on themselves for turning up late.



After about an hour the exit of fans         leaving Leppings Lane had ceased

and I took my serial      into the ground where we saw that           the ground was

littered with paper,     the wire fencing     in Leppings Lane        stand had been

cut open,    I presumed by Fire Brigade officers using bolt             cutters.

Whatever    injured or dead there were had been removed and the ground

was almost empty.



1 then took my serial      back along Leppings Lane towards Claywheels

Lane and dur i ng t h i s w a 1k she pherde d some   gro ups o f Li ve rpo o 1 f ans
•who were making their way back towards their transport.                One youth

had been so distraught he was arguing with a resident from one of the

side streets    close to Leppings Lane arid we had to step in quickly and

restrain this youth to prevent an assault taking place.                 He was taken

by his friends and they went on their way.



When we reached the traffic       island at Claywheels Lane we          remained in

                On Saturday the           15 April   1989   <150489)    1 attended at Sheffield on the

                occasion of the F.A. Cup Semi-Final               between Liverpool and Nottingham

                F o re s t «



                I. was    in charge of Serial 42 which consisted of 8 Constables and in

                overall        command of our sector was; Inspector BROOMHEAD.



                Our duties on this date were to patrol Halifax Road from Southey Careen

                Road to Browning Road,             the Police Cons'tables working           in pairs.     At

                • 10 a.m.       (1000 ) that morning we were brief ed at Hi 1,1sborough Stadium

                during which time we had had a packed meal, and then we went to our

                locati on »



                At 11 a.m.        (1100)    the same m o r n i n g , I went with Inspector BROOMHEAD

                to the White Horse           public house where we spoke to the licensee who

                informed us that he intended to remain open until the commencement of

                the match.         He also       informed us that he intended to keep an orderly

                crowd and would have doormen on to reinforce this.
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                R 4 1 l,?A

At IE noon <1200)       the same day I saw that this       public house was full

and there was no bother and everything appeared in good humour.                      I

also noticed that the Thresher off-licence             close by was being fully

supported.     Liverpool      fans were queueing up to obtain cans of

drink.     The public house was packed solid and the beer garden at the

side was also fully supported.          Supporters     of Liverpool arriving by

coach and private transport and at          "I p.m.   (1300)   the same day myself

and Inspector BROOMHEAD had occasion to rebuke only one Liverpool                        fa

who was acting       in a bawdy manner.    We checked this man *s ticket,            saw

that is was    in order and warned him about his conduct.                There was no

further repetition of misconduct          from this fan or any others,         even

though the majority had taken a good deal             to drink.    All    in all they

were well behaved in this particular          part of the town.



At 2 p.m.    (1400) many supporters were still arriving,             Threshers off-

licence closed because they were sold out of canned beers.                  One fan

had to be removed to hospital by ambulance when he had sat on the

ground and a piece of glass had cut his buttocks.                 The fans were

still    in good    humour and there was no animosity.         I spoke toseveral

fans who were       looking forward, to the game*,



During this period a family consisting of two elderly parents,                  their

son and daughter arrived at the White Horse for the purpose of

obtaining    refreshments.       I informed them that only Liverpool          fans

were present        in the pub and even though they were             sporting the Fores

colours,    they    managed to get into the pub without incident.



At 2.40 p.m.       (1440)   the majority of fans started to make their way

towards Hillsborough.          Those that were   left were drinking off,.

           considered by the                 club.      The    idea of extra gates                  in the         radial       fences

           was only a small                 part of the w h o l e .

           The Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t        'F'      D i v i s i o n at the time was Mr B r i a n

           Moseley,         who    d ied     in 1986.         He was     very       interested,        in g r o u n d

           improvements,            and      I w o u l d say that        it was         very m u c h his           personal

           d e c i s i o n as to w hat          took    place.        The     e xtra     radial      f ence        gates were

           his     idea.      He    took      control       at the g r o u n d          on all m ajor m a tc he s,              a nd

           w o r k e d from the         control        room      o v e r l o o k i n g the L e p p i n g s L an e

           terraces.          He was         the re fo re     f am il ia r    w i t h the    prob le ms       that a ro se



           1 was     the     l iaison officer,              but on m os t m a t t e r s          I would       consult Mr

           Moseley,         and on a q u e s t i o n like this                the    police w o u l d        present a

           si ngle    policy,        over w h i c h Mr M o s e l e y was             the    c o nt r o l l i n g   influence.

           To my     rec ollection,            I was     con ta c te d       by Mr V a u g h a n     of S YC C      a bout       the

           club's     o bj e c t i o n to the          radial     fence       gates,       and    I c o n s u l t e d Mr

           Moseley,         before     replying        to him that            the   police were w i s h i n g              to

           concede       this      point.        There were         o ther       requests w h i c h w er e          t ho ug ht         to

           have    greater         priority.

           The     reason for        originally          r e q u es t in g    gates      to be      installed           lower down

           the terrace,            adjacent       to the       p e r i me t er    fence,     was     two fold.             F i rs t     to

           allow     better a c c e s s        by the       police     to the front              of the t e rr a c e s          to

           s p e ct at or    b et w e e n    pens.      In my o p i n i o n       the    first     of these          two

           reasons was m ost                i mportant      to the     p olice at that             time.

 About 5.00pm,     the same day I was   informed by D e te c t i v e ' C h i e f

'Superintendent Addis that the Coroner Dr, Popper had a u t h o r i s e d t h e

 use! of Kenyons    the firm of Funeral   Directors who specialise i n

 dealing with the bodies of victims of major            incidents.        1 was told,

 that Kenyons would be responsible for the preparation of the bodies

 for identification and their       removal   to the iiedico'-Legal Centre,

 mortuary at Watery Street,      Sheffield.

 In view of this,     once the   respective body officers had completed                   .

 searching and documenting       their body and had placed it into a body

bag,    they were stood down to the middle section of the gymnasium

The continuity and listing of property found on the                 individual bodies

officers supervised by Inspector Tingle.                                           ‘'.y

About 6.45pm,      the same day the Coroner Dr. Popper,           Home Offiee

Pathologist,     Professor Usher and Dr.      Jones attended at .the 'tetftpWary

mortuary and following discussions with Detective Chief;

Superintendent Addis,      it was decided that the services::of Kenyons

would then be permitted to view that                 particular body in Order to make

a fprmai       identification.         It was felt    that this system w ou ld        ■

alljeviate the need for             relatives or friends to undergo the traumatic

sspjerience of examining each and every body in order t:d make ;an

The respective           ’body o f f i c e r ’ assi st ed by a two man team of

Detectives        then cleaned up and prepared the facial           features of his

body which was then photographed.

About 8,50pm the same day a further twelve bodies were                   received at

the temporary mor tu ar y from the Nort he rn General Hospital and these

were processed in the same way as d escribed previously. . Thfese were

the bodies of persons taken from the ground to the hospital                      by

ambulance who had either been found dead on arrival                  there or who had

subsequently died shortly after their arrival.                                                     .

By 9,15pm,       that evening all of the bodies had been p ho to graphed and

the photos d isplayed in an area inside the main -entrance to the

gymnasium which is at the opposite end to that being used as the

temporary mortuary.                                                                            ■

A number of screens had been erected                 inside this entrance so as to

form a viewing area for the              individual    bodies® to be viewed by        . ’

respective        relatives or friends.        The bottom section of-the gymnasium

was fitted out with tables and chairs                 for use as an in’
                                                                      t&ryi.#             e#

The   procedure a dopted as far as the            identification process, was

concerned was as follows*-                                                                     •

Relatives or friends as appropriate,                 viewed the photographs and,

having made an initial              Identification were then taken to the viewing

area where that              particular body was shown to them.      If.- a. positive

ide ntifi cation was made they were then taken to the adjo in in g -area of

the   gymnasium where they were           interviewed and ail the    information

required by the    ’body o f f i c e r ’ to complete    the Sudden Ceath Report

(farm G.en/18) was obtained from them.

That Officer then returned to the body whilst a Detective obtained a

•statement regarding formal         identification.      Each body was     conveyed

from the temporary m ortuary area of the gymnasium to viewifig area by

means of wheeled stretcher trolleys which had been provided f or the

purpose by the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service.                Once the body had

been formally identified and the            relatives taken to the;, ihi«r'y„i'.ewi.ns' .

area,   the body was    returned to the temporary mortuary to await the

return of the    "body o f f i c e r ’.

On that officers     return to the body,        he then supervised i t ’s loading

onto an awaiting ambulance and then a c co mp an ie d the body to the

Medico-Legal Centre mortuary at W atery Street where               it was handed over

to a team of officers headed by Detective              Inspector Timms who /wivre

responsible for continuity thereafter.              The bodies were      conveyed in

threes to W atery Street       in order to maximise       the use of the

ambulances and prevent unnecessary delays,                           v         :   ■

Initially it had been intended to hand over to identifying                 relatives

the property found on the respective body but              in the event     it was;

found that this procedure was slowing down the              identification process

and in view of the      large number of people seeking to make

identification this      procedure was discontinued and the property taken

with the body to the Medico-Legal Centre where              it was   lodged.

At 9,30 pm, that day the first of the bodies were identified, and by

approximately 4,30 am,       the following morning Sunday                       .-19S9,-

At -approximately 1S.30 p.m.        <12305    I escorted a bus load of Notts

Forjest fans to H illsb oro ug h by bus.         All were well     behaved and didn't

seejri to mind the fact that they would have to go straight                    into the

grolund even though it was still          only 1.00 p.m.       (1300).     Onfe© the fans

disembarked and began to queue-: to enter the ground,               I returned on

the bus to the Midland Station,          where    I continued searching fania and

showing them onto the buses.

At 'approximately '2.15 p.m.       (1415)    together with six or.seV.ern other ,

Police Constables,       I went to Hills bo r ou g h on a bus.       On the way we

passed several      public houses.      Many were        so busy that football farts

(both Liverpool      and Notts Forest)       were drinking outside.          Fans on

their way to the m atch were openly drinking as they w alked towards

the g r o u n d .                                                     V'

On our arrival at the ground we made our way to the gymnasium.                       At

approximately 2.45 p.m.        <1445)   we received our meals..

Shortly before 3.00 p.m.        (150G) Police Sergeant K NI GHTS a sked myself

and about eight other Police Constables to follow him to the

Leppings Lane entrance       to the ground.        On our arrival we were met by

fans who screamed and pleaded with us to open the concertina gates.

One   in particular     came up to me and screamed,           "FOR CHRIST'S SAKE

OPEN THOSE GATES,      T H E R E ’S KIDS B EI NG CRUSHED O U T S I D E T h e    gate was

for approximately one minute to ease the pressure.                  As the gates

opened the fans more or less fell through the gates.                     Several   held up

their match tickets to be checked but            it was     impossible to check if

everyone had tickets,       due to the n u m b e r s .    The gates were then closed.

I ti-ien went with Police Sergeant K NI G HT S and other Police Constables

for help.      Others were blue       in the face and appe ar ed dead..                The ekit

gatps onto the pitch were then opened and a few fans g o t                         Out.      One

man! we pulled out       immediately returned and screamed at me to help his

girlfriend,     "SHE’ S DEAD, SHE’ S        DEAD.,"     The girl was not breathing but

she still     had a pulse.        After    1 gave     her mouth to mouth          resuscitation,

she began coughing and then she breathed.                     I then pulled her out a

bit further but her        legs were       caught,.                                            .

It was obvious at this point that we                  could not get a n y m o r e "out             .

gate without     firstly easing the pressure behind.                    1     tb#n climbed up

on the fencing beside the gate and began pulling                       people: over.

Several     children were    passed to the front anil we               pulled them over.

Sever#.!    people tried to grab my hand to be pulled overv

The fans then began to move           back.       1 then climbed over into the ‘

terrace and began to pull           bodies back from the front of the terrace,.

Those who were still alive were               passed out onto the pitch.

I gave mouth-t o- mo ut h to about five or six people,                       only one came too.

After we got all        the bodies out onto the            pitch and they were; taken to

the gymnasium,        I just stayed in the terrace and cried.                    -There were

shoes,     scarves,    jackets,    money and m atch programmes strewn on .the

terrace.      The barrier    beside       me was buckled. Fans above were

screaming and pointing at us              angrily.

After a while     1 made my way onto the pitch.                  My c o l l-eagU b s; were

standing around        in small    groups,     many    crying,    some walkJ.ng a i ml es sl y

around.     Fans too sat crying on the pitch and trying to console each

other.

because they were                 impeding       rescue efforts.                 Access and egress was

controlled from that                  time,      which would be about 3 . 40 p m .                       This was

essential action              because of the sheer numbers                          of people who were

a 1 ready i n v o l v e d .

My concerns from that                   point were to            impose         proper o r ga ni sa ti on on the

necessary duty of ensuring                       continuity as             regards evidence                for the

Coroner,        protection of property,                    and formal            identification

Detective Superintendent M c K a y , confirmed at about 4 . 0 5 pin by

Detective Chief S uperintendent Addis,.                               Part of this            control was to

allocate bodies a personal                       identification number!! to ensure that from

that point an individual                       police officer was made                  responsible             for each

foody; and that a search of the body was                                carried, out by those officers

to attempt         to make a tentative                 identification.

Circumstances           were      s u c h that a v e r y small              number     of     the       d e c e a s e d were

gave was       part     of    the    tentative         identification process.                          However

T h e r e were a large            n um b e r    of   people     in the          gym most      of    the     time,

particularly           in the       early stages.             M a n y w er e      police      officers,          a large

p r o p o r t i o n of t h e m    being        in plain     clothes.             This was      because          in the

police procedures for dealing with major disaster,                                           the Criminal

Investigation Dep artment                      role is to deal with mortuary and

identification arrangements.                         CIO officers who had responded to the

incident were deployed on these duties.                                   In the routine match

operation local CID officers had been deployed to crime                                                 prevention

and detection duties and many were                            casually dressed,                so to an

outsider would not have been immediately                                  identifiable             as    policemen.

As well as police officers assigned to each body,                                        others were

  deployed on dealing with personal       property of the deceased,        cleaning

  the bodies before    identification.     Other officers were deployed          in

  escorting arid dealing with attending       relatives   in the far end of      the

  gymnasium which had been made      into a reception     area.   It was   not    the

  case that relatives or friends were allowed to          wander freely about

  the temporary mortuary,     even in the very early      stages.

  The acoust i cs of the g y mnasium b u i 1ding w e re such that s o und echoed

  around the hall,    and there was a background of sound which was

  unavoidable.    However,   apart from the   confusion of the very early

  stages   everyone worked quietly and so far as possible with due

  respect for the dead.      This particularly applied     in the evening when

  relatives were attending to identify the deceased.          It was so quiet

  that the distress of the relatives      could be heard by any of the

  policemen present and caused considerable distress to them also.

             Hillsborough Football Ground,                Sheffield,    between Liverpool       and

             Nottingham Forest.               Prior to the kick off at 3.00pm on that             date      I

             Shortly after 3„00pm on that date together with other officers                            I was

             directed to enter the West Stand at the ground via the Leppings Lane

             entrance and clear               it of supporters.     Having entered      the stand 1

             assisted with the            removal     of a number   of dead and injured fans from

About 5.00pm,         the same day I was            informed toy Detective Chief

Superintendent Addis             that the Coroner Dr.. Hopper had author:!.Bed the

use of Kenyons the firm of Funeral                     Directors who specialise       in

dealing with the bodies of victims of major                       incidents,.    1 was told

that Kenyons would be responsible                    for the preparation of the bodies

for   identification and their               removal      to the Medi co--Leg a.I Centre

nio rt ua ry at Watery 3 1 r e e 1 , She f f i e 1 d ,

In view of this?          orice the respective            body officers   had completed

searching and documenting their body and had placed it into a body

b a g r they were stood down to the middle section of the gymnasium

which by then had been cleared of casualties and fitted out with

c ha i rs ..

The   continuity and listing of property found on the                      individual      bodies

and   in and around the West Stand                 was    co-ordinated .by a team of

0 f f i ce rs s u pe rvise d by I n s p e ct o r T i r t g 1e .

About 6.45pm,        the same day the Coroner Dr,. Popper,                Home Office

Pathologist,        Professor Usher and Dr., Jones attended at the temporary

mortuary and fallowing discussions with Detective Chief

Superintendent Addis,             it was decided that the services              of Kenyons

would not be utilised.               It was also decided that           in order to

facilitate       identification of individual                 bodies a Scenes    ofCrime Team

would take a polaroid photograph                   of the facial features        ofeach body.

1 he photographs would then be marked with the unique number                          of the

body to whi ch they ref e r r e d .

These would then be displayed on a board to be examined by the

relatives or friends of a suspected victim,                       in the event    that such

persons then made an initial                 identification of a photograph.,          they
                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                          R 137A

would then be permitted to view that                    particular body   in order to.make

a formal        identification.           It was felt    that this system would

alleviate the need for relatives                  or friends     to undergo    the traumatic

experience of examining each and every body in order to make an

•j.d e rtt i f i ca t ion.

The    respective            'body officer*   assisted by a two man team of

Detectives         then cleaned up and prepared the facial              features    of his

body which was               then photographed.

About 8.SOpm the same day a further                  twelve bodies were        received at

the temporary mortuary from the Northern General Hospital                         and these

were processed in the same way as described                      previously.     These were

the .bodies of persons taken from the ground to the hospital                        by

ambulance who had either                 been found dead on arrival      there or who had

subsequently died shortly after their arrival.

By 9.15pm,         that evening all         of the bodies had been photographed and

the photos displayed               in an area inside the main entrance to the

gymnasium which is at the opposite end to that being used as the

t em po ra ry m o r t-u a r y .

A number of screens had been erected                    inside   this entrance so as to

form a viewing area for the individual                   bodies to be viewed by

respective         relatives or friends,,         The bottom section of the gymnasium

was fitted out with tables and chairs                   for use as an interview area

for relatives/friends and members                 of the    caring agencies     that were

counselling them,               together with facilities for them to obtain              light

r efreshmsnt.

The   procedure adopted as far as the               identification process was

concerned was as follows s ~

Relatives or friends as appropriate,                 viewed the     photographs and

having made an               initial   identification were then taken to the viewing

area where that               particular body was shown to them.         If a positive
                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                               R 137 A

identification was made they were then taken to the adjoining area of

the gymnasium where            they were          interviewed and all       the information

requ i r e d by the      "body o f f i c e r ’ t o co rnp 1e t e t h e S u d d e n I)e a t h Repor t

(form Gen/18)         was obtained from them.

That Officer then           returned to the body whilst a Detective obtained a

statement      regarding formal              identification.      Each body was         conveyed

from the temporary mortuary area of the gymnasium to viewing area by

means of wheeled stretcher                   trolleys which had been provided for the

purpose by the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service,,                           Once    the body had

been formally identified and the relatives taken to the                              interviewing

area,    the body was        returned to the temporary mortuary to await                       the

r e t u.r n o f t h e *b o dy o f f i ce r    „

On that officers          return to the foody, he then supervised                    it's   loading

onto an awaiting ambulance and then accompanied the body to the

Medico-Legal Centre mortuary at Watery Street where                           it was handed over

to a team of officers headed by Detective                      Inspector Timms who were

responsible for          continuity thereafter.             “Ihe bodies were         conveyed in

threes to Watery Street              in order to maximise the use of the

air>bu 1ances and pre vent unne cessary de 1ays

Initially it had been             intended to hand over to identifying                   relatives

the property found on the respective                    body but in the event            it was

found that this         procedure was slowing            down the      identification        process

and in view of the           large number of people seeking                to make

identification this            procedure was         discontinued and the           property taken

with the body to the Medico-Legal                    Centre where      it was    lodged.

At 9.30 pm,       that day the first of the bodies were                    identified and by

approximately 4.30 am,             the following morning Sunday               16th April       1989,

a total    of 74 bodies had been identified and conveyed to the Med ic o—

Legal Centre.          The body bags          containing the remaining twenty bodies

were then clearly marked UNIDENTIFIED and together with their

         respective body officers   conveyed to the Medico-Legal    Centre mortuary

        where they too were handed over to Detective    Inspector    Iimms team.

         ninety four bodies had been formally identified.

               At 9.30 a.m.        (0930) we left West Bar for the Midland train station to

               begin our duties as a P.S.V.                 escort,,           This       entailed the shepherding

               of Nottingham Forest               fans onto waiting buses as they arrived at the

               Midland Station.           Fans were searched at                      random and several         had

               alcohol     confiscated.           Generally the fans                     I dealt with at the station

               were well behaved and courteous.

seem to mind the fact              that they would have to go straight                 into the

ground evert though it             was still only           1 .00 p.m.   ( '1300) »   Once   the farts

disembarked and began to queue to enter the ground,                            I returned on

the bus to the Midland Station,                  where I continued searching fans                 and

s h ow i n g t h ein o n t o t h e buses.

At approximately 2.15 p.m.              (1415)       together with six or seven other

Police Constables,          I went    to Hillsborough on a bus.                 On the way we

passed several        public houses,,          Many were so busy that foot bail fans

(both Liverpool        and Notts Forest)             were    drinking outside.          Fans on

their way to the match were openly drinking as they walked towards

the ground.

On our arrival at the ground we made our way to the gymnasium.                                 At

approximately H.45          p.m.   (1445) we received our meals.

Shortly before 3.00 p.m.             (1500) Police Sergeant KNIGHTS asked myself

and about eight other Police Constables                       to follow him to the

Leppings Lane entrance to the ground.                        On our arrival we were met by

fans who screamed and pleaded with us to open the concertina gates.

One in particular         came up to me and screamed,                 "FOR C H R I S T ’S SAKE,

OPEN THOSE G A T E S , THERE*S KIDS BEING CRUSHED O U T S I D E ."                    The gate was

bulging due to the pressure                 being exerted on it.           The gate was opened

for approximately one minute to ease the pressure.                            As the gates

opened the fans more or less fell                    through the gates..         Several     held up

their match tickets to be checked but                       it was   impossible to check          if

everyone had tickets,           due to the numbers.               The gates were then closed.

I then went with Police Sergeant KNIGHTS and other Police Constables

through the South Stand onto the                 pitch in front of the Leppings Lane

terrace.      It was obvious as we approached the area of the goal                            that

there were far too many people                 in the terrace.           I could see several

                                                                                                      860

faces    crushed against           the fence.          Many were       pale and were screaming

•for: help.      Others were blue            in the face and appeared dead.                      Ihe exit

gates onto the          pitch were then opened and a few fans got out.                                One

man we pulled out            immediately returned                and screamed at rue to help his

girlfriend,        "SHE'S DEAD,         S H E ’S DEAD."          The girl was        not breathing but

she still had a pulse,,                  After     Igave her mouth to mouth               resuscitation,

she began coughing and                 then she breathed.             I then pulled her out               a

bit further but her             legs were       caught.

It was obvious at this               point that we          could not get any more               out the

gate without firstly easing the                     pressure behind.             I then     climbed up

on the fencing beside              the gate and began pulling                  people over,.

Several      children were         passed to the front and we                  pulled them over.

Several     people tried to grab my                 hand to be pulled over.

The fans then began tomove back.                      I     then climbed over           into the

terrace and began to pull                 bodies back from            the front of the          terrace,.

Those who were still alive were                    passed        out onto the pitch.

I g a v e m o u t h - 1 o - m o u t h t o a b o u t f i v © o r a i x p e o p 1 e , o n 1y o n e c a m e t o o „

After we got all           the bodies out onto the                pitch and they were              taken to

the gymnasium,          I just stayed in the terrace and cried.                           There were

shoes,     scarves,      jackets,       money and match           programmes        strewn on the

terrace,,      The barrier         beside      me was     buckled. Fans above were

screaming and pointing at us                   angrily.

After a while         I made my way onto the               pitch.       My colleagues were

standing around           in small      groups,      many crying,         some walking aimlessly

around,,      Fans too sat         crying on the pitch and trying to console each

other.

At about 4.40 p.m.            <1&40)      I was    instructed,         along with some other

Police Constables,            to escort        fans back to the Midland Station                     on

buses.      Together with Police               Constable 53 LIVERSIDGE               I escorted          a bus

         We arrived at West Bar at approximately 7,00 p.m.          (1900)   and made our

         way back to the gymnasium on the fifth floor,.          We were de-briefed by

               On 15 April     1989,   I came on duty at Sheffield Wednesday football

               ground at 9-30 a.m.       and attended briefing.           I was   reponsible for two

               serials on the Spion Kop.        Following     briefing and refreshments              I took

               both serials     onto the Spion Kop terraces at about              11 a.m.    and briefed

               them.   I also briefed the stewards allocated to the Spion Kop at

               about   11.30 a.m.      The turnstiles opened at about this time.

               It had been a nticipated that Liverpool            supporters would enter the

               Spion Kop with tickets allocated to the Notts Forest                  fans.     To

               contain them an area adjacent          to the North Stand had been set -aside

               for them.      This a ssumption proved      correct and by 3 p.m. about 500

               Liverpool   supporters were      in the area under         close Police

               supervision.      The majority were not?       from their accounts,           from

               Merseyside.      Those from Merseyside       numbered 2 0 0 + r some said they had

               obtained tickets        from friends   in Nottingham,       others   said from touts

               both in Liverpool       and around the ground.

               Drink   in excess was evident      in a considerable number           of supporters,

               both Liverpool and Notts Forest.           This    included those      in a drunken

               condition and     in possession of drink.          The extent was such that X gave

               instructions     that only those       in an extreme state would be arrested in

               order not to deplete manpower.

                                                                                             ft53

        At about S . 45 p.m.   it became apparent      there was a fault on the radio.

         Transmissions from control were becoming broken,           although still

        audjible.   1 informed control     of this.

         I v|as on the Spion Kop at 3 p.m. with the serials             I had detailed to

         supervise the area    containing the Liverpool       supporters.       An apparent

         pitch invasion shortly after kick off          created a situation which

         incensed the Notts Forest       fans and the actions of some of them

         towards the Liverpool       group of supporters     suggested there would he a

         public disorder    situation on the Kop.        I therefore remained at this

         location with my serials       until   the ground   cleared.     1   took no part          in

         the events on the Leppings Lane terrace.

         Prior to early 198S,    I was responsible for several years             <9>    for

         Police    liaison in connection with Policing at Hillsborough.                 In

         connection with this    I made various       suggestions   in regards     to the

         ground,    in particular,   in respect   of the Leppings Lane end of the

         ground where,    due to the restricted access,        problems had been

         apparent at games with large crowds of away supporters.                 this

         included re-designing       the turnstile access and provision/extension of

         the public address    system to cover the outside of the turnstiles.                       I;

         can give further    information    if required.

                             Radio fault — best described as a warbling/clicking

                missing out one word in three.

                S»           I went to Leppings Lane end of ground with                 *C * Div. PC and

                Inspector White.        PC    identified gate      (B > he said was opened by a

                evident at Leppings Lane turnstiles due to increase                     in away fans.        .I

                suggested with a rough sketch that the whole of Leppings Lane. \

                turnstiles ~ then a crescent shape - should be demolisherd with rteUr

                individual       pens and to stand.        This was discussed with then senior

                of f icers - Chief S u p t . Moseley and S u p t . Lock • agreed shou 1 d be put

                to club.     Then secretary - Mr,          Chester ••••• came forward wit h c a itip ro m i s e

                accepted on basis that anything             is better than nothing.

                The   intention was twofold        (1) on the practice then operating' to allow

                different sets of supporters          into different         pens and    (2) to give

                greater space at the turnstiles.

          1987 SEMI FINAL - LEEDS UTD. V. COVENTRY

          Leeds on Leppings Lane Terraces — played on              Sunday with lunchtiuie

          kick off.     I was on duty outside     the ground       before kick off.      Despite

          time numerous drunks arrived..      In planning this match we had,           because

          of Leeds Utd reputation,       gone to great    pains tos

          1.          prevent fans arriving without           tickets™

          2.          taken steps to contain those Leeds fans who arrived without

                       tickets.

          In the event there were no problems at Leppings Lane                 that end of

          ground filled to capacity.        The only problem was Coventry fans

          arriving    late because of traffic on Ml ~ kick off time delayed.

          To the best of my knowledge there was no pitch invasion.

          There was,    however,    a pitch invasion    in 1961 Semi Final.      Spurs    v.

          Wolves.     This was caused:

          1.          by the Spurs fans    purchasing Wolves        tickets   to the Kop.

                       terraces    then being allowed    into Leppings Lane      Terrace and

          S.          late arrival    of Spurs fans who        rushed onto terrace     shortly

                       after kick off causing surge.

          We took this    into account this year and          last by ensuring that fans

     V    who had tickets for Kop but were not Notts,             Forest   fans were   not
"tpgir^                                       .           .                                  ,,



          transferred to other       ends of ground so capacity would not foe exceeded

          were held on area of Kop.

          It should be noted that       in 1980 Semi Final Arsenal         v„ Liverpool      that

          capacity was exceeded by at least       1000 due to forged tickets - no

          problems experienced.

             From     '1979 to late        1987 I was    responsible      for     liaison and in

             organisation of            (in consultation with senior officers)                  police

             functions at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.,                          Prior to this the

             task was undertaken on an ad hoc basis,                     usually by a shift           inspector

             or sub divisional             chief   inspector-     Following the         publication of the

             Standing        Instructions on policing football matches                    1 took over the

             duty of liaison officer.                                                            -

             During this          period    it became apparent       that despite         stewards     being

             employed by the club many were failing                   to do anything Other             than

             attend at the ground and disappear                  if problems arose - m a n y           failed to

             wear their tabbards and others were                  physically        incapable of carrying

             out their duty.            It was also apparent         that many of the stewards had

             no real idea what they should do.                  One of the problems on match days

             was that the club had no overall management                        of their s t e w a r d s , -

             In August        '19S1 I remember      that   I received a memorandum from then

            Chief Superintendent Herald                 concerning    the ineffectiveness             of

            stewards at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

             I brought Mr Herald's             comments,   and further views of my own,                    to the

            attention of all            stewards at a briefing held at Sheffield Wednesday

            Football Club on 22 August                198'1.    I have    continued to stress              these

poijnts in all the informal and formal          discussions     I have held with

 Stejwards and the club since that time.
     I
■The! situation improved with the appointment             of Mr Lock as security

officer     (in 1983 I t h i n k ) who on match days acted as the club's                'link

man; for their stewards and the subsequent adoption of a personal

radio system to maintain         contact with their       chief stewards        in various

areas of the ground.

Over the    period I was      liaison officer   I had frequent and various

contact with club officials - the secretaries               usually,    when     I pointed

out problems with stewards - this          included the clubs         r es po n s i b i 1 ities

for spectators     on the terraces as well as in the stands.                 1 am aware

this theme was frequently repeated by senior officers                  both to the

secretaries and the         club's security officer on several

occasions™      1 gained the     impression that the club believed that

because?    out of necessity,     the police occasionally        performed

the function of crowd packing,         they had no need to show, interest

or responsibility for the standing         crowds.

For several years      to    1987 I attended the annual meeting           of the

stewards,    usually shortly before the start            of the season.         During the

course of my presentation I outlined what the               police function and

responsibilities were,        what their duties were        in relation to the

crowd   (including on the terraces)        and what the safety procedures were

Prior to commencing my briefing - in (1984 or 1985 I think)                      I

obtained a copy of the         club instructions to stewards which was

completely inadequate - giving only information on conditions of

service and an outdated evacuation procedure.                I made    certain

suggestions which were        incorporated   in new instructions          for

stewards.     These   instructions were      circulated at every annual meeting

and explained by club staff.

     by the Spurs      Pans purchasing Wolves           tickets to the Kop terraces'

     then being allowed       into Leppi.ngs Lane Terrace and                        :

2.   late arrival      of Spurs fans who        rushed onto t s r ra c e: -stio r t ly:.after-.

     kick off   causing surge.

We took this    into account this year and last by ensuring that fans

who! had tickets for the Kop who were not Notts.                  Forest fans were not

transferred to other ends of ground so capacity would be exceeded -

they were held on segregated area of Kop.

It should be noted that        in 1980 Semi Final Arsenal             v« Liverpool        that

capacity was exceeded on Leppings Lane                 terraces by at     least    10(30 due

to forged tickets — no problems experienced.                   (This terrace was at

thait game occupied by Liverpool             supporters).

On -IS April,   1989    ( 130489)    I came on duty at       Sheffield      Wednesday

football   ground at 9.30am         (0930)    and attended briefing.          I was

responsible for two serials on the Spion Kop.                   Following      briefing and

refreshments    1 took both serials           onto the Spion Kop terraces at about

"II am ( 1100) and briefed them.             I also    briefed the stewards allocated

to the Spion Kop at about           11.30am    (1130).     The turnstiles       opened at

about this time.        It had been anticipated that Liverpool                 supporters

would enter the Spion Kop with tickets allocated to the Notts.                           Forest

fans.   To contain them an area adjacent                to the North Stand ha4 been

set aside for them.        This assumption proved correct and by 3pm                     (1500)

about 500 Liverpool       supporters were        in the area under        close Police

supervision.     The majority were not,           from their accents,         from

Merseyside.     Those from Merseyside           numbered 200+,       some said they had

Obtained tickets from friends           in Nottingham,       others said;from touts

both in Liverpool and around the ground.

Drink   in excess was evident         in a considerable number of suppor.ters P

both Liverpool and Notts. Forest.               This    included those      in a drutiken

         gave instructions       that only those     in an extreme state would be

         arrested in order not to deplete manpower..

         At about S.4 5 pm (1445)     it became apparent         there was a .fia-'U'l.t on the

         radjio.    Transmissions    from control were becoming broken,              although

         sti;ll audible.       I informed control      of t h i s .    The   radio fault    can best

         be ‘described as a warbling/clieking              missing out one word in three.

         I. was on the Spion Kop at 3pm          (1500)   with the serials        1 had detailed

         to supervise the area containing the Liverpool                  supporters.       Ari

         apparent   pitch invasion shortly after           kick off      created a situation

         which incensed the Notts.          Forest fans and the actions of some of them

         towards the Liverpool       group of supporters         suggested there would be a

         public disorder       situation on the Hop..        I therefore      remained at, this

         location with my serials until          the ground cleared.           1' took no part          in

         the events on the Leppings Lane terrace.

         My briefing to stewards was for those on Kop only - also Sergeants

         present and identified.

         I asked if worked Kop before         - yes.

         They were told to keep aisles          clear as possible.

         The emergency procedures were explained                 all   should be aware of own

         responsibility.

         The senior steward was       present      he was told         if he had any. problems

         to s peak' to m e .

         The stewards were told not to leave until               ground clear.

         I knew the senior       steward.    I had carried out annual           briefing several

         times and knew others       by sight.

         To the best of my knowledge stewards             on Kop did job.

         1   cannot say where they normally worked.

           On 7 August     '1985 (070885)    I attended a meeting at Hillsborough

           Football Ground of the Officers Working Party              in relation to Safety

           in Sports Grounds

           At this meeting various matters were discussed including the new

           secondary radial       fence 2m from the existing        radial   fence,    dividing

           the North from the Central         pens.

           At this time       it was agreed that      the gate at the perimeter        fence

           (number 3) would still         be available    for use for emergency agreis by

           fans.    These would be directed by the          police officer who had control

           of the g a t e s .

           I explained that our       control   of the gate was only exercised when the

           gates were     closed to effect segregation.           If the gates    in the radial

           fences   remained open and fastened back,            then segregation was no

           longer an issue and a police         presence was not      required.       This was

           already our     practice at the existing gates          in the    radial fence          no

           abjection was made by any person present.                                           o   /

           At this time there was no common key and the practice employed was

           for gates    in radial    fences when      closed,   to be bolted but not locked.

           The introduction of a common key was            to facilitate     ease,of access         for

           supervisory     police officers and club officials to all             parts of the

              On -15 April       1989,     I came on duty at Sheffield Wednesday football

              them.      I also briefed the stewards allocated to the Spion Hop at

              about    11.30 a.m.          The turnstiles opened at about this time.

              It had been anticipated that Liverpool                          supporters would enter                  the

              contain them an           area adjacent to the North Stand                      had been set            aside

         I was on the Spiort Kop at 3 p.m. with the serials I had detailed                                 to

         supervise the area              containing        the Liverpool       supporters.    An apparent

         Prior to early           1988,     I was     responsible         for several years    (9)   for

         Police     liaison       in connection with Policing at Hillsborough.                       In

         connection with this               I made various suggestions             in regards to the

         ground,      in particular,           in respect of the Leppings Lane end qf the

         ground where,          due to the        restricted access,           problems   had been,,

         apparent at games with large                    crowds of away supporters.           This

         included re-designing the                  turnstile access and provision/extension                     of

         the public address             system      to cover the outside of the turnstiles.                      I

         can give further            i rtfo rrnat ion if required.

               suggested with a rough sketch that the whole of Leppings Lane

               turnstiles            then a crescent        shape -• should be demolished with new

               ones built          parallel      to and near rear of stand with access to

               officers - Chief S u p t - Hose ley and S u p t . Lock - agreed should be put

               to club.        Then secretary — Mr.              Chester       came forward with compromise

               as turnstiles are laid out now - new turnstiles A/G built                                   in the

               accepted on basis that anything                     is better    than nothing,,

               The        intention was twofold          (1) on the     practice then operating            to allow

               different sets of supporters                     into different     pens and    (2) to give

           During this period it became apparent that despite stewards being

           employed by the club many were failing to do anything other than

           attend at the ground and disappear if problems arose - many failed to

           wear their tabbards and others were physically incapable of carrying

           out their duty.           It was also apparent that many of the stewards had

           no real idea what they should do.                     One of the problems on match days

           was that the club had no overall management of their stewards.,

           In Augtjst 1981 I remember that I re ce ived a memo randurn f rom then

           Chief Superintendent Herold concerning the ineffectiveness of

           stewards at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

           attention of all stewards at a briefing held at Sheffield Wednesday

Stewards and the club since that time.

The situation improved with the appointment of Mr Lock as security

Over the period I was liaison officer I had frequent and various

contact with club officials - the secretaries usually, when I pointed

out problems with stewards                  this included the clubs responsibilities

for spectators on the terraces as well as in the stands.                                I. am aware

this theme was frequently repeated by senior officers both to the

occasions.          X gained the impression that the club believed that

because, out of necessity,              the police occasionally performed

the function of crowd packing,                 they had no need to show interest

or responsibility for the standing crowds.

For several years to 1987 I attended the annual meeting of the

stewards, usually shortly before the start of the season.                                During the

course of my presentation I outlined what the police function and

responsibilities were, what their duties were in relation to the

crowd (including on the terraces) and what the safety procedures were

Prior to commencing my briefing - in <1984 or 1985 I think)                                I

obtained a copy of the club instructions to stewards which was

completely inadequate - giving only information on conditions of

service and an outdated evacuation procedure.                          I made certain

suggestions which were incorporated in new instructions for

stewards.       These instructions were circulated at every annual meeting

forward with compromise as turnstiles are laid out now - new

spending at football grounds accepted on basis that anything is

better than nothing.                  The intention was twofold <1> on the practice

then operating to allow different sets of supporters into different

pens and (8) to give greater space at the turnstiles..

policing for the 1987 Semi Final                        Leeds Utd. v . Coventry.

Leeds were allocated the Leppings La no; Terraces.                            This game was

played on Sunday with lunchtime kick off.                           I was on duty outside the

In the event there were no problems at Leppings Lane ~ that end of

ground filled to capacity.                   The only problem was Coventry fans

arriving late because of traffic on M1.                          The kick off time was

delayed.         To the best of my knowledge there was no pitch invasion.

There was., however, a pitch invasion in 1981 Semi Final Spurs v.

Wolves. This was caused —

•'I,   by the Spurs fans purchasing Wolves tickets to the Kop terraces

       then being allowed into Leppings Lane Terrace and

2.     late arrival of Spurs fans who rushed onto terrace shortly after

       k i ck   af f ca u s in g s u rg e .
We took this into account this year and last by ensuring that fans

who had tickets for the Kop who were not Notts, Forest fans were not

transferred to other ends of ground so capacity would be exceeded ~

they were held on segregated area of Kop.

It should be noted that in 1980 Semi Final Arsenal v. Liverpool that

capacity was exceeded on Leppings Lane terraces by at least 1000 due

to forged tickets - no problems experienced,                   (This terrace was at

t ha t gam e occupied by L iv er po o 1 s u pp o r te rs) .

On 15 April., 1989 (150489)               1 came on duty at Sheffield Wednesday

football ground at 9,30am (0930) and attended briefing.                     I was

responsible for two serials on the Spion Kop,                  Following briefing and

refreshments I took both serials onto the Spion Kop terraces at about

11     am (1100) and briefed them,,            I also briefed the stewards allocated

to the Spion Kop at about 11.30am (1130).                 The turnstiles opened at

about this time.             It had been anticipated that Liverpool supporters

would enter the Spion Hop with tickets allocated to the Notts. Forest

fans.      To contain them an area adjacent to the North Stand had been

set aside for them.              This assumption proved correct and by 3pm (1500)

about 500 Liverpool supporters were in the area under close Police

supervision.          The majority were not, from their accents,            from

Merseyside.          Those from Merseyside numbered 200+, some said they had

obtained tickets from friends in Nottingham,                  others said   from touts

both in Liverpool and around the ground.

Drink in excess was evident in a considerable number of supporters,

both Liverpool and Notts. Forest,                This included those in a drunken

condition and in possession of drink,                The extent was such that I

         At about 2.45prn (1445)                 it became apparent there was a fault on the

          radio.      1 ransmissions from control were becoming broken, although

         still audible,            I informed control of this.                  The radio fault can best

         be described as a warbling/e1icking ~ missing out one word in three.

         I was on the Spion Hop at 3pm (1500) with the serials I had detailed

         to supervise the area containing the Liverpool supporters.                                   An

         apparent pitch invasion shortly after kick off created a situation

         which incensed the Notts. Forest fans and the actions of some of them

         public disorder situation on the Kop.,                        I therefore remained at this

         location with my serials until the ground cleared.                               I took no part in

         the events on the Leppinga Lane terrace..

         My briefing to stewards was for those on Kop only - also Sergeants

         p re s e n t a n d id &n t if ie d ..

         I asked if worked Kop before -■ yes,.

         They were told to keep aisles clear as possible.

         The emergency procedures were explained ~ all should be aware of own

         r es po ns ibi 1 it y .

         The senior steward was present •••■• he was told if he had any problems

         to speak to me.

         The stewards were told not to leave until ground clear.

         I knew the senior steward,.                  I had carried out annual briefing several

         t imes and k new others by si g h t „

         To the best of my knowledge stewards on Kop did job.

         1 cannot say where they normally worked.

           On 7 August 1985 (070885)                     I attended a meeting at Hillsborough

           Football Ground of the Officers Working Party in relation to Safety

           in   S p o rt s G r o u n d s «

           At this meeting various matters were discussed including the new

           secondary radial fence 2m from the existing radial fence?                                   dividing

           the North from the Central                     pens.

           At this time it was agreed that the gate at the perimeter fence

           (number 5) would still be available for use for emergency agress by

           fa n s .   T h es e w o u 1d fa& di re cted fay th e police of fi cer w ho ha d co nt ro 1

           At this time there was no common key and the practice employed was

           for gates in radial fences when closed,                               to be bolted but not locked.

           The introduction of a common key was to facilitate ease of access for

           supervisory police officers and club officials to all parts of the

          locked on match days when segregation is an issue or small     crowds

         attend.

                In April      19 S 8 , as Detective Superintendent at                        "I- * Division,         I

                was a capacity crowd and adriii s s i on was by ticket o'n.i.y„

                My remit on that day was to organise and supervise all                                      elements of

                crime      prevention and         crime detection,.

                At about 2.40pm that day I found myself                           outside the ground               in the

                Leppings Lane turnsti 1e area,,                    The crowd using those turnstiles were

                numbers of people us i nq the turnstiles and a sizeable queue

                developed.           There was     increasing evidence                of drunkenness amongst the

                supporters who were all Liverpool                       fans.       “Ihere was a good deal                of

the turnstiles           but without         problem.

On Friday        14 April       1989 1 took         part     in a 'phone         in programme with

Radio Me rseys i d e , when I spoke with the presenter of that                                     programme

in relation to the Semi —F inal to take                         place on the following                   day arid

passed on various             pieces of advice             for fans who were travelling to

Sheffield.          One of the areas which                 I stressed was that              it was an all.

ticket match and that fans who did not have a ticket should not                                                come,,

At 3. GOpm that same afternoon 1 gave similar advice,                                    bv telephone,

which was recorded .by a member of staff at Radio Nottingham.

On Saturday 1S> April              1989 I was responsible for all matters                               in

relation to crime at the Cup Tie Seini— F i nal between Liverpool                                        I-C and

Nottingham Forest F C .               As    it was a carbon copy of the match which had

been played before             it made sense to use what had previously been

successful arrangements as the bulk of the supporters would have

attended the previous match and would be aware of the                                     locations of

the various facilities and the various                           systems operating at the ground

On the day my staff were split into two teams,.                                 A team of          IS

Outside the ground Detective                    Inspector Scaife had charge of a team of

clothes on non descript motor                     cycles and it had been envisaged that,

whilst the game was              in pr ogress, these officers would                        patrol        the

quiet streets          lined with          parked cars        in an effort to prevent and

I attended the briefing at Sheffield Wednesday FC at                                     10.0Dam and

following this briefed my own detectives.                               I was accompanied through

the first       part of the day by Police Constable S439 Booking,                                       who was

At    1□.5 0 a m , together with PC Backing,                   I went to a mobile         police       radio

control,, who were monitoring all C1.0 transmissions on channel.                                  19.

This      caravan was               placed on land at the side of l-lillfoot bridge arid

only a few yards from the frontage                          of a public house       called     * Ihe O w l 1
                                                                                                           ';

Even at that stage supporters were queuing outside,                                waiting     for the

Owl    to be opened,                 and at 11.D0a.rn the bars opened.

1 remained in and around that                         location for some 40         minutes and during

that      period,          trade at the public house               increased as football        fans

g a t h e r e d 111e re .

The     location of this                     public, house would    lead me to     believe that the

majority,            if not all,             of these fans were Nottingham Forest

supporters.               X had nothing to do with them and cannot say for certain.

I patrolled in my own vehicle with PC Bo eking and at about                                  '1.00 pm had

a meeting with Detective                         Inspector Scai fe and some of his, staff              in

the parking area for Wads ley Bridge Section Station,,                               This    lasted a

few minutes and after                        the departure of Detective         Inspector' Scaife and

his staff            I was joined by the two motor                 cyclists and 1 gave them

intention to leave my car in the                          car park there arid spend the time

between then and the start of the match,                             on foot.    Whilst at thal­

lo cat ion I went                 into the Club with PC Bo eking and sought out the

Deputy Head of Merseyside CID, a Detective Superintendent Baxter ■- a

man who          I knew would be 1urichi ng at the Club with some of his family

and for whom I had arranged nearby parking.                              I had not met Mr. Baxter

before and,               having        introduced myself as a matter of courtesy,                PC

supporter '5 of both football               clubs who,      I assumed,      were ail        police

officers,,,      It was apparent         that most were di ni ng or' waiting for meals

About    1.50 pm PC Bo eking and I went to the gymnasium at Sheffield

decided to spend the rema i n i ng time until                   kick- oft       oulsicie    t,lie ground

in the vicinity of the Leppings Lane turnstiles,                           as    I considered this

to be the most         likely place for          pick— pocket activity,,

With PC Bo eking        1 walked      out   onto the perimeter track surrounding the

g round and      walked       across          thefront of the Spiort Kop,             where the

Netting h a rn F orest supporters           were gathered.           There was s t i 1 1 plenty

of ro arrt in    t iie 8 pi on K o p b u t , neve r t he 1 e s s , t here was a large number

Stand was sparsely occupied,,                 1 went down the player's tunnel arid

through on to the service               road and car parking area at the                    rear of

the South Stand,,          We made our way through a sterile area up to a

light    portable      barrier     which was near         to a pair of metal            concertina

type gates, marked           "C * at the Leppings Lane turnstiles area.

"ITiis turnstile serves the North Stand and the West Stand and terraced

areas behind the goal.              There are three          lots of turnstiles and it

immediately became apparent that the seven turnstiles,                              serving the

terraced area and between the                 concertina type gates marked                  *iB* and

the ones      previously referred to marked                 *C , were      in heavy demand.

A large     crowd was backed up right out on to Leppings Lane and there

was angry pushing and shoving taking                     place.      There were several

police officers         in evidence and in particular two mounted officers

barrier some ED yards                 long and at        chest      height,     the crowd was

c o n ta i n e cl b e hii v1d t i1 i s ba r r ie r .

It was apparent that the turnstiles were not                              coping efficiently with

the crowd, which was swelling by the minute,,

Throughout the next 30 m:i.nutes or so 1 r em ained mostly at that

location but,          on two oc ca s io ns , walked back through the sterile area

to where a serial was employed at another                           barrier at the Nott :i.ngham

Forest turnstiles             into     the South Stand,,           They were having no

difficulty with the               people      in that area          and X spoke to a man i know

as Sergeant Hodgett and told him that                         I     anticipated that, as the

crowd increased at the Leppings Lane turnstiles,                               more    police officers

would be required and I asked him to post an officer from his serial

At Lappings Lane the build-up of crowd increased,                                tempers      became

frayed and evidence               of drunkenness         became more and more               pronounced,,

1 remember at one time,                  Inspector Purdy standing on the barrier with

his back to the turnstiles,                     while    in the manner of a tight--rope

walker,      vainly trying to address the crowd,,                         He was beginning to look

frightened and,            frankly,        I was not surprised.

A young boy of some               10 or 1£ years          climbed to the top of the wall

near to gate          vB ' but apparently what he saw on the other side

deterred him from dropping over and he returned to the crowd on this

side.       I was dismayed to realise that                    in this swelling mass of people

there were such young                 children.         There were many people standi ng

marked      *C * were      opened and closed on a 'number of occasions                              by

opened at the request of police officers outside to admit                                          people with

shout to make himself heard on the radio and I heard a shouted

request from Inspector Purdy for the gates to be opened to relieve

the pressure on the turnstiles.                         Even at that stage               I could

At some stage           it was decided that some                     large wrought        iron gates which

lead out into Leppings Lane should be closed in order to prevent the

now seething mass of people                     in Leppings Lane from continuing                         to apply

During these few brief momenta                     I was frightened for my own safety and

it made me        realise what         conditions must have been like              i n the more

severely packed area behind the barrier                        leading to the turnstiles,,             1

F!C Bo eking was        carrying my radio at this time which was tuned, to the

channel designated to C 1D » number                     19.   Uniformed officers were being

another surge            from the crowd which appeared to be                      a concerted attemp

to unseat this same officer and the horse started dancing about                                  in

f right.      Throughout         I could hear         demands over a loud speaker          system

pleading wit hi the crowd to stop pushi n g , to be patient,,                        X could

recognise the speaker as PC 1035 Ryan.

As it got         nearer to So'clock it became apparent                   to everyone that it

was impossible for this vast crowd,                       whi ch now stretched out      of my

sight in both directions                 of Leppi rigs' Lane,        to gain access to the

The crowd         became more and more unruly avid nasty arid I could hear

officers,         who were       caught    in the    press,   yelling     frantically into

their     personal       radios.

At various times during this                period the mounted        police officers had

been supplemented by a number of others avid 1 would estimate there

being    in the        region of 8 to 10 mounted officers             in that small a r e a .

point that these gates had never been under severe                        pressure as the

crowd had recognised that there was no probability of entering

through that gate,,           The people      in the    immediate vicinity of the gate

began to go through it and it seemed to take the bulk of the crowd 30

seconds or so to realise what had occurred,,

point,     I remarked to PC Bo eking             "That gate should have been opened

ten minutes ago".

Over the newt two or three minutes                  the flow through this gate

increased and           it was apparent to me that the situation at the

turnstiles would soon be eased,,                  It was about this time that I heard

a roar from the           crowd inside the ground and assumed that either the

players were out or that the matel'i had commenced.                       "Ihis surprised me,

having thought that the game was going to be delayed.                          This roar

increased the urgency of the people entering the ground.                           I. turned to

walk back with PC Socking down the service                     road and made my way to

the south east           corner of the ground,         where   I walked onto the

perimeter track of the pitch,               behind the £3pi on Kop goal.

would be contained and I left the                         pitch at the north east                corner,,

I walked back to the gymnasium which was being used as a dining                                           room,

where       1 spoke to Detective               Inspector' 1 owe 11 , and a few minutes                   later

someone          called to me that           play had been stopped and that there were

Uniformed officers were hurrying out of the gymnasium and I returned

to the north east               corner of the          pitch to see what was happening.

The scene was one of confusion at the Leppings Lane end with some

people      climbing from the terraces                    into the seated stand above and

people      continuing          to spill out onto the pi tch through gates                          :i.n the

fencing which were                now open.         It appeared to be an invasion of the

pitch which should be contained by uniform officers                                    b u t , after a

minute or so,             I decided to walk over,,                I had gone only about 4U yards

when I met Detective Sergeant ?H7 Lindley coming the other way and he

called to me " Th ere ’s about 20 dead in there boss".

1 went       immediately to the Police Room under the North Sita?id, from

where     I contacted Detective Chief Superintendent Addis                                  by telephone,,

I would estimate the time to be somewhere                              in the region of 3. 1 pro.                   1

informed Mr. Addis that I believed there were deaths and we discussed

that we would, need to be thinking                        in terms of setting up an incident

Room and activating a Casualty Bureau.

1 have to say that from that time                          1 have no clear recollection of the

sequence of events or of any time scale.                               I returned to the gymnasium

and my return coincided with that of Chief                               Inspector Beal who shouted

One     half    of the       gymnasium          had    been set      up      as a dining area and                there

was a t e mporary            p a rtition down the; centre                    of the gymnasium.             it     was

It was about             this    time     that      I remem b e r e d       that my y o u n g e s t         son was

somewhere          :i.n the     crowd and almost               all    of the      bodies,        the    feet       of

w hich were            protruding       from under            these    tablecloths,            seemed        to have

trainers          on    identical       to his.          I had to          resist     the    urge      to go and

look at each             of the      bodies.

It was      decided         that     I should        return      to Ha miner ton Road,               assist        in

setting      up a Major             Incident Room             there and also arrange                   for     the

friends and             relatives       to be bussed            to H a m m e r t o n Road Police Station.

was- o b v i o u s l y    looking at          the    scene    c a refully and was              speaking        to as

many officers             as   he    possibly        could,      offering        words      of encouragement,,

I believe          shor t l y after       this       I returned wit h Chief                 Superintendent

Addis who         had not        had the       opportunity          to visit       the area of the

disaster and             together we went             from there          into    tire service           road at       the

back     of the S o u t h Stand wire re we d i s c u s s e d the                    prospect        of

against        it.,

After      I had        returned, to the            gymnasium       I    went    to Hammer'ton Road Police

On arrival             home at about          2»30am    1 discovered             that my y o u n g e s t       boy had

    could see a pile               of bodies        against        the wall,         my      recollection           is that

    joined         by another.         1 d o n ’t recall           how    but      1 realise      they were           trying

    to get         the    fence open so that we                could get        the    dead and         injured           out

series      of f r ee - s t a n d i n g          barriers         manned            by u n i f o r m e d Police.

In the       locality          there was             plenty of u n i fo r m e d Police                     presence          both at

the    turnstiles             and     i n    Le p p i n g s Lane         i t s e l f ,     where    the      r e c e p t i o n    o f

Inspector Sykes                of     ’F 2 ’ .

Even at this           early          stage,        a number            of Liv e r p o o l       supporters approached

the ground d r i nking                  beer and soft                 drinks         from    cans w h i c h        in the main

were     d i scarded on the                  floor       or as        they a p p r o a c h e d      the      turnstiles             to

gain entry          to the ground,                  in c o ntainers                 which    I noti c e d h ad been

positioned          by Po l i c e           Officers        directly            outside       the       tur n s t i l e    area..

Certainly,          anything            containing alcohol                      was      either     disposed           of,       drunk

or otherwise,            by fans             before       they e n t e r e d the ground,                     no doubt

anticipating           that         they w o u l d        be searched.

P r o b a b l y around. 1.30                p.m.    the     numbers            of    s u pporters        in the Leppings

                   At 3.23 p.m.          on Saturday,      15 April    1989,    I was on duty at Police

                   Headquarters when I received a telephone                     call from Detective

                   Superintendent McKay to inform me that an incident had. occurred at

                   Hillsborough Football Ground,                Sheffield,      and that fatalities may be

                   involved,         I immediately proceeded to Hammerton Road Police Station,

                   arriving there at 3.35 p.m.                 On entering the control           room area at

                   resume of the situation at the football                     ground.     I informed him I

                   would go to the ground to assess the situation from the point of view

                   of setting up an incident               room.

                   and discussed the events which had taken place.                         At this time Mr

                   Jackson was very busy with other senior officers,

                   1 then spoke with another supervisory officer,                        whose   identity 1

                   cannot remember,           and requested that he arranged for details to be

gymnasium at the ground was being used as a temporary mortuary.                                         I

accompanied him to the temporary mortuary and supervised the

necessary a r r a n g e m e n t s .          I ascertained that             an instruction had       been

that bodies should not be removed from the temporary mortuary until

such time as they had been photographed                         in situ and their          identities

                 enqacied on this duty for the Semi Final of 1966 with a responsibility

                 for the area of Middlewood and Wisewood. My recollection of                                           that        day

                 :i.s that we were directed to three                      public         h o u s e s . These were thePark

As* a result of large scale                   pickpocketing at the previous years match

a team of officers which included myself                              had been delegated the task

of acting as a pickpocket squad whose aim was to arrest any

offenders who          came to light.              As a part of this strategy DC l-lai Iam

was to act as a ’

outweighed the number of supporters and it beacrne increasingly

difficult to maintain any covert status.                               There were virtually no

groups of people             in whi ch DC Hal lam could adopt his intended role at

this stage and we positioned ourselves at different                                      locations    in the

I'tope of identifying             known pickpockets.                It was during this time that

it became       clear that a large number of fans hiad travelled to

Sheffield without tickets as myself and my colleagues were                                       constantly

foeinq approached by fans who were asking                             if we had any tickets to

sell.       1 was approached              by one man who was               in his early twenties who

asked :i.f I         had a ticket to sell on receiving a negative reply he went

and stood nearby.               He struck up a conversation with another

supporter,           a man in his thirties who was obviously                            in the same

then went on to say that                   if they could not get a ticket                     then they

intended going to the turnstile and trying to obtain admission by

saying that they had lost their tickets,,

1 was approached by Inspector Sykes who informed me that two ticket

touts had been seen,                 one at either side of the turnstile area a short

distance from the ground and 1 deputed DC Lawrence and DC L c.o k in g to

go and review the situation in relation to them,,

Coaches       started to arrive anjd they were met by the Police                                   coach

reception as is the                 case at all mat dies.             Supporters were            leaving the

coaches arid go i ng towards the turnstiles »                           1 he re were no real queues

forming at this time and many of the supporters on seeing that there

were no queues seemed to wander around 'the area rather than going

into the ground,,             We were then joined by a number of mounted officers

who were continually patrolling tha area                             in front of the wrought                  iron

gates advising fans to either go into the ground if they Ina cl tickets

or to move away from the area if they h a d n ’t.                              1 remember one of the

officers was a female South Yorkshire                           officer and another was a male

to stand was outside the sweet shop near to the turnstiles.                                           Still

we were joined by DS Smith,                    DC L :i.vidsay and DC Li 1 ley who had been on

a similar operation inside the 'turnstiles.                               It was apparent           that

there had been little or no congestion                            in their area avid they had

come to see if we needed any assistance.

It was decided that                 in view of the fact that there were no crowds at

the turnstiles the fans must be somewhere else                                 in the area and. it

followed that wherever there was a large gathering then that                                          is

where the pick            pockets would be operating.                     With this        in mind myself

and all the other officers on pick pocket duty walked along Leppings

walking along the footpaths on both sides of the road.                                      Again we

were    constantly asked if we had any tickets to sell and by this time

the majority of fans were drinking beer from cans..                                  We went as far

after about        13 minutes we made our way back to the turnstile area

of Leppings L a n e .          On arrival        the re it could be seen that                  crowds

DC Hallam again went and stood near to the sweet shop and I was

speaking wi th D . 1 . Towel I as to the activities of the day,.                                   Ihe

mounted officers were still                   patrolling        the area outside the

turnstiles..        We made them aware of our duties and it was agreed

that to some         extent we would be left alone near to the sweet                                shop,,

I was standi ng with D .I . Towel I when we were told that all                                  crowds

would have to be moved because of the arrival of the Especial

train,.      1 would estimate that the time would be around H „Oprn.

I saw the escorted fans arrive at the ground and. this naturally

started to swell             the numbers actually queuing at the turnst i l e s .

The queues were             now reaching the wrought               iron gates but things

seemed quite         orderly.,        I cannot say whether or not uni formed                        officers

were    present      amongst       the queues as my attention was taken up                          in the

main bv watching DC Hal lam as the                      likely hood of pi c k po c:ke t s operating

was increased bv the volume of the crowd.                             At one stage however                  I did

rejoin it at the back,,               The volume of the crowd outside the

this time        I was standing         on the raised area near' to the edge of the

I located DC Hal lam and returned to the raised area,,                               I couldn't see

either the        men or DC Lilley and was joined by him a short time

later.      He    informed me that the men had walked                      off along     Leppings

Lane towards Penistone Road.                    By this time all            the officers        in the

squad were together and we decided that DC Lilley                                 together with one

group should remain in the turnstile area whilst m y s e l f , DC Askew, DC

Locking and I. believe DC Lawrence would walk along Leppings Lane to

We walked as far as Law Bros.                   Garage with no gain..              On walking along

Leppings Lane we were met by a flood of supporters                                stretching the

full width of Leppings               lane both on the roadway and on the

been drinking although                        I    would not described their' condition as

was forced to drive on the wrong side of 'the road and had the

headlights on and was sounding the horn c o nt i.nuou s .1.y .                             As we neared

Leppings Lane              Turnstiles              I could see that the      crowd had swelled

enormously compared to when                           we had left some      1!:>minutes    earl i e r .        We

returned to the raised area                           near to the roadway from where            I could

see that serious                 problems were arising              the crowd was much          .Larger and

more tightly packed.                       PC Buxton via the P.A.          system repeatedly asked

t he supporters to ease back                          from the turnstiles ex plaining that

people were being squashed at the front.                                These requests met w:i.th              no

response at all and people were                            continuing to walk       into the

overcrowded area.                    My immediate          reaction was that we as a body had

lost control             of the crowd.                1 could see mounted officers            in the crowd

but these were unable to                           have any real effect as they seemed to                 be

then called for mounted officers to form a line,                                 presumably to hold

the crowd back.                  I saw our mounted officers               in the crowd although 1

could only identify Inspector Hand Davis of South Yorkshire.                                           This

was    no doubt because my attention was focused on this officer' who

was having extreme difficulty in moving his horse                                   in the    crowd.       At

one point       I thought that he was going to be unseated.                              1 also       recall

seeing a uniformed officer attempting to close one of the wrought

iron gates,,

I looked back down Leppings Lane and could see no end to the body of

supporters that were approaching the ground.                              As the fans          reached the

crowd outside the turnstiles they did not appear to be particularly

pushing at the back but .just continued walking                             into the enclosed

area.      My own thought at the time was that one way to ease the

situation would have been to place some form of cordons across

Leppings Lane to reduce the flow of supporters arriving at the

turnstiles,,         1 then thought of the numbers that would be required to

do this arid the speed with which it would have to be done and quickly

realised that         it was      not a viable solution.

The situation was now becoming                    critical and I could, well                  imagine that

at least serious           injury and at the worst a death would                         result from

the crush that was forming outside the turnstiles,,                                   I then saw that

a number of supporters               had started to climb up the outside of the

turnstiles and onto the                roof of the building.                At first         1 thought

that this was to gain entry to the                       club but it then became apparent

that    it was to escape the crush at the f r o n t .                       1 saw one youth get

onto the roof who was so near to collapse that he almost fell                                         back

into the crowd,,           1 watched the youth until                  he recovered and having

done so I saw him throw his ticket back down into the                                   crowd,    a

through the crowd and it was also obvious that the area we were to

patrol would be far too busy to allow any pickpockets                                       to drop the

property,          I therefore decided that                   close to 3.. Oprri we would go round,

the outside of the ground,                     enter through           the police ent ranee and take

a short meal          by which time things                inside       the turnstiles would have

Just before we left Leppings Lane,                          I should estimate the time at

about S,, 35 pm a loud cheer                 came from within the ground,                     I assumed that

this was the teams                  corning out onto the field.                 Th i % cheer liad the

as they realised that the Kick Off was not to be delayed..                                           iogether

with other officers                 in my squad at 3.0pm               I walked along Vere Road, and

whilst qo:i. nq along that                road 1 hiear’d anothe r             loud, cheer from          inside

the ground.         I thought at the time that a cheer                          like that would have

made t hi rigs even worse outside the tur nsti l e s .                            Infact a small           number

of fans who were walking along Vere Road towards the turnstiles

started to run on hearing                    it.

We readied the gymnasium and started to take our meal when Ch.,

Inspector Beal               came    i n arid ordered that the area be cleared to be

used as a mortuary,.                 No sooner had he said that than a continuous

st reani of bodies began to arrive,,                        7 hey were being           carried by Police

officers and fans.                  Some were on stretcher and some were on the

advertising boards.                   Most of the bodies were a grey/blue                        in colour

although       there were            no real    signs of injuries to them.                     Any persons

•who were not obviously dead were transf erred to anothe r section of

the Gymnasium where they received medical                               attention.

         A number of doctors attended in the gymnasium and certified life

         extinct.        As bodies ware brought    into the Gymnasium it soon became

         clear that difficulties may arise          if officer’s who had brought         bodies

         to the Gymnasium returned to the scene of the problem,,                1 therefore

         attemtped to ensure an officer stayed with each body that was brought

         in „

         My duties from that       point were   concerned with the identification,

                     I am a Detective Sergeant             currently stationed at Hammerton Road

                     Police Station, Sheffield.

                     My past experience          of duties at Sheffield Wednesday Faot.ba.lI Club has

                     been limitedin recent times to outside Transit van patrols;.                                I was

                     engaged on this duty for the Semi Final                       of 1988 with a responsibility

                     f or t h e a r ea o f M l d dle wa od a n d W is ew o o d .    My r e c o 11 e c t i on o f t h a t da y

                     is that we were d i r e c t e d to three          public h o u s e s .     These we re the Park

                     Hotel where there had been a disturbance,                      The Horse and Jockey where

                     f lases had been broken and the Weds ley Jack where                        information had

                     been received that Notts Forest supporters were expected to visit.

                     None of the calls         resulted in police action.                 Nothing     I saw on that

                     day gave any cause for           concern and the movement               of fans towards the

                     g ro un d appeared timely and well             ordered and was          nothing     like the

                     scenes I experienced on the 15 April                  1989 which I will           describe       in

                     detail at a late-r stacse.

                     At 9.0am Saturday         13 April     1989 I reported for duty at H a m m e r ton Road

                     Police Station C.I.D.           office avid a t t e n d e d a briefing at the ground at

                     operation was given by Ch. S u p t . D uc ke n f i e i d .            DS C harlesworth gave a

                     briefing as to the          intelligence aspect and we then divided into

sections, to toe briefed by individual                  commanders.

As a result        of    large scale pickpocketing at the previous years match

a team of officers which included myself had been delegated the task

of acting as a pickpocket                squad whose aim was to arrest any

offenders who came to light.                 As a part of this strategy DC Hal lam

w as to act as a            ’t a r g e t ’ for offenders   ou ts id e    the turnstiles at the

L ep p in g s Lane area of the ground,,              1 was    to supervise a number               of

officers who rk i ng with DC Hal lam in this area.                        F ol lowing the brief .tn>;

At 11.30am that day together with DC Locking,                           DC Lawrence,       DC Hal lair.

I went to the area outside the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of

the ground.         At      this time the crowd was very sparse and 1 recall

seeing a number             of police officers      :i.n this a r e a .    Officers which              come

to mind are        Inspector Purdy         (Training)      and Inspector Sykes             (FE)

together with a number of serveants and PC “s.                           At this time and for

the following half hour                the number of uniformed police officers

outweighed the number of supporters and it beacme                           increasingly

dif fi c u11 to maintain any covert s t a t u s .              There were v i rt ua 11y no

groups of people             in which DC H a 1Xam could adopt his intended role at

this stage and we positioned ourselves at different                            locations       in the

hope    of i d e n t ifying known pickpockets.               It was during this time that

it became clear             that a large number of fans had travelled to

S3h ef f iel d w it h out ticket s a s m y s elf and m y co 11 ea g u e s w ere c o n s ta n 11 y

being a p p r o a c h e d    by fans    who were    asking    if we had any tickets               to

sell.      I was approached by one man who was                  in his early          twenties who

asked if I        had a ticket to sell on receiving a negative                        reply he went

and stood nearby.              He struck up a conversation with another

supporter,        a man in his thirties who was obviously in the same

position.         They spoke about the             likelyhood of obtaining a ticket and
                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                       R 176

then went on to say that if they could not get a ticket then they

intended going to the turnstile arid trying to obtain admission by

saying that they had lost their tickets.

I was approached by Inspector Sykes who                        informed me that two ticket

touts had been seen,             one at either side of the turnstile area a snort,

distance      from the ground and I deputed DC Lawrence and DC Lcoking to

go and review the situation in relation to them.

Coaches started to arrive anjd they were met by the Police                                      coach

reception as is the case at all matches.                          Supporters were          leaving the

coaches and going towards the turnstiles.                          There were no real              queues

into the ground.            We were then joined by a number                   of mounted officers

who were      continually patrolling tha area i n front of the wrought iron

gates advising fans to either go                    into the ground if they had tickets

or to move away from the                 area if they hadn ’t .          I r eruembe r one of the

officers was a female South Yorkshire officer and another was a male

Merseyside officer.              The     actions of these officers somewhat                     thwarted

our   operation and it was               decided that the best place for DC l-ia1 1am

to stand was outside the sweet shop near to the turnstiles.,                                      Still

there appeared to             be little congestion around the turnstile area and

we were joined by             DS Smith? DC Lindsay and DC Lilley who had been on

a similar operation inside the turnstiles.                           It was apparent             that

there had been little or no congestion in their area and                                  they had

c orrte *■o s e o x T w en e e d d a n y a s %i s Ca ?tc e „

It was decided that            i n view of the fact that there were no crowds                              at

the turnstiles the fans must be somewhere else                            in the area and it

followed that wherever there was a large gathering then that                                      is

where? the pick pockets would be operating.                          With this in mind myself

and all the other officers on pick pocket duty walked along Leppings
                                                                                   P AGE
                                                                                   R "17 8

Lane towards Penistone Road,             The time would be approximately        1.30pm

and at this time there was a steady by light stream of people

walking along the footpaths on both sides of the road.                 Again we

were    constantly asked if we had any tickets           to sell and by this t ime

the majority of fans we re drinking beer from cans,.              We went as far

as Si ckerton Road where we found a congregation of people outside

the Fish and Chip shop.         This seemed a likely location and DC

Hal lam went amongst     the    crowd.     This met with a negative        result and

after about    15 minutes we made our way back to the turnstile area

of Le ppi ngs Lane.    On arrival        there   it, could foe seen that    crowds

were starting to build up but the queues for the turnstiles were

still    not reaching the wrought         iron gates.

DC Hal lam again went and stood near to the sweet shop and                 I was

speaking with D . I . Towel I as to the activities of the day.               The

mounted officers were still         patrolling the area outside the

turnstiles.     We made them aware of our duties and it was agreed

that to some extent we would be left alone near to the sweet shop.

1 was standing with D.l« Towe 11 when we were told that all                  crowds

would have to be moved because of the arrival              of the Special

train.     I would, estimate that the time would be around g.Opm.

I saw the escorted farm arrive at the ground and this                naturally

started to swell      the numbers actually queuing at the turnstiles.

The queues were now reaching the wrought              iron gates but things

seemed quite orderly.          I cannot say whether or not uniformed officers

were present amongst the queues as my attention was               taken up in the

main by watching DC Hal lam as the likelyhood of pickpockets operating

was    increased by the volume of the crowd.            At one stage however         1 did

go to the opposite side of the road to the turnstiles and saw

officers meeting the SY Transport buses              carrying Liverpool* fans.

At    approximately 2.10pm I saw two youths who I h a d seen earlier
hanging around groups of people and who given DC Hal. lam some

attention approach the queues at the turnstiles.                              I would describe

the m e n as f o i l ow s:

1.    Asian ha 1 f caste a pp e a r a n c e » 25 to 3 0 y r s , dark hair                r e c e e d m g at

      t h e t em p 1 © s , t h i n i n g o n t h e ba c k o f h :i.s h e a d , w e a r i n g a

      distinctive        sheepskin coat and a br ight blue j u m p e r .                    Ho was

      wearing sunglasses with blue topped frames.

2.    Not so distinctive,            white male 20 to 25 yrs fresh f a c e d , wearing

      a black     leather jacket,,

1 kept the men under observation and                       saw them continually join queues

walk almost to the turnstiles and then walk out of the queue to

rejoin it at the back.              The volume of the crowd outside the

turnstiles was such that they had no difficulty                           in walking        from the

front of the queue back to rejoin the queue.                           I located DC Lilley and

Pointed o u t t he two me n and i ns t ruct ed h im t o k ee p t bem under

observation whilst           I went to locate DC Hal lam                and tell him of their'

activities     in the hope that we could                   position him near to           them.       At,

this time 1 was standing on the raised area near to the edge of the

roadway and had no difficulty in keeping                       the men under observations.

1 located DC Hal lam and returned to the raised area.                               I couldn't see

either the men or DC Lilley and was joined by him a short time

later.    He   informed me that the men had walked off along Leppings

Lane towards Penistone Road.                 By this time all the officers                       in the

squad were together and we decided that DC Lilley together with one

group should remain           in the turnstile area whilst myself,                       DC Askew, DC

Locking and I believe DC Lawrence would walk along Leppings Lane to

see if we could locate the men.

We walked as far as Law Bros.                Garage with no gain.                On walking along

Leppings Lane we were met by a flood of supporters stretching the

full width of Leppings             lane both on the roadway and on the
footpaths-         Some were still asking for tickets and many had obvious.!

been drinking although I would not described their condition as

drunk.      We were       confronted by fans            in such numbers along the full

Having     reached, the garage with no gain we turned and walked back

along Leppings Lane towards                   the g r o u d .   As we were doing so I saw PC

Buxton     (FI PC 1863)        driving a Land Rover              in the same direction.        He

was forced to drive on the wrong side of the road and had the

headlights       on and was sounding the horn continuously.                        As we neared

Leppings Lane Turnstiles                   1 could see that the crowd had swelled

enormously compared to when we had left some                          15 minutes    earlier.        We

returned to the raised area near to the roadway from where                             I could

see that serious           problems were arising the crowd was much                   larger and

more tightly packed.               PC Buxton via the P.A.            system repeatedly asked

the supporters          to ease back from the turnstiles explaining that

people were being squashed at the front.                          These requests met with no

response at, all and people we re continuing to walk                        into the

overcrowded area.             My immediate reaction was that we as a body had

last    control of the crowd.,                1 could see mounted officers           in the crow

but these were unable to have any real effect as they seemed to be

marooned individually in the crowd.                        I was standing by the side of

the Land Rover and from my position could not see PC Buxton.                              It was

obvious however that another officer had taken hold of the

microphone and was trying to placate the crowd by telling them that

attempts would be made to open further                          turnstiles and to postpone

the kick off.           Again this was met with no response.                  The officer

then called for mounted officers                     to form a line,      presumably to hold

the crowd back.            1 saw our mounted officers                in the crowd although 1

could only identify Inspector Hand Davis of South Yorkshire.                              This

was no doubt because my attention was focused on this officer who

                                                                                                    R178

was having extreme difficulty in moving                         his horse        in thecrowd.         At

0 n t-: p o i n t I t h o u g h t t ha t h e w a s g o in g t o fae u n a e a t e d .   I a 1 s o r e ca 11

seeing a uniformed officer attempting                       to close one of the wrought

1 ran g a t e a ,

I. looked back down Leppings Lane and could see no end to the body of

supporters       that were approaching              the ground.          As the fans reached the

crowd outside the turnstiles                  they did not appear             to be part iculariy

pushing at the back but just                  continued walking            into the enclosed

area.      My own thought at the time was                   that one way to ease the

situation would have been to place some                         form of cordons across

Leppings Lane to reduce the flow of supporters art- iving at                                 the

turnstiles,,        I then thought of the numbers                   that would be requx red to

do this and the speed with which it would have to                                foedone and        quickly

realised that it was             not a viable solution.

"fhe situation was now becoming critical and I could well                                 imagine that

at least serious           injury and at the worst a death would result from

the crush that was forming outside the t u rn st i le s.                           I then saw that

a number of supporters had started to climb up the outside of the

turnstiles and onto the roof of the building.                              At first      I thought

that this was to gain entry to the* club but it then became apparent

that    it was to escape the crush at the front.                           I saw one youth           g& t
onto the roof who was so near to collapse that he almost fell                                       back

into the crowd.            I watched the youth until he recovered and having

done so 1 saw him throw his ticket back down into the crowd,                                    a

method of gaining entry* which x l^ave in the past seen used                                 Co gain

access from the Leppings Lane Terrace                       into the West Stand.               As    I
watched I saw a number of fans doing the same with their tickets

once they had reached the roof of the turnstiles.

As we were dressed in casual                  civillian clothing             I accepted that for

us to try arid assist            in any form of crowd control would only have

made matters worse.                     Our      brief at Kick          Off time was             to move        through

the t urnstiles               into the a r e a of the                toilets       behind the L e p p i n g s          Lane

Terrace       to    check       for     pickpockets            d r o pping     the    remains       of    their

plunder       in this area.                  It was      quite       clear     that we       could not          pass

t h r o u g h the       crowd and          it was also          obvious        that     the area we were               to

patrol       w ould be far            too       bu.sv to a l l o w any         pickpockets          to    drop       the

property,           I t h erefore            decided that            close     to 3 . 0 pm we w o u l d         go    round

the outside             of the ground,              enter      thro u g h    the     police      entrance         and take

a short meal             by w h i c h      time     things      inside       the     turn s t i l e s    w o u l d have

q u i e t e n e d clo w n .

Just     before we            left L e p p i n g s Lane,         I should estim a t e             the     time at

about 2 . 5 5 pm a loud               cheer       came    from w i t h i n      the ground,             I assumed          that

this was          the    teams       coming       out    onto    the field.             This     cheer      had      the

effect       of    causing        some       surging      in the       crowd outside             the     turns'll les

as    they realised             that       the Kick Off was             not     to be delayed.                 Together

with other          o f f icers       in my squad at 3 .Qpro I wa l k e d along                          Vere Roa d and

wh i l s t   going along             that       road    I heard a n o t h e r        loud cheer          from     inside

the    ground.          I thought          at    the    time    that a cheer            like that w o u l d have

made     things         even worse           outside      the t urnstiles.                Infact a small              number

of fans who were w a l k i n g                  along Vere R oad             towards       the    turnstiles

s ta r t e d t o r u n o n h e a r i n g i t .

We    reached the           g y m n a s i u m and s t a r t e d to          take our meal          w h e n Ch..

Inspector Beal                came    in and orde r e d that                the area be          clea r e d to be

used as a mortuary.                     No      sooner    had he said           that      than a c o ntinuous

st r e a m of bodies            b e g a n to a r r i v e .       They were           being     carried         by Police

officers and fans.                    Some were          on s t r e t c h e r and some were               on the

advertising             boards.         Most      of the       bodies       were a g r e y / b l u e      in colour

a l t h o u g h there were            no     real      signs    of    injuries        to them.           Any    persons

who were          not    obviously           dead were         transferred           to anot h e r       s e c t i o n of

the G y m n a s i u m where           they       received medical             attention.

          A    number     of      doctors    attended           in    the       gymnasium         and    certified        life

          extinct.           As    bodies    were        brought          into       the    Gymnasium       it    soon    became


          clear       that     difficulties         may        arise       if       officers      who    had     brought      bodies


          to    the     Gymnasium      returned           to    the       scene       of    the    problem.        I    therefore


          at   tem tped      to    ensure    an    officer           stayed          with    each    body      that     was   br   ough

           i n .

          My    duties       from    that    p o x Jit   were        concerned             with    the   identification,

          labelling          and    disposal       of    bodies           to    the    medico       legal      centre.

                  In April       1988,       as D e t e c t i v e S u p e r i n t e n d e n t at     "F*    Division,,         I

                  a t t ended a football                m a t c h being         played, at   the home         ground, of Sheffield

                  W e d n e s d a y Football           Club,     Hi 1 1 sborough.          The game was a C u p Semi- F i n a l

                  and was      p .1a y e d b e t w e e n L,i v e r po o 1 FC a n d N ott ing ham F or es t FC .                      Ther e

                  was a. capacity            crowd and a d m i s s i o n was              by ticket        only.

                  My   remit    on that          day was         to organise         and     supervise        all    e l e m e n t s of

                  crime      p revention and             crime       detection.

                  At about E .40pm that                  day     I found my s e l f        outside      the    gr o u n d     in the

                  Le p pings    Lane        tur n s t i l e area.          The     crowd using        those      turnstiles              were

                  m o s t l y good natu r e d           but,     about     H.SOprr., there was a build                   up    in the

                  r>urnbe   r s of   people* us i ng the               turns t i l e s    and a s iseabl w nusue

                  developed.           There was             incr e a s i n g    evidence     of d r u n k e n n e s s   amongst           the

                  supp o r t e r s who were all Liv e r p o o l                   fans.      There was a good deal                    of

                  pushing and shoving and                       police o f f icers         on horses were            necessary             to

                  control      the     crowd.           An    ideal     opportunity          for    pick-pocket          activity.

                  It took      this     b u i l d - u p of supp o r t e r s         several        minutes     to    clear         thro u g h
T,h e turn s tiles           but w i t h a u t p r o b 1 e n't.

O n Fr i d a y     14 April          1989    I took         part    ina     * phone       in pro g r a m m e w ith

Radio M e r s e y s i d e , w h e n         I spoke wit h           the    presenter            of   that    p r ogramme

in relation to the S e m i Final                        to take        place        on the       fol l o w i n g    day and

A young boy of some                      10       or     12    years     climbed to the top of                                 the wall

near      to gate         *B *     but a p p a r e n t l y what              he    saw on the                   other          side

d e t e r r e d him from dropping                            over and he          returned to the                        crowd on this

side.          I was      d i s m a y e d to           realise        that     in this s w e l l i n g mass                            of     peopl

friends?          whether             they          were          waiting           for       the          rush          to    die          down       or


whether,          in       fact,          they          were       opportunists                    without                tickets.                    The       gates

marked       *C * w e r e            opened             and       closed          on     a    number                of    occasions                   by

stewards          on       the       other          side,          either           to       allow          officials                      and       police


officers          to       enter          or       leave          the       ground,           or       to       admit          people                who    were          in


distress.              I    remember                on       at    least          three           occasions                   these             gates       were


opened       at    the       request                of       police          officers              outside                to       admit             people          with


injuries.              One       of       these             was    a     child         who        was       carried                bodily             in    and          who


had    been       removed             from          the          crush       at     the       t u r n st i 1 e s .


At    some       stage,          1    would             guess          at    about           2.40pm,                I    saw       Superintendent


Marshals          directing                police                operations              m        this          crush.                 He       was    having             to

shout       to    make       himself                heard          on       the     radio          and          1       heard          a    shouted

request          from       Inspector                   Purdy          for     the       gates             to       be    opened                to    relieve

the    pressure             on       the       turnstiles.                     Even          at    that             stage          I       could

understand             the       reason             for          this       request.               I       did          not    see          Superintendent


Marshall          again.              I    was          later          to    learn,           in       fact,             that          he       remained


there       continuing                to       direct             operations                 in    the          area          of       the          Leppings


Lane     turnstiles                  but       such          was       the     thronging                   mass          of    people                that       I    did

not    see       him       even       though                he    must       have        been          a    matter             of          yards       from          me.


Not    long       afterwards                   1    spoke          to       Inspector              Purdy                and    said             I    thought             the


gates       should          be       opened.

At    some       stage       it       was          decided             that       some        large             wrought                iron          gates          which


lead     out      into       Leppings                   Lane       should           be       closed             in       order             to       prevent          the

now    seething             mass          of       people          sti      Leppings              Lane          from          continuing                   to       apply

pressure          to       the       queue          to       the       turnstiles.                     This             was    done             successfully

but    it    seemed          to       be       only          minutes           before             the       gates             were          forced          open

again       and    the       pressure                   resumed.               At      one        stage,                still          pre-occupied

with     the      pi c k - p o c k e t s ,              I    moved          nearer           to    these                blue       gates             but

struggle         to get        back    into a        relatively         clear     space     near      to the    light

portable         barriers.

During         these    few brief moments                 I was       f r i g h t e n e d for my own sa f e t y and.

it made me          realise what             conditions must              have    been    like     in the more

severely         packed are a          behind the           barrier       leading to the t urnsliles,                      1

was    getting         quite        c o n cerned and        remember       remarking        to PC Bo eking           that

they were          going       to have       to open the gates.

PC Bo eking was               carrying my          radio     at this       time w h i c h was         tuned    to    the

channel         designated           to CID.       number       19.     Uniformed        officers       were    being

d i r ec ted from         control          on channel        25.

pleading wit h the                  crowd to       stop     pushing,       to be       patient.        i. could

recognise         the     speaker          as PC     1035 Ryan.

As    i t got nearer            to 3 o v c 1 o ck       it be cam e a pparent           to e ve r y o n e that       it

was    impossible             for    this vast          crowd,     which     now s t r e t c h e d out       of my

sight        in both d i r e c t i o n s      of L e p p i n g s Lane,          to gain ac c e s s      to the

1 he crowd became more and more                           unruly and         nasty and       I could hear

officers,         who were           caught       in the     press,       yell i n g    frantically          into

their        personal         radids.

I    began to have grave                   fears     that    the s i t u a t i o n     could only       end    in

disaster.           The       crowd w e r e       b e ginning      to swarm over          the walls          into    the

Over       the       next        two       or       three          minutes             the      flow          through             this       gate

increased                and     it    was          apparent             to       me    that         the          situation             at    the


turnstiles                 would       soon             be    eased.              It    was      about             this        time       that         I    heard

a    roar       from        the       crowd             inside          the       ground         and          assumed             that       either           the

players             were        out    or          that       the       match          had      commenced.                     This       surprised                me,


having          thought              that          the       game       was       going         to       be       delayed.              This       roar-

increased                the     urgency                of the people                   entering                  the ground.                 1    turned                to


walk       back          with        PC Bo         eking        down the               service            road          and       made       my    way        to


the     south            east        corner             of the          ground,            where          I       walked          onto       the

perimeter                track        of       the       pitch,          behind            the       Spion             Kop     goal.


The     game         was        in    progress                and       as    I    looked            up       towards             the     Leppings               Lane
end      I could see           the    crowd spilling               out f rom the terraces                    onto     the

pitch,          I could not           u n d e r s t a n d this         but,    as there were             large       numbers

of un i f o r m e d officers making                      their way along                 the    perimeter       path    in

front      of the N o r t h S t a n d             towards        that area,             I a s s u m e d that    the matter

would      be      co n t a i n e d and      1    left     the    pitch at             the north east          corner.

I wal ked back            to    the       g y m n a s i u m w h i c h was      being used as a dining                   room,

where       I spoke        to D e t e c t i v e       Inspector         Towel 1, and a few minu t e s                  later

someone         called      to me         that      play had been stopped and                         that   there were

U n i f o r m e d o f f icers were               hurrying        out    of the g y m n a s i u m and           I returned

to the       north east          corner of the               pitch to see what was                      happening,

ihe scene was             one    of       confusion at the L e p p i n g s Lane                       end w ith some

people       climbing          from the           terraces        into       the       seated    stand above          and

people       continuing          to spill            out    onto       the    pitch t h r o u g h gates          in the

pitch which sh o u l d be                  c o n tained      by u n i f o r m officers                but,   a fter a

called to me             " T h e r e ’s about 20 dead                  in there          boss".

I went       i m m e d iately        to the Police R o o m under                        the N o r t h Stand,         from

One    half        of the      g y m n a s i u m had    been set     up      as a dining are a and there

was a tem p o r a r y          p a rtition       down the centre             of the gymnasium-               It     was

this area that was                   cleared and there was a rush by police                               o f f icers        to

put tables           to one        side.       X believe        that D e t e c t i v e       Inspect tor Towel 1

was    in the        g y m n a s i u m at that         time and      I am certain             that    I was       the

s e n io r o f f i c e r p r e a e t1 1 .

People      started a r r i v i n g          into the g y m n a s i u m      carrying          victims.           The

first     victim to arrive was a young man and                               I believe          he was       carried

in .by two          police        officers      an d a civilian.             He was          taken    to the wall

opposite        the    door and           laid down-          Other     people were            now flooding             into

the g y m n a s i u m c arrying             victims.         The   first ma n was a p p a r e n t l y             dead

and    I touched            one    of the officers,             i n t r o d u c e d mvself,       and     explained

to hi in that         that        body was       his    r e s p o n s i b i l i t y and that     under     no

c ircu m s t a n c e s was        he to      leave      that body.           He was to ensure             that      no

one else           had any        dealings      wit h the       property or         clothing         or

identification               of    that     body.      These were         instructions            that     I was        to

Brought       in w ith         the    dead were        the? injured and           these were            d i r e c t e d to

the    far end of the                g y m n a s i u m at   the other      side     of the        partition.             The

dead were a r r i v i n g            in such numbers            that    it was      impossible            to try        to

e s t a b l i s h whether,           in fact,       they were        dead,    but      I have        to say that

every     body that            1 saw bore what              I recognise       to be          classic      signs of

a s p h y x i a and     1    am    satisfied        that e very        body that         1    saw and d i r e c t e d

Although           I saw most         of the      bodies       1 have     to say that            I did     not see

them all.            Indeed        they were a r r i v i n g       in such numbers an d w i t h such

f r e q u e n c y that on m a n y o c c a s i o n s          it was     impos s i b l e       to give

Of the       people a r r i v i n g        in the g y m n a s i u m man y were            s t a nding around,

remaining          there.        Police       officers were            going     back     out     to fetch more

casualties          and    the    scene was one            of general          c o nfusion wit h           bodies

being       put down h a p h a z a r d 1y .

At some stage             I saw D e t e c t i v e    Inspector Charles,                 apparently              having

come    into       the    gym w ith a body,           about, to          leave    the     gymnasium.             Mr.

Charles       had a t t e n d e d     the m a t c h on duty            in full      police       uniform.              I

shouted to Mr.             Charles         arid whe n he     came to me           I told him that                 this

gat h e r i n g    police     o f f icers     to him and giving                them     instructions              and       I

noted that          he gave       priority to the g y m n a s i u m floor.                      It was

impossible          to    count      the    bodies as they arrive,                  but w h e n        there were

about SO          I remember         t h i nking    that    there        could not        be m a n y mor e         dead.

As    the    bodies were          laid      nearer and       nearer         to the g y m n a s i u m door

someone,          I believe       it was Det e c t i v e         Sergeant        McSloy,        said to me             "If

I     find        xt       very             d iffic u lt             to      recall             the        events                 in     the    gymnasium.                    My

overall             perception                      is       one        of    dead          bodies               a rriv in g              and       being          carried

by s h o c k e d              and           perspiring                  police          o ffic e rs ;                   by        distressed               people            who

were            obviously                   friends              and       relatives                  and        by         drunken            people,             some       of

whom            were      shouting                       and        wanting            to        fig h t.                   In ju re d people               were

arrivin g                and       being                 directed                to    the           far        end          of        the h a ll     and          the       scene

was         one     of        increasing                     confusion.

Some            degree            of        regulation                  began          to       take           place a s                 I n spector C h a r l e s

and         his     team           regulated                     the       people           in t h e             gym          and        ejected           t h e    unruly

ones.             it      would              have        been           fo lly         to       try        and          separate               the     grieving

relatives                 and          friends               from          the        bodies              and.      many,              m any    people             were       le ft

standing                 around              in    the           gymnasium              h elplessly,                          in       a ll    stages          of      distress

At      some        stage              I.    recall              having          seen           a     police                o ffic e r         sat     on      a    chai r         fay

the         telephone                  in        the     Police              Room.              He        had       a       big        tear     in     his

trousers.                     He       was        weeping               openly.                 He        was       quite              obviously             shocked.               I

had         a    f ew     wo r d.s           w i th      him         whi ch s e e m e d                   to     me to             be     t o t a 11 y       i n a de qu a t e

At      a       very      early              stage           I     had       deputed                s ome o n e             to a r r a n g e         for       the major-

I had also a s k e d for the Coro n e r                     to    be    informed                which        seemed at, the

time     to be art a b s o l u t e l y        i ncongruous             request.

At    some     stage,           I think after          half an hour,                  I needed to make                 contact

wit h    the       control      box    inside       the g r o u n d to           inform them of the

sit u a t i o n      in the     g y m n a s i u m and as        I was       unable        to contact              them b y

telephone           and     I knew     that any        radio m e s s a g e            passed w o u l d        .be relayed

over every o f f i c e r ’s radio                  in the ground,                1    went     on foot,            1    am    now

informed by D e t e c t i v e             inspector      Towel 1 that                 he a c c o m p a n i e d m e , but my

remember           him doing        sor      although       1   have no reason                 to doubt that             he         did.

At the Police Control                   Sox       I spoke       to fir, Addis and,                whi l s t        I cannot

remember what               I said to him.          I must       have       told        him the     situation                in

the gymnasium.                  I do remember         s p e aking      to the           ACC Op e r a t i o n s ,         Mr.

Jackson,           and m e n t i o n i n g   that amon g s t       other             problems we w o u l d              have

were     the       press, who were           present     in numbers.                    Hr. Addis           asked        me     to

take     i"tiif*, back      to the qymnas iurn and as we                    left        the are a of          the        Pol ice

Box     I remember              hearing       the Liv e r p o o l Manager, K enny Dalglish,

addressing            the       crowd and a ripple               of a p p l a u s e went round the ground.

Other      than that            1 have       no   idea o f      what time             it was.

On my      return to            the g y m n a s i u m with Hr. Addis                   1 saw senior a m b u l a n c e

officials,            in parti c u l a r Ala n H o p k i n s who                 I introduced               to Mr.       Addis

an d we d i s c u s s e d       the    eventual        removal         of    bodies          from the         gymnasium

and who w o u l d be            responsible.

Hr.     Addis       then took         charge       in the g y m n a s i u m and after                   a    few minutes

of ass e s s i n g        the   s i t u a t i o n he stood on a chair,                       called         for    order          in

the hall,           and told        police        officers       what       he       intended to            do.        The

gy m n a s i u m    floor was         littered w i t h          rows    of bodies and               I remember

someon e       telling me w h e n            1 a sked how man y              "Seventy odd a n d mor e at                            the

Most    of the        bodies      by this       time    had been draped wit h what                    appeared       t

be whi te shr auds and                I re m errtbe r w onde r i ng whe r e on ear th they had

now piled up at              the side of the            gymnasium.

It was about            this    time     that     X remembered          that my y o u n g e s t       son was

somewhere          in the      crowd and almost all                 of the     bodies,      the      feet    of

w h i c h were       p r otruding      from under           these     tablecloths,         seemed      to have

It, was    decided         that     I should       return        to H a m m e r t o n Road,    assist        in

On arrival          at H a m m e r t o n Road      I f ound the         place     under    virtual          siege.

Liverpool          s u p p o r t e r s were w a n t i n g     to make      urgent   enquiries,          many war

standing a r o u n d         not knowing what               to do and someone          had     put     out a cai

for all      off-duty          social     workers       to     report      to H a m m e r t o n Ro a d and ther

were m a n y       social      workers.         My first         r e a ction was     one of       di s m a y at th

thought      of so m any          social       work e r s     being   directed      to this area             but,    i

a very short            time,     it became a p p a r e n t         that    they were       to be      invaluabl

and    provided a buffer               between d i s t r e s s e d      relatives      and     fans,        who had

lost    contact wit h           relatives         and friends          in the     crowd,      an d    the    police

1   called together             the    Incident R o o m staff,              who   had a r r i v e d at       the

S t a t i o n to set up the            Incident        room,      and brie f e d them as             to what       had

o c c u r r e d at the gr o u n d and the              s i t u a t i o n there.      I should say here

that    I was       aware      that a r r a n g e m e n t s    had been mad e        for    the C a s u a l t y

Bureau     to be activ a t e d .            1 was      shortly        to be    i n f ormed howe v e r        that

all    numbers        to the C a s u a l t y B u r e a u           had already          gone       out    over     the

radio,       jamming        all     of the      lines,        and as a result               there was           to be no

police       contact        by telephone w i t h              the B u r e a u     for man y hours.

Having       told the        Incident        R oom staff what               had o c c u r r e d the y went about

the business           of netting           up the       Incident Room at H a m m e r t o n Road.

I tried to make              a t e l ephone        call       to my     home      but     could not           get an

outside       line.         1 later went           to an a d j a c e n t        building w h e r e            I knew

there was a direct                 outside       line.,        1    telephoned          home a n d e s t a b l i s h e d

The      scene at            the      g y m n a s i u m was           now m u c h more            orderly.             The       bodies           ha

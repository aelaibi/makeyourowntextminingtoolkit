                We didn't         see anyone       drunk or fighting           from arriving at the               coach

                We had no pn6blern finding                   our entry    point and getting            inside t h r ou gh

                At this       time       there were         no gates open,      nor did       I at any    time, witness

                an yo ne    getting       in any other way except              via the turnsti/xes.

                or stewards          controlling           people   entering    the tunnel       or    g»ens_.

                didn't see anyone               drinking or fighting           or a ny thing like that.

                <1430)      the    pen was       fu/l.       By this time we were all             standing        up,    by the

                At about 2.45pm,               (1445)      my brother    said that      he thought        it was        getting

                a bit squ as he d but            I told him it w ould be alright.

to our end and got a corner,                  and     thats w hen another J b i q shove               came.     I

then     realised that         something was          wrong, the pen was far/too               packed.

I c o u l d n ’t move      for about     ten minutes,           and    p e o p le w e r / s c r e a m ing for

someone       to open the gates onto thsr pitchy       It was then that people

s ta rt ed    climbing over the perimeter f/nce onto the pitch.         The P olice
              ------------------------ ,  y r , --------------------- .
were    trying       to push them ba/K          but there were           so many,       they

c.uld^' stop them

The    police       then op en ed the gate          in ps»n 4 , and        loads     of people        tried to

get    to    i t , c^imbi ng over       each oti'WrC but after a short while                      they shut

it again,

My brother          then told me that         he    c o u l d n ’t breathe      so   I told the        blokes

b ehind me to move,            but they d i d n ’t so       I hit       one of them and a small

line along          the fence a p p e a r e d so      I held onto m y / br ot he r whilst              he held

onto my waist and             pulled him torwards           the       back/    of the    pen.     It was

w hi ls t    I was doing       this    that



When     I got my brother            to the   back of the         pen,     I lifte^T him up onto the

dividing          fence and some       blokes      up in the stand t h e n/ gr ab be d my

brothers arm and             lifted him up.          About 5 minutes            ^ater    I managed       to

get onto          the fence and get       pulled up into the st/nd and met                       up w i t h

my brother.           When my brother and            I were      1 ifte'cKinto the stand,              the

other       two    lads we were with                                                 stayed on the

terrace and we met             up wit h them a few hours                later.

W he n we were        up in the stand we saw one bobby                     ripping        at the fence but

most    of them were doing             nothing.

F ro m the stand           I could    clearly see the extent               of the     packing     in the

pens .

Just after we got             into the    stand the forest              fans    chanted something,

and some          of the    people who had got on the                 pitch began         to run down

towards       them.        It was at this       time    that a load o f police                 came    from the
                                                                                                                     P AGE
                                                                                                                     S1781

          other end and formed a double                      lints and m ov ed them back             to the half way


/          3. i n e .

          After          the match had been stopped and the                    crush eased,         I could see all

          the dead bodies             on the floor at the front                 of the      pens.      I could see a

           pile of bodies            in pen 3,       just    in front      of the gates,          where a barrier

          had broken and rolled over onto                       them.        There were also a number of

          bodies          in pen 4 but       not so many.

           I could also see a number                    of dead bodies        on the      pitch     covered up with

          coats.

          W hi l st      this was     going     on    I saw one      ghotographer who            pulled back a coat

          a nd tried to take a picture                    of a dead body,          get attackptt.            Also when
    y
          the      police     got    into the        pen where     the barrier         b r o k a     guy taking

          pictures         of the barrier and bodies was also                      battered,         but we were

          told          later that he was a police              photographer.

          I also         saw a guy get        b at tered who was          picking up m oney from the

          terracing,          a group of blokes             gave him a few digs and the                     police     got

          him off them and took him away.

        ^ /6 n e   of the f a c t o r s w h ic h      probably may have           cai/sed injuries            or d e a t h s ,

          was      the    police     pushing     people     back     into the/pens at the b eginning and

          for      not opening        the    perimeter       fence g at e s / q u i c k l y e n o u g h .     They were

          far too slow          in realising what was                happaming.         There were          not en ou gh

          police officers             on t he    perimeter       to h^lp.

          At about         4 .33pm    (1635)     to 3pm      (1700)     a l ou d s p e a ker a n n o u n c e d that      the

          game was a b a n do ne d so we              left through the .stand exit,                 and met       up

          wit h                                           in the     courWard         area between the

          turnstiles and the                stand.

           I think        that a filter         system should have             be/n    in operation,           a distance

          a wa y from the ground,               w ith    police and stewards            checking t i c k e t s .

          There         should have      been more        police     or stewards a ct ua l l y         in the

          terraces          d irecting      fans where       to go.

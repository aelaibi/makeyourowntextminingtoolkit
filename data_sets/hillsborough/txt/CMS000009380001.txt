De a r

Thank you for y our recent letter to the M inister for Sport which
has been p assed to this department in view of our responsibilities
for the S a fety of Sports Grounds Act.

As you are probably aware Lord Justice Taylor held an I n q uiry into
the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.   Following the publication of
his Final Report the Home Secre tary produced a schedule outlining
the Government's initial response to its recommendations, a copy of
which is attached.  Since then the Chancellor has announced that
the Government would be reducing the pools betting tax, therefore
making available £100 million to the football industry over the
next five years.

I hope this information is of use to you.

                                                         Yours sincerely




                                                         STEVE BILBE

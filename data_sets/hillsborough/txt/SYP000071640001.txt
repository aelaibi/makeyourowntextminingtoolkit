                 I. a m a single man and                  I live at the above addr e s s w ith my               parents.



                 On S a t u r d a y        15th April      1989,   I was w o r k i n g as a regalia vendor

                 scarfs        and hats,           its a casual      job w hich      I do on very       rare    occasions

                 ■For a man           I know who attends           large     football      venues,     I don't     know his

                 name      all    you do          is go to the m a t c h buy a q u a n t i t y of hats and scarfs

                 off      him and          sell    them yourself      outside      the    ground.



                 On        ■sit day           ravelled      to S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football   grou nd w ith my

                 We      both brought             some   hats and. scarfs and at about              12 m i d d a y we went
                  round      to the N o t t i n g h a m Forest End of               the gr o u n d and stood         in the

                  street       that     the Forest         fans were w a l k i n g        down to the ground along,                1

                  think      it was Herri.es R oad we sold all                      our N o t t i n g h a m Forest       regalia

                  and    then we went            round to the L i v erpool              end of the ground,           me and

                  split      up before         changing        our sites.



                  1 got      round to the L e p p i n g s           Lane^nd       of the       ground at about S. 13pm.                1

                  stood on t he b r i d g e on the                 ground si'd'K^of the Le ppi ngs L a n e . I was

                  s to o d   roughly        in the mi d d l e       of the     bridge       facing      towards    the    entrance

                  to the       ground.



                  At    this       t I'rvie about sj. 15pm there was a \ t e a d y                  flow of fans    going    up to

S o £_            the    t ur n s t i l e s S i n L e p p in gs    Lane,    taut there were            only small    queues    at

                  The    fans       a p p r oa ch in g   the   t urnstiles       all a p p e a r e d    to be   in good

                  spirits,          singing,       they were a bit           rowdy but         I never     saw a n y signs     of

                  di s o r d e r    or fighting.           1 was    only a p p r o a c h e d   by a few fans who wanted

                  to    buy things and             I d i d n ’t get the        i mp r e s s i o n    that any of them had

                  b e e n d r i n k i n g h e a v i 1y .



                  There      were      plenty of s up p o r t e r s        having a drink             of beer   from cans and              I

                  saw a lot          of d i sc ar de d beer         cans    in the street            and also     in the    river

                  below w here           I was     standing,        but this      didn't       seem any different           to any

                  other      football        ground       I've     been to.

               At about 2 . 3 5 p m a lot          of fans        seemed to be a p p r o a c h i n g        the turnstile*

                   from both dissections in L e p pings Lane soon the fans were spreading out

                I know that at one              time?       w hich      I think was            just    before    or just after

                the    kick      off all      three    of these gates were                     open,    I think    the     left   hand

                I can       remember       seeing     I think          two    police      by the       left hand gate        by the

                on a horse,           but there was          no    control         as    I could see of any of the fans

                e n t e ri ng     through the        three     open gates,              nobody was          checking    tickets

                that was          obvious.

                The    two       conce r t i n a gates      by the         terrace       turn s t i l e s    *B* and the West

                s tand      turnstile        SC ’ were      closed after about 2 or 3 minutes and                            then a

                short       time a f t er wa rd s     the    gate on the               left    by the north stand

                I c a n ’t say how m a n y fans went                    thro u g h the         gates    during    the H or 3

                minutes          they were     open but the             crowd that            had been there       before     I

                w o u l d say had        reduced      by at       least three            quarters.



                As    far as        I can say    people were               still       entering       through the turnstiles

                when     the gates         had been opened,                and    con t i n u e d    to enter after        they had

                been shut.

                   It was       only a couple       of m in u t e s after        I had seen the          concertina     gates

                   closed that       I deci d e d    I had done enough and went away from the                          ground,

                   The    only other      thing     I w ou l d    like to say        is that      I thought     the fans

A iy j f f f y f   C1u e u e in 9 ou.tsi.de the     ground were          not h a n d l e d   very well     by the Police,

                   there    didn't    seem to be any             o r g a n i s a t i o n of the   crowds also     I don't

                   think    there were      enough Pol i c e at the L i v e r p o o l             end of the     ground.

                   Also    X think    the kick       off   should have           been dela y e d and the        fans

                   outs i d e    should   have    been     informed and          there w o u l d n ' t   have   been such a

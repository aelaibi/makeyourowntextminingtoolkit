VISITS


I mentioned the visits which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will be making to Sheffield
and Liverpool over the next few weeks.

2.     The Liverpool visit should be on Monday 6 and Tuesday 7 October (possibly
the next day also, and travelling up on the Sunday). Publicity will be unavoidable
and I agree that we will need to decide how to manage that.

3.      I am going to Liverpool tomorrow to fix the arrangements, and expect to meet
Trevor Hicks and perhaps other Family Support Group figures. They will have ideas
of their own about publicity for the visit (Hicks has told me that he wants to play it
down). I will contact you again after I am back, when I should have more details.

4.      Meanwhile we also have the Judge’s visit to Sheffield and the Hillsborough
Football ground. This will be on Wednesday September 24, when there is an evening
match against Derby. (I had hoped that we could visit the ground on Saturday
October 4 when we could have gone in the afternoon and there is what I think might
be a rather bigger crowd for a game against Everton, but Sir Murray has another
engagement that day).

5.     I have discussed the arrangements with the club and the police and the
attached letters to them set out the plans for the day. Both club and police are keen
for there to be no publicity if possible, which suits us also. But I have taken your
point that we need to have fall-back arrangements if any football reporters twig that
the Judge is there.

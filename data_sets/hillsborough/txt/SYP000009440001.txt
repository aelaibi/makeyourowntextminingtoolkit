               I am a single man                living at    the above addres            together with my

               I am employed as a F i r e m a n by S outh Yor k s h i r e C o u ntry Fire Service,

               firemen,       and up to fifteen firemen to man                      fire appliances.

               On S a t u r d a y    151h April      1989     <150489),       I was    on duty at S h e f f i e l d

 S a tu r d a y    15th April          1989    <150489),          I knew that an F.A.                    Cup s e m i ­

 final     m atch between Liverpool                     and N o t t i n g h a m Forest Football                    Cups was

 to be      played at the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football                  ground      in Sheffield.

 S h o r t l y after 3 . 0 0 p m        (1500)       that afternoon,            another            fireman        called my

 a t t e n t i o n to the t e levised             programme         of the match.                 On the television,

 1 could see what at                   first a p p e a r e d to be a crowd              invasion of the

 pitch.           I then    realised          that    there was       some      s o p r o b l e m                at the

 g round.

 S h o r t l y afterwards,             at about 3. 1 5 p m         (12^15),     we    received an em e r g e n c y

 call     to at t e n d S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y >rootball           ground.             I immediately

 went     to the ground floor                  to my fire          engine,      where all            the others          of

 Red W atch had gathered.                      There S u b o f f i c e r                told us we were                  going

,^to H i l l s b o r o u g h Football          ground to assist             the Police and Amb u l a n c e

 Services.              A total    of three          fire a p p l i c a n c e s a t t e n d e d the          ground,         they

 were     Central         1 and 2,       w hich are        normal     fire      engines,           and Central           5

 which      is the emergency              tender and          contains more            specialised               cutting

 e q u ipment and a resuscitator.                        S t a t i o n Officer F L E TCHER was                    in overall

 control          of the three Central                applicances.          While      on route            to the

 ground,          we    received a m essage             from Central          Control,             informing        us that

 the    s i t u a t i o n at the H i l l s bo r o u g h       ground had now been desig n a t e d a
                                                                               ..       - -   -      -       -



 Major      Incident.            I was    then aware          that    the     s i tuation at H i l l s b o r o u g h

 was    really serious.

 We a r r i v e d at H i l l sb o r o u g h Foo>tfalI g r o u n d at about 3. 2 0 p m                            (1520).       We

 were a l r e a d y aware          that              Rive l i n    1 appi i cance had arri v e d at the

 ground before             us,    as    they had sent a mess a g e                  to Central            control,       which

 I overheard,             stating       that    they     could not find the Police Officer                               in

 charge,          and that       the sit u a t i o n was          complete      chaos.            I halted my

 appliance             in P e nistone Rd,         just     before     the gateway which

 gives access             to the       rear    of the S outh Stand.                  I could see that                there

 were    quite a few people walking away from the                                    ground.             Some    of them

                                                                                                              S8 4 8

a p p e a r e d to tas upset,           but they were all              leaving      in an orderly mannor.

The Central           2 a p p l i c a n c e was    parked d i r ectly          in front      of me,      and       I

could see someone                in the     road in front             of Central      2, waving         the

app l i a n c e    into the        ground,        I am not sure whether               this      person was a

stew a r d or a police              officer.

Central        2 pulled         into the driveway,              I f o l lowed    behind.         I could see

that     there were a lot of                people       in P e n i s t o n e Rd,    actually        in the        road,

a n d that        some    of the       traffic was        being       held up.

I could see           people walking             down the       d r i veway from the Leppings Ln end

of the ground towards                   the gates        into Pen i s t o n e Rd„       There was a steady

flow of          people,       many a p p e a r e d distressed,           either     upset      or   injured           in a

minor way.            I did not see anyone at                   that    time who was         seriously

i nj u r e d .

I f o l l o w e d Central         2 up the driveway to just                    past the      corner      of the

So u t h Stand where             it joins        the L e p pings Ln terrace.               We    pulled       up

opposite          the double        gate    close    to the Police Control                 box.        A Police

officer was           standing         by the     gate,    w hich he then slid open to a l l o w the

crews        to get      in.     The    crews went        into the area          behind the gate,              taking

with them the             cutting       equipment        and    resuscitators.          I remained with

the a p p 1 i a n c y 7 as did the              driver    of Control        2 Fire m a n                           ,     It

is no rmal yf-ract i ce for the driver                     to    remain with the a p pliance and to

act as Ltiasion with                the    officer       in charge.There were              people milling

ar o u n d    in the area surrounding                the       fire

appliances,           and so the          gate    through w h i c h the         crews entered was              closed

behind them.              I could not           see anything          inside    the ground at this                 time.

After a minute             or two,        due    to there       being     too much     radio traffic               to

contact S t a t i o n Officer FLETCHER                    for further          opa^ ^ s T I went        into       the

g r o u n d to find him.               I went     in through— trfie same            gate as      the    crew,       went

into a corridor                running     through the S o u t h S tand between the                     covered

a nd   uncovered areas,                and down from the              un c o v e r e d area onto       the    pitch.
                                                                                                           PAGE            4

My    immediate       view was a        large number           of    people    on the    pitch,        I would

estimate      that        they were     hundreds        in number.           There were a lot of

people     lying on the           pitch    in front       of the L e p pings Ln terracing.                         Some

of the     people         lying down had jumpers,               coats     or other      items    of    clothing

thrown over          their    faces,       I assumed       that       these    people were       dead,             I saw

o thers    lying on the           ground who were          not       covered over,       but were

c o mpletely still,              1 assu m e d that       these       people were     either      dead or

very    badly     injured,         I could also see             people who were          injured       lying

and sitting          down.       Some     were    receiving          first aid treatment           from St,

J ohns A m b u l a n c e m e n , Police,     Fire Service             personnel     and others,                1

could see that some               people were          being    given m o u t h to m outh

resuscitation,            and some were          being    given heart massage.

Pe o p l e were      spread out on the            pitch at          least a quarter        of the way up

the    pitch.        It    looked like      utter       chaos       to me.     People were       just

running a r o u n d on the          pitch;       no-one a p p e a r e d      to know what        to do. I

could see no-ons who a p p e a r e d to be                 in overall          control     of the

s i t u a t i o n which a p p e a r e d to be e x tremely disorganised.                     I was shocked

by what     1 saw          in front      of me.

In the middle of the             pitch    I could          clearly see S t a t i o n       Officer

FLETCHER,       who        was   visible due       to the white fire             helmet,    1 went             to him

and asked him              for   further orders.          He told me that           the casualties

w o u l d shortly be ferried off                 the    pitch to waiting ambulances,                       I

a s s u m e d that    these      casualties       would    be taken          from the ground          the       same

wa y that     I had gone          in,     I went       back to the        gate    by the    fire

a ppliance.       There were        two Police         Officers        by the gate,        and   1 told them

that    casualties would shortly be brought                           through     the gate.        These

officers a p p e a r e d to see this as an                 impossible          exercise,     saying            that

there would not            be enough       room.        1 could not          identify either          of these

officers.

I. returned       to the      pitch to      inform S t a t i o n Qffioe'r FLETCHER.                   He       told
                                                                                                          PAGE       5

me that       no-one      in the area a p p eared              to/be making any decisions,                 and

that casualties            would      therefore            be taken out         through the gate
    ■■
p r eviously m e n t i o n e d      on his orders.              I. was     to    return to a position

outside       the gate,        and to help to organise                   the ambul a n c e s and to assist

the    casualties         into    them.

I went       back     to the Fire appliance,                 and    parked       it closed to the

e ntrance      to the Riv e r s i d e Suite,               where    it would not          obstruct

a mbulances.           Central      2 was also m oved and                parked adjacent            to Central      1,

After a few minutes,                the    casualties were            being       brought     out    of the

gate.        At that      time    I only saw one a m bulance                    there    to collect
                                                       /
casualties.           S t a t i o n Officer FLETCHER            contacted me on the              radio    to tell

me to organise            the ambul a n c e ^          for the worst        of the       casualties.

There    were       no further        a mbu/ances at           this   time,       and so the        casualties

had to wait           by the gate.          \

1 looked down the d r i v e w a y towards P e n i s t o n e Rd,                     and    I could see        two

ambulances          parked     near the Souvenir               shop by the         corner of the South

S t a n d near      to the S p i o n Kop.

1' ran down to the a m b u l a n c e s and asked them to drive                               up to the     end of

the S o u t h Stand to           collect         the    serious     casualties.           They a p p e a r e d to

ignore me        to    concentrate         on people with minor                  injuries,     and    having

returned to the top of the driveway,                            I was      forced       to go back,      and ask

them a g a i n «

I had asked Police Officers                       close to these           parked ambu l a n c e s     to send

any further           ones who a t t e n d e d straight             up towards          the fire appliances,

but none a t t e n d e d for a long time.                      It must      have    been at      least    ten

minu t e s    before      the second ambulance a r r i v e d there.                       Serious     casualties

were    waiting        for a m b u l a n c e s    there,      and were      receiving m outh to mouth

r e s u s ciation and heart massage                    outside      the gate.

I could see           that some a m bulances                had started to make            their way towards

my    position,        but about       halfway up the              drive    they    stopped,        apparently
                                                                                                        PAG E        6
                                                                                                        SS48

so the drivers and                  crew could speak          to Police O f f icers          there.      I went

clown a third time                 to urge    them to get a move             on.

I told the Police Officers                        there   to send any further a m b u l a n c e s         up,

an d    then went to the gates                    into Pen i s t o n e Rd,    and asked Police

Of f i c e r s and S t e wards          there      the same      thing.      I then went       back    up to

the Fire appliance,                  and shortly afterwards,               the ambulances        began to

arrive       r e g u 1a r 1y   .
F i reman |                and      I were    then oc-eapied for           the     next half an hour          or

so     in directing ambulanp^'iT'land casualties                         to try and get        them on their

way as       soon as                   le. Once      no more      casualties        had been brought          out

through the gate,                  and the s i t uation at that            point     had eased,       I wa l k e d

a r o u n d the      corner along           the    driveway towards          the Leppings       Ln entrance.

As     soon as       I turned        the    corner,       I saw a line of Police Officers

facing a line of bodies                     laid down      in a row by the           fence    by the     river.

I then       returned          to my    position by the gate,              and was joined by a number

of Police Officers.                    T o g ether we org a n i s e d the ambulances            for    the

removal       of the bodies.

F o l l ow i n g    the    removal      of the bodies         I remained         by the Fire app l i a n c e

until      the      crew    returned.         We    remained there         until    about 5 . 15pm       (1715)

whe n we       received a radio message                   from Central        Control      to say we were

no     longer       required we then              returned to the         station.

A1though           I saw many of the              injured and dead         people     on the    pitch and

brought            that afternoon,           I cannot      describe any          in detail,     or say where

I saw them,           with one         exception.         Just    in front       of me when     I went       onto

the     pitch the first              time    I saw a young         bay    lying on the        pitch.      He was

white,      aged about             12 or    13 years,      and    I think he had blonde           hair.         He

a p p e a r e d to be       lying      in the      recovery      position.         I am not sure       if he

was     dead,       but    I believe        that at that time            he was still alive.

I have       seen a plan of S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football              Ground,    and on it

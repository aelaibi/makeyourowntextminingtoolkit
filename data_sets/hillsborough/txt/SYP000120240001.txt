meal      ticket          from Police                Sergeant           Chapman            at    the     players          tunnel.              We

then      proceeded             to    the       West       Yorkshire              canteen wagon                situated          behind

the N o r t h S t a n d          next          to    the     gymnasium.                 When       we    got     there,         we     were

told      t hat      the       canteen          had    shut        for         SO minutes.               We    therefore             went

b ac k    to       our    original             positions           in f r o n t         of      the N o r t h Stand.

About         E.SO       p.m.    (1420)             Police     Constable                Brookes          went       for    his       meal

while         I covered          both          our    positions.                  By    now      the     ground was             filling             up

nicely.             I thought             at    the    time        though            there       was     s t i ll    a    lot    of     people

yet      to    come       in a n d        t im e     was     getting             on.       About        2.45     p.m.      Police

Constable            Brookes          returned                and       I went         for      a q u i c k bite         to eat.           I

returned            shortly          before          k ick    off             to m y    position.              By    n o w the

atmosphere               was    electric.              As     I walked               back       to m y    position,             the     g ame

started.             When       I a r r i v e d at m y             point          I stood          facing        the      crow d.          Then
about        six       youths        jumped          over       the     concrete          wall      and       onto       the       perimeter

tr a c k .        At    first        I was        astonished.                  I managed           to    grab       hold       of       one

youth.         I asked          him       if    he     had a t i c k e t          which       he    h a d n ’t,         so    I escorted

him    down        the       perimeter            track         towards         the     Police          Room.           I took          his

details           and     ejected          him       out    of    the       ground        via      '0*       gate       situated          on

Penistone              R o a d , . near         the S p i o n         Kop.        As    I turned             to    go    back       onto       the

tra c k ,      I saw         several           Police       Officers            run     from       the       gymnasium             onto       the

perimeter              track.          I could            hear    garbled            messages           over my          personal

ra d io      to    the       effect        t hat       there      was       some       trouble          at    the L e p p i n g s         Lane

end.         I quickly              ran    after          them    onto         the     t rac k .        As    I entered             the

ground         between          the       Spion        Kop and North                 Stand      I looked            down       to the

Leppings           Lane        end.        X could          see       several          Police       Officers             stood          between

gates        4 and        3 and what             appeared             to me       to    be a       crowd          spillage          or    some

sort      of      pitch        invasion.               I ran      up     the      track       beside          the       NOrth       S ta n d ,

the    football              match        still        continuing.                I took        up m y        original             position

in f r o n t       of     the N o r t h         S t a n d as      I thought             the     situation               behind          the

goal      in the L e p p i n g s               Lane       terraces          was      policed adequately.                           I thought

it b e s t        to    stand        fast       where       I was        wi t h my        serial         and       make       sure       no    one          i

else      came         over     from       the       North Stand.                 At    this       p o int        I didn't          realise                 i

Stand.            I think           p l a y was        stopped         by      now.      The       crowd          in the       North

Stand were              u p out       of       their       seats       and      seemed        to    be       shouting          and

pointing           over        to    the       Leppings          Lane       terraces.              Some       were       booing,

gesticulating                  to    the       f ans      behind       th e     goal.         Probably             because          they

thought,           like        I did,          it ws       some       s or t    of     crowd       invasion.                 They

appeared           to     be    incensed and                the       situation          started             to    get       out    of

Liverpool            supporters              being       assisted                 over        the       fencing           by P o l i c e

Several            appeared        to    be     injured.                 They          a ll    appeared              to    be w a l k i n g ,

holding            their     stomachs          and       lower           regions.                  I then          became        aware        that

something            serious        was       happening                 and       that        people          were        injured.            It

became         chaos.           I assisted             several            injured               people          to    the     advertising

of       uninjured         people        were wandering                       around           the       pitch making               it

difficult            to a s s i s t      those         who      needed             treatment              or       first      aid.         I can

remember            feeling        very       angry       towards                 people           just       stood        talking,

move       away      and     they would             ignore              me.        They         even      ignored            injured                            i

Leppings           Lane      end    I heard            hysterical                  screaming              from a woman                  knelt          o ver

a youth            lying     nearby.           He      looked            seriously                 injured,           very a sh e n           faced

and motionless.                    He    was     lying          on       his b a c k            and      didn't           appear        to be

breathing.                I grabbed           hold       of     Police Constable                         Brookes wh o              was        still

with       the      injured        lad a n d        the S p e c i a l              Constable.                   We   went        back      to      the         V,

ashen      faced       youth.         I noticed          he w a s n ’t b r e a t h i n g           and       I Could           not

f ee l    his    pulse.         We    pulled       him     onto       his     side      and made             sure       his air

passage         was    cl ear.        We    then     put       him    onto       his    back       again and Police

Constable         Brookes           gave    heart       massage        whilst          I gave          him     the kiss          of

life.




                  At    this        stage     a woman       appeared             and    knelt          down       beside        me.

She      said,    "Let     me       help,     I ’m a     staff        nurse."          At    this       she       took       charge

and      continued        to    give       heart     massage          whilst          I continued              to    give mouth

to m o u t h .                                                                   I felt          like     giving          up but

the      staff    nurse        was    gre a t ,    she     encouraged             all       of    us    to     continue.                 I

can r e m e m b e r     feeling        the y o u t h ’s b o d y            and    thinking             ’ i t ’s s t i l l       w a rm ,

he    c a n ’t be      d e a d ’.     We    continued           what       a p p e a r e d at      the       time       to     be an

eternity,         but     to    no a v a i l .      The     staff          nurse       finally          stopped           pu m p i n g ,

she      said,    "He *5 d e a d ,         h e ’s g o n e . "        The    staff       nurse          then       got     up a n d

w e n t . I never         saw    her again.              I presume            she w e n t         to    help        others.          I

can      remember       feeling        very angry,              I was       totally          shattered.                 I shook

the      body and       I can        remember        saying,          "You       bastard,          you       b a s t a r d ."        I

d o n ’t k n o w why,          I probably          just        had    to    let       go.        I failed           him*        I was

really angry            towards        him.        There        he w a s      just      lying          there,        I d o n ’t

know what         I really           felt.

Anyhow,         Police     Constables?             Andy and           myself          stretchered             t his       youth          off

the      pitch.        As w e       carried       him    someone           put    something             over        his      face,           I

can      remember       Andy     getting          annoyed        and       pulled       it off.              He     was      r i ght      as

well,      we    d i d n ’t w a n t    the     other       supporters             to    think          he w a s      dead.           To

them      he was       just     another         injured         person        being         carried          off.         We    took

him      into    the    gymnasium and              there        we w e r e       greeted          by    other        dead

bodies.          Rows     of    them with          stunned Policemen                    stood          over       them       like

black      crows.        Qthers        were       lying     down       or     sitting            down.        We     p laced our

body into one of the rows.     Andy then took a body off a Special who had just

come in.     He was in no fit state to deal with it.   The rest was pretty non-

important.    We documented the bodies etc, we seemed to stand over them for

hours until we were told to go to another part of the gymnasium.       I found

’m y ’ youth’s details on some personal papers.    I'll never forget his name:-

DAVID WILLIAM BIRTLE, D.O.B. 060566

                            STOKE-ON-TRENT, STAFFS, or his face NEVER.

It's quite ironic I thought that David would have been 23 years this next

month.     His birthday was to be the day                   life can be full of

daft little things like that, 23 years, what a waste.

After that I sat in the gymnasium with the other Police Officers waiting

hours and hours to get them identified and took down to the mortuary.         The

atmosphere was obviously strained.     We sat around in little groups and kept

going over and over what happened.     We all had our own    littlestories   to

tell.    It helped quite a lot talking together.   We even managed tolaugh,

let's face it it's better than crying.      As a Police Officer you get used to

switching off your emotions - you have a job to do and you do it.        That's

what all the training and years of experience drums into you.       You don't

forget you    just push it aside - life goes on.

I went off duty at 2.00 a.m. (0200) the next morning.

body     i nto       on e    of    the     rows.             Andy    then       took      a    body       off      a Special            who

had     just     come        in.      He      was       in no       fit     state        to    deal       with        it.        The    rest

was     pretty         non-important.                    We    documented             the      bodies          etc.,        we    seemed

of     the    gymnasium.              I found            'my'       youth's         details          on       so me    personal

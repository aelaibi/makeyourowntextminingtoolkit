At the ground we were briefed and told to be on our respective points by 11am that day.

At 10.50am I was positioned on the Leppings Lane side of the ground. Seriel 19's duties

on the day were to search incoming coaches and maintain public order outside the ground.

Shortly after 11am a number ©f Incoming coaches arrived at the ground. All were searched

and the fans directed to go straight into the ground.

At around mid-day fans were spilling out into the road and as       a result i moved to the locatioi
of Leppings Lane,and the junction with      Catchbar Lane advising all fans to getoff the road
sind onto the pavement.
I remained at this position until further coaches arrived.I then assisted in searching
the coaches before returning to the Leppings lane,Catchbar lane position.

At 2pm the volumne of fans were such that it was impossible to keep all the fans off
the road and onto the pavement.Every effort was made to do this but it was practicably
impossible.

At 2.^5pm fans were seen running down from the direction of Wadsley lane towards the ground.
The majority of fans were seen to be carrying both cans and plastic bottles of beer and
lager.Due to the Shear numbers of fans they were turned away from the ground .

Shortly before the start of the match fans had to be seperated in Leppings lane as fighting

brtke out between two large groups.It was necessary at this stage for two police officers
on horseback to do this.

By this time it appeared apparent that the situation was begining to get out of hand,there
was such a large influx of fans that they filled Leppings Lane from one side of the road
to the other and from the bottom of Leppings Lane to the mouth of the junction with Catchbar
,lane.

At 3pm I heard a radio message which stated that the game had been put back to 3*15pra«
As a result of the radio message and in order to slow the sudden Influx of fans into
the ground I informed almost every passing fan that the kick off time had been delayed
until 3 *15pm.
At just after 3p® it was apparent both to me and the waiting fans that the game had
infact commenced* I could hear tie roar of the crowd inside the ground as could the fans
outside.

A short time after this I heard another radio message requesting all available officers
to go onto the pitch.I shouted to other officers in Leppings Lane,to do just this most
were unaware of the request as they were not equipped with a radio.

Together with other officers I joined Sgt John Morgan on the pitch and with him was
Instructed to go to the rear of the west stand.

At the rear of the stand I entered the tunnel entrance it was apparent that people were
trying to get out of the stand.Most were holding their chests apparently in pain*
I assisted two fans to the end of the tunnel where other fans assisted them*
I went back into the tunnel where I was confronted by one fan shouting and swearing.
I throw @ne youth over my right shoulder and carried him out of the tunnel. It was
apparent that this youth had stopped breathing but due to the shear number and mass
of people I was unable to commence mouth to mouth until he was clear of the tunnel.
Once outside the ground he was given mouth to mouth at this stage an ambulance arrived.
Together with the ambulance crew I assisted the Injured and together with the crew we
transported Injured people ferrying them to both the Northern and Hallamshire Hospitals.
At 7.30pm that evening I returned to Ecclesfield Police station for other duties.

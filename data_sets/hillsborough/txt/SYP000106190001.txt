                Report of Stephen Murray FS 960


        Cn Saturday, 15 April, 1989, I commenced duty at Bcclesfield Police Station at 9am.
        I attended at the briefing at Hillsborough at 10am together with my Serial, No. 45.
        The Serial comprised, I'C's 2431 Jones, 2500 Hedyard, 1218 Glover, 2520 H-*ihinSr
         3203     Crapper, 1629 Rogers, 811 Holmes, 297 Barnes and 571 Fall. The Serial was
        under the command of Inspector Morton.

         checking coaches and mini buses. Our aim was to search ior alcohol auu oiieck puo^enger.
         to see if they were in possession of tickets. A log was kept of all vehicles checked
         including the outcome of the searches. All the vehicles checked contained Liverpool
         supporters and between 11am - 2.45pm. approximately               50   vehicles were encCKcd.


         As a result of traffic flow being extremely quiet we resumed patrol at 2.45pm. to
_       return to Claywheels Lane. We arrived at this location at 3Pra*                     logged off for

        .meal.


         At approximately 3•05pm. we received a radi0 message directing us and other available
         units at Claywheels Lane, to assist at Lepplngs Lane entrance. Because of the large
         amount of radio traffic it was impossible to say what was happening at that end of

         the ground.


         On arrival my serial assisted other serials to form a cordon leading from the bridge

         fO "bllf? ST’JCr^+ *?hop ^         enfcr.wn** "to      ground. Although I was in possession of a,
         personal radio I did not have a earpiece aiv; I could hear nothing of the communication
         Oil arrival «f the first ambulance, Inspector K w ’tar <r*-+~x!t«d our Serial +•"
         the rear of the West Stand Enclosure through one of the large gates, which adjoins
^       the service road connecting Leppings Lane to Penistone Road.


         Once through this gate I saw injured persons and bodies strewn about the floor at
         the rear of the West Stand. At this point the serial became split tip as we each gave
         assistance to the injured. I assisted both fellow police officers and fans remove
         several injured persons out of the ground and into the service roaa wnorc ^;;bui.uiioe
         and medical assistance was arriving. The operation of removing persons from the
         re^r of the stand antieared to take at leas't half an hour f;nd bf cause of lack of
         radix o^smu'r; w».tion I believed that the problem was confined tothis area               alone.


         Once the injured persons and bodies had been removed Itook up a                  position at the
         entrance to the tunnel at the rear of the stand. There I joined other officers who
         viere attempting to prevent fans re-enter the enclosure through the tunnel to look

         for friends >?nd relatives.
I ascertained that persons bad been crushed on the terraces and that the
vatt majority from the enclosures had gone on to the pitch.        In visw — thi.-:
I saw it as ray duty to prevent any persons entering the enclosure via the
tunnel to enable emergency assistance to be given to those who were injured.
Ag a result I was subjected to a uux'i c-i                    a rua       ----   .v.-it--
                                              4-1•/»          of in+fw;? A*.;-nhfU Wh"51 s t

it was possible to reason with the a-.ore rational, the majority were taking
no notice at all and several attempted to force their way through.


With no anncv.nc3 ment3 coming over the loudspeakers cpil.te a number oi ians
belelved that the natch v?as still going ahead and were pleading with police
to call on the referee to postpone the match. At one stage I nal to request
the at-distance of other serials as I feared that the fans who we had refused
access through the tunnel were going to vent their anger on us. eventually
I heard a loudspeaker announcement at about 4pro. and almost immediately the
fans left on.the Leppings lane enclosures and West Stand started to leave tne
ground. The atmosphere was like a tinder box and I feared for the safety of
the police at this     stage as most ofthe anger was directed at us.


As the fans v;ere leaving I was able to re-group my serial and with the exception
of PC 1623 Rc.'^rs, who uas detained with a body, we returned to our transit.

             I am a single man and                   I live a t the a b o v ^ a d d r e s s          with my mother

             have    two    brothers,        one of whom.



             I have     been a supporter                of E v er to n FC/^or as             long as       I can remember

             and    I intended to get a ticket for the FA Cup Semi-F x nal fixture

             between Ever t o n and N o rw i ch to be held at Villa P k , Birmingham.

             Unfortunately          I could not get a ticket                       but a s ___         had tickets          for the

             other     semi-final         involving Liverpool                   and N o tt i n g h a m Forest        to be held

             at H i l l s b o r ou g h S ta d iu m      in S h e f f i e l d,     I decided to go with him.                     The

             tickets       he had were £ 6 tickets                   for the        standing are a for Leppings Lrn

                     got these         tickets        on Fr id ay        14th April        1989     (140489)       and     it was

             the following          day that we               travelled to S h e f f i el d by coach to w at ch                     the

             game.      The      coach we tra ve ll ed by was Eaveswa;//ft r a v e l , As|Yj^g¥i~in-

Make rfieId and al a r o u nd II am                (11Q Q ) we met               the    coach    in

We also      travelled with
                         --------------- " -------- ; J T s a fijA Z U Z T
friend who we h«\ve known for many years and Vincent/F iftjzs ffiTimons, a lad

who    I had never met            before.        Vincent was one of the 93                       people who       died

that    day.

A n y w a y we    left                 at about        11     (1100)       or     12 o ’clock         (1200)    and

tra ve ll ed to M an ch es te r        via M62 and then through Buxton on A class

roads.      There were           heavy traffic         del a y ^ M y K ^ o u gh M a nchester and we

even tu a l l y a rrived         in S h e f f i el d at 2.50         pm.         (1450)        We had been

stop pe d once about             10 miles    out of S he f fi e ld               by the P o l i c e «     A

p o li ce wo m an >f nd a policeman              boarded the           coach to cj^ej^^or alcohol                     and

tickets     B u t their         check was very brief.

By the time we a r ri ve d            in Sheffield,            we were warned that we may miss

the kick         off.     There were a lot of               coaches        building up behind us

containing Liverpool               fans who,      as    I thought,               had also       been de layed         in

traffic.          When we got off          the    coach we d e ci de d to run to the ground.

We had     parked        in Halifax Rd and          ran to the along Halifax R d ,

P e n n i s t o n e Rd and Leppings Ln.             We saw a lot of                    police    officers       lined

up along         the    rou te but did not         receive         directions            from any.        However,

there were also a lot of Liverpool                          s u p p o r t e rs     making       their way to the

ground all         of whom a pp ea r e d         to know their way so there was no need                               for

d irections        to be given.           Some    of these         s upporters           1 saw    drxnking

alcoho 1 from cans but the mood was good and                                I certainly did not see

any fighting or drunkenness.                     We a r ri ve d to the entrance                       to the ground

at 3,bout 2.55           pm.     (1455)     We were met by a large group of supporters

outside     who were           shouting    for the opening              of gates.              1 he gate's 1 refer

to are these blue               iron gates at the entrance w hich were                                         w hen we

arrived.          I was    very w or ri ed at one stage                  because         the    crowd were

shoutng a g g r es s iv e ly at the          police         to open the gates and                     I formed the

opinion that            had the gates       not been opened there was an element                                of the

crowd who would have          caused trouble.

After about £ minutes we had reached a position nearer                                  to the     iron

gates.     We had been       carried and jostled about                    to the      position     rather

than gone     there      by chance.       I also     felt that had the gate's not been

opened     people outside w ould have             been     injured        in the      crush w hich at

that    time was worse       than       I h^e    e xp er ie nc ed    before.          There was a line

of three     police horses                      the qates w hich we had been                   carried

past.      As we got      past and near-s^f the gates               one of the         police    officers

on horseback,       a male,       was shouting       to some        people         that they were

mental,     referring      to their      behaviour as they ducked under                       police

horses.

At about 2 .57 pm {,4457)/Che two sets of gates outside                                the terrace

turnstiles     opened!, /f d i d n ’t see who opened them.                         As they did the

crowd    caused us to break          into a steady trot and as we                      crossed the area

outside     the turnstiles        a police       officer said,            “K eep to your        right

lads?"      We did this and         came to a halt         behind a group of supp orters

who were waiting         outside a blue          cage    like gate,         the one         nearest    the

river.      As we had crossed the area outside                      the    turnstiles we         noticed

that    despite    the    crowd    people did not seem to bm o/ing                      tl^rough

turnstiles.        I saw    people      climbing     over the t/rnsti 1 e / 4 r               jinto ths

getting     over   but he was alone and unable                to cope,

An y w a y we had been waiting           in the    crowd outside            the      cage    like gate       for

only a minute       or so during which time everybody,                          including myself,

were    impatient as       time was      getting     on.    As the         crowd built up outside

once again there was a heavy               crush and        people were shouting                for the

gates    to be opened,

S u d d e n l y the galte opened and there was a stro/g                        yhflu^/'bf supporters

the    terraces    could be gained         in other ways.             As we headed along               tunnel

        I joined        in with the       rest of the supporters               singing,. “W e 're on the

        m a r c h with Kenny's a r m y , ” which,            being an E v er to n supporter,                     I was     not

        too happy with.            The    tunnel     was   very p a c k e d    and     I had no         choice as to

        w here    I went,       w ith all    the singing we         c o u l d n ’t hear anything.                   As we

        got     to the terraces          there were people          trying       to get out but they were

        prevented from doing              so by the        crowd along        the tunnel.            As we got           to

        the terraces we went              right     into Pen 3 and we were                carried by the              crowd

        ( 1)    Ian Rt^sh, who         had a tracksuit        top on, was          kicking        the    ball against

        point     I was a p p r o x i m at e ly    15 feet away from the               perimeter         fence

        di rectly       in line w it h the gate            in the   perimeter          fence.         I was       turned

        by the     crowd to face          towards     the south stand side of the ground,                             my

        right.         I could not see what was going on on the field but                                  I was

        panicking as           I was    having     d if fi cu lt y breathing.           I saw police officers

        and     camera men       rush over        to the fencing as           people      trijpd X/T jjejy out

        people to get           back down       into the terraces.             Meanwhi 1W x           saw a mid^jr^

        age d    police    officer stood at the gate doing all                        he could ^o assist.

        He was     o bv iously aware         of what was going          on and star ted be/^i^jyg the

        spikes     on the fencing           over    to help people        get over.             The p fe ss u re

going       to fail       down and be trampled and                   1 was       very frightened.              I tried

to find my feet and to get up I stood on the                                     legs of somebody             in

eased off.           I saw a pile of                people    in front          of us.                said,    "lotne

straight.           He wore a dark             coloured 3/4          1                         whi ch had a h o o d ,

It    looked       like    it had a large             collar              the hood was          detachable

There were a large                number       of    injured       people       lying a ro un d at that             time

beinq a tt e n de d to but we did not see                                        or Vincent.

At that       time we decided to leave the ground.                                We were aware            that

people       had died so thought we w ould                     phone home.              For    this    reason we

left the ground and visited a toffee shop where at a cost of £1 we

were allo we d to use                 the telephone.           The man had not asked for                      the

to the ground to look               for the others      but we w ere not a l lo we d               in.      From

there we went back            to where       the   coach was    parked and e ventually

            turned u p .       The    coach left without Vincent and                     it was     not

until     the     following    day we found out that Vincent                     had died.

Gp4nq     back to my position whilst on the terracing,                            I am aware        that a

crush barrier         collapsed.         I have,    however,       learned this              from the media

and was     unaware at the           time.     I w ould say,       h o w e v e r ^ that on reflection

I was     stood somewhere           behind    it and that      p e a p l f e ^ f j p . 1 1 ing foward was

caused by the         collapsing       of the barrier

I will     add that as we           left the ground via t h# same gate as we had

ente re d through        I saw a steward dressed             in a reflective                 bib stood

outside     the main gates           on Lappings Ln.         There were a lot of Liverpool

suppo r t e r s    leaving and a lot of            police officers          stood outside           who     the

fans were abusing.             I heard the steward say to a group of Liverpool

'supporters,        " I t ’s your    own m a k i n g , ” at w hich    point one of the

supporters        hit him,     pushing       him over a parked            car.     The Police        said,

duties        that     is    covering     t urnstiles         1 to 8 and at a p p r o x i m a t e l y            12

noon the t u r n s t i l e s       opened to a l l o w fans              to enter.        At        this   time        1

could see two male                uni f o r m e d officers         carrying put           searches of fans,

^entering throsugh t urnstiles                   1 and 2 in front                of me.        Shortly       before

the t u r n s t i l e s      ope n e d several       stewards           in reflective          jackets were

j oined by sQme>orie who a p p e a r e d to be an official w i t h a UHF                                   type

divided the a c c e s s           from the N o r t h s tand and the West                       stand-        I

 q u e s t i o n e d the m a n wit h the          radio aS        I was      concerned that            fans

 entering       later w h e n       it w o u l d be busy w o u l d have access                      to either

 side.        I was told that            they had w r o n g l y          positioned two mark e r s               outside

 t urn s t i l e s ,9 to      12 and fans enter i n g             for the N orth stand w o u l d                  be

 entering       the gr o u n d on the West s tand end.                        I was also            told that          it

 was    too    late     to take      them down as they had been scre w e d                           in position.

 A small       portable        type a l u m i n i u m . b a r r i e r    had been p o s i t i o n e d to the

 left of t u r n s t i l e s 9 to 12 and m a n n e d by further                       stewards who               have

 been    requested by the man with the                        radio.

 By this time           I was aware         that the Serial               Sergeant,       Sgt.       Edwards,          was

 not    in the vicinity.               I returned to             my position and at that time                          the

 turns t i l e s o p e n e d and fans           began to         enter.

 At ar o u n d 2 p m (1400)         I was aware          that     two     fans    had been brought                in

 thro u g h the gate           leading      to the N o r t h stand            immedi a t e l y to my             right*

 T hey were       in p o s s e s s i o n of several           hund r e d     pounds    in cash and a

 number       of tick e t s     for the m a t c h that were                s u spected     to be forgeries.

 They were        c o n v e y e d to the Police            room.

A short        time a fter        this as       I was     s e arching a fan e n t ering                the

 t ur n s t i l e at    1.     1 heard one of the                ticket collectors shout from                          the

 d i r e c t i o n of t u r n s t i l e 4 or 5       "He's       got     no ticket".           I tu r n e d an d s%

a young        lad     in a blue       track suit, runn i n g             from that d i r e c t i o n and on
                                                                                                  PAG E   3
                                                                                                  R 134 •

seeing me a t t e m p t i n g     to run away from me.

I detained the y o u t h who was               in p o s s e s s i o n of a ticket      stub w hich he

ag r e e d was    not his and after ob t a i n i n g          his details       he was    ejected via

the N o r t h stand gate w h i c h was by this time beginning                         to be blacked

by large numb e r s          of fan'si'*'

The y outh was e j e c t e d ' a s         opposed to being a r r e s t e d or t aken to the

Police     room as! it was           becoming m u c h busier and I was a w a r e           that

numberous        other      £ans were       causing    problems     in the area of the

turnstiles        by jumping         over them or a t t e m p t i n g    to enter      two at a

time.      Mad    I t aken any other ac t i o n           it w o u l d have    left    less of a

Police     presence at         the turnstiles.            Y o u t h ejected?




It was     getting       p r o g r e s s i v e l y more and more    busier at all        the

turnstile.         I had to       intervene       several     times     between t u r nstile      1 and

6 where more        than one fan was a t t e m p t i n g        to enter thro u g h       the

t urnstiles       together.          One    fat fan,    30 years,       pushed out of

turnstile -- no ticket.                He had tried        to get     in w ith three      others who

had tickets and had entered.                    He was     ext r e m e l y drunk an d his       three

friends Were also             intoxicated.          Incidents      involved fans a t t e m p t i n g     to

pull    tickets and stubs             from the tur n s t i l e attendants.

At ar o u n d 2 . 3 0 p m    (1430)    I d e t a i n e d a further      person who      had jumped

over    the    barrier w i t h o u t a ticket?

                                                                               Due    to the    ever

growing       numbers       outside    the t u rnstiles       between     1 and      12 I took this

fan a r o u n d thro u g h     the West, stand         (then I remained at this            point)       area

behind the t u r n s t i l e s       to the    large Gate G i mmediately a l o n g s i d e         the

S o u t h stapd    road entra nce          beside     tu r n s t i l e G where he was     ejected

a l o n g wit h about        three    other    fans who     had been e s c orted to this           point
by other officers,                     1847 Bungy,        1506 M a r s h — E2,. b y            this time        it, was

approximately 2.35pm                        (1435).

As    I had a p p r o a c h e d the area behind turns t i l e s A to G at                              the      rear of

the West            stand       I o b s e r v e d about      10 persons           climbing along         t h e , t o p of

the gate            betw e e n tu r n s t i l e      16 and     turnstile A.

These       fans were             p r o g r e s s i v e l y making   their w a y t o w a r d s 1the       roofs of

t urns t i l e s A to G.                After       ejecting              I was      concerned for           the few

officers f o r k i n g at                  these    turnstiles,        a.la r g e    number       of fans who were

In an a g g r e s s i v e an d              noisy mood were          congregating ar o u n d           turnstiles A

tp G and the                fans who         had been on top of the gate                       earlier were        by

this       time on the                roof of turnstiles A to G and were                         i ncreasing       in

numbers.

The       fans on the             roof were waving what a p p e a r e d to be                     complete        tickets

with attached                stubs,         they began to jump from the turnstile                          roofs        in

 increasing            numbers.             I was    by this time            on my own.          I deci d e d     to

 remain at this                 point as       it    was a p p e a r i n g       to be    having greater          control

problems            that at t u r n s t i l e s       1 to    12 where           I had been earlier.

I was       being          approachd         by larger groups          of         fans some of w hom had

climbed         the        outer       gate and gained access                    from the      turnstile        roofs at

turnstiles A to G.

     can only          recollect'seeing               two or three           uniform officers            standing

fans     outside         the    turns t i l e s     towards the S o u t h stand            road entrance,

I was      by this         time    being      pushed       phys iCal 3 ^ back away from the                    gates

an d other        fans were a p p r o a c h i n g          pleajgM^ig that       the gates sh o u l d be

opened.         H a t ^ r e , s|ber m e n w e r M n             tears    pleading       that    children and

w omen were            being c r u s h e d    to death outside.               Some    fans who were more

have to        let them         in,     this was m e n t i o n e d by one fan a n d anot h e r with

I saw one man male,                   white,      a p p r o x i m ^ r e l y 30 years,     5 ’8 slim build,

daf-k hair,            black moustache,             th^'W^'faci.al features,            he ente r e d through

f rom chest            crush /injuries.             As    I attempted       to assist        him        I saw an   old

m an enter        thro u g h these           same    turn s t i l e s and     lean on the wall              gasping

for     air.

I offered to take                 the    injured man to a first aid                   post but        he    refused

stating        that      he w o u l d    be alri g h t a n d wa n t e d to w a t c h the match.

A number        of fans who were mill i n g a r o u n d / b e h i n d                the West       stand again

star t e d shouting at me on seeing                          theyapparently          injured s c r e a m i n g , f o r

the gates         to open.

I believe         that      it was       somVtime^/around 2 . 5 0 p m          (1450)      that         Iwas

no   radio or access                tovdne.        No    tannoy m e s s a g e s were heard but the                    t

gates mentiorted^ifove                    opiened.       I believe       that they w e r e O p e n e d by -

Police      officers w h o m             I had seen standing             near     them a short           time    before,

As s oo n as the gates                   opened a flood o f fans              came     into      the ground,

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 6 to 8 wide,            they    rushed towards me             causing me to               run

to my       left and back            towards       the main gate above.

Although        it seemed           like a long time            the gates were               only o p e n e d aJb,out

i minute        then      closed.          I a s s u m e d that all        the fans who           entered       I

w o u l d guess       100 or 20,0 perhaps                more went        in the d i r e c t i o n of the West

stand tunnel.              I do not          recall      seeing any Police            officers at the

m o u t h of the tunnel              prior       to the    gates     being opened.               I do however

recall after            the gates          had    closed     looking       towards       the     tunnel    entrance

and one       blue w o o d e n       door was        pulled     partly across a n d the other

Opened,       there were            no fans mill i n g about             or   crowded         into the m o u t h of

the tunnel.             I do not          recall whet h e r at         that     time     1 could see        the

gras s e d a r e a of the            pitch w h i c h      is n o r m a l l y v i s i b l e    from where        I was

standi ng.

A l t h o u g h most     of the          fans    entered     in. a rush,        some wa l k e d      in,   several

were o b v i o u s l y d i s t r e s s e d and a p p e a r e d       to be suffering              from breathing

difficulties.              Again         I was    sub j e c t e d to a torrent          of abuse and            pleas

to have the          gates ope n e d a g a i n by the               fans who had just               entered.

T h e y stated       that a l t h o u g h we had           let a large          number        in the     problem

was just as bad and a g a i n                    reference was made             to   it being -’Anot h e r

Hyesel      S t a d i u m outside'.

Again more sympathetic                     fans were a r g u i n g       on my behalf            that    they

s h o u l n d * t , b l a m e me.        I was a s k e d for the         name of the officer               in

charge and the             name     of my Chief Constable.                    The    fans were          extremely

d i s t r e s s e d a n d from what             I could see       I feared that              someone Would

surel y die outside.               I could see fans                 continuing        to    climb the gates -

and falling         t h r o u g h the turnstiles at A to 6 , .some in injured states.

Mentitin was made           by one of these                 fans,    of .a public          house where       fans

had been drinking            shor t l y before              the game       called The Bee Hive*                  This

public haute was l|«>t k n o w n to me                      prior    to being mention'ed by this

fan.     to date        lyrifa not know             its    location a l t h o u g h    I presumie it ffiust

be r e a s e n a b i y * n e a r the stad i u m at Hills b o r o u g h .                                            v

I was,, b u s ^ d e a l i n g wit h tHese fans and trying                      to console and appease

them, jj^heri a g a i n a b o u t 3 or 4 minu t e s                 later,    the same           gate opened

ag^n;,     and a l t h o u g h    further           fans ente r e d     it was    not       in as m a n y numbers,

 St this    point       I recall a u n iformed PC                   calling to me from the gate and

a s k i n g me to help       push the gate                 closed,    which    I did.            I have

cons idered        this matter and am unsure whet h e r                       1 a s s i s t e d this PC to

close the gate on the               first           or second occasion.

During     this     time    I was aware of two                    stewards    to my left wear i n g              the

floure s c e n t waistcoats,             one of them m e n t i o n e d to me that                   he did not

know where all            the fans w o u l d go as the West                   Stand must           be full.

Also whilst         the    crowd    entered on the first o c c a s i o n                    I believe       that       I

saw the     juvenile                 [w h o m       I had ejec t e d from the N o r t h             stand gate

at a r o u n d H p m    (1400),     he was           in the       centre    of the     crowd w ith other

youths who were            running       hard.            I formed the       i m pression that            this

g roup did not have              tickets.            A large       number    ob v i o u s l y did and on

entering         several    a t t e m p t e d to give, me their tickets                     to    remove    the

stub.      Due     to the    circu m s t a n c e s         several    injured     persons          s t aggering

ar o u n d and few o f f icers           I did not attempt                 to take     tickets        from them.

Had    I .done     so   I w o u l d most        certainly have             been pushed out of the way

by the bulk         of the       crowd and w o u l d have             impaired their              entry w h i c h

w o u l d have d e f e a t e d the object                 of the    exercise     that       is    relieving       the

After       the gates      had      closed on the second occasion                  it seemed strangely

quiet       in the v i c i n i t y of the turhstiles.               I was       relieved to find that

most    of the more a g g r e s s i v e        fans had gone and            1^ looked a r o u n d        to see

if    I could see any pf my .colleagues                    or other officers.                 T here were

few officers arourt#.                 After a bout 5 minutes             I’ saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y   10 to

15 u n i f o r m e d    constables; rUn past me from the d i r e c t i o n of the W orth

stand.        Amongst      them      I saw DC        Turner,    DC Friend, DC Tit’t e r t o n and

other officers            from my sifial             (Serial    11).     They were running            in      the

dir e c t i o n of the Po l i c e        control      room at the side of the West                    stand.

At this        time     I was    unaware, of what         the    incident was and on joining

these officers            running', towards          the Police        control     room I was         informed

that     it was a pitch             invasion.

I was       not aware      of the       time and      I did not        realise     that     the    game was

in fact        underway.         On arrival          at the side       of the West stand an

internal        dividing        gate at the          rear of    the Police room was             opened        and

we a l l had ac c e s s         to the side of the S o u t h stand.                 On e n t ering          the

f'irA% aisle           leading      onto the     pitch,    I was aware          that    no players were

      the    pitch.       I could hear         fans    state     that    the teams        had just          left

the     pitch.

On    looking ac r o s s        towards      the front of the West stand to my                      left      I

could see P o l i c e       officers         in front     of the s e c urity fencing               in the

are a    behind the        goal      post,    numerous     fans were        scaling       the     perimeter

fence and d r o p p i n g        over    onto the      pitch.      It became obvious              that       it

was     not a pitch        invasion,         people were        staggering       from the         perimeter

fence       being a s s i s t e d    by Po l i c e   officers and other            fans.        T h e y were

falling        onto the      grassed        playing are a       in the vicin i t y of the             goals.

Women,       old men,      young      children were        sitting       crying,       some     having

d i f f i c u l t y breathing.

Togt h e r w i t h my      colleagues,         I went     d i r e c t l y to the a r e a at        the      rear

could.see a number               of obv i o u s l y de#d bodies,              young w o m e n a n d mainly

teenage male         fans.         The y were        pressed firmly against               the     perimeter



obvitsusly d e a d     persons.             At this      time officiers were             climbing     the

pemmeter       fence and ass i s t i n g             in pulling bodies and               injured out.         I

i m m e d iately went to ,the open gate                       to my    l eft jand; jo i n e d a P o l i c e

Sergeant      < I. D. ???,?>„          He was a t t e m p t i n g      to pull a large uncons c i o u s

was a conscious y o u n g w o m a n w i t h                  long brown hair, slim build,

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20 to 30 years.             She was         screaming i n      pain and      trapped

by her waist         like        the u nconscious man by her side.                       She    could not be

pulled free at this                time.       I then became aware that at                     least another

S or    10 bodies were             e n m eshed and           piled up behind them d i r e c t l y          behind

the gate most were                blue and a p p e a r e d          dead.    The   crowd were       still

surging     forw a r d and despite                 s h o uting at them to move            back,     they

obviously      could not hear                from the n o i s e        being made m o s t l y      from the

rear by a n g r y and a g g r e s s i v e           fans.       I .could see DC        1177 Davis,         he was

abus i v e    remarks were            being made.

Through exhaustion                 I was     unable        to   continue         the    r e s u s c i t a t i o n and    I was

relieved by someone                 else who took over.

D u r i n g this     time      I was o b s erving a y o u n g P o l i c e w o m a n             (shoulder          length

male,     white,        E O ’s,    green T shirt            (tefinis style),            blue-jeans,           6"    tall,

slirft build.           At one      point he seemed                  to have recovered and started

breathing.           I recalll          thinking that                she was doing a great job

bringing       him around.             She had placed him on his side                           in the      recovery

position.

As a    result       of my a t t e m p t e d r e s u s c i t a t i o n       I had been         left d izzy and

a fter a few mom e n t s , I            turned to see that                  the above d e s c r i b e d       fan had

s topped      breathing again.                I then wen t            over to her and wit h her

assistance         I a g a i n turned him onto                  his    back,     cleared his a i r w a y and

t ogether we a d m i n i s t e r e d         cardiac and artificial, resuscitation..                                After

a few minutes we were                   joined by a Doc t o r and a nurse who                          took     over

w i t h the a i d of an amb u l a n c e            r e s u s c i t a t i o n mask and ox y g e n tank.

By this       time      the first        fan that          I had a t t e n d e d to on the             pitch,       the

fan w ith the moustache,                    he had been             removed by someone and                 presumably

taken to the Sp o r t s Hall                 where a m b u l a n c e s       had by then arrived.

I was also aware whilst                     r e s u scitating         the first fan that a reporter

(TV)    with a c a m e r a m a n were w a l k i n g             onto the        pitch from the d i rection

of the S o u t h stand.               The    behaviour          of    the    reporter       in particular

(male,       white,      black      hair,     ? blue        suit,      dark eyebrows,            2 5 - 3 0 years)            was

instantly offensive.                   He was      c a s ually walk i n g          past my s e l f an d other

officers and fans who wer e s t r u g g l i n g                       to    resuscitate         casualties.              He

be   looking for any or a certain senior                               police officer.

Police      officers        removed them from the                  pitch.

After     this     I looked aro u n d to see                if I could assist an y o n e              else    but4

by this tiime, e v e r y t h i n g was under                control.

dropped by one of the                  injured or dead.               He quickly        put    it in his back

pocket an d         ran back up to the                left hand side of the West                  s tand to

join other young L i v erpool                   fans.        I went after       him and a s k e d -him if

          time-on'the roof of Turnstiles. A to Q and were increasing in numbers

          The fans on the roof were waving what appeared to be complete tickets with           attached stubs

          they began to jump from the turnstile roofs in increasing numbers, 1 .was. by this time on

          control .problems, that at Turnstiles 1 to 90 where I had been earlier.

          I can only      recollect seeing two or three usiform officers standing beside the closed

          two officers , one I think w * u a Sgt m m were immediatly in front of Turnstiles A to 3,

would be allright and wanted to watch the match®

A number of fans who were milling aroung behind the West .stand again started shouting .at

me on 'seeing the apparently injured screaming for the gates to open*

I believe that it was sometime i s a r o u n d               2,50pm that I was. standing opposite

Turnstile A in Line with the Main gate/immediatltf alongside turnstile S ( Leading onto

the South stand access Sd) I was not aware of any orders or instructions as I had no radio

or access to one, no Tanoy messages were heard but the gates mentioned above opened, I

believe that they were opened by Police officers whom 1 had sees standing near them a

 short time before.

As soon as the gates opened a flood of Fans came into the groun# approximatly 6 to 8 wide

they rushed towards me causing me to run to my left and back towrds the Main Gate above.


Although it seemed like a long time the gates were only opened about 1 minute then closed,

I assumed that all the fans who entered I would guess 1°or 200 perhaps more went in the

diction of th. West stand tunnel. I do not r . « U ...ing any POlic. officer, at th. —

of the tunnel prior to the gates being opened , I do however recall after the gates had

closed looking towards the Tunnel enterance and one blue wooden door was pulled partly

ascross and the other opened, thier were no fans milling about or crowded into the mouth

of the tunnel, I do not recall whether at that time f.I could see the grassed area of the                        ,

          called th® Bee Hive, this public house was not known to me prior to being mentioned by                      k

      .   this fan, to date I do not know its location although I presume it must be reasonably

          near the stalium at Hillsborough*

          I was busy dealing with these Fans and trying to console and appease them, when again

          about, 3 or k minute later the same gate opened again, and although further fans entered.

      '' it was not in as many numbers.

          At this point I recall a uniformed P.O. calling to me from the gate and asking me to

          help push the gate closedwhich I did, I have considered this matter and am unsure whether

          I assisted this P.O. to._close the gate on the first or Second occasion.

          During this time I was ‘aware of two stewards to my left wearing the flourecent waist coats

          one of them mentioned to me that he did not know where all the fans would go as the west

          stand must be full, also whilst the crowd entered on the first occasion I believe that

          I saw the juvinilef         1whom I had ejected from the North stand gate at around 2pm,he

          was in the centre of the crowd with other youths who were running hard, I formed the .

          immpression that this guoup did not have tickets, a large number obviously did and on

          entering oseveral attempted to give me thier tickets to remove the entry stub, due to

          the circumstances several injured persons staggering around and few officers I did not

          attempt to. take tickets from them, had I done so I;.would most certainly have been pushed

          out.of the- way by the bulk of the crowd and would have Impaired thier entry which;would                        .

          and I looked around to see if I could see any of my collaages or other officers, there

          were few officers around, after about 5 minutes I saw approx 10 to 15 unifomed constables

          run past me from the direction of the North stand, amongst them I saw DC Turner, DC Friend

          DC Titterton and other officers from my serial (Serial 11) They were running in the direct:
 of the Police control room at the side of the West, stand, A         At this time I was unaware

 of what the incident was and on joining these of icers running towards the Police control

 room I was informed that it .was a pitch invasion.                   -

 I was not aware of the time and I did not realise that the game was in fact underway* ;

 on arrival at the side of the West stand an internal dividing gate at the, rear of the

 Police room was opened and we all had access to the side of the South Stand on entering

 the first ailse leading onto the pitch I was aware that no players were on the pitch, I

 could hear fans state that      the teams had just left the pitch*


 On looking accross towards      the front of the West stand to ay left X could see Police officer

 in front of the Security fencing in the area behind the Goal post, numerous fans were scalir

 the perimiter fence and dropping over onto the pitch, it became obvious that it was not a :

 pitch invasion, peaople were staggering from the perimiter fence being assisted by Police

 officers and other fans, they were falling onto the garssed playing area in th             vicinity

 of the goals, women Old men young children were sitting crying           some having difficulty

 breathing.     ■.'       . ''                                                               '

 Together with my colleaugea      I went directly to the area at the rear of the Goal posts,

 to my left a perimiter fence gate some k* wide was open, between this area and the area to 1

 the right of the Goal posts I could see a number of obviously dead bodies young women and

 mainly teenage male fanethey were pressed firmly against the perimiter fence in a standing

 position I estimated initially about 20 obviously dead persons, at this time Officers

 were climbing the perimiter fence and assisting in pulling bodies and injured out, i immedis

 attempting to.pull a large unconcious male person out of the gate, this person teas trapped

by his legs he was wearing a white/Light T Shirt, Heavy build blue $eans and short fair

hair, despite attempts he was jammed        tight, alongside hime was a concious        young8womanwith

          or so the fans were behaving hysterically, some were throwing object one of which was a coin

          which I saw strike the fencing near to the gate, this behavious seemed to cease relativley

          quickly and Officers formed a line inside and outside the Gate enterance and began to pass

          bodies through.

          A large number of injured and distressed persons outside the West stand areaon the pitch were

          being recieved and assisted by Police officers and ST John ambulanee brigade*

          I was passed the body of an unconcxous female with Long brown hair, she was not the one

          trapped at the agate, I with others( Unknowm) carried her to a streacher nearby, I believe

          that she was till alive.

          I returned and was passed an unconcious male, he was slightly blue and with others I placed

          him* in front to the     x x f il of      the goal post and immediatly began CArdiac and Artificial

          resuscitation and was quickly joined by others, one I believe a mediaal student and a younf

          female St John Ambulance first aider (approx 15yrs0) She assisted and at my request went to

          get an airway to assist me, on her return I was informed that all the Airways had gone, they

          didn’t have any more,        .      ^     ^

          f M s apparently dead fan was            Male White 30 to 35 yrs Black thinning short hair, Brown eyea,

,      5*9,f.stocky build wearing jeans, he had a thick moustache on upper lip only.

               I continued attempts to resucitate for some 15 to 20 min's

                                                                throughout this time I;was aware o p y of movements

                                          Rora« more abusive fan*
       within a close proximity, I recall some                    mwrnmrinsr and blaming
                                                             fans swearing       blamine- the Police                       '.

      '.right.;hip.whilst I was,ressueitatiag. the above fan/ I continued; what; X. was' doing-.but was aw«n

       of a fan walking away from me wearing blue j«an# and white trainers, I could not tell whether

     ■ I was kicked intentionally but it occerred whilst the abusive remarks were being made.

            Through exaustion I was unable to continue the reeusitation and I, was releived by someone

              vho took over.
 During this time/I was observing a young Police woman (Shoulder length .black hair bushy at

 bottom) She had been resucitating a youn& manMale white 20*e Breen cotton T Shirt(Tennis si

 style) Bln# jeans   6 ’ tall slim build. At one point he seemed to have recovered and stafcted

 breathing , I recall thinking   that she.was doing a great job      bringing    him around, sh

 placed him on his side   in the recovery pos ition.

texlxmgxzseiizafx As a    result of my attempted- reeucitation I had been left .dizzy and after

 a few moments I turned   to see that the above described fan had stopped breathing again,

 I then went over to her and with her assistance I again turned him onto his back , cleared

his airway and together we administered Cardiac and artificial resucitation, after a few

minutes we were joined by a Dr and    a Nurse who took over with the aid of an ambulance

resucitation mask and oxygen tank.


By this time the first Fanst that I had attended to on the Pitch the fan with the Moustache

he had been removed by someone and presumabley taken to the Sports hall where ambulances ha

by then arrive##

I was also k* aware whilst resucitating the first fan that a reporter (T.V.) with a camera

man were walking onto the pitch from the direction of the South Stand, the Rsatebehaviour of

the reporter in particular( Male White black hair, ? Blue Suit dark Eyebrowes25-30yrs)

 was instafatly offensive, he was casually walking past myself and other officers and fans

who were struggling to jnoceresucitate casualties , he was adjusting his tie a® if to

prepare to be filmed and appeared to be looking for any ar a certain senior Police officer.

As a result roars of anger could be heard from fans who were likewise angered and .-disgusted

by his behaiiour, I was aware that several Police officers removed them from the pitch.


After this I looked .around to see if I could assist anyone else but by this time everything

was under control.

1 made my way towards where the bodies had been recovered, at this time a number of liverpo<

fans were standing aroung mainly at the rear all the bodies had been removed and Police

Officers. w«r* beggining t© collect clothing and personal items dropped by the injured and

 In my opinion thier appeared fco be a lack of First aid equipment/ Airways oxygen etc,

 the atmoshere on the pitch could only be described as totally.uncontroUableChaoo due to                                                                                                                      .

 the incredable numbers of dead and injured, the situation was not helped by the continual

'.interference of Press photogrphers and Camera crew,-#*' -r>rt*


 In respect of the Perimiter fencing I had great difficuly in assisting the evacuation of :

persons from the West stand mm due to a wall_some 3* high before you reach the bottom of th

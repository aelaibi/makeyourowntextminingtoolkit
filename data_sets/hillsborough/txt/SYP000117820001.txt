                     The Court below has proceeded on the general principle that                          as this the manufacturer owes no duty to the consumer apart
                     in an ordinary case a manufacturer is under no duty to any                           from contract. Admittedly the case does not come within
                    one with whom he is not in any contractual relation, j To this                        either of the recognized exceptions to the general rule, but it
                    rule there are two well known exceptions : (1.) where the                             is sought to introduce into the law a third exception in this
                    article is dangerous per se, and (2.) where the article is                            particular case—namely, the case of goods intended for
                    dangerous to the knowledge of the manufacturer, but the                               human consumption sold to the public in a form in which
                    appellant submits that the duty owed by a manufacturer to                             investigation is impossible. The reason now put forward by
                    members of the public is not capable of so strict a limitation,                       the appellant was no part of Lord Hunter’s dissent in the
                    and that the question whether a duty arises independently of                          previous case ; nor is there any hint of any such exception in
                    contract depends upon the circumstances of each particular                            any reported case. There is here no suggestion of a trap, and
                    case. When a manufacturer puts upon a market art article                              there are no averments to support it. It is said that people
                    intended for human consumption in a form which precludes                             ought not to be allowed to put on the market food or drink
                    the possibility of an examination of the article by the! retailer                    which is deleterious, but is there any real distinction between
                    or the consumer, he is liable to the consumer for not taking                         articles of food or drink and any other article ? In Heaven v.
                    reasonable care to see that the article is not injurious to                          Pender (G) Brett M.R. states the principle of liability too widely,
                    health. In the circumstanccs of this ease the respondent owed                        and in Le Lievre v. Gould (7) that principle is to a great
                    a duty to the appellant to take care that the ginger-beer which                      extent whittled away by the Master of the Rolls himself and

                    August 2G, 1928, the appellant drank a bottle of ginger-beer,                      their ambit.
                    manufactured by the respondent, which a friend had bought                              Now the common law must be sought in law books by
                    from a retailer and given to her. The bottle contained the                         writers of authority and in judgments of the judges entrusted
                    decomposed remains of a snail which were not, and could                             with its administration. The law books give no assistance,
                    not be, detected until the greater part of the contents of the                     because the work of living authors, however deservedly
                    bottle had been consumed. As a result she alleged, and at                          eminent, cannot be used as authority, though the opinions
                    this stage her allegations must be accepted as true, that she                       they express may demand attention ; and the ancicnt books
                    suffered from shock and severe gastro-cnteritis. She accord­                        do not assist. I turn, therefore, to the decided cases to see
                    ingly instituted the proceedings against the manufacturer                           if they can be construed so as to support the appellant’s ease.
                    which have given rise to this appeal.                                               One of the earliest is the case of Langridge v. Levy. (1) It
                       The foundation of her case is that the respondent, as the                        is a case often quoted and variously explained. There a
                    manufacturer of an article intended for consumption and                             man sold a gun which he knew was dangerous for the use of
                    contained in a receptacle which prevented inspection, owed                          the purchaser’s son. The gun exploded in the son’s hands,
                    a duty to her as consumer of the article to take care that                          and he was held to have a right of action in tort against the
                    there was no noxious element in the goods,' that he                                 gunmaker. How far it is from the present case can be seen
                    ncglected such duty and is consequently liable \ for any                            from the judgment of Parke B., who, in delivering the judg­
                    damage causcd by such neglect. After certain amendments,                            ment of the Court, used these words: “ We should pause
                    which are now immaterial, the case came before jthe Lord                            before we made a precedent by our decision which would be
                    Ordinary, who rejected the plea in law of the respondent                            an authority for an action against the vendors, even of such
                    and allowed a proof.        His interlocutor was recalled by                        instruments and articles as arc dangerous in themselves, at
                    the Sccond Division of the Court of Session, from whoso                             the suit of any person whomsoever into whoso hands they
                    judgment this appeal has been brought.               ;                              might happen to pass, and who should be injured thereby " ;
                       Before examining the merits two comments are desirable :                         and in Longmeid v. Holliday (2) the same eminent judge j
                    (1.) That the appellant’s case rests solely on the ground of a                      points out that the earlier case was based on a fraudulent//
                    tort based not on fraud but on ncgligence ; andl (2.) that                          misstatement, and he expressly repudiates the view that/(
                    throughout the appeal the case has been argued on j the basis,                      it has any wider application. The case of Langridge v.
                    undisputed by the Second Division and never questioned by                           Levy (1), therefore, can be dismissed from consideration

                      cither in tort or arising out of contract. This case seems to me             The general principle of these eases is stated by Lord
                      to show that the manufacturer of any article is not liable to a           Sumner in the case of Blacker v. Lake <Ss Elliot, Ld. ( 1 ), in these
                      third party injured by negligent construction, for there can be           terms : “ The breach of the defendant’s contract with A. to

                      said (2): “ The only safe rule is to coniine the right to recover         B. when he is injured by reason of the article proving to be
                      to those who enter into the contract; if we go one step beyond            defective.”
                      that, there is no reason why we should not go fifty.” j                      From this general rule there are two well known
                          Longmeid v. Holliday (3) was the case of a defective lamp             exceptions : (1.) In the case of an article dangerous in itself;

                       in the ordinary intercourse of life between one individual                there is, in the words of Lord Dunedin, “ a peculiar duty to
                       and another, that, if a machine not in its nature dangerous,              take precaution imposed upon those who send forth or install

                       care, should be lent or given by one person, even by the person           Co., Ld. v. Collins & Perkins. (3) And as to (2.), this depends !l
                       who manufactured it, to another, the former should be answer-             on the fact that the knowledge of the danger crcatcs the obli­

                       use of it.” It is true that he uses the words “ lent or given ”           In this case no one can suggest that ginger-bcer was an article
                       and omits the word “ sold,” but if the duty be entirely inde­             dangerous in itself, and the words of Lord Dunedin show

H . L . (S o .)      In this way it can be ascertained at anyw time whether the               as lai^^ ow n by Lord Esher (then Brett M.R.) when it is H . L. (So.)
      1032           law recognizes a duty, but only where the case can be referred           limited by the notion of proximity introduced by Lord Esher         1932

  LordTtkin. cases where liability is established must logically be based                     circumstances, one man may owe a duty to another, even Lord Atkin,
                     upon some element common to the cases where it is found                  though there is no contract between them. If one man is
                      to exist. To seek a complete logical definition of the general          near to another, or is near to the property of another, a duty
                      principle is probably to go beyond the function of the judge,           lies upon him not to do that which may cause a personal
                      for the more general the definition the more likely it is to            injury to that other, or may injure his property.” So
                      omit essentials or to introduce non-essentials. The attempt             A. L. Smith L.J. : “ The decision of Heaven v. Pender (2)
                      was made by Brett M.R. in Heaven v. Pender (1), in a,definition          was founded upon the principle, that a duty to take due
                      to which I will later refer. As framed, it was demonstrably              care did arise when the person or property of one was in such
                     itoo wide, though it appears to me, if properly limited, to be           proximity to the person or property of another that, if due
                    i capable of affording a valuable practical guide.          j             care was not taken, damage might be done by the one to the
                         A t present I content myself with pointing out that in                other.” I think that this sufficiently states the truth if
                       English law there must be, and is, some general conception             proximity be not confined to mere physical proximity, but
                       of relations giving rise to a duty of care, of which the ^particular    be used, as I think it was intended, to extend to such close
                       cases found in the books are but instances. Thp liability               and direct relations that the act complained of directly
                       for negligence, whether you style it such or treat it as in other       affects a person whom the person alleged to be bound to take
                       systems as a species of “ culpa,” is no doubt based upon a              care would know would be directly affected by his careless
                       general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which                  act. That this is the sense in which nearness of “ proximity”
                       the offender must pay. But acts or omissions which any                  was intended by Lord Esher is obvious from his own
                       moral code would censure cannot in a practical j world be              illustration in Heaven v. Pender (3) of the application of

                    to tho fact that Lord Esher emphasizes the necessity of                      which might well be the case in the purchase of some articles
                    goods having to be " used immediately ” and “ used at once                   of food or drink, no warranty protecting even the purchascr-

                    obviously to exclude the possibility of goods having their                   food and drink where goods are sold intended to be used

                    expresses the law of England ; without the qualification,                    should be a harmless proprietary mcdicinc, an ointment,

                    were justified in thinking the principle was expressed in                    to articles of common household use, where every one,
                    too general terms. There will no doubt arise cases where                     including the manufacturer, knows that the                articleswill
                    it will be difficult to determine whether the contemplated                   be used by other persons than the actual ultimate purchaser—
                    relationship is so close that the duty arises. But in the class              namely, by members of his family and his servants, and in
                    of case now before the Court I cannot conceive any difficulty                some eases his guests. I do not think so ill of our jurisprudence
                    to arise. A manufacturer puts up an article of food in a                     as to suppose that its principles are so remote from the
                    container which he knows will be opened by the actual                        ordinary needs of civilized society and the ordinary claims
                    consumer. There can be no inspection by any Ipurchaser                       it makes upon its members as to deny a legal remedy where
                    and no reasonable preliminary inspection by the consumer.                    there is so obviously a social wrong.
                    Negligently, in the course of preparation, he allows the                        It will be found, I think, on examination that there is no
                    contents to be mixed with poison. I t is said that the law                   case in which the circumstances have been such as I have
                    of England and Scotland is that the poisoned consumer has                    just suggested where the liability has been negatived. There
                    no remedy against the negligent manufacturer. I f this were                  are numerous eases, where the relations were much more
                    the result of the authorities,^1 should consider the result a                remote, where the duty has been held not to exist. There are
                    grave defect in the law, and so contrary to principle that                   also dicta in such cases which go further than was nccdssary
                    I should hesitate long before following any decision to that                 for the determination of the particular issues, which have
                    effect which had not the authority of this House. | I would                  caused the difficulty experienced by the Courts below.
                    point out that, in the assumed state of the authorities, not                 I venture to say that in the branch of the law which deals

                     in considering reported cases in the law of torts that the        for is also supported by Hawkins v. Smith (3), where a dock

                       In my opinion several decided cases support the view             the defendant, who knew the use to which it was to be put,
                     that in such a case as the present the manufacturer owes          and had been provided by the consignees for tho use of the
                     a duty to the consumer to be careful. A direct authority          dock comp€any, who had been employed by them to unload

                    to sell a hairwash made by liimself, and that the plaintiff         negligence. Similarly, in Elliott v. Hall (4), the defendants,
                    Joseph George bought a bottle, to be used by his wife, the         colliery owners, consigned coal to the plaintiff's employers,
                    plaintiff Emma George, as the defendant then knew, and              coal merchants, in a truck hired by the defendants from a
                    that the defendant had so negligently conducted jhimself in         wagon company. The plaintiff was injured in the course of
                    preparing and selling the hairwash that it was unfit for use,       unloading the coal by reason of the defective condition of
                     whereby the female plaintiff was injured. Kelly C.B. said          the truck, and was held by a Divisional Court, Grove and
                     that there was no question of warranty, but whether the            A. L. Smith JJ., entitled to recover on the ground of the
                    chcmist was liable in an action on the case for unskilfulness       defendants’ breach of duty to see that the truck was not in
                    and negligence in the manufacture of it. “ Unquestionably           a dangerous condition. It is to be noticed that in neither case
                    there was such a duty towards the purchaser, and it extends,        was the defective chattel in the defendants’ occupation,
                    in my judgment, to the person for whose use the vendor              possession or control, or on their premises, while in the latter
                   knew the compound was purchased.” Pigott and Cleasby BB.             ease it was not even their property. I t is sometimes said
                   put their judgments on the same ground. I venture to think           that the liability in these cases depends upon an invitation
                   that Cotton L.J., in Heaven v. Pender {2), misinterprets             by the defondant to the plaintiff to use his chattel. I do not
                   Cleasby B .’s judgment in the reference to Langridge v.              find the decisions expressed to be based upon this ground,
                   Levy. (3) Cleasby B. appears to -me to make it jplain that            but rather upon the knowledge that the plaintiff in the
                   in his opinion the duty to take reasonable care can be                course of the contemplated use of tho chattel would use i t ;

               was based upon the fact that the direct relations established,      at his lodgings and sent his servant, a mulatto girl aged

          constructed tho bridge that the plaintiff, a passenger of the           Bayley J., the former remarking that it was incumbent on

                    allegation of fraud ; they were not satisfied that the defendant             innocent machine is “ lent or given.” Then the dictum is
                    knew of the | defects. The plaintiff Frederick ta d already                  confined to machines “ lent or given ” (a later sentence

                    implied warranty of fitness. The declaration made no                         words and “ delivered to the purchaser under the contract of
                    averment of negligence. Verdict was entered at the trial                     sale ”), and the manufacturer is introduced for the first time,
                    by Martin B. for the plaintiff, but with liberty to the defendant            “ even by the person who manufactured it.” I do not for a
                    to move to enter the verdict for him. A rule having been                     moment believe that Parke B. had in his mind such a case
                    obtained, plaintiff’s counsel sought to support !the verdict                 as a loaf negligently mixed with poison by the baker which
                    on the ground that this was not an action for a breach of                    poisoned a purchaser’s family. He is, in my opinion, confining

                    from conduct amounting to fraud. Parke B., who delivered                     rely upon a duty of care which arises out of a contract with
                    the judgment of the Court, held that, fraud Having been                      a third party, and has never even discussed the case of a

                    He then went on to discuss cases in which a third person not                 and selling it in that condition whether with immediate or
                    a party to a contract may sue for damages sustained if it is                 mediate effect upon the consumer. It is noteworthy that

                    of a carrier, or of a firm in breach of contract committing                  known to the law, where the special relations thereby created
                   a nuisance on a highway, he deals with the case where                         have a particular bearing on the existence or non-existence
                   any one delivers to another without notice an Iinstrument                     of a duty to take care. Next in this chain of authority come

               I this case has to do with contract it is difficult to see. He                     The plaintiff sued in the county court for personal injuries due
                   then goes on : “ B u t it would be going much tooj far to say                  to the negligence of the defendant. The plaintiff was a driver
                   th a t so m uch care is required in the ordinary ^intercourse                 in the emplojr of a firm who owned vans. The defendant, a

                   not in its nature dangerous—a carriage for instance—but                        their vans in good and substantial repair. Tho allegation of
                   which m ight become so by a latent defect entirely unknown                    negligence was that the defendant’s servant had negligently

                     arise only from a breach of contract; for, as has been pointed                        lamp which he had bought from a shopkeeper who had                —
                     out, that was the only allegation in Winterbottom v. Wright ( 1)                      bought it from tho manufacturer, the defendant. The
                     negligence apart from contract being neither averred nor                             plaintiff had used tho lamp for twelve months before the
                     proved. It is true that he cites with approval the dicta of                          accident. The case was tried in the county court before
                     Lord Abinger in that case ; but obviously I think his approval                       that excellent lawyer the late Sir Howland Roberts. That
                     must be limited to those dicta so far as they related to the                         learned judge had directed the jury that the plaintiff could ;
                    particular facts before the Court of Appeal, and to cases                             succeed if the defendants had put upon tho market a lamp j
                    where, as Lord Abinger says, the law permits a icontract to                           not fit for use in the sense that a person working it with
                    be turned into a tort. Stirling L.J., it is true, said that to                        reasonable care would incur a risk which a properly con-1
                    succeed the plaintiff must bring his case within the ^proposition                    structed lamp would not impose upon him. The jury found
                    of the majority in Heaven v. Pender (2), that any one who,                           that the lamp was defective by reason of an improper system
                    without due warning, supplies to others for use an ‘instrument                       of making an essential joint between the container and the

                    danger is liable for injury. I venture to think that the Lord                        dangerous, but ought as reasonable men to have known it.
                   Justice is mistakenly treating a proposition which applies one                        Hamilton J. seems to have thought that there was no
                   test of a duty as though it afforded the only criterion.                              evidence of negligence in this respect. Lush J. expressly
                      Mathew L.J. appears to me to put the case on; its proper                           says so and implies— " I also think ’’—that Hamilton J. so
                   footing when he says (3) tho argument of the plaintiff                                thought. If so, the case resolves itself into a series of
                   was that tho defendant’s servants had been negligent in                               important dicta. Hamilton J. says (1) that it has been
                   the performance of the contract with the owners of the van,                           decided in authorities from Winterbottom v. Wright (2) to
                  and that it followed as a matter of law that any one in this                          Earl v. Lubbock (3) that the breach of the defendants’ contract
                  employment had a cause of action against the clefendant.                               with A., to uso care and skill in and about the manufacture
                     It is impossible to accept such a wideproposition, and,                             or repair of an article, does not itself give any cause of action
                  indeed, it is difficult to see how, if it were the Jaw, trade                         to B. when injured by the article proving to be defective in
                 could bo carricd on.” I entirely'agree. I have no doubt                                breach of that contract. He then goes on to say, how is the
                 that in that case the plaintiff failed to show that the repairer                       case of the plaintiffs any better when there is no contract
                 owed any duty to him. Tho question of law in ithat case                                proved of which there could be a breach. I think, with
                 seems very different from that raided in the present case.                             respect, that this saying does not give sufficient weight to
                 Tho case of Blacker v. Lake & E\|liot, Ld. (4), approaches                             the actual issues raised by the pleadings on which alone

                      alleged. Hamilton J. recognizes that George v. Skivington (2)            to have been negligent in not taking proper means to discover
                      was a decision which, if it remained an authority, bound                  whether the bottle was defective or not. IJorridgo J. found
                      him. Ho sa3's that, without presuming to say it was wrong,               that a bottle of ginger-beer was not dangerous in itself, but
                      ho cannot follow it, because it is in conflict with                      this defective bottle was in fact dangerous ; but, as the
                      Winterbottom v. Wright. (3) I find this very difficult to                defendants did not know that it was dangerous, they were
                      understand, for George v. Skivington {2) was based upon a                not liable, though by the exercise of reasonable care they
                      duty in the manufacturer to take care independently of                   could have discovered the defect. This case differs from the
                     contract, while Winterbottom v. Wright (3) was1 decided on                present only by reason of the fact that it was not the manu­
                     demurrer in a case where the alleged duty was based solely                facturers of the ginger-beer who caused tho defect in tho
                     on breach of a contractual duty to keep in repair, and no                 bottle; but, on the assumption that tho jury were right in
                     ncghgence was alleged. Lush J. says in terms that there                   finding a lack of reasonable care in not examining the bottle,
                     are only three classes of cases in which a stranger to a                  I should have come to the conclusion that, as the manu­
                     contract can sue for injury by a defective chattel { one is that          facturers must have contemplated the bottle being handled
                     of fraud; the second of articles dangerous or noxious in them­            immediately by the consumer, they owed a duty to him to
                     selves, where the duty is only to warn ; the third of public              take care that he should not be injured externally by explo­
                     nuisance. He does not bring the cases represented by                      sion, just as I think they owed a duty to him to take care
                     Elliott v. Hall (4) (the defective coal wagon) within his classes         that he should not be injured internally by poison or other
                     at all. He says they belong to a totally different class,                noxious tiling. I do not find it necessary to discuss at length
                       where the control of premises or the management of a                   the cases dealing with duties wlicro the thing is dangerous,
                     dangerous thing upon premises creates a duty.” I have                    or, in the narrower category, belongs to a class of things
                     already pointed out that this distinction is unfounded in                which are dangerous in themselves. I regard the distinction
                     fact, for in Elliott v. Ilall (4), as in Hawkins y. Smith (5)            as an unnatural one so far as it is used to serve as a logical
                     (the defective sack), the defendant exercised no control over            differentiation by which to distinguish the existence or non­

                  Dixon v. Bell (1) is the starting-point. There a maid-servant                           the contract of sale between the vendor and the purchaser ;
                  was sent to fetch a gnn from a neighbour’s house; oil                                   and the plaintiff, the purchaser’s wife, was not seeking to

                  gun went off and injured the child.             The owner of                            tion, as the Chief Baron stated it, was “ whether the

                  was drawn before he entrusted the gun to the maid­                                      was bought, is liable in an action on the case for unskilfulness

                  the gun, had made it capable of doing mischief, to                                      who used it was injured.” And this question the Court
                  render it safe and innoxious.” This case, in my opinion,                                unanimously answered in the affirmative. I may mention
                  merely illustrates the high degree of care, amounting in                                in passing that Lord Atkinson in this House, speaking of that
                  effect to insurance against risk, which the law extracts from                           case and of Langridge, v. Levy (4), observed t h a t : “ In both
                  those who take the responsibility of giving out such danger­                           these latter cases the defendant represented that the article

                  relevance, is favourable to the appellant, who submits that                            contemplated that it should be used and the party
                  human drink rendered poisonous by careless preparation may                             injured was ignorant of its unfitness for these purposes” :

                  and known to the vendor to be defective. The purchaser’s                               by Hamilton J., as he then was, in Blacker v. Lake

                  of the gun causing it to explode. The ground of the decision                           ruled. I am not sure that it has been so severely handled
                  seems to have been that there was a false representation by                            as that. At any rate I do not think that it deserved to
                  the vendor that the gun was safe, and the representation                               be, and certainly, so far as I am aware, it has never been

                    their being used by another person under such circumstances              too remote, and the practical consequences of affirming
                    that everyone of ordinary sense would, if he thought, recognize          liability in such a case were considered to be such as would
                    at once that, unless he used ordinary care and skill with                render it difficult to carry on a trade at all. “ No prudent

            that party, and that the circumstances are such as to cast

                 wrongful act causing injury to a wife might be actionable fit the             respect of which the action is brought. The emphasis is on
                 suit of her husband who would have to allege ft wrongful act                  society and comfort. The rights of the spouses in consortium are
                 towards her, causing her injury, per quod he himself suffered                  mutual, separate and similar. There is no authority for saying
                 damage. The action was sufficiently flexible to cover any damage               that the rights of the husband and wife respectively are different
                  to the husband and there is no trace of any attempt to confine                in kind. Their relation is mutual and not a matter of “ services ”

                 also cases with an allegation of loss of consortium with no allega­             following propositions are relied on: (1) The only duty owed by
                 tion of carrying away: Guy v. IJvcsey,38 where the allegation                   an invitor is to take reasonable care not to injure the invitee or
                  was of a loss of consortium for three days. See also Comyns’                   damage any property which may be brought onto the invitor’s
                 Digest (1772 ed.), vol. 1, p. 576. Jn Stone v. Jackson*a there                  premises; from early times, however, a person in the potestas
                 was no suggestion of separation of the wife from the husband : see              of another was deemed to be in an analogous position to that of
                  also Masper v. Brown. " Loss of consortium does not necessarily                the other person's property. Query, whether since the Married
                 import total loss. Wrongful interference with consortium includes               Women’s Property Act, 1882, a husband has any right of action
                 partial loss. The development of the enticement action in practice              “ per quod servitium amisit.” If one takes away the husband’s
                 took the place of the “ carrying away ” action.                                 potestas one does not give the wife a cause of action, though one
                      The three declarations “ abduxit,” “ per quod negotia . . .                may take away the husband’s. (2) Where loss of consortium is

work, from swelling of the ankles, knees and fingers particularly after a
heavy work.
     This disease can be very serious. It can be, and has been in some cases,
fatal. Fortunately, the plaintiff has not suffered any of the more serious
sequelae of this disease, and Dr. G. H. Hall, in his second report of Marc
10,1969, concludes in these words:
       “ As regards prognosis, I expect continued gradual improvement and B
       return to normal health and life expectancy. There is no reason to
       suspect that any permanent damage has been done to his liver or
       kidneys.”
      Mr. Wien, for the plaintiff, has submitted that in order to succeed in
 this case he must establish: (1) that at the material time there was a serious
 or substantial infestation of rats on the farm; (2) that it was reasonably c
 foreseeable by the defendants that the plaintiff would be exposed to the
 risk of disease if the rats were not controlled; (3) that the defendants were
 CTuilty of breach of their duty to take reasonable care to control the rat
 population on the farm; (4) that the plaintiff contracted the disease from
 and in the course of his employment.
      With regard to the second submission, Mr. Stocker for the defendants
  does not accept that foreseeability of any disease is the correct criterion, U
  and I will return to this issue in due course.
      It would be convenient, before considering the other facts, to examine
  the disease itself, as I have had the advantage of hearing the evidence ot
  Dr. James Maxwell Alston, one of the few acknowledged authorities on this
  disease. The defendants do not dispute that in March, 1967, the
  became infected with Weil’s disease, and they accept that it would be E
  proper for me to find on the balance of probabilities that he contracted
  the disease in consequence of his employment on the farm.
       Dr. Alston has made a special study of Weil’s disease or leptospirosis
  for the last 35 years. It is now known that the leptospires are present in
   about 40 to 50 per cent, of the rats in this country, and that the leptospires
   are passed from the kidney to the urine of the rat, and remain active in the
   urine for two or three days if they remain in wet or damp conditions. Rats
   infect each other and so perpetuate the disease. Human beings contract e
   disease through contact with the rodent urine and contamination of the
   skin, especially if the skin is cut, eroded or sodden with water. The
   incidence of the disease in human beings is rare in spite of the prevalence
   of the leptospires in rats because of the very slight susceptibility of human
   beings to the disease. The risk is very low indeed.                             <
       At p 78 of the text book on leptospirosis [Leptospirosis in Man and
    Animals. Livingstone (1958)] by Dr. Alston and Dr. J. C..Broom, a schedule
    of statistics shows that in the 16 years from 1933 to 1948 there were 983
    cases in all in the British Isles, an average of 61'4 per annum. Of these, 21b
    were fish workers, 139 coal miners, 79 sewer workers, 45 farm workers and
    48 were persons bathing or paddling, including seven cases of involuntary
    immersion. After a slight annual rise between 1951 and 1954 there was H
   a steady annual fall between 1955 and 1967, from 99 to eight. In 1966
   there were 24 reported cases, in 1967 there were eight and in 1968 there
   were seven up to September. The world figures show that the highest pro­
   portion of cases occur amongst agricultural workers who are likely to be
   infected when harvesting grain, vegetables or sugar cane or_ transplanting
  ’rice, and so working in wet conditions; but in Great Britain, there is a
   hieher proportion amongst fish workers and sewer workers than amongst

when a prudent and experienced farmer, once the facts had come to his A
knowledge would call in the rodent officer or a contractor, and arrange for
an intensive attack upon the rats. He would, however, take that course
with a view to protecting his milk supply, preventing the contamination ot
foodstuffs preserving his animal feed and generally improving cleanliness.
He would not have in mind the safety of his farm staff m the performance
of their work as his servants as there was no reason for him to suppose ^
that they were in any danger in their daily work.
     Moreover, I am not satisfied that in March, 1967, the defendants knew
 or ought reasonably to have known: (1) that the rat population had
 reached the proportions which the evidence before me establishes or
 (2) that any more precautions were required than those which they applied
 as a matter of routine. Had they known that the infestation of rats was
 increasing, they would, in my view, have taken the action         which they took c
 in 1965, when they became aware of the infestation in the poultry deep

llttei mustnext consider the time and place of the plaintiff’s infection. No
attempt has been made or could be made to prove or suggest when the
plaintiff came into contact with rat unne. Two places of infection are
 suggested; the milking parlour and the stack where the plaintiff man- ^
handled hav; it would perhaps be more accurate to say any place where^he
handled bales of hay which came from the stack. In the milking parlo
the plaintiff obtained water from the 40 gallon water trough and used n for
 washing round the parlour morning and evening. He also washed his
 hands in the trough. When the cows required an udder wash he used
disinfectant and water from the trough. That the plaintiff came into regular
 contact with water in or from the trough is certain, but in D r Alston^s E
 opinion, if any rat urine reached the water, it would be so diluted as
 virtually to remove any chance of infection. A more likely source o
 infection in Dr. Alston’s opinion, therefore, is any damp hay which the
 plaintiff may have handled. The plaintiff himself said that in the early
 stages he thought that he got the disease from the hay, and in evidence he
 attached some importance to the contammated hay which he spread on the
 fields some time before his illness. F ro m the plaintiffs point of view, one F
 difficulty about attributing the infection to the hay is that no rat proofing
 can keep rats out of hay, and emphasis was later put upon the milkinc
  oarlour as the place of infection.                           ,  .     ,
      It is quite impossible to find on the balance of probabilities when or
  where the plaintiff became infected. To say that the hay stack is more
  probable than the milking parlour does not mean that the stack can be G
  accepted as the probable source. I feel able on the evidence to find that
  on the balance of probabilities the plaintiff became infected on the farm,
  but anv greater precision would not be justified.                          _
      The employer’s duty to his servants is to take reasonable care for their
  safety and this safety extends to the safety of the premises and the plant,
  and to the method and conduct of the work, but is not restricted to those
  matters. Put in slightly different words, their duty is to take reasonable H
  steps to avoid exposing the plaintiff to a reasonably foreseeable risk of
  injury. It follows from the contents of this judgment that in my opinion the
  defendants were not in breach of any duty of care to the plaintiff, nor
  was his disease attributable to any such breach. I t contrary to my view
  it should be held that the defendants were in breach of dut> in that th y

A. general hazard involving personal injury, illness or disease in consequence
   of the infestation, the defendants, as I think, are still immune from liability
   on the grounds that Weil’s disease was at best a remote possibility which
   they could not reasonably foresee, and that the damage suffered by the
   plaintiff was, therefore, unforeseeable and too remote to be recoverable,
       I do not accept Mr. Wien’s contention that it is sufficient to show that
   the plaintiff was exposed generally to the risk of disease because of the
® possible contamination of animal feed or of milk at the farm or the
   possibility of the plaintiff being bitten, itself, in my view, an unlikely event.
   Weil’s disease is not comparable to the other human disabilities which
   may flow from an infestation of rats. One must not overlook the fact that,
   if the defendants had to take effective precautions against Weil’s disease, it
   would not be sufficient merely to keep the rat population in check by
q poisoning, trapping, hunting and so forth. A rat population of varying size
   would still remain on the farm as it does on all farms. It would be neces­
   sary to introduce protective clothing for the hands and arms, some check
   upon cuts and abrasions and a system of washing facilities and hygiene
  ^which, in my view, would be out of all proportion in cost and effort to the
 ^ K k which had to be countered.
       There is ample authority for the principles of law applied in this
D judgment. In Hughes v. Lord Advocate [1963] A.C. 837, Lord Reid said,
   at p. 845:
         “ But a defender is liable, although the damage may be a good deal
        greater in extent than was foreseeable. He can only escape liability if
        the damage can be regarded as differing in kind from what was
        foreseeable.”
E
       In Overseas Tankship (U.K.) Ltd. v. Miller Steamship Co. Pty. [1967]
   1 A.C. 617 (The Wagon Mound No. 2), the facts of which are too well
   known to require repetition here, Lord Reid said, at p. 636:
          “ It has now been established by The Wagon Mound (No. 1) [1961]
          A.C. 388 and by Hughes v. Lord Advocate [1963] A.C. 837 that in
P         such cases damages can only be recovered if the injury complained of
          was not only caused by the alleged negligence but was also an injury
          of a class or character foreseeable as a possible result of it.”
       The kind of damage suffered here was a disease contracted by contact
   with rats’ urine. This, in my view, was entirely different in kind from the
  ^Eect of a rat bite, or food poisoning by the consumption of food or drink
( ^Jptaminated by rats. I do not accept that all illness or infection arising
   rrom an infestation of rats should be regarded as of the same kind. One
   cannot say in this case as was said by Lord Reid in Hughes case [1963]
   A.C. 837 at p. 845 “ if they [the defendants] had done as they ought to
   have done this accident would not have happened.”
       It may be that it is less satisfactory in this case to ask the question
   whether the infection is different in kind from other sequelae of rat in-
" festation which might be foreseeable, as that leads to disputation about
   what is meant by difference in kind, than to ask the direct question
   whether on the facts of this case the leptospirosis was reasonably foresee­
   able by the defendants. In my opinion, one has only to ask that question
   and the answer is inescapably “ No.” If one is minded to pursue the
   question whether leptospirosis is different in kind, it is helpful to compare

lip by a piece of molten metal which caused a burn, and the bum was
the promoting agent of cancer. Lord Parker C.J. said, at p. 415:
     “ In those circumstances, it seems to me that this is plainly a case
     which comes within the old principle. The test is not whether these
     employers could reasonably have foreseen that a burn would cause
     cancer and that he would die. The question is whether these
     employers could reasonably foresee the type of injury he suffered,
     namely, the bum. What, in the particular case, is the amount of
     damage which he suffers as a result of that bum, depends upon the
     characteristics and constitution of the victim.”
In Bradford v. Robinson Rentals Ltd. [1967] 1 W.L.R. 337, the plaintiff,
a mobile radio and television service engineer, was to the knowledge of
the defendants exposed to prolonged periods of extreme cold and con­
siderable fatigue, in consequence of which he suffered permanent damage
to his hands and feet from cold injury, commonly known as frostbite, an
admittedly unusual condition in this country. The plaintiff recovered
damages, and in the course of his judgment Rees J. said, at p. 344:
     “ It was strongly argued on behalf of the defendants that injury to
     his health suffered by the plaintiff in this case by ‘ frost-bite ’ or cold
     injury was not reasonably foreseeable. There was no evidence that
     before the plaintiff started the journey either the plaintiff himself or
     the defendants’ servants, the Exeter branch manager or the senior
     engineer, actually contemplated that the plaintiff might suffer from
     ‘ frost-bite ’ if he were required to carry out the journey. I am, how­
     ever, satisfied that any reasonable employer in possession of all the
     facts known to the branch manager and senior engineer cm January 8
     would have realised—and they must have realised—that if the plaintiff
     was required to carry out the journey he would certainly be subjected
     to a real risk of some injury to his health arising from prolonged
     exposure to an exceptional degree of cold.
          No doubt the kinds of injury to health due to prolonged exposure
     to an exceptional degree of cold are commonly thought to include, for
     example, that the victim might suffer from a common cold or in a
     severe case from pneumonia, or that he might suffer from chilblains
      on his hands and feet. The question I have to consider is whether
      the plaintiff has established that the injury to his health by ‘ frost-bite ’
      (and I use the lay term for convenience), which is admittedly unusual
      in this country, is nevertheless of the type and kind of injury which
      was reasonably foreseeable.”
 Continuing, Rees J. said, at p. 346:
     “ In all these circumstances I hold that the defendants did, by sending
     the plaintiff out on this journey, expose him to a reasonably fore­
     seeable risk of injury arising from exposure to severe cold and fatigue.
     That breach of duty caused the plaintiff to suffer from ‘ frost-bite ’ or
     cold injury with serious consequences. Even if there had been—
     and there is not—evidence that the plaintiff was abnormally susceptible
     to ‘ frost-bite ’ as opposed to the more common sequels of prolonged
     exposure to severe cold and fatigue, he would be entitled to succeed
     on the footing that a tortfeasor must take his victim as he finds him
     (see Smith v. Leech Brain & Co. Ltd. [1962] 2 Q.B. 405).”
       The distinction between those two cases and the present case is crystal

  clear. There the risk of injury from a bum in the first case and from
  extreme cold in the second was foreseeable, and it was only the degree of
  injury or the development of the sequelae which was not foreseeable. In
  this case the risk of the initial infection of the plaintiff was, in my view,
  not reasonably foreseeable. Further support can be obtained from

B C.A. is the only action relating to Weil’s disease which has been traced or
  brought to my attention. The court, overruling the trial judge, found that
  there was no serious infestation of rats and no negligence, and, therefore,
  some of the issues which have formed an important part of this case did
  not require close consideration. In the course of his judgment Ormerod
  L.J. said:
       “ In these works there was no sign that there were any more than
       the very few rats which would be seen from time to time in any
       works.”
    le relevance of that case in the present proceedings is that it emphasises
  the fact that a workman is exposed to the remote risk of contracting Weil’s
  disease if he works in a place to which rats find their way, whether the rat
D population is substantial or otherwise.
      For these reasons the plaintiff’s claim fails, and there will be judgment
  for the defendants with costs.

plaintiffs, as owners who were the intended occupiers of jthe house, were

persons injury to whose safety or health might necessarily be expected
to occur if the foundations of the house were inadequate. There can be
no doubt that, under the ratio decidendi of Anns, a remedy against the
local authority would have been available to any subsequent occupier
who had purchased the house. The plaintiffs were in breach of certain
material provisions of the relevant byelaws dealing with the adequacy of
foundations, but the fact remains that plans showing the intended
foundations had been submitted with their authority i and had been

     it is not easy to see a distinction in principle merely because the n u m b er

     steel coils to be shipped in Korea c. and f., free out, Immineham
     The price was payable by a 180-day bill of exchange to be
     endorsed by the buyers’ bank in exchange for a bill of lading The
     buyers had intended to resell the steel before the bill of lading
     was tendered but were unable to effect a sale and their bank
     declined to back the bill. Meetings took place between
     representatives of the buyers and sellers to try to resolve the
     problem. The bill of lading was sent by the sellers to the buyers
     and by an exchange of letters it was agreed that the goods were to
     be at the disposal of the sellers until further notice and that sales
    by the buyers were to be notified to the sellers. Subsequently the
    buyers forwarded the bill of lading with other documents to agents
    at Immmgham instructing them to clear the goods through customs
    on their arrival and to place them into a warehouse to the sole
    order of the sellers stating that the buyers would accept liability
    for the duty acting as the sellers’ agents.
          The goods had been loaded "on the defendant shipowners’
    vessel, The A hakm on, which was on time charter, the time
    charterers being responsible for the stowage of the cargo with a
   power reserved to the master to intervene in the stowage. Owin^
   to bad stowage damage was caused to the goods. The buyers
   brought an action claiming against the shipowners damages for
   breach of contract and/or duty in respect of the loss suffered as a
   result of the damage to the goods. Staughton J. held that the
   shipowners were liable to the buyers in contract on the ground
   that the sellers’ rights of suit had passed to the buyers under
   section 1 of the Bills of Lading Act 1855 and therefore the claim
   m tort did not arise. On appeal by the shipowners, and the buyers
   claiming by respondents’ notice that they were entitled to sue the
  shipowners in tort for the damage caused by the bad stowage the
  Court of Appeal allowed the appeal holding that the buyers’had
  no right m the circumstances to sue the shipowners.
         On appeal by the buyers on their claim that there existed a
  duty of care which was broken by the shipowners:—
      'field, dismissing the appeal,'that it was a long established
  principle that, for a plaintiff to have a right to claim in
  negligence for loss caused to him by reason of loss of or damage
  to property, he had to have had either the legal ownership or a

 Sir John D on ald so n M .R . said in the present c a J ^ 9 8 5 ] Q . B . 350, 368:
                                                                                              s e c i ^ l t o them selves the benefit o f such a rem edy.
       “ I have, o f course, considered w heth er any duty o f care o w e d in                     A s l indicated earlier, under the usual c.i.f. or c. and f. contract the bill
       tort to the buyer could in so m e way be equated to the contractual                   o f lading issued in respect o f the good s is endorsed and delivered by the
       duty o f care ow ed to the shipper, but I do not see how this could be                seller to the buyer against payment by the buyer o f the price. When that
       d o n e . T h e co m m o n e st form o f contract o f carriage by sea is o n e on     happens, the property in the goods passes from the sellers to the buyers
       the terms o f the H ague Rules. But this is an intricate blend o f                    upon or by reason o f such endorsement, and the buyer is entitled, by
       responsibilities and liabilities (Article III), rights and im munities                virtue o f section 1 o f the Bills o f Lading A ct 1855, to sue the shipowners
       (Article IV ), limitations in the am ount o f dam ages recoverable                    for loss o f or damage to the goods on the contract contained in the bill of
       (Article IV , r.5), time bars (Article III, r.6), evidential provisions               lading. The remedy so available to the buyer is adequate and fair to both
       (A rticle III, rr.4 and 6), indemnities (Article III, r.5 and Article IV ,           parties, and there is no need for any parallel or alternative remedy in tort
       r.6) and liberties (Article IV , rr.4 and 6). I am quite unable to see               for negligence. In the present case, as I also indicated earlier, the variation
       h ow these can be synthesised into a standard o f ca r e.”                           o f the original c. and f. contract agreed between the sellers and the buyers
                                                                                            produced a hybrid contract o f an extremely unusual character. It was
     I find m yself suffering from the sam e inability to understand how the                extremely unusual in that what had originally been an ordinary c. and f.
 necessary synthesis could be m ade as the Master o f the Rolls.                            contract becam e, in effect, a sale ex-warehouse at Immingham, but the risk
     A s I also said earlier, Mr. Clarke sought to rely on the concept o f a                in the go od s during their carriage by sea remained with the buyers as if the

     With the greatest possible respect to Lord G off the principle o f
transferred loss which he there enunciated, however useful in dealing with
special factual situations it may be in theory, is not only not supported by
authority, but is on the contrary inconsistent with it. Even if it were
necessary to introduce such a principle in order to fill a genuine lacuna in
the law, I should myself, perhaps because I am more faint-hearted than                 p   F
Lord G off, be reluctant to do so. A s I have tried to show earlier, however,
there is in truth no such lacuna in the law which requires to be filled.
Neither Sir John Donaldson M .R . nor Oljver L.J. (now Lord Oliver of

I find myself entirely in agreement with their unwillingness to do so.

  n         e , ™ a'TmattT   e'r f ° r consideration is the argument for the Attorney-

 L        i                       Was ma'nta>ned that if the com m issioner were to be
   eld to o w e actual or potential depositors a duty o f care in negligence
 there would be reason to apprehend that the prospect o f claims would
 nave a seriously inhibiting effect on the work of his department. A sound
 judgment would be less likely to be exercised if the com missioner were to
 be constantly looking over his shoulder at the prospect o f claims against
him, and his activities would be likely to b e conducted in a detrimentally
defensive frame o f mind. In the result, the effectiveness o f his functions
w ould be at risk o f diminution. Consciousness of potential liability could
!e a d t ° dlstortions o f judgment. In addition, the principles leading to his
liability would surely be equally applicable to a wide range o f regulatory
agencies, not only m the financial field, but also, for exam ple, to the
tactory inspectorate and social workers, to name only a few. If such
S r tyfKWf rt t0, b! . , desirable upon any P ° licy grounds, it would be much
better that the liability were to be introduced by the legislature, which is
better suited than the judiciary to weigh up competing policy considerations.
    ih e i r Lordships are o f opinion that there is much force in these
arguments, but as they are satisfied that the plaintiffs’ statement o f claim
does not disclose a cause o f action against the com missioner in negligence
 hey prefer to rest their decision upon that rather than upon the public
policy argument.                                              F        F
    For these reasons their Lordships will humbly advise H er Majesty that
the appeal should b e dismissed.

               auditors owing duty o f care to banks
                    A company's business consisted of the provision of import-
                export finance to its overseas customers, the advances made to
                the customers being secured by bills of exchange accepted by
                the customers and drawn in favour of the company. The bills of
                exchance, which were shown in the company's audited accounts,
                represented virtually the whole of its assets. The company
                negotiated the bills of exchange ;o banks to secure advances
                made by the banks. In February 19S0 the defendants, a firm of
                accountants, were appointed auditors to the company. They
                were re-appointed in 1981 and 19S2. Their report on the 19S0
                accounts was in heavily qualified terms, stating that they were
                unable to express an opinion as to whether the financial
                statements gave a true and fair view of the company's affairs as
                at 31 March 1980. Their reports for the two following years
                included a statement that in their opinion, subject to an express
                qualification, the accounts gave a true and fair view of the
                company's affairs at the respective balance sheet dates. On 31
                January 1983 the company was ordered to be compulsorily
                wound up, with an estimated deficiency in relation to unsecured
                creditors of £8.6m. The plaintiff banks had advanced money to
                the company. Seven of them were existing creditors"at the date
                of the reports on the accounts delivered by the defendants,
                three were not. The plaintiffs brought actions for negligence,
                which were subsequently consolidated, alleging that the
                defendants ought reasonably to have foreseen that the plaintiffs,
                as lending banks, would rely on the content and accuracy of
                their auditors’ reports, that the plaintiffs had relied on the
                defendants’ reports in deciding whether to continue, renew or
                increase existing facilities, or to grant new facilities to the
                company, and that the reports did not reflect a true and fair
                view of the company's affairs as at the balance sheet dates.
                    On the preliminary issue whether the defendants ow’ed a
                duty of care to the plaintiffs;—
                    Held, answering the preliminary issue in the negative and
                dismissing the action, (1) that in the case of the three banks
                which were not existing creditors of the company at the date of
                the relevant auditors' reports, the defendants had not made
                their reports either directly to the plaintiffs or to any other
                person with the imention-er in the knowledge that the reports
                would be communicated to them; that the position of those
                plaintiffs was comparable to that of potential investors in the
                company, and the element of proximity necessary to found a
                duty of'care was lacking; and that, accordingly, even though it
                was’ foreseeable that if any bank wished to consider whether to

\   creditors o f the com p any , which they know or ought to foresee may rely
    on those accounts and their reports when considering whether to
    co n tinu e, renew or increase existing facilities or to grant new facilities to
    the com pany.
         The plaintiffs are am on g a num ber of banks which lent m oney to
    Gallic Credit Ltd. ("the com pany") b etw een 1980 and 1982. T h e m oney
    was lent for the purpose o f enabling the com pany to finance its business
3   op era tion s, which consisted o f the provision o f import-export trade
    finance to the com pany's overseas customers. The company's advances
    to its customers were secured by bills of exchange accepted by the
    custom ers and drawn in favour o f the com pany. T hese w ere in turn
    negotiated to the plaintiff banks to secure their advances to the company.
    T h e bills o f exchange w ere shown in the company's audited accounts
q   and represented virtually the w^hole o f its assets appearing in the balance
    sheet.
          T h e defendants w ere appoin ted auditors o f the com p any on 26
    February 1980. T h ey w ere subsequently re-appointed in 1981 and 19S2.
    Their report on the 19S0 accounts, dated 24 June 1980. was heavily
    qualified. T h e v stated that 'hey were unable to express an opinion
    w h e th er the financial statem ents gave a true and fair view' o f the state of
D    the com pany's affairs as at 31 March 1980. Their reports on the 19S1
     and 1982 accounts, dated 14 July 1981 and 2 July 1982 respectively,
     included a statement that, in their opinion and subject to the qualification
     expressed therein, the financial statements gave a true and fair view of
     the com pany's affairs at the balance sheet date. The plaintiffs allege that
     they either (i) granted n e w facilities to the com pany or (ii) renew ed,
     continued or increased existing facilities in reliance on the accuracy of
E
     the com pany's audited accounts and the defendants’ reports thereon.
          T h ere w ere originally 14 plaintiff banks, but four have discontinued.
     O f the rem aining 10, seven w ere existing creditors o f the com pany at the
     date o f the auditors’ report alleged to have b een relied u pon , and three
     w er e not. O n e further bank, Swiss B an k Corporation, has brought its
     o w n separate action against the defendants. It has agreed to abide by
     the terms o f m y decision on this preliminary issue, subject o f course to
     any appeal. Swiss B a n k Corporation first agreed to grant a credit facility
    l o t h e ’ co m p a n y in D e c e m b e r 1981 and agreed to increase it in May
      1982. It alleges that in deciding to grant and later to increase that facility
     it relied o n the 1981 accounts, and that in deciding not to reduce the
     facility from July 1982 it relied o n the 1982 accounts.
           It is the plaintiffs’ case that the com p any’s business, or a large part
      o f it, w as fraudulent; that the tw o largest customers o f the com pany
      w er e associated with the c o m p a n y ’s directors; that bills o f exchange
      provided by them w'ere not supported by any underlying business
      transactions at all but w ere furnished in order to enable existing bank
      in debted ness o f the c o m p an y to be repaid out o f fresh ad vances,
      w h e th er by the sam e or a different bank; that those two customers were
H    h o pelessly in solvent; and that the bills of exchange accepted by them
      and sh ow n in the c o m p a n y ’s accounts were valueless or o f negligible
      valu e. T h e plaintiffs allege that the accounts failed to sh o w , as was in
      fact the case, that the com p any was insolvent, and accordingly they did
      not reflect a true and fair view o f the state o f the com pany s affairs at
      the balance sh ee t date.
           On 31 January 1983 the com p a ny was ordered to be compulsorily
      w'ound up. T h e estim ated deficiency as regards the com pany's unsecured

creditors is £ 8 . 6m. T here are no assets available for distribution am ong             ^
the com p any's unsecured creditors. T h e bills of exchange accepted by
the two custom ers in question are worthless. The advances by the
plaintiffs to the com p any are thus unsecured and wholly irrecoverable,
and probably w er e so from the outset. T h ey claim damages from the
d efen da n ts for loss and dam age sustained by them in consequence o f
their alleged negligen ce in exam in in g the company's accounts and in
m akin g their audit reports on which the plaintiffs claim to have relied in              ®
deciding w h e th er or not to provide or continue finance to the company.
    O n 2S A pril 1989 I directed the trial o f a preliminary issue in both
actions in the follow ing terms:
       "W hether on the facts set out in paragraphs 3, 13, 14, 22. 23 and 25
       o f and schedu le 2 to the statem ent o f claim in the consolidated
       action the defen dan ts ow ed a duty o f care to any one or more o f               C
       the plaintiffs."

     This is a pure question of law to be decided on assumed facts. I must
stress, so that there m ay be no misunderstanding, that although for the
purpose o f the preliminary issue the allegations in the statement of claim
must be assu m ed to be true, they have not been proved by the plaintiffs
or admitted by the defendants. T h e defendants do not admit that the                     D
plaintiff banks did rely on their audit reports, let alone that they
the m se lve s could fo re see that they w ould do so. They pour scorn on the
allegations o f reliance on the part o f those plaintiffs which made
ad vances to the com p any notw ithstandin g the terms o f the 1980 audit
reports. T h e y reserve their strongest denials for the allegations of
n eg ligen ce on their own part. T h e s e are vigorously repudiated by the               £
d efen da n ts and w ould be strongly con tested by them at any trial.
     T h e relevant factual averm ents which are alleged to give rise to the
duty o f care are that, in carrying out the audit o f the com p any’s
accounts and m akin g their audit reports, the defendants: (a) were aware
o f the m an n er in which the c o m p a n y ’s busin ess was conducted and knew
that the b usin ess w as, by its very nature, dep en dent upon the com p any’s            —
ability to o b ta in , renew , increase or con tinu e lines o f credit from banks         F
or o th e r le nd in g institutions; (b) must have foreseen or ought reasonably
to have fore see n that the c om p an y w ou ld provide cop ies o f the accounts
and the d e fe n d a n ts’ reports thereon to b ank s (w h ether existing or only
potential creditors o f the c om p an y) w hich w ere considering the grant,
renew a l, increase or continuation o f facilities to the company; and
(c) must have fore see n or ought reasonably to have foreseen that such                   q
banks w ould rely upon the con ten t and accuracy o f the accounts and the
d efen d a n ts’ reports when considering the grant, renewal, increase or
contin uation o f facilities to the com p a ny.
     In the course o f argument b efo re m e, the plaintiffs laid stress on a
further fact w hich , though not presently p leaded, is unlikely to be
ch allen ged and w hich I shall also assum e to b e true: that in the course
o f carrying out each audit the d efen dan ts b eca m e aware o f the identity            H
o f each o f the lendin g banks which was an existing creditor o f the
co m p a n y and o f the am ount advanced by each such bank to the
co m p a n y at the balance sh eet date.
     It is c o m m o n ground b etw e en the parties that, in order to establish
the ex isten ce o f a duty o f care o w e d to the plaintiff by a defendant w ho
is alleged to have m ade a negligent m is-statem ent, three requirements
must be satisfied: (i) it must be reasonably foreseeable by the defendant
    The Weekly Law R epons 23 February 1990
                                                                                    349
    2   W '.L .R .         Al Saudi Banque v. Clarke Pixley (C h .D .)        M illett J.

^    that the statem ent will be relied on by the plaintiff: (ii) there must exist
     the relevant degree o f proximity betw een the parties: and (iii) it must be
     just and reasonable in all the circumstances to impose a duty o f care on
     the part o f the defendant to the plaintiff.
           T h e plaintiffs accept that they must satisfy each o f these requirements
     in order to su cceed in establishing a duty o f care on the part o f the
     d efen d a n ts. T h ey also accept that this is a case o f alleged negligent
^   m issta te m e n t, that there was no direct contact between the defendants
     and the plaintiffs, and that their case is based on foreseeability alone.
     T h e y submit that, where the degree o f probability that the plaintiff will
     rely o n the statement is sufficiently high, foreseeability o f reliance is
     sufficient by itself to satisfy the requirement o f proximity. Alternatively,
     th e y subm it that this is so where the num ber o f potential plaintiffs is
q   limited and their identity is known to the defendants, as it was in the
     case o f those o f the plaintiff banks which were existing creditors o f the
       o m p a n y at the relevant balance sheet date.


    •      In cases of negligence which causes physical damage, it is seldom
     n ecessary to consider the concept o f proximity in order to im pose a
     reason a ble limit on the ambit o f the duty o f care. The physical damage
     itself usually provid es a sufficient limiting factor. Claims for damages for
3   e c o n o m ic loss resulting from negligent misstatements, however, are very
     different. There is a potential for foreseeable but indeterminate and
     possib ly ruinous loss bv a large and indeterminate class o f plaintiffs.
     F oreseeab ility o f reliance by itself is not an adequate limiting factor.
     E v e r since the cele brated case o f Ultramares Corporation v. Touche
     (1931) 174 N . E . 441, courts in the co m m o n law jurisdictions have b een
g   c o n ce rn ed to avoid , in the well-known words o f Cardozo C .J., at p. 444,
     “liability in an in determ in ate amount for an indeterminate time to an
     in determ in ate class."
           T w o control m echan ism s for limiting the ambit o f the duty o f care
     can b e discerned in the authorities: (i) to limit the transaction in which
     the d e fe n d a n t’s statem ent may be relied upon to the transaction in
     w hich he. in tended it, or k n e w .th a t it w as intended, to be relied upon;
F    and (ii) to limit the plaintiff or class o f plaintiff to the person or persons
     to w h o m the d efendant m ade the state m e n t, or to whom he intended or
     k n e w that it was in tended to be com m un icated.
     ! T h e law in relation to negligent m isstatem ent by auditors has been


•    the subject o f recent and co m prehensive analysis by the Court o f A p p ea l
     in Caparo Industries Pic. v. Dickman [1989] Q . B . 653. It was held that
     auditors o w e a duty o f care to existing m em bers o f the com pany but not
     to p otential investors in the com pany. T h e y o w e a duty o f care to the
     m e m b e r s because they are under a statutory obligation to report to them
     and b ecau se the m em bers have a corresponding statutory entitlement to
     receive their reports. A s Bingham L.J. neatly put it, at p. 6 8 6 g : “the
     author [is] subject to a statutory duty to report to the victim in a
     capacity in which the victim su e s .” A n d as Taylor L.J. said, at p. 701:
H            "A uditors' contem plation o f an individual registered sharehold er is
             also ‘actual, n om in ate and direct.’ T h ey know o f the sh areholder’s
             actual existence; they know his nom inate-jdentity; and they send
             directly to that sh areholder the report upon which his reliance is
             foreseeable."
    (In fact, the auditors do not usually th em selves send the accounts or
    their report to the sh arehold ers but leave it to the com pany to perform
    its statutory obligation to do so,)

     T h e Court o f A p p e a l held that auditors o w e no duty o f care to
 investors, w h o may be “almost literally anyone in the w orld .” because
 the auditors have no obligation to report to them , and because they do
 not receive the report from the auditors and have no contact or
 relationship w ith them . A s Taylor L.J. said, at p. 702:
       “A ll [the auditors] can foresee is that som e unidentified investor or
       investors may inspect their report and act upon it. By the same
       token oth e r unascertain ed persons may also do so; e.g. a bank
       c o n tem p latin g the grant to the com pany o f a loan or its suppliers or
       creditors. In n o n e o f these instances is there any close or direct
       relationship with the auditors. Foreseeability o f reliance is conceded
       but the e l e m e n t o f proxim ity is in my judgm ent lacking.”

      T h e Court o f A p p e a l consid ered two earlier cases o f auditors’
  n egligen ce at first instance in the U nited K ingd om , as well as a number
 o f A m e r ic a n and C o m m o n w e a lth decisions. In JEB Fasteners Ltd, v.
 Marks, B lo o m & Co. [1981] 3 All E .R . 2S9. a company's audited
 accounts w e r e m ade available to the plaintiff for the purpose of
 influencing his decision to m ake a takeover bid for the company. The
 accounts had actually b een prepared by the auditors themselves, but
 they w ere not prepared for the purpose o f bein g shown to the plaintiff
 and w er e not supplied to the plaintiff by them . W oolf J. based his
 conclusion that a duty o f care existed on the fact that the plain tiffs
 reliance on the accoun ts w as fo reseeable. T h e Court o f A p p eal in the
 Caparo ca se rejected his reasoning, considering that it was based on a
 m isu nd erstan ding o f the first stage o f the test propounded by Lord
 W ilberforce in A n n s v. Merton London Borough Council [197S] A .C .
 728. B in g h a m L.J. th o u gh t that the actual decision could be supported,
 but only b eca u se the auditors knew that it was intended to sh ow the
 accoun ts to the plaintiff and them selves supplied further information
 directly to the plaintiff. It was, therefore, a case in which the auditors
 could b e said to have im pliedly represented the accuracy o f the accounts
 to the plaintiff.
     T h e J E B Fasteners c a s e was follow ed in Twomax Ltd. v. Dickson,
McFarlane & R obinson, 1982-S.C. 113, w here the auditors also k new for
 a fact that the accoun ts w e r e bein g supplied to lenders, though the Lord
Ordinary did not base his decision on that fact. Insofar as he based it on
fore see ab ility a lo n e , fo llo w in g the approach o f W o o lf J., it is clear that
the Court o f A p p e a l disapproved o f it. In Haig v. Bamford (1976) 72
D . L . R . (3 d ) 68 , a similar question was consid ered by the Supreme
Court o f C a n a d a . T h e crucial finding was that, prior to the completion
o f the relevant financial statem ent, the auditors knew that it was
in tend ed to b e m a d e available to a particular bank and also to potential
investors in the c o m p a n y , though these had not been identified. Bingham
L.J. ex p re sse d the view that, without that finding, the claims would have
failed for w ant o f proxim ity.
     In m y ju d g m e n t, Caparo's case is binding authority for the following
prop o sitio ns, (i) In cases o f negligent m isstatem ent, foreseeability that
the p laintiff or s o m r o n e in a similar position will rely upon the statement
is a n ece ssa r y but not sufficient condition for liability, (ii)—In addition, it
is necessary to establish a nexus or relationship between the parties
sufficient t o create a duty o f care. That relationship can only be
deter m in ed by close analysis in each case. T h e label applied to such a
re lationship is “ p r o x im ity ,” but there is no single definitive test. In som e

 \      cases, it may be useful to consid er w heth er there has been “ a voluntary

        “equivale nt to contract." (iii) The necessary relationship exists b etw e en
        a co m p a n y s auditors and its m em bers, because the auditors are u nder a
        statutory duty to report to the m em bers and know that it is in te n d ed to
        send cop ies o f their report to them, (iv) T h e relationship m ay also exist
        if the circumstances are such that the auditors can be taken im pliedly to

       perhaps w h e n e v er they provide the accounts to the co m p any with the
       in tention , or in the k n ow le d ge that it is the com pany’s in ten tion , that
       they are to be supplied to the plaintiff or to persons in a class o f which
       the plaintiff is o n e . (v) It is not necessary that the auditors should have
       any particular transaction in contem plation, or should intend the recipient
q      o f their report to act upon it in any such transaction. If the necessarv
       relationship exists, it is enough if it is foreseeable that the recipie nt o f
       the report may rely upon it in so m e future transaction, w heth er
       con tem p lated by the auditors or not. and w hether with referen ce to his

       existing sh arehold ers in the com pany. T h e fact that it is f o r e s e e a b le that
       D their report m ay co m e into their hands and be relied upon by them is
       not sufficient without m ore to create the relationship.
             T h e plaintiffs su bmitted that the decision in Caparo’s case must now
       be reconsidered in the light o f the still m ore recent decision o f the
       H o u s e o f Lords in Smith v. Eric S. Bush; Harris v. Wyre Forest District
       Council [1989] 2 W . L .R . 790. They submitted that where the probability
£    o f reliance is sufficiently high, the n eed to establish proxim ity as a
       separate requirem ent has been relaxed and may be d isp en sed with
       altogether; and they con ten d e d that a duty o f care may arise e v e n w here
       the statem ent was not m ade to the plaintiff or with the intention that it
       should be co m m un icated to him, so long as it was or ought reasonably
       to h ave b een in the contem plation o f the maker o f the state m e n t that it
       w ould “alm ost certainly” or “in com m ercial reality” be relied u pon by a
F person such as the plaintiff. T h ey relied for this proposition particularly
       u pon the passage In t h e lp e e c H ~ o f T o r d Griffith's, at p.~8'16iHC.          '
             In m y jud gm ent, this is a com p lete misreading o f the decision in
       Smith v. Eric S. Bush and o f Lord Griffiths’s speech in particular. Far
       from relaxing the proximity test, the H o u s e o f Lords displayed a m ore
^ ^ r e s t r i c t i v e approach than the Court o f A p p ea l had d o n e in C a p a ro ’s
J ^ c a s e . Smith v. Eric S. Bush [1989] 2 W . L .R . 790 was not c o n ce rn ed with
       auditors, but with a valu ation report prepared by a valuer, su pplied to a
       prospective m ortgagee in connection with a proposed m ortgage advance
       to the purchaser o f a dwellinghouse and relied upon by the purchaser.
      T h e valu er k n e w that the valuation, though co m m ission ed by the
       m o rtg a g ee , had b een paid for by the purchaser; that it was g o in g to be

      be the ca se, but he regarded it as important that the valu ation w as paid
      for by the plaintiff, so he clearly consid ered there to be privity o f a kind

assumption o f responsibility was a helpful or realistic test for liability:
the q uestion he said, was w heth er, in all the circumstances, the law
should d e e m the m aker o f the statement to have assumed responsibility
to the p erson w h o has acted upon it.
      Lord Griffiths w as doubtful w heth er it was wise to extend the scope
o f the duty o f care b eyon d the person directly intended by the maker of
the statem ent to act upon it. He. was concerned to ensure that, if
e x te n d ed to p ersons w h o he could m erely foresee might do so, the
liability should remain strictly limited. H e said, at pp. 813-814, 815-816:
       “T h e essential distinction b etw e en the present case and the situation
       b eing con sid ered in H edley Byrne [1964] A .C . 465 and in the two
       earlier cases [Cann v. Wilson (1SSS) 39 C h .D . 39 and Candler v.
       Crane, Christmas & Co. [1951] 2 K .B . 164], is that in those cases
       the advice w as bein g given with the intention o f persuading the
       recipient to act upon it. In the present case, the purpose o f
       provid in g the report is to advise the m ortgagee but it is given in
       circum stances in which it is highly probable that the purchaser w-ill
       in fact act on its con ten ts, although that was not the primary
       p urpose o f the report. I h ave had consid erable doubts w hether it is
       w ise to increase the sc o p e o f the duty for negligent advice beyond
       the person directly in tended by the giver o f the advice to act upon it
       to those w h o m he k now s m ay do so. . . . I therefore return to the
       question in what circumstances should the law d eem those who give
       advice to h a v e assumed responsibility to the person w ho acts upon
       the ad vice or. in oth e r w ords, in what circumstances should a duty
       o f care b e o w e d by the adviser to those w ho act upon his advice? I
       w ould answer— only if it is f o re see a b le that if the advice is negligent
       the recipient is likely to suffer d am age, that there is a sufficiently
       p roxim ate relationship b etw e en the parties and that it is just and
       reasonable to im po se the liability. In the case o f a surveyor valuing
       a small h o u se for a building society or local authority, the application
       o f th e se three criteria leads to the conclusion that he o w es a duty o f
       care to the purchaser. If the valuation is negligent and is relied
       u pon d a m a g e in the _form o f ec o n o m ic loss_ to the_purchas_er is
       o b vio u sly fo r e se e a b le . T h e necessary proximity arises from the
       su rv ey or’s k n o w le d g e that the overw helm ing probability is that the
       purchaser will rely upon his valuation, the evidence was that
       su rveyors k n e w that approxim ately 90 per cent, o f purchasers did
       s o , and the fact that the surveyor on ly obtains the work because the
       purchaser is willing to pay his f ee . It is just and reasonable that the
       duty should b e im posed for the advice is given in a professional as
       o p p o s e d to a social co n tex t and liability for breach o f the duty will
       be limited b oth as to its extent and am ount. T h e extent o f the
       liability is limited to the purchaser o f the house— I would not
       ex tend it to su bsequ en t purchasers. T h e am ount o f the liability
       cannot be very great b eca u se it relates to a m odest house. There is
       no q uestion here o f creatin g a liability o f indeterminate amount to
       an in d e te r m in a te class. I w ould certainly wish to stress that in cases
       w here the advice has not b een given for the specific purpose o f the
       recipient actin g upon it, it should only be in cases when the adviser
       k n o w s there is a high d eg ree o f probability that som e other
       identifiable p erso n will act upon the advice that a duty o f care
       should be im p o s ed . It w ou ld im pose an intolerable burden upon

            those w ho give advice in a professional or commercial context if
            they w ere to o w e a duty not only to those to whom they give the
            advice but to any other person w ho might ch o o se to act upon it."
            (M y em phasis.)

 Lord J a u n c e y o f Tullichettle said, after discussing H edley Byrne and two
 earlier cases, at pp. 821. 822:
            “In the present case there was no direct contact b etw e en the
            appellants and Mrs. Smith and their sole purpose in preparing their
            report was to en ab le the building society to fulfil its statutory
            obligation. T h ere are thus points o f important distinction betw een
            the facts o f this case and those o f the other three. H o w e v e r , that
           d oes not necessarily mean that a different result must follow . The
            question must always be whether the particular facts disclose that
            there is a sufficiently proximate relationship b etw een the provider of
           information and the person who has acted on that information to
            his detriment, such that the former ow es a duty o f care to the
k,          latter."
™               “I prefer to approach the matter by asking w h e th er the facts
           disclose that the appellants in inspecting and reporting must, but for
           the disclaimers, by reason o f the proxim ate relationship b etw een
           them, be d e e m e d to have assumed responsibility towards Mrs.
           Smith as well as to the building society w ho instructed them. There
           can only b e an affirmative answer to This question. T h e four critical
           facts are that the appellants k new from the outset: ( 1) that the
           report would b e sh own to Mrs. Smith; (2) that Mrs. Smith would
           probably rely on the valuation contained therein in deciding whether
           to buy the h ou se without obtaining an in depend en t valuation; ( 3)
           that if. in these circumstances, the valuation was, having regard to
           the actual condition o f the h ouse, excessive, Mrs. Smith w ould be
           likely to suffer loss: and (4) That she had paid to the building
           society a sum to defray the appellants’ fee. . . . I w ould not
           therefore co n clud e that the m ere fact that a m o r tg a g e e ’s valuer
           k no w s that his valuation will be shown to an intendin g mortgagor o f
     -     itself im poses upon him a duty o f care to the m ortgagor. Knowledger
           actual or im plied, o f the mortgagor’s likely reliance upon the
           valuation must be brought hom e to h im . ” (M y em p h a sis.)

     A ll three o f their Lordships insisted upon proxim ity as a separate
requirem ent ov er and above foreseeability. A ll three set out the factors
which in their opinion gave rise to the necessary proxim ity, and all three
included the fact that the valuer’s fee was paid by the plaintiff (including
Lord Griffiths, at p. 816c). This show s a narrowing o f the duty and
establishes a relationship between the parties. In H edley Byrne & Co.
Ltd. v. Heller & Partners Ltd. [1964] A . C . 465, there w as privity but no
contract because o f the absence o f consideration; in Smith v. Eric S.
Bush [19S9] 2 W . L .R . 790 as counsel for the d efen da n ts put it, there
w as consideration but no privity. In so far as all the s p e e c h e s , and in
particular the sp eech o f Lord Griffiths, refer to the high probability that
the purchaser w ould rely on the valuation, this was in the con text o f a
case in which it was know n that the valuation was goin g to be shown to
the purchaser. It was not a reference to the probability that the valuation
w ould be supplied to her. but to the probability that, o n c e supplied, it
w o u ld be relied on by her. I have already stressed passages in the

 s p e e c h e s o f Lord Griffiths and Lord Jauncev which sh ow that to be so.
 It is also e v i d e n c e d bv Lord Griffiths's doubts in Harris v. Wyre Forest
 D istrict Council [1989] 2 W .L .R . 790. which was heard at the sam e time,
 w h e r e the valuer's report was not in fact supplied to the purchaser; but
 the purchaser k new that the m ortgagee was not prepared to make a
 m ortgag e offer unless he received a satisfactory valuation, himself paid
 the valuation fe e and subsequently received a mortgage offer. In such
 circum stances, he knew that the valuation was satisfactory almost as
 certain lv as if he had read it him self.              ~   .
        In each o f the cases considered by the H o u se o f Lords, therefore,
  th e re was a tripartite transaction in which the valuation could realistically
  b e regarded as provided by the valu er to the purchaser. In each o f the
  c a ses the valu ation was given to the m ortgagee with the intention of
  b e in g acted upon by him ’ in a specific transaction know n to the valuer,
  viz: the m aking o f a mortgage offer in connection with a specific
  transaction o f h o u se purchase, and in the know ledge that the valuation
  or th e gist o f the valuation would be com m unicated to the purchaser and
  w o u ld in all probability be relied upon by him in deciding w hether to go
  ah ead with the v e r y ’ transaction for which the mortgage offer was
  so u g h t. This w as a much more restricted context in which to found a
  duty o f care than was present in the Caparo case, for there was in
  co n tem p la tio n not only a particular and identified recipient o f the
  in form ation to w h o m the defendant k new that it w ould be com m unicated,
   but a particular and known purpose for which he could foresee that it
  w o u ld be relied upon.
       In Hedlev Bvrne [1964] A .C . 465 and the cases which follow ed it, the
  sta te m e n t was m ade directlv to the plaintiff with the intention that the
  plaintiff sh ould act upon it! T h e JE B Fasteners case [19S3] 1 All E .R .
  583 can be su pported onlv on the basis that the statem ent was impliedly
  confirm ed directly to the plaintiff without any such in tention, but with a
  particular transaction in contem plation , and it was foreseeable that the
  p laintiff w o u ld rely upon it in that transaction. In Caparo s case [1989]
  Q . B . 653 it was m ade to the plaintiff w-ithout any such intention and
  w ith o u t any particular transaction in contem plation , but it was foreseeable
  that the plaintiff might rely upon it in so m e unknown future transaction.
  In Smith v. Eric S. Bush [1989] 2 W . L .R . 790, it w as m ade to a third
- party with the intention, that h e . should act. u pon it in. .a know n and
  co n t e m p la t e d transaction, but in the k now ledg e that it would b e
  co m m u n ic a t e d to the plaintiff and w ould almost certainly be relied upon
  b y him in c o n n ectio n with a transaction without w hich the transaction o f
  th e third party could not proceed.
        In the p resen t case, the defendants did not m ake their reports to the
   plaintiff banks or to any other person with the intention or in the
   k n o w le d g e that they would b e com m un icated to them . T h e most that
   can b e said is that it was fo reseea ble that, if any o f the plaintiff banks
   w ish ed to con sid er the continuance or renewal o f existing facilities or the
   grant o f additional facilities, it might well call for co p ies o f the company s
   latest audited accounts and rely u pon them and the accompanying
   au d ito rs’ report.                                                    ,     , . ,
         In m y ju d g m e n t, the position o f the three plaintiff banks which were
   n ot already existing creditors o f the com p any at the relevant balance
   s h e e t date is directly com parable with that o f t h e jio t e n t ia l investors in

         In my jud gm ent, Caparo's case [1989] Q .B . 653 marks the furthest                    ^
  limit to which the duty o f care for negligent misstatement has so far
  b e e n taken in E n g lan d , and its reasoning d oes not encourage anv
  further advance. Smith v. Eric S. Bush, by contrast, suggests a more
  strin gent test to m a k e the requirem ents for proximity accord more

  case with Smith v. Eric S. Bush suggests that the test o f proximity may
  h av e b een too w id ely stated in Caparo's case, not too narrowly. But
  e v e n applying the m o re gen er ou s test in C aparo’s case, these plaintiffs           q
  d o not m eet it. T h er e was no relationship between them and the
  d efen d a n ts. The test o f proxim ity is not satisfied.
        This m akes it u nn ecessary to consider w hether, if the requirement of
  prox im ity w ere satisfied, it w ould be just and reasonable to impose a
  d uty o f care to the existing bank creditors. But in case the matter goes
 further. I ought to in dicate m y ow n views. In my judgment, it would
  not. C aparo’s case sh o w s that even if the duty o f care is confined to the             D
 creditors w hose ex iste n c e was k now n to the defendants, the potential
 liability is not restricted to the a m oun t o f the existing in debtedness. The
 d efen d a n ts will be liable to a bank which m ade an additional facility
 available to the co m p a n y in reliance on the audited accounts. Accordingly*,
 althou gh there is no d anger o f ex p o sin g the defendants to a liabilitv to
 an indeterm inate class, they will be ex p o se d to liability for an                       p
 in determ in ate am oun t. M o r eo v e r, this is potentially a far greater
 e x p o su r e than in Caparo's case, w h e re the com p any was solvent, though
 ov er v alu ed in the accounts. In the worst case, the maximum liability
 w o u ld b e m easured by the am oun t by which the value o f the company
 w a s overstated. W h ere the value o f a c om p an y is negligently overstated
 o r u nd erstated in the accoun ts, the auditors’ liability to investors and
 sh areho ld ers w ould be m easu red b y , or at least related to, the extent o f           F
 their ow n negligen ce. T h a t is not so w here creditors are concerned and
 the co m p a n y i s - a l l e g e d - t o have been- in solvent. "In t h e ' case o f a
su b s e q u e n t and irrecoverable a d v a n c e , the auditors’ maxim um liability
w o u ld fall to be m easu red by the a m o u n t o f the advance, which would
b e u n k n o w n to the auditors and cou ld not be foreseen by them. It
w o u ld bear no necessary relationship to, and could be m any times                         r
g re a ter than, the valu e o f the c o m p a n y as sh own by its published
acc o u n ts. In the p resen t case, the c o m p a n y had a paid up share capital
o f £ 3 2 5,0 00. The 1982 accounts s h o w e d net assets o f just under £800.000
and bank borrowin gs o f £ 6 .4m . T h e y could have been used to support
further borrowin gs o f m an y millions o f p oun ds. E ven if the requirement
o f p roxim ity were satisfied, I w o u ld not for m y ow n part, unless
con strain ed by authority, extend the duty o f care to a prospective                        H
le n d e r , unless the a m o u n t or at least the scale o f the p roposed loan was
k n o w n to the d efen dan t.
      If, on the other hand, the d efen dan ts' liability could be confined to
the a m o u n t, o f the existing in d e b ted n e ss, this, would not help the
plain tiffs. T h ey allege that the co m p a n y w as in fact insolvent at the
relevant balance sh eet d ate , and claim to have suffered loss by continuing

that they w ere already irrecoverable, the loss had already been sustained;
ih e dam age p rec ed ed the breach. The only actionable loss that could
arise in such circumstances would occur if an advance was partially
recoverable at the balance sheet date and later b ecom e w holly
irrecoverable. T h e loss might then be attributable to the d efen dan ts’
failure to qualify their report in such a way as to bring about a cessation
o f trade. But this is not the pleaded, ground o f liability or the p lead ed
mechanism o f loss, and w ould involve different considerations.
     T h ese consid erations forcibly suggest to my mind that the plaintiffs’
claim, even if confined to the seven existing creditors, is o n e which the
law ought not to allow. F or the reasons I have given, I am o f opinion
that it d o es not. I answer the preliminary question in the negative.

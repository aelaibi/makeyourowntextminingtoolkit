DRAFT REPLY FOR PRIVATE SECRETARY'S SIGNATURE



Thank you for copying to the Prime Minister your letter of 28 February to the
Home Secretary about his decision not to hold a fresh inquiry into the
Hillsborough Disaster. I am replying on the Prime Minister's behalf.


Firstly, I am sorry for the distress caused by the mistake over Graham's name in
the Home Secretary's letter of 1 8 February.


I appreciate that the Home S ecretary's decision not to hold a fresh inquiry is a
disappointment to you. As he explained in the House, one of his first concerns
on taking office last year w a s to ensure that there should be a thorough and
independent investigation of any material which cast doubt on earlier findings
about the disaster, and it w a s to this end that Lord Ju stice Stuart-Smith w as
asked to conduct his scrutiny.


The Home Secretary has em phasised that he is satisfied Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith has conducted a thorough scrutiny of the evidence and considered its
significance carefully. His report is comprehensive and se ts out clearly the
matters he has considered and the reasons for his conclusions. He has
considered all the material allegations about missing or concealed videotape
evidence, the alleged interference with w itnesses and w itness sta te m e n ts and
concerns about the use of the 3.1 5pm cut-off time at the Inquest.


It is inevitable with a disaster of this magnitude th at evidence will em erge from
time to time which has not been heard publicly before. W hat the scrutiny had to
consider w a s not only w h eth er the evidence put forward w a s new, but also
consider w a s not only w h eth er the evidence put forward w a s new , but also
whether it w a s of such significance that it would justify a new inquiry, or further
consideration by the Attorney General (with regard to the inquest) or the criminal
or disciplinary authorities.


The Home Secretary has considered the J u d g e 's report carefully and ac c e p ts the
conclusion which he has reached that the evidence submitted to him does not
add anything significant to the evidence available to and considered by the
Taylor Inquiry and the Inquests. Lord Ju stice Stuart-Smith has m ade it clear that
he entirely ac c e p ts Lord Ju stice Taylor's conclusion th a t the principal cause of
the disaster w a s the failure of police control. Lord Ju s tic e Stuart-Smith himself
condem ned w h a t he described as Chief Superintendent Duckenfield's
"disgraceful lies" that the fans had opened Gate C.


The Home Secretary has indicated that he shares the se n tim e n ts expressed by
the Lord Ju stice Stuart-Smith in Chapter 7 of his Report w h en he says:


"/ understand the dismay that they (the families) have that no individual has
personally been held to account either in a criminal court, disciplinary
proceedings, or even to the extent o f losing their job".


There are profound shortcomings in the presen t police discipline s y s te m which
the Government intends to address. In January, the Home Affairs Select
Committee published so m e important recom m endations about the police
complaints and discipline procedures. The Home Secretary has recently
announced his response to the HAC recom m endations including his intention to
reduce the standard of proof to the civil standard in discipline procedures and to
remove the existing double jeopardy provision which restricts criminal and
disciplinary action on the sa m e facts. He has also endorsed the C om m ittee's
recommendation that forces should show greater c o m m itm e n t to their po w ers to
verify claims of sickness and disability and, w here appropriate, to p o stpon e a
request to retire on ill health grounds until the completion of disciplinary
proceedings. However, under the term s of the European Convention on
Human Rights, new rules cannot be applied retrospectively, and it would be
wrong for me to s u g g e s t that any such action could n o w be taken against
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, or any other officer.


I know that for you, and the other families of t h o s e w h o died at Hillsborough,
the grief will never end, and it will clearly be difficult for you to a ccep t the
Home Secretary's decision. The original Taylor Inquiry w a s very thorough and
w a s unequivocal in identifying the main c a u s e s of the disaster, and I hope that
you will accept Lord Ju stice Stuart-Sm ith's scrutiny w a s equally rigorous. The
Home Secretary is, as you know, ready to talk to the families further to explain
his approach. I know th a t Graham 's sister w a s am ong the delegation he m et
whilst in Southport on 7 March, and you may be aw are that he is currently
arranging another meeting in Merseyside.


You asked about s ta te m e n t s by m em bers of the St J o h n Ambulance. The
Home Secretary indicated on 18 February th a t he w a s placing in the House of
Commons Library s ta te m e n t s made by police officers about the ev en ts of the
day. This w a s appropriate because Lord Ju s tic e Stuart-S m ith's report dealt with
allegations about the a m e n d m e n t of a number of th o s e s ta te m e n ts .


All other s ta te m e n ts m ad e by those present at Hillsborough, including th o se
made by St Jo h n Ambulance m embers, are held by South Yorkshire Police.
Copies of s t a te m e n ts should therefore be requested from South Yorkshire
Police direct. I understand th a t any requests should be m ade in writing to
PC Ken Greenway at the Complaints and Discipline Departm ent, Windsor Road,
Sheffield, S8 8UB.


I am sending a copy of this letter to the Chief Constable so th a t he is aw are of
developments.

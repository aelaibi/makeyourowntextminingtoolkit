              HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

              You will -no doubt be aware by now that Mr Leslie Sharp, QPM, Chief
              Constable of Cumbria, was appointed as the new Investigating Officer 'with
              effect from 1 April 1990.   He is now in full command of the investigation
              and is responsible for deploying officers of the West Midlands Police
              investigation team.   Consequently, any future communications on the
              Hillsborough investigation should be referred to him, care of Nechells
              Green Police Station, or anywhere else he may specify.

             The Inquests were concluded on Friday, 4 May 1990 and that day saw my
             departure from this investigation.  With effect from Tuesday, 8 May 1990, I
             took up a temporary post at the Police Staff College at Bramshill as the
             Assistant Chief Constable to the Senior Command Course.  The purpose of
             this letter, therefore, is to indicate my departure and at the same time
             express my gratitude to you and your staff for the very professional way in
             which our relations have been over the past twelve months.  In expressing
             these sentiments I also reflect those of my colleagues with whom I have been
             privileged to work.

              In saying thank you can I also express my appreciation of the efforts made
              by Ms

             With Mr Sharp at the helm I feel certain that there will be no loss of
             momentum nor loss of continuity, especially as Detective Chief
             Superintendent Mick Foster remains with the team.  Of course, whilst I will
             be in Hampshire I will be available to give Mr Sharp any assistance he
             requires.

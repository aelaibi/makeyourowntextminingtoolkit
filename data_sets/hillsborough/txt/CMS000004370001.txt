                 HOME SECRETARY'S STATEMENT ON
               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT
                    OF HIS INQUIRY INTO THE
          HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL STADIUM DISASTER


With permission,     Mr Speaker,   I should like to make a
statement about the final report of Lord Justice Taylor's
Inquiry into the tragedy at the Hillsborough stadium in
Sheffield on 15 April 1989, which is published today.


Shortly I will, of course, refer to Part 1 of the Football
Spectators Act about which there has already been much
speculation.     But the report covers a very wide range of
issues dealing with safety and hooliganism in and around
football grounds and I intend to follow the theme of the
Report and come to the membership scheme at the right
moment.


We are indebted to Lord Justice Taylor for the Report,
which is a careful and thorough analysis of why we have
had so many major tragedies at football grounds over the
years and why we have had disorder and hooliganism.             It
is addressed as much to the football industry as to the
Government.      Lord Justice Taylor explains       how in his
interim report he concentrated on overcrowding because that
was the cause of the Hillsborough disaster, but now he
goes on to talk of a game, the image of which has been
much tarnished, and of a blight over the game due to old
grounds, poor facilities, hooliganism, excessive drinking
and poor leadership.


Lord Justice Taylor does not spare                   those who run    the
industry.     He says indeed that the provision they make for
their customers is often not merely                  basic but squalid,
and he says that squalid conditions can have an impact on
safety but they also lead to lower standards of behaviour.


Lord Justice Taylor says that the Football Association and
Football League have not seen it as any part of their duty
to offer guidance to clubs              on safety matters and he
questions     whether   the        directors    of    many    clubs   are
genuinely     interested      in     the   welfare      of    their   own
supporters    or their good behaviour. Players                  too   are
criticised, with Lord Justice Taylor pointing out that
incitement from the pitch or bad behaviour by players,
which is not confined to soccer, has a major influence on
the crowd.     He says that the game only has a future if
the   directors   and the play^ers             can   change   their own
priorities and give a leadership which is plainly lacking
at present.
He agrees with the Government that there must be a move
towards      all-seater            stadia     and   points    out      that   the
machinery        for        that   now exists       in section      11 of     the
Football Spectators Act.                 The change will improve safety
and will      improve behaviour, and we intend to bring it
about.      Lord Justice Taylor mentions ways in which clubs'
finances might be improved to help cover the cost and
canvasses a number of possibilities, including a change in
the      system        of     capital       allowances   which      discourages
expenditure on new stands but encourages what he describes
as grotesque transfer fees.                     The Government will study
these matters:              but the Report makes clear that the bulk
of the finances for ground improvements will have to                          be
raised by the clubs themselves, and the Government agrees.


The Report makes a number of detailed                         recommendations
about gates, gangways and many other matters relating to
spectator safety, building on the recommendations of the
Interim Report.               The Government accepts these proposals,
some of which can be implemented immediately.                          Some will
need further work.                 I propose to place in the Library of
the      House         a      detailed       response    to      the     various
recommendations in this chapter of the Report (Chapter 4)
so that Hon Members can see what action the Government is
taking to implement them.
                                  4.



Hon Members will recall that section 13 of the Football
Supporters     Act     provides   for   the     Football      Licensing
Authority to supervise the safety responsibilities of local
authorities in respect of designated football grounds.               We
intend to implement the provision.              Lord Justice Taylor
would like us to go further and extend the remit of the
Football     Licensing Authority        to      cover   all    grounds
designated under the 1975 Safety of Sports Grounds Act,
and indeed all premises requiring safety certificates or
licences under Parts III and IV of the Fire Safety and
Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987. This would                 require
primary    legislation and we will            have to consider the
matter further.       There is, of course, also the possibility
of a voluntary interim arrangement to cover other than
football grounds, pending any legislation.


Part III of the Report contains a number of proposals
relating     to      crowd   control    and     hooliganism.         It
acknowledges      the crucial     role of the police          in crowd
control.     Lord Justice Taylor pays tribute to the police
generally for their invaluable work in maintaining order
at sports events.        I want to add my personal tribute to
his and to thank the police service for their efforts,
without which, as Lord Justice Taylor rightly reminds us,
many sporting events could not be permitted to take place.
They turn out to do what is often a very unpleasant job.
They often face derision,          abuse and assault,     and they
endure it all with remarkable good humour.           They deserve
the thanks of every decent citizen.


The Report recognises the advances made in the last couple
of years in the effectiveness of the policing of football,
particularly inside grounds, and to the major impact of
CCTV on the hooligan problem.


Lord Justice Taylor also recognises the great potential
value of the police National Football Intelligence Unit in
dealing with footbal1-related crime and with hooligans
travelling to matches abroad.


As I have said. Lord Justice Taylor takes the view that
better facilities and better treatment of fans will bring
better behaviour.       Beyond that, the Report recommends the
creation   of   three new specific        offences   to apply at
designated sports grounds:         throwing a missile;    chanting
obscene or racialist abuse;           and going onto the pitch
without    reasonable    excuse:       and   it   also   asks   for
consideration to be given to extending the courts' powers
to impose attendance centre orders and for the use of
electronic tagging in the case of offenders convicted of
footbal1-related offences.            I welcome these recommendations
in principle and will consider the most practical methods
of giving them effect.


[There     are   further     recommendations        directed   to police
authorities in connection with charges to be made for
policing inside grounds, and to the police in connection
with planning their operations, with communications at the
match,     and with the training for police commanders at
matches.     I endorse all these recommendations.]


I now come to the proposed football membership scheme.
The House will be aware that as yet no such scheme exists.
Lord Justice Taylor therefore addressed himself to the
Invitation to Tender issued by the consultants employed by
the football authorities.             On this basis he feels unable
to support the implementation of the provisions of Part I
of the Football           Spectators Act concerning the football
membership       scheme     because     he   does     not   believe   the
technology would work well enough to avoid the danger of
congestion and disorder and instead proposes the anti-
hooliganism measures to which I have referred.


We have decided in the light of his advice not to proceed
with the establishment of a Football Membership Authority
to draw up a scheme at this time.    Part I will remain on
the statute book and the practical concerns expressed by
Lord Justice Taylor about the scheme envisaged in the
Invitation to Tender will be fully explored in the light
of advice from the specialist companies who responded to
the Invitation to Tender on 19 January and others.


If the hooliganism is not quelled by the alternative
measures proposed in the Report we will be in a position
to come back to the House and seek the House's approval
of an effective membership scheme.


The right course at the moment is to implement Part II of
the Act and implement Lord Justice Taylor's proposals in
the way I have indicated, and give the industry and the
clubs yet another chance to put themselves in order.     The
public will not forgive them if they d o n ’t now act.

                               FOOTBALL SPECTATORS ACT: TAYLOR REPORTS

            The Prime Minister discussed with the Home Secretary this
       morning his minute of 22 January about the handling of the final
       report of Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry into the Hillsborough
       football tragedy. The Lord President, Lord Privy Seal,
       Secretary of State for the Environment, Chief Whip (Commons), the
       Minister for Sport and Sir Robin Butler were also present.

        .   J would be grateful if the letter were copied only to those
       directly concerned with handling the suh-jp^t concerned»


             The Home Secretary said that Lord Justice Taylor had
       concluded that he could not support the implementation of the
       National Membership Scheme under Part I of the Football
       Spectators Act 1989. Lord Justice Taylor had looked at the
       invi.tation to tender for the National Membership Scheme and had
       expressed grave doubts about the adequacy of the technology
       involved, the feasibility of the scheme, its impact on police
       resources and its implications for crowd control and safety. He
       doubted whether the scheme would eliminate hooliganism inside or
       outside grounds.

              Lord Justice Taylor had put forward a variety of
      recommendations for improving crowd control and safety, including
      progressive movement towards all-seat accommodation, and the
      establishment of an independent body to supervise the
      responsibilities of local authorities for safety of sports
      grounds. Preliminary advice was that even if the football
      membership scheme was not set up, the Football Licensing
      Authority could be appointed to exercise this responsibility, at
      least in respect of football grounds. There were also a number
      of recommendations directed to the criminal law, such as the
      creation of new offences covering certain types of behaviour at
      football matches: while it was likely that these were already
      caught by the existing law, the proposals could be made specific
      offences if that was thought desirable. Similar considerations
      attached to Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations on ticket sales
      a n d _attendance centre orders. Together therefore there was the
mK    basis of a convincing package which could be put forward to
      Parliament.

     As to the handling of the report, the Government had all
along made clear that Part I of the Football Spectators Act was
an enabling measure and he proposed that the Government should
accept Lord Justice Taylor's advice that the National Membership
Scheme under Part I should not be implemented at least at this
stage. He would make clear in an early statement, however, that
Part I would be left on the statute Book and could be
implemented, at a later date if necessary. Meanwhile the
Government would rigorously pursue those of Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendations that fell to it, many of which built on action
which the Government already had in hand.

     The Secretary of State for the Environment said that Lord
Justice Taylor's report was flawed in a number of respects.
Nevertheless, he accepted the Home Secretary's conclusion that
it would not be possible to proceed with the National Membership
Scheme in the face of Lord Justice Taylor's findings.
Hooliganism remained a serious problem, however, which the
forthcoming World Cup would emphasise. A convincing alternative
package would therefore need to be assembled which picked up Lord
Justice Taylor's proposals. It would also be highly desirable to
implement Part II of the 1989 Act on Restriction Orders before
the end of the current football season, in order that the
provisions were in force before the World Cup. But it was right
that the enabling powers in Part I of the Act should be kept in
reserve, in case Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations proved
ineffective or advances were made in technology or otherwise
which overcame Lord Justice Taylor's objections. In this way
pressure would be kept on the football authorities and clubs to
secure continuing improvements.

     In discussion, the following   points were    made:

a.   Lord Justice Taylor's report contained anumber of factual
     inaccuracies and it was doubtful whether some of his
     recommendations would prove effective. It was right that an
     opportunity should be found to expose these shortcomings,
     although the Home Secretary's statement should not itself
     dwell on them. One means of doing this might be if an
     Adjournment Debate were mounted on the report shortly after
     its publication. The points could also be brought out in
     response to questions about the report.

b.   It was unclear whether Lord Justice Taylor would be holding
     a press conference about his report. There was no doubt
     that if he did so he would be questioned closely by
     journalists about a number of his findings.

c.   None of the arguments advanced by Lord Justice Taylor in
     support of his conclusion on the Football Membership Scheme
     was novel and the Government had provided answers to all of
     them in Parliament.-

d.   It was desirable to continue testing of some types of
     membership scheme with individual football clubs to see if
     the criticisms made by Lord Justice Taylor could be
     overcome. This would have to be done with the consent of

                           CONFIDENTIAL

         the football clubs concerned. This might be difficult to
         get in the wake of publication of the report and there could
         be demands that the costs were borne by Government.

    e.   The great majority of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations
         built on work which the Government had already set in hand.
         This point should be brought out clearly in the Home
         Secretary's statement. The report also made clear that the
         primary responsibility for improving safety and tackling
         hooligan behaviour lay on the clubs. Implementation of Lord
         Justice Taylor's recommendations would have substantial cost
         consequences, about which clubs would be bound to protest.
         Although the report had discussed various tax concessions,
         it had made no firm recommendation for Government financial
         assistance to the clubs, and it was right that the onus for
         finding the money should be on the clubs, who were earning
         very substantial stuns, for example, from the sale of rights
         to televise matches.

    f.   Lord Justice Taylor had suggested that an independent body
         should supervise the responsibilities of local authorities
         for the safety of all grounds covered by the Safety of
         Sports Grounds Act. This recommendation would require
         legislation, however, and it was not clear that there was a
         case for implementing the recommendation immediately in
         respect of sports other than football (where section 13 of
         the 1989 Act provided the necessary powers).

    g.   The Opposition would be bound to seize on the report to try
         to embarrass the Government. There was a risk that the
         contents of the report would leak if publication was
         delayed. Nevertheless, the Government could be criticised
         if it rushed to publish the report without making an
         adequate number of printed versions of the report available
         through HMSO. On balance it was preferable to hold to the
         plan to publish the report immediately sufficient properly
         printed versions of it were available.

         The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it
    was clear that Lord Justice Taylor's report was flawed in a
    number of respects. Its deficiencies could be brought out in
    response to questions following the Home Secretary's statement.
    Nevertheless it was clear that the Government could not proceed
    with the National Membership Scheme in Part I of the Football
    Spectators Act in the face of Lord Justice Taylor's findings.
    Part I was, however, an enabling provision, as the Government had
    made clear all along, and it was right that it should be left on
    the Statute Book for use at a later date should this seem
    desirable and be shown to be feasible. The Home Secretary's
    statement should make clear that for the present the Government
    would proceed expeditiously with a package based on Lord Justice
    Taylor's recommendations, many of which built on action the
    Government had already put in hand. In addition to Lord Justice
    Taylor's own recommendations, the package could embrace further
    testing of membership schemes provided that clubs were willing to
    assist with this. The Home Secretary's statement should make
    clear that the report identified that the primary responsibility
    for the present situation and for remedying it lay with the

clubs themselves. The Home Secretary should make his statement
on Monday 29 January and should take advantage of an earlier
Question to acknowledge that he had received the report and to
set out the expected timetable for publishing it. He should
circulate the text of his draft statement in advance to
interested colleagues.

HOME SECRETARY'S STATEMENT ON LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT


Thank you for getting the draft statement to us yesterday
evening. My Secretary of State has now considered it and there
are a number of amendments which he would like to see made, so
that it reflects fully the points agreed at yesterday morning's
meeting at No.10:


- on page 6, he considers it important that the Home Secretary
should be as positive as possible about taking forward Lord
Justice Taylor's recommendations for anti-hooliganism measures.
He suggests amending the final sentence of the first paragraph to
read:

       "I welcome these recommendations in principle and will
       consider the most practical methods of giving them effect."

- on page 7, he suggests that the first sentence should begin.

       "As I have mentioned, in relation     to    hooliganism           Lord
       Justice Taylor takes the view..."

And that, for the sake of completeness,    the second sentence of
the same paragraph should end:

       "an extension of the courts' powers to       make       attendance
       orders and to impose electronic tagging."

   pages 7 and 8; replace the paragraphs on the                      national
membership scheme by those attached to this letter.
  My Secretary of State takes the view that the paragraphs on the
  national membership scheme should come at the end of the
  statement, as they do in the draft. He recalls that it was agreed
^ at yesterday's meeting that the Home Secretary would confirm his
  intention to implement Part II of the Football Spectators Act
  very soon.

  My Secretary of State would like to have a word with the Home
  Secretary on the telephone this afternoon before he has to leave
  for Nairobi. We have first order questions at 2.30pm. Perhaps Mr
  Patten and Mr Waddington could have a word after that, say at
  about 3.45pm.

                  PARAGRAPHS ON THE NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME




             I come now to the proposed Football Membership Scheme. The
        House will be aware that as yet no such scheme exists. Lord
        Justice Taylor therefore addressed himself to the Invitation to
        Tender   issued    by    the   consultants      employed     by    the   football
        authorities.      On    that   basis   he    felt   unable    to    support   the
        implementation of the provisions of                 Part   I of the Football
        Spectators Act concerning the National Membership Scheme and
        instead proposed the anti-hooliganism measures to which I have
        referred.


             We have decided, in the light of his advice, not to proceed
        with the establishment of a Football Membership Authority to draw
        up a scheme at this time. However, hooliganism in football is a
        notoriously recalcitrant problem. We do not therefore intend to
        repeal Part I of the Football Spectators Act. It will remain on
        the statute book, and the practical concerns expressed by Lord
        Justice Taylor about its operation will be fully explored in the
        light of advice from the specialist companies who responded to
        the Invitation to Tender on 19 January.                If hoolganism is not
        quelled by the alternative measures proposed in the Taylor report
        we can therefore introduce an effective and tested Membership
        Scheme as quickly as possible.


             The right course at the moment is to implement the Taylor
        proposals as I have indicated,              and give the industry and the
        clubs yet another chance to put themselves in order. The public
        will not forgive them if they don't now act.

better             treatment               of      fans         will          bring           better

LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S REPORT - HOME SECRETARY'S STATEMENT



I attach draft paragraphs on the national membership scheme for
the Home Secretary's statement on Monday. They have been prepared
without sight of the Home Secretary's draft for the statement as
a whole, which you are'expecting this evening. But given the lack
of    time before the Secretary of        State leaves     for Nairobi,    we
thought    that    it    might   be   helpful   to   let   you    have   these
paragraphs,      for    consideration   alongside    the   Home   Secretary's
draft, at tomorrow morning's meeting.

PARAGRAPHS ON NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME



1.    I come now to the proposed Football Membership Scheme. The
House will     be    aware that      as yetno        such    scheme exists.     Lord
Justice Taylor       therefore addressed himself to the Invitation to
Tender   issued      by    the    consultants     employed         by the    football
authorities.    On    that       basis,   he   felt     unable     to   support    the
implementation       of    the    provisions    of    Part     I   of the    Football
Spectators Act, concerning the national membership scheme. [While
the   Government     has    reservations       about        Lord   Justice    Taylor's
comments]    we have decided in the light of his advice,                       not to
proceed with the implementation of a scheme at this time.


2.    It is important that I should put this decision in context.
The Government remains of the view that it was right at the time,
and in the context of the Popplewell recommendations, to take
powers   in the Football Spectators Act to establish a football
membership scheme.         Following the Hillsborough disaster and the
setting up of Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry, we made clear that
this House would have the opportunity to consider the proposals
before they were implemented, in the light of the Final Report of
the Inquiry.


3.    We do not however intend to repeal Part I of the Football
Spectators Act. That will remain on the statute book so that if
hooliganism is not reduced by the alternative measures proposed
by Lord Justice Taylor and a workable scheme can be produced the
powers remain available for us to proceed with a scheme.

           PARAGRAPHS ON THE NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME




1.     I come now to the proposed Football Membership Scheme. The
House will be aware that as yet no such scheme exists.                           Lord
Justice Taylor therefore addressed himself to the Invitation to

implementation of        the provisions      of    Part    I of the         Football
Spectators Act, concerning the National Membership Scheme .




2.     We have decided, in the light of his advice, not to proceed
with   the implementation of a scheme at                  this   time.      However,
hooliganism in football is a notoriously recalcitrant problem.
We do not therefore intend to repeal Part I of the Football
Spectators Act.        It will remain on the statute book,                  and the
practical concerns expressed by Lord Justice Taylor about its
operation will be fully explored, so that if hoolganism is not
quelled by the alternative measures proposed in the Taylor report
the powers remain available.

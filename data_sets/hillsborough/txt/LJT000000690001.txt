   Dear Mr. Storr,


         Thank you for your letter of 21st. June as Chairman of the Working Group
    on Disasters and Inquests.
         I do think that the present situation is wholly unsatisfactory. The
    various proceedings in the aftermath of a disaster usually consistjf“of (a) a
    public inquiry (b) an inquest (c) civil proceedings (d) criminal proceedings
    and (e) po^sit^lv disciplinary proceedings. These various procedures are not
    necessarily^inThat order but they are treated separately and the effect is to
    string out the aftermath for years after the event. I do not think one could
    combine the public inquiry with criminal proceedings. I think there would be
    difficulties (although not insuperable) about combining the public inquiry with
    civil proceedings, although I think that the fact-finding exercise performed by
    the public inquiry could well form the basis for a judicial consideration of
    liability and damages. What could I think be beneficially combined would be
    the public^nquiry and the inquest. I believe (shortness of time has prevented
    me from verifying this) that some such procedure is followed in Scotland./^The
    long Protx^ctionpf the present sequence of proceedings described above nas a
   number ofTefreefs. First, it must add greatly to the distress and ordeal of
    those whonmay in the end be prosecuted or disciplined. In most cases any fault
    attaching to them is likely to have been the result of gross negligence rather
    than any wickedness. To have the matter hanging over them for years with
    intermittent appearances before various tribunals is most unsatisfactory.
   Moreover, memories fade and criminal proceedings taken some 3 or 4 years after
    the event are bound to encounter difficulties which could be avoided if the
   whole process were swifter. Again, the protraction of the proceedings tends,
    in my view, to encourage those aggrieved by the disaster to make almost a
   vocation of pursuing their grievances through tribunal after tribunal. I think
   they feel, albeit subconsciously, that so long as they can continue to contest
   the issues they are in some way serving the memory of their loved ones. I
   would have thought this was undesirable in the publicinterest and, in the long
   run, even in the interests of those contesting the issues.
         The object of an inquest is not to ventilate grievances or apportion blame
   but merely to establish the cause of death. Accordingly, I would favour an
   amendment to the law which empowered a tribunal conducting a public inquiry
   into a major disaster to discharge the functions of the coroner in this
   respect.
         Turning to the Hillsborough Disaster and its aftermath, I conducted with
   two assessors a public hearing of oral evidence over some 7 weeks in Sheffield
   and published axy Interim JJeport which was essentially a fact*finding document
   although it hacfjtacked on^to it^interim recommendations pending a final report,
^/'fhere were    then civil proceedings which were begun to be heard in Manchester
but were settled at an early stage. Thereafter, there was an inquest which I
understand lasted some 78 days. During the course of the inquest, I am told
that the coroner declined to allow any questions based upon what witnesses had
said before the public inquiry. Thus, if a witness said, many months after the
event, that he could not remember something, counsel was not allowed to remind
the witness of what he had said at the public inquiry within a very short time
after the event. Since the civil proceedings had already been settled I simply
cannot understand how it could possibly have been justifiable to go into all
the facts again over 78 days and conduct it as an exercise in memory.
     For the purposes of the public inquiry, a vast number of police officers
was deployed to take statements from eye-witnesses. When the public hearing
was over, I visited the West Midlands Police Headquarters to thank those
responsible and was shown the operations room of the scicel&s^of police deployed
to provide evidence for the inquest. They were concerned in the detailed and
harrowing task of trying by the use of photographs and witness statements to
trace the movements of every one of the 95 victims so as to establish for the
coroner (where possible) exactly where in the ground and from what injury the
individual had died. I appreciate that the mere fact that 95 people died does
not in any way diminish the importance of each individual life and the manner
of its termination. But I wonder whether such meticulous investigation (which
was only possible because of the peculiarly public and photogenic nature of a
Cup Final) was really necessary.
      In answer to your specific question^'                  /. ---
(1 ). I thijik there were ares't^ overlapjf^r the inquiry jdl the inquest as
conducted^ in that the whole *6f the factj seemed to have been gone over again at
the inquest. I believe the object of this exercise on the part of those
representing the deceased was to seek to urge the DPP to prosecute police
officers after all^despite his earlier announcement that no prosecution would
take place. I think that the overlap could be pvpided in future if, as
suggested above, the inquest were subsumed wifcb'^the inquiry.
(2)    I do not think that the knowledge that there was to be an inquest had any
effect on the way in which the inquiry was planned or carried out.
(3)    I did have contact with the coroner before commencing the oral hearing at
the public inquiry. He was extremely co-operative and agreed to adjourn the
inquest until the public inquiry was over. I have no doubt that the
information gleaned from the inquiry and all the statements which the police
took were available to ^tlje coroner. However, he seems to have taken the view
that the evidence feSST the inquiry should be excluded.
(4)    I think the relatives of those who died were content with the outcome of
the inquiry. I think in general terms they gained sufficient information about
the cause of the disaster. It may well be that without the meticulous
investigation to which I refer above they would not know the individual
circumstances of their relatives’death* in terms of precise injury, attempted
treatment and the precise place of death.
     These are my immediate thoughts in answer to your letter and I set them
down in view of the very short time before your meeting. Should you require my
assistance on any specific point please do not hesitate to get in touch.

     Yours sincerely

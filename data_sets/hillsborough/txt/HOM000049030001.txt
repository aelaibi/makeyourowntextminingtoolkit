 1                                                     Wednesday,   8th October,   1997
 2    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            I have read the letters that you
 3           have sent to me, Mrs.         Sefton, and for which I am grateful.
 4           As you know I think,         I had a day either last week or the
 5           week before with Mr. Jones and junior counsel and Miss
 6           Adlington where a lot of submissions were made to me in
 7           relation to the          video evidence and the cut-off time of
 8           3.15 and so on.           That has been fairly fully covered by
 9           counsel in his written and oral submissions.               By telling
10           you that I do not want to stop you saying anything that
11           you want to say          to me but just to let you know that that
12           has been pretty          fully covered.
1-3                  Would you like to fire head or do you want me to ask
14           you some questions?
15    MRS.   SEFTON:     No,   sir,   I am being honest, to save wasting my
16           time because we have had so much of our time wasted as
17           though we are not important and our time is insignificant,
18           so I will give you facts.
19                   P.C. Kierny made threes statements.            He is supposed
20           to have picked Andrew up from ,the fans.               He is supposed to
21           have spent ten hours with him and in his last statement he
22           says the only mark on Andrew was a mark across his
23           abdomen. Now,      I was appalled when I saw my son and that is
24           the after death photograph of Andrew.              They are facial
25           injuries and they are actually —              it's not just bruising,
26           they're facial injuries.          Behind it is the post mortem
27           report explaining those injuries.              There is the post
28           mortem r e p o r t .
29    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            Is this the body file that you
30           have?
31    MRS.   SEFTON:     This is the body file, which I have been
32           accumulating over eight and a half years.
33    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            Are you satisfied that you have got
34           all the documents now or not?
35    MRS.   SEFTON:     Sir, according to the South Yorkshire Police I
36           have all the evidence.          I no more trust the South


                                                2
 1          Yorkshire Police than I would trust Jack the Ripper.                 I
 2          think they have lied in and out of every situation.                 Sir,
 3          I can truthfully say from Richard Wells down I have not
 4          met one truthful South Yorkshire policeman and we have met
 5          an awful lot.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            What I have---
 7   MRS.   SEFTON:    The pathologist's report will be easily
 8          accessible,       I feel sure it will.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            The problem that I have is that if
10          I am going to —           I can look at the body files which are in
11          the custody of the police but it is difficult for me to
12          know without having documents from y o u .
13   MRS.   SEFTON:      There is the pathologist's report.
14   LORD JUSTICE       STUART-SMITH: Are you proposing to let me have
15          this?
16   MRS.   SEFTON:     No,    sir.     I can give you a copy of it and I can
17          let you have copies of it.
18   MR.    BONE:     All this stuff is on Andrew's body file,             isn't it?
19   MRS.   SEFTON:     That's right.        It should all be in Andrew's body
20          file and it should be accessible.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:             The only question I think at the
22          moment is whether there is anything else on the body file
23          that you have not seen.
24   MR.      SEFTON: We don't know.
25   LORD JUSTICE       STUART-SMITH: You do not know.
26   MRS.   SEFTON:      According to them,          sir,   I have got the complete
27          body file.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:             But you say you do not trust that?
29   MRS.     SEFTON: No.
30   MR.      SEFTON: I don't trust the South Yorkshire Police.
31   MRS.     SEFTON: No, sir,        I don't.
32   MRS.    FALLON: We've had two many dealings with them.
33   MR.     FALLON: I think the onus now is actually on the                other
34          side.     It is no longer the onus on us is prove that we
35          have access or we actually physically have all the
36          evidence.     What I'm suggesting to you is that the evidence



                                                 3
 1          now suggests that the onus is actually on you, on the
 2          establishment,     on the South Yorkshire Police to prove to
 3          us that we have all the information, not the other way
 4          round.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           That is what I am---
 6   MRS.   SEFTON:    There is P.C. Kierny's statement,          sir.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Can we just not all talk at the
 8          same time.
 9   MRS.   SEFTON:    Certainly.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Can just I answer the point that
11          you have made, which is         very good point if I may say so.
12          What I am anxious to do         is to look at these body files and
13          make sure that you have         had all the material from them---
14   MR.    FALLON:     Can I just cut      in there?
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Yes, but difficulty that I have in
16          doing that is that I do not know what you have got?
17   MR.    FALLON:     Can I just ask you, and I would like this to go
18          on record actually.         What I would like to see is the video
19          from the mortuary.         That has b e e n —   we know that it
20          exists.     Every single effort that has been made by anybody
21          and everybody in the Group to actually obtain a copy of
22          this video has been denied,           has been obstructed,   has been
23          patronised,     has met with a nil response.         Each and every
24          time and we are left in a very difficult position.                We are
25          left in the position where we are beginning to wonder
26          whether that video actually contains damning evidence.                 I
27          d o n 't know w ha t ---
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           What sort of evidence do you---
29   MRS.   SEFTON: Can I interrupt, please-—
30   MR.    FALLON: We don't know what evidence there is.
31   MRS.   FALLON: But if people hide things we can only surmise,
32          can't we?
33   MRS.   SEFTON:    Sorry, Leo, can I interrupt.          This is a fact,
34          sir, and you can't question it as other than a fact.               A       31
35          year old doctor would not put his professional integrity
36          on the line by pronouncing 20 people dead in the gymnasium


                                              4
 1          so early on in the afternoon when there was a fleet of
 2          ambulances waiting outside to get those victims to expert
 3          help.
 4                  Nor would he have performed such a cursory
 5          pronouncement of death without a stethoscope to check
 6          vital life signs unless he saw something within the gym
 7          which influenced him,       for example, the police had assumed
 8          death instead of life and covered the v i c t i m s ' faces with
 9          bin bags,    thereby potentially suffocating those who were
10          deeply unconscious.        This would also account for his
11          decision not to resuscitate.
12                  There were 20 the people at a very early stage that
13          that man pronounced dead.        This is Dr. Bull.   He says he
14          made no attempt to resuscitate them.
15   MR.    SEFTON:    His name crops up an awful lot.
16   MRS.   SEFTON:    Sir,     you would not.   Even the most pathetic,
17          alcoholic,    limping doctor would not do that.       He will not
18          lay his professional integrity on the line.          There is no
19          way he would do it.        He has seen something within that gym
20          that has made him decide to pronounce 20 people dead.           I
21          have photographs of bodies with bin bags over their head
22          and I certainly---
23   MRS. FALLON:             given access to ambulances that we were
24          waiting outside,       just put a bin bag in over their head
25          instead.
26   MR.    FALLON: Yes,        and what we're suggesting here is that there
27          may be evidence of that nature and perhaps even m ore---
28   MRS. FALLON:       But we don't know because we can't see it.
29   MR.    FALLON: So I        am officially requesting now, you have the
30          power, you have the power ---
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I have seen t his---
32   MR.    FALLON:     Fine,    I would like a copy of it please and I am
33          asking you to please make a copy of this available to me.
34          If you don't do it I need very good solid reasons for you
35          not doing so.        And if you're going to suggest me that I
36          might be upset I have scraped children's brains off the


                                             5
 1          road.     Before I went to university I was a fireman.          I
 2          have done jobs that people don't want to do.         You cannot,
 3          you cannot tell me that that kind of thing will upset me
 4          more than the things I have already had to deal with in my
 5          life.
 6                  I '11 tell you what does upset me more than the idea
 7          of things that have happened in the eight and half years
 8          since Hillsborough and on that night.         I'll tell you what
 9          upsets me more than        having to scrape an 8 year old child's
10          brains of the road.         It's being lied to, being covered       up
11          to, having the truth suppressed---
12   MRS. FALLON:       Having the legal system used against you when it
13          is there to represent you.
14   MR.    FALLON:     I need that video.
15   MRS. SEFTON:       Sorry,   can   I just interrupt now please.   The
16          mini-inquest summary which states that no statement was
17          taken from me when in fact I made four and all of them
18          were damning and now---
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          In what sense were they damning?
20   MRS.   SEFTON:     I said I found Andrew's body warm and I have seen
21          —   I have worked in a hospital where it has been what they
22          call an Indian Summer and I have had patients who were
23          dying and I have felt moribund people who were colder than
24          Andrew.     I am talking about 12 hours later,      11 hours
25          later---
26   MR.    FALLON:     I will testify to that as well,     I also touched
27          Andrew's body.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Just one at a time please
29          otherwise---
30   MRS.   SEFTON:     In all truth I waited months for a time of death
31           for Andrew.     I waited months for the doctor who pronounced
32          him dead.      I kept asking and asking and it is in my
33           statement and my statement will be in the file.          Oddly
34           enough when I started insisting I actually got a copy of
35          my statement,    one statement.      I also wrote to Lord Justice
36           Taylor's Inquiry I was so concerned.        I do not think my


                                             6
 1          son died until a lot later on.
 2   MR.    FALLON:        I'll agree with that.
 3   MRS.   SEFTON: Sir,       I am sorry    but that is manslaughter.        That
 4          is not just people who have not known what to do, the
 5          basics of first aid or badly provided first aid.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:             Manslaughter by whom?
 7   M R S . SEFTON:       Presumably when they were taken     into the
 8          gymnasium they were in fact covered when           the first thing
 9          they should have done was actually let those people have
10          air until they were officially pronounced dead.
11                  I          also have a great deal of reservation about the
12          times of death because of the statements by Dr. Bull and
13          also because of the fact that I waited so long.               I
14          actually waited about three months for a time of death for
15          Andrew.
16                  You have a simple scenario; a body is brought in,            it
17          is given a body number.           A policeman is there, he has a
18          report which he is filling in.            The doctor comes along and
19          says:       "Sorry, this body is dead."       So the doctor puts the
20          time of death and the name of the doctor who pronounced
21          him as dead.         I come along at half past the two the
22          following morning and say:             "This body belongs to this
23          body number, please give me a time of death" and they
24          c o u l d n 't .
25   MRS. FALLON:          But then they had to three months in order to
26          make one up.
27   MRS.   SEFTON:        Then they had three months in order to attribute
28          an lawful lot of bodies to Dr. Bull.             Sir, if you read Dr.
29          Bull's statement you will in find that in less than three
30          quarters of an hour this man pronounced 40 odd people dead
31          by the most cursory way, because he was there as a
32          spectator,         he was not there in point of fact as a doctor.
33   MR.    BONE:       But he was a police surgeon.
34   MRS.   SEFTON:        He was also a police surgeon from the South
35          Yorkshire Police, which concerns me as well.
36   MR.    BONE:       Just to get this straight what you are saying is



                                               7
 1          that either Dr. Bull pronounced too many people dead in
 2          too short a time and did so incompetently and without
 3          properly examining or he did not pronounce some of these
 4          people dead at all but it was said afterwards that he had
 5          done?
 6   MRS.   SEFTON:     They were attributed to him.
 7   MR.    BONE:     They were attributed to him?
 8   MRS.   SEFTON:     Yes.    To be truthful with you,   sir, if he had
 9          pronounced them dead under those circumstances he had
10          sadly failed in his job and his allegiance appears to be
11          more to the South Yorkshire Police than it does to the---
12   PROFESSOR SCRATON:         Sorry, before you go on I think there is an
13          important issue here which picks up on the some of the
14          concerns that were raised yesterday in one or two of the
15          other cases that I sat in on.          Crucially here we have a
16          sequence of events in which the family cannot be sure that
17          enough was done to help Andrew in the circumstances.
18                  There is no confidence in a system where once the
19          disaster plan has actually been operationalised and bodies
20          are being ..bought into the gymnasium there has to be there
21          at that point a duty of care of those bodies from those
22          people who are directly involved.
23                  The concern here is, returning us again to the issue
24          of liability and negligence,        it's not so much an act of
25          intervention,       it's an omission that the family is
26          concerned,    that not sufficient was done to identify that
27          in that situation Andrew was indeed already dead.
28                  The concern hinges on a range of factors already been
29          very graphically explained by Mrs. Sefton, but crucial to
30          this is that there cannot be any confidence at all in a
31          cursory examination,       however well qualified the doctor.
32          We have seen many examples of senior doctors, often two
33          and three at a time in other situations trying to find
34          some sign of life and two failing and one succeeding,
35          taking maybe two, three,       four,   five minutes to do that, to
36          achieve t h a t .


                                            8
 1                  In this situation,    as we stated yesterday,   Dr. Bull
2           was able to pronounce life extinct, he says confidently,
 3          on 20 people in 25 minutes.          I think that is a real
4           problem.     It's not so much about saying that Dr. Bull
 5          omitted to operate a duty of care but it does raise
 6          questions about the quality of care that was rendered
 7          available to each and every one of those people that were
 8          brought into that gymnasium.
 9                  The quite,    I think, understandable concern that the
10          families have that there were paramedics standing by,
11          there was equipment just outside the gymnasium in the many
12          ambulances that never got brought into the gymnasium and
13          was not used.        At some point we have to say,    "Who was
14          responsible for taking that decision?"          We know it was a
15          confused situation, we know it was chaotic and I am sure
16          none of us would want to find ourselves making snap
17          judgments in those situations.         However, there was a
18          professional responsibility and a duty of care to get the
19          best possible care to those individuals as they came into
20          t he gymnasium.
21                  I think the concern over the video is that probably
22          what it will demonstrate,       and    having looked at the still
23          photographs myself,        quite candidly is that   that equipment
24          was not brought in and that people who should have been
25          maybe    attending and making sure that those people were
26          dead     or maybe had some    life still in them.    That that was
27          not done quickly enough and sharply enough.          That raises a
28          question about omission rather than an actual direct act.
29   MRS.   SEFTON:      I have in actual fact put in my letter that
30          omissions which, to my mind, were divisive.          I believed it
31          then and I believe        it now and   if you don't mind,   sir, I
32          will carry on.
33                  I'm surprised at the way in which the South Yorkshire
34          force keep moving the goalposts regarding evidence.              I
35          have     it on record that it varies from,      "We can't let you
36          have     it because it was not included in the inquest", to,


                                             9
 1          "You can't have that,     it was already included in the
 2          inquest."     These men are changing the goalposts by the
 3          minute.     They are dishonest men and they are time-wasters.
 4                  There is one more thing,      sir, and that is Dr.
 5          popper's statement,     and you can check the transcript for
 6          this, that he would certify the 95 as accidental death and
 7          he would also make death certificates out for Andrew
 8          Devine and Tony Bland but they would not be filled in
 9          until later and that,     sir,    should be in the transcript.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Whereabouts in the transcript would
11          I find that?
12   MRS.   SEFTON:     At the end when he was summing-up and after the
13          verdict was brought in and he stated that he would also
14          make a statement for Andrew Devine and Tony Bland.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        They were the people who were— -
16   MRS.   SEFTON:     They lived, Andrew Devine is still alive.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Is he?
18   MR.    BONE:     He is still in a vegetative state.
19   MRS.   SEFTON:     He is recovering rapidly.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Bland has died, -I think, has he?
21   MRS.   SEFTON:     No, Tony Bland, the parents made the decision to
22          switch the life-support machine off about 3 years ago.           To
23          stop the feeding about 3 years ago.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH CLARKE:            As a result of that he died.
25   MRS.   SEFTON:     But to pre-empt a situation,      sir, by making death
26          certificates out for them that will be filled in later?
27          I'm telling you the Coroner was anything but straight.
28          His involvement was too great and his scope was too large.
29          You had a man who was beholden to the South Yorkshire
30          police,    he was beholden to the council for his job.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Why was he beholden to the South
32          Yorkshire police?
33   MRS.   SEFTON:     Because,   sir, he was very much involved at the
34          beginning on the day.       He was there.     He was there on the
35          day checking that everything was just right.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Why does that make him beholden to


                                             10
 1            the South Yorkshire police?
2      MRS.   SEFTON:       Because once the investigation started I can
 3            imagine, yes, he has to be involved,             he has to take
 4            everybody's statements.          He does not have to be physically
 5            there with Professor Usher telling everyone how they good
 6            they were setting up this mortuary.              He had far too much
 7            involvement,       sir,    far too much and it should have been
 8            taken off him from the beginning.
 9     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            That is a complex question as to
10            whether or not he should have handed it over to some other
11            coroner.        The Coroner is bound to be involved from the
12            outset,       is he not?
13     MRS.   SEFTON:        I feel sure, yes,       I feel sure he wou-ld be
14            involved.        They would notify him of the fatalities but I
15            will say that there is a statement here by Superintendent
16            Addis who had a 'phone call from Superintendent McKay at
17            twenty-five past three.           Dr. Popper went on at great
18            length saying that people were dead,             everyone was dead,
19            those who had died were already spoken for at 3.15, that
20 ,          was it.
21                    Mr.     Addis had a 'phone call from McKay saying that,
22            and it was at twenty-five past three, that there was an
23            incident at Hillsborough Stadium and fatalities may be
24            involved.        He did not receive a 'phone call saying a whole
25            host of people are dead.
26     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:             Yes.
27     MR.    FALLON:        Can I ask just how long you two have be working
28            on this case?
29     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:             I started reading the papers in the
30            second half of July.
31     MR.    FALLON:        This year?
32     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:             Yes.
33     MR.    FALLON:        1997?
34     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:             199 7.
35     MR.    BONE:     About the same time for me.
36     MR.    FALLON:        I've got to go on record to say I'm absolutely



                                                 11
 1         staggered,   absolutely befuddled that we can get so late on
 2         in the year after you have been working on this case for
 3         so long and so intimately that you go on record as not
 4         even being fully aware of the cases of Andrew Devine and
 5         Tony Bland and that you,      sir, didn't even know how Tony
 6         Bland came to die.       I find that staggering.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I did know,   at least I think I knew
 8         how Tony Bland came to die but---
 9   MR.   FALLON:    What I am saying to      you is that we have to,
10         because of the legal system in this country, we have to
11         put our faith in you and I'm asking just how much faith
12         can we put in you when you are showing of your own
13         admission so much ignorance of the facts of the case and
14         yet you're say will have such sway within this country,            it
15         will have implications for the future of the law in this
16         country.     It will have implications for how the families
17         of Hillsborough have to live the rest of their lives.
18   MRS. FALLON:     Not just Hillsborough,      it goes right the way
19         through.
20   MR.   FALLON:    It has repercussions for every future disaster,
21         this is a massive case, the ramifications of it are beyond
22         understanding and yet you appear to be making —          you
23         appear to be in a position to make a final judgment on
24         this case based on at least partial ignorance and I,
25         therefore,    have to go on record to say just how little
26         faith we have in that.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I am sorry that you feel that.     I
28         certainly did not know that Andrew Devine was still alive
29         and that he was recovering.         I knew that Bland had died.
30   MR.   FALLON:    Tony Bland.    He was    a young man, he had a name,
31         he had a future.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I knew that he had died,    I think I
33         knew but I wanted to check up from you, who know much more
34         about him than I do, that the reason why he died was
35         because the support was stopped.          There was a case about
36         it.


                                          12
 1   MRS.   SEFTON:     Yes, there was, it was an unprecedented thing.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:               I hope you will accept that I am
 3          human,    I have had a great deal to read.          I had a month's
 4          holiday in August,        I started working again in September.
 5          You think. I should not have had a holiday?
 6   MRS. FALLON:       No, what we are saying, we are genuinely not
 7          trying to get up your nose but what you to have accept is
 8          that we have had eight and a half years of repeatedly,
 9          putting our case and people going,            "Thank you ever so
10          much,    r i ght" ---
11   MR.     FALLON: "How interesting. Next."
12   MRS. FALLON:        ---and when you have had eight and a half years
13          of that you end up being very, very distrustful of any
14          kind of establishment figure whatsoever.             So what we are
15          looking for are assurances that you are actually listening
16          to us and also before I leave I would actually like to
17          know what the possibilities are, what the range of
18          possibilities are that you have open to you because
19          actually I'm not aware of what could come out of this.                So
20          to some extent here we are again putting our case forward
21          and p u t ti ng ---
22   MR.     FALLON: Divulging information            to you.
23   MRS. FALLON:       — -divulging information and I'm not actually
24          certain what the potential outcome because as far as I'm
25          aware I don't think there has been this kind of situation
26          before.      We either have inquiries or we don't have
27          inquiries, but a pre-inquiry inquiry all sounds a novelty
28          to me.      So I would like to know before we leave what those
29          options are.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:               Can I answer that or try to answer
31          it.     Did you come on Monday?
32   MRS     FALLON:      No,     I didn't,    I was working.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:               Have you seen my terms of
34          reference?
35   MRS.     SEFTON: No,     sir.
36   MRS.    FALLON: No,      I haven't.


                                                 13
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We can provide a copy of the terms.
 2          I tried to explain on Monday what ray terras of reference
 3          are.    They are to look, for fresh evidence which might
 4          affect any of the judicial proceedings that have occurred
 5          so far.     By that I mean the outcome of the Lord Taylor's
 6          Inquiry; the verdict at the inquest of accidental death;
 7          the decision of the prosecuting authorities not to
 8          prosecute anybody for any criminal offence and the
 9          decision of the Police Complaints Authority not to pursue
10          disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Duckenfield and Mr.
11          Murray.
12                  Those basically are the terms of reference.      What I
13          am looking for is evidence-which has not previously been
14          considered by any inquest or tribunal which might affect
15          those decisions.
16   MRS.   SEFTON:     A scenario you are looking for, sir, if you will
17          excuse me, is you have 10 people in the         gym, right,   and 2
18          vicars or eminent people saying,       "Well,   you know what, we
19          could not get them to die so what happened was we saw the
20          South Yorkshire police actually shoot them but that never
21          came up because that was a real cover u p " , and it has to
22          be as clear-cut as that, does it?
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       No,    it does not have to be as.
24          clear-cut as that.
25   MRS.   SEFTON:     So you will look for new evidence within the old
26          evidence?
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Of course I will, this is why I am
28          listening to you and this is w h y ---
29   MRS. FALLON:       I'm sorry, we don't want to be      aggressive or
30          antagonistic.     You really,    really d.o have to put yourself
31          in our position.     We are talking yet again to people with
32          absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that -- because all our
33          past experiences lead to the fact that, one, we won't be
34          listened to, and, two, anything we produce will be used
35          against u s .
36   MR.    BONE:     Perhaps I can add a couple things to what Sir


                                            14
 1          Murray has said.    First of all,   I think we do understand,
 2          we are beginning to understand very clearly,         if we didn't
 3          before, the-feeling that people in Liverpool have got
 4          about this whole, awful business from start to finish.
 5               Secondly,    in reading our terms of reference, which I
 6          have just given to Mrs.    Sefton, you will see that we are
 7          here to make recommendations to the Home Secretary.              Sir
 8          Murray can't just strike down inquest verdicts, or
 9          whatever.     His terms of reference don't allow him to do it
10          and the law d o e s n ’t allow him to do it.
11               Thirdly,    at the end of the terms of reference is a
12          very wide statement of what we can do.         We are making
13          recommendations to the Home Secretary,         it says,   "Sir
14          Murray can recommend, as a result of his Scrutiny, any
15          course of action which he thinks might be in the public
16          interest."     That is rather wider than just looking for new
17          evidence and so on.
18   MRS.   SEFTON:     Can you tell me what exactly this extremely
19          dubious term "in the public interest" means?
20   MR.    FALLON:     It's a fascinating---
21   MRS.   SEFTON:      Sir, we have had it from everybody,      "We can't
22          let you see this video because it's not in the public
23          interest."     They did not go before the jury; it wasn't in
24          the public interest.      Alan Green chose not to prosecute
25          because it wasn't in the public interest.
26                So what is the public interest?      Because this force,
27          the South Yorkshire force,     I say it without any
28          hesitation,    has totally - in spite of what Lord Justice
29          Taylor said - this South Yorkshire force had totally
30          vindicated itself in the eye of the public.          They have
31          made themselves invincible.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       In what way?
33   MRS.   SEFTON:     Their attitude is: throw anything you like in,
34          say anything you want, we will win.       I always remember
35                         the Police Federation man, telling me that the
36          person with the longest purse strings will win.            So it



                                         15
 1        doesn't how much evidence we have or how much evidence -we
 2        don't have.
 3             Sir, this force has vindicated itself and, more
 4        importantly,     it has made itself invincible and when people
 5        are allowed to do that they are a danger.       How many years
 6        on will it be before we have another      Hillsborough because
 7        it will happen again because nothing has ever sunk in with
 8        that force, except covering their backsides, hiding
 9        evidence and making sure we go away.
10             I don't know how long I'm going to live but
11        regardless they will take over.       I have a grandchild,   sir,
12        I would like to be able to say to my grandchild:       If
1-3       you're ever in any possible trouble please approach a
14        policeman.     Sir,   I can't do that, not with what I know.      I
15        cannot do that.       It's not an ideal world but I would like
16        to think that I would be able to take my grandchild aside
17        and say: please respect the law, uphold the law and trust
18        the police.      How can I say it when these policemen have
19        placed themselves above the law and that is what they did.
20         They never thought for one second,     sir, that we would ever
21         come back and want to see these statements, these
22         conflicting statements, the false evidence, the nonsense
2,3        that went on all to cover---
24    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Just a moment, the false evidence,
25         by that you are referring mainly to Dr. Bull, are you?
26    PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Can I just to make a point on this at the
27         moment that might help.      I think, as I made clear in the
28         comments I made on Monday morning,     I think that one of the
29         issues that is problematic relating to the terms of
30         reference is the interpretation of what is constructed as
31         fresh evidence.      What do we mean by fresh evidence?     Is
32         that evidence that has never been previously in the public
33         domain?     Is that evidence that has been taken, put before
34         the inquiries and not used, in other words,     selected out
35         for want of a better phrase.
36              I don't want to rehearse all that again but the


                                         16
 1       reason that I am raising it now is because specifically in
 2       relation to this case there is clear concern over the
 3       quality of some of the evidence that is in the body file
 4        and which has been so significant in underpinning the
 5        circumstances in which Andrew Sefton is said to have lost
 6        his life.
 7               There are two sets of police statements; one from a
 8        P.C.   Shipley, one from a P.C. Kierny.     Again, we find by
 9        looking at these statements not only do they conflict with
10        each other but the statements themselves conflict,
11        particularly Shipley's statements.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Who is the other one?
13   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    Kierny.    Particularly Shipley's statement,
14        where there is the quite clear discrepancy in his story as
15        told in own handwriting on A4 notepaper and the eventual
16        statement made to the West Midlands Police where he refers
17        back to this issue.
18               I think this is the point, this goes to the heart of
19        many of the families'      concerns.   That it is not just that
20        -- this evidence to a lot of the families is fresh
21        evidence to them and they have had to move hell and high
22        water in order to get to this evidence,       as you are aware,
23        in order     get these statements.     Previously they were
24        working on nothing more than their summary sheets, which
25        were scant     to say the least.
26               They have now got the statements that have come
27        through in dribs and drabs over the years and low and
28        behold long after the inquest is finished they find
29        conflicting statements, between the statements, they find
30        conflict and contradictions within the statements.        They
31        have never, returning to a point I made yesterday, they
32        have never been able to test the quality of that evidence
33        through cross-examination.
34               The problem it seems to me that this could easily be
35        defined out as constituting fresh evidence or significant
36        evidence simply because it has been put before the


                                         17
 1          inquiries, whether or not it has being used in seemingly
 2          now is immaterial.     I think that is one of the crucial
 3          issues.     One of the crucial issues of this case, for
 4          example,    is the status of one particular statement by P.C.
 5          Shipley,    a first statement which is not dated, which is in
 6          his own handwriting and is not witnessed.        I don't know---
 7   MRS.   SEFTON:     He has signed it.
 8   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       I would like to know,    I am sure the
 9   families    would like to know, what is the actual official
10               status of a statement like this because it is quite
11               unusual---
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I will certainly look into this.       I
13          think you may have been here yesterday when I dealt with
14          what I understand is the position with regard to these
15          statements, but I will say it again because Mrs.        Sefton
16          was not here.
17               What happened was that on the day itself all. the
18          police officers who were involved in any way in the case
19          were told go away and write out in their own handwriting
20          or type out by themselves their recollection of what had
21          happened.     That, what I might call homemade statement so
22          to speak, was then submitted to other officers in the
23          South Yorkshire Police to make sure that the statement was
24          in proper form.     By that,    as I understand it, what they
25          meant was that anything which was not admissible as
26          evidence should be cut out of it and things of that sort.
27               Therefore there are some alterations to the original
28          statements before they were submitted to the West Midlands
29          Police.     I propose to examine the original draft
30          statements or the original handwritten statements,         compare
31          them with the ones that were,        if one can use the word,
32          'edited'    to see to what extent there is any significant
33          difference between them.        That is one of the things that I
34          am proposing to do.
35                I        have looked at one or two of them and I went to
36          look at the police archives about ten days ago and I


                                            18
 1          looked at some at random.       In some cases the alterations
 2          are quite insignificant and trivial,      in other cases they
 3          are more significant but they are, certainly the ones I
 4          looked at, what has been cut out are observations of
 5          comment or opinion, which it may be perfectly proper to be
 6          have been cut out.       That is an issue which I am going to
 7          look at, it is an important aspect of my Scrutiny.
 8                The statements were then I think formally made to the
 9          West Midlands Police and various police officers made
10          various statements at different times.       By and large the
11          pattern was that having given an account of what they did
12          during the day,      at that stage they did not know who the
13          people were that they had handled by and large, they did
14          not know who they had tried to resuscitate, they did not
15          know who they had carried down to the gymnasium and so on
16          and so forth.
17                There was then a long process of trying to tie up the
18          individual police officers with the particular deceased.
19          That is was a complicated process,      it involved very often
20          looking at video stills trying to identify both the
21          deceased person and the police officer concerned.
22                You will probably have seen in the body files similar
23          sorts of statements that I have been talking about.         I
24          have seen dozens of them which read something like this:
25          "Further to my statement of 15th April I am now shown
26          photograph X Y X / 2 .   I recognise myself as being the police
27          officer concerned at in that picture."        There then has to
28          be an identification of the person who he is dealing with,
29          either carrying---
30   MRS.   SEFTON:     Sorry,   sir, can I just stop you there?
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Would you just allow me to finish
32          first.     There then has to be an identification of a
33          similar sort between the body,       so to speak, and the
34          picture,    and in many cases this is done I think by
35          relatives or whatever it may be saying:        "Yes, that is my
36          son in the photograph."        In other cases it is done by a


                                           19
 1          continuity of police officers'        statements where the
2           policeman says:       "Yes, that is me carrying that body down
 3          to the end."       You then get another police officer who
 4          says:     "I took over that body and I took him to the
 5          gymnasium.      He was pronounced dead at such and such time.
 6          Another police officer was then directed to stay with the
 7          body until it was identified by a relative."
 8                  That is the general pattern of how it went.          I think
 9          anyone will appreciate in the chaos, is probably not too
10          strong a word, of what was happening that it is not a
11          particularly easy task to trace those things through.               I
12          have not the slightest doubt that mistakes have been made
13          in the course of assimilating these files.          I think it
14          would astonishing if they had not been.
15                  One   of the things that has troubled me is the fact
16          that a lot of people since they have had access to the
17          body files have said that there are a whole lot of
18          discrepancies here and we do not really know what
19          happened.
20                  The problem that I have is this;      I do not quite see
21          how any further investigation,       full-scale investigation at
22          this stage is actually ever going to resolve those
23          problems.       I can look into them,    I can try and resolve
24          conflicts.       In some cases it is perfectly obvious that
25          there has been a misidentification of a particular person
26          by a particular police officer, but in other cases it is
27          much more difficult. We had a           case this morning where---
28   MR.    FALLON:       Excuse me, we are very short on time and this
29          really to me seems largely insignificant.
30   MRS.   SEFTON:          Sir, can I just say one-
31   MR.    FALLON:        I think this is very becoming--
32   MRS.   SEFTON:        This is actually something rather different.
33          This man       dealt with no-one.    Would you agree? This    man       in
34          his first statement, presumably nearer the day, dealt with
35          absolutely no-one.       In this statement he did not deal with
36          a soul.       Is that not so?


                                            20
 1   MR.    BONE:     It seems---
2    MRS. FALLON:       No mistaken---
 3   MRS.   SEFTON:     No mistaken identity,    sir.   He dealt with no-one.
 4          In this he suddenly deals with Andrew.         Sir, that is
 5          corrupt.     That has been made to fit this.      That man came
 6          to my house because I thanked the fans that helped,           I
 7          invited the policeman as well,       I wasn't going to
 8          differentiate.     In here he speaks about he suddenly
 9          decides he's dealt with several, does he not, Mr. Bone?
10   MR.    BONE:     He does, yes.
11   MRS.   SEFTON:     In this one he dealt with no-one.      He was simply
12          in Nesbitt's line.        In this one he dealt with several.        We
13          didn't have these statements when I invited this man to my
14          home and I said:        "Can you be sure it was Andrew?" and he
15          said:     "I can because I only dealt with Andrew before I
16          was called into Nesbitt's line."        Three different
17          versions,    sir, that is corrupt.
18   MR.    FALLON:     I think what you are saying is extremely
19          charitable.     We all recognise that human beings in a
20          situation like that will make mistakes involving
21          m i sidenti ficatio n.    You have painted a very, very
22          charitable picture of what may well have gone on that
23          evening.
24                  What has transpired from our point of view ever since
25          then has been something quite, quite different.           Whereas
26          the inconsistencies on the night, there appears to have
27          been a far more organised and schematic approach to how we
28          were dealt with and how the evidence that accrued on that
29          night was dealt with ever since.
30   MRS    FALLON:     Because we were supposed to go away, we were
31          supposed to make cursory inquiries, we were supposed to
32          have body numbers given to policemen, we were supposed to
33          say,    "Thank you ever so much", and go away.      9 years later
34          we are still here and it is getting on their nerves now.
35          In 27, 29, 45 years we will still be here because those
36          questions are still there and it is not enough to say,


                                            21
 1          "Oh, there was some confusion on the night."
2    MR.    FALLON:    Of course there would be confusion on the night.
 3   MRS. FALLON:      But if it turns out, and we believe that there is
 4          evidence to show, that it was not just about confusion, it
 5          was not just about chaotic situation,        it was about a hell
 6          of a lot more our questions are,        "What is going to be done
 7          with these people?"       We all forgive chaos, we all forgive
 8          misunderstandings and confusion, we are human.         But we do
 9          not forgive blatant corruption, we do not and we follow it
10          to the bitter end.
11   MRS.   SEFTON:    Sir, they have taken a policeman who had nothing
12          to do and was doing nothing and rather than have 1,100
13          policemen standing round, which was who was there, they
14          changed it into this,      "Give him a body, make him look
15          busy."     It was my son and it was my child and I do not
16          believe he was dead when Dr. Bull pronounced him dead.             If
17          I did I would have walked away from it.         You cannot spend
18          II hours with a young man and say that he was unmarked.
19          Mr. Bone, you have seen the photograph.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: _ Yes.
21   MRS.   SEFTON:     I believe these were concocted statements, sir.
22   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       Can I make one crucial remark here, which
23          might help.     I think   that the portrayal of how the police
24          statements came into      being by yourself,    I think that
25          portrayal is more than generous.          It's almost unheard of
26          for police officers to be sent away to write their
27          recollections of an event.          They usually make up their
28          pocket books and then make their statements as soon after
29          the event on Criminal Justice note paper.          This did not
30          happen.
31                I think why the families are concerned here is for
32          two reasons.     One, there is the opportunity here for it to
33          be collusion.     The senior members of the force, there is
34          already,    right from the outset their actions are in doubt.
35          That was very clear from the immediate aftermath.          Those
36          senior officers had the opportunity to look at the


                                           22
 1        recollections, we won't call them statements, to look at
 2        those recollections and advise changes.
 3                They can do that in two w a y s .   Things that are in
 4        those statements that they don't like they can ask to be
 5        removed.       Things that they feel were over-emotional they
 6        can ask to be removed.        But,   equally, they can ask for
 7        things to be added.
 8                I think what Mrs.    Sefton is demonstrating here is
 9        just one example where a recollection sheet,         I think by
10        mistake,       found it's way into Mrs. Sefton's possession.
11   MRS. SEFTON:        I actually think it was given to me by mistake
12        too,    sir.
13   PROFESSOR SCRATON:        That that recollection sheet goes from a
14        general comment on that police officer's behaviour on the
15        day written in the immediate aftermath to many, many weeks
16        later,    in fact September, making a statement in which he
17        now can recollect very clearly who he did and didn't deal
18        with.     That would be an example of what I would consider
19        something being added to.
20                Equally,    there is now clearly .a situation where I
21        think many police officers were asked to remove things
22        from their statement that maybe didn't necessarily sit
23        well on the shoulders .of their seniors.
24                I don't think that we can have any confidence in the
25        situation that is so far removed from normal procedure.
26        Normal procedures were broken here.
27                It was very clear to me reading through a lot of this
28        material,       it's absolutely clear that this was done prior
29        to the West Midlands police taking statements from those
30        officers.
31                I would encourage you to look very carefully not only
32        at the recollections where they still exist, and I have a
33        fear that they might not be in the archive.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I think there are.
35   PROFESSOR SCRATON:        Some will be, but not all because I think
36        that one of the big issues here is that some of those

 1          police officers refused to actually change their
2           statements and I think we have to look very carefully at
 3          that.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       How do you know that?
 5   PROFESSOR SCRATON:      I will be making a further submission to you
 6          on this in the next few w e e k s .     What I would add to that
 7          is that it really concerns me in terms of the way in which
 8          that process occurred.      I don't believe it was off-the-
 9          cuff.     I don't believe it was done in the usual way of a
10          senior officer saying to a junior officer,         "Just give me
11          your recollections,     I'll go through it,     I will smarten up
12          your statement."      I .think it was systemic,    I think it was
13          institutionalised.      I don't think it stopped with just the
14          senior officers.      I think that it involved legal opinion.
15                  That is of great concern to me that prior to the
16          police statements being made to the West Midlands police
17          they went through a process involving legal opinion and
18          senior officers and the statements that eventually saw the
19          light of day had very little,         in some cases, to do with
20          recollections that were written initially.
21                   I think that is sailing very, very close to the
22          procedural wind.
23   MRS.   SEFTON:      Mr. Bone, you have read both statements.         Would
24          you say that in the first statement he dealt with anyone?
25   MR.    BONE:     He doesn't say so.
26   MRS. SEFTON:       If it was written within a few days      of you
27          doing —     if you were driving along the road and      you
28          knocked somebody down or you saw somebody knocked down and
29          that evening you had to go home and describe something
30          that you had done,    would you remember it?
31   MR.    BONE:      I think you probably would, yes.
32   MRS.   SEFTON:      You would remember it for quite a few weeks.           He
33          has not dealt with anyone.          This statement has been added
34          to,     sir, and it is corrupt.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I have got the point on this.        I
36          will be looking into that.          Thank you very much for


                                           24
 1          coming.    I have got another family to see now but I take on
 2          board what you have said and if there is anything more
 3          that you want t o ---
 4   M R S . SEFTON:    Sir,   something else that should be really looked
 5          into and truly is the fact that,      I have already mentioned
 6          it, but it is actually very serious - the Coroner
 7          preempting death on two people who lived.       One lived until
 8          3 years later and the other gentleman is still live.         Any
 9          coroner who can do that I'm afraid he's got his facts a
10          little bit twisted.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I have got your point on that.
12   PROFESSOR SCRATON:         Just one little addendum to that.   I think
13          it is something that we should all bear in mind in looking
14          at the medical evidence which was so certain and so
15          clearly presented to the mini-inquest,      that we always
16          think of medical evidence as being scientific and the
17          example of Andrew Devine being diagnosed as being in a
18          persistent vegetative state, which meant there would be
19          nil chance of recovery long-term, bodes well for us to
20          remember that the fact that he.' s now making a recovery
21          means that medical opinion is not always as scientific and
22          accurate---
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         You do not have to remind me of
24          that,   I am very well aware of the fallibility of medical
25          evidence.     I have had many cases of medical negligence,      I
26          have had many cases where there has been conflicting
27          medical views,      criminal and civil and I am very well aware
28          people's opinions are not infallible any more than legal
29          opinions are not infallible.
30   MRS,   SEFTON:     If it was medical negligence on 20 people you are
31          talking a huge amount.
32   MR.    FALLON:     I would like to leave this with you,   it is an
33          official formal request within the content of the meeting
34          for the video which I have been pressing for on a number
35          of occasions.       If that's all right with you I would like
36          to leave that with you.       The address and telephone number


                                           25
1          is there.
2   MRS.   SEFTON:     Sir, can we have a copy of the transcript?
3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Of course.
4   M R S . SEFTON:    When and where?
5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I am afraid it may be a little
6          while before it is ready.
7   MRS.   SEFTON:     I think Mr. Bone said about a week.

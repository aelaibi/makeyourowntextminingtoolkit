               M y duties        for the         event were as a me mb er                of Serial       1, w hich       had

               At a p p r o x i m a t e l y     1105 that         date    I took      up rny p os ition on the

perimeter        track,        in front         of the N o r th Stand,                and    level w it h      the

centre      line     of the         pitch,      and thus was m i d w ay betw ee n the                      ends      of

that stand.



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1145 that date                s pe ct at or s    began entering             the      ground

and    taking seats            in the N or th S t a n d .             This was also            hap pe ni ng        at

various       other     locations w it hi n the ground.                          There were,           at the        time,

the s pe c t at or s       b egan entering              the    ground,       numerous         stewards,        wi th in

the N o r t h Stand,           and to the           best      of my     r e co ll ec ti on all         entrances,

were ma n ne d       by at      least       one    steward,          a l t h o u g h some     en tr an ce s    had more

than one steward on d u t y .                     All    the     stewards        a pp ea r ed to be d irecting

people      to their        r espective           seats,       and    I have      no    cri ti ci sm of their

actions.         At that        time       the rnood of the             crowd was           quite    jovial,

a l t h o u g h there were           very few spec ta to rs              in the ground at that                     time.



Prior     to comme n ci ng           duty,      we had been told                that a hot meal w o u l d be

p rovided for our              serial       after       1.13pm       (1315)     whi ch we w o u l d         take at

staggered        intervals           before       commencement           of the g a m e .           At 2 . 1 3 p m      <

1413)     having       r ec eived no          i ns tr uctions         to take a meal,               I made

e nq u i r i e s with other           offi cers         on the serial            and d i s co v er e d      they had

a l r e a d y taken a meal.                At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 3 5 p m    (1423)       that    date        I

left my       position and went                 to the        rear of the N or th Stand,                   where        I

o b t ained a meal.             On    leaving        I noti ce d        that     the S pi on Hop,           a nd     the

S o u t h Stand a p p e a r e d       to be almost             full,     wher ea s      the L a p p i n g s Lane

Terrace,       West S t an d and N orth Stand,                       a p p e a r e d only half         full,       w ith

large areas          of the         seats     unoccupied.



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 5 0 p m     (1450)      I r e t u rn ed     to my      p os ition        in front          of

the N orth Stand.               I    noti c e d that the m oo d of the                      crowd was       now more

a ggresive,        wit h    large      numbers 'of s pe ct at or s               standing,          and    s ta nd in g      on

the seats.              Large    numbers        of the s pectators               had o bv i ou s ly been

d ri n k i n g    intoxi cants,          w h ic h was     re fl ec te d by their agg res i ve

behaviour and             chanting        d ir ec te d    towards N o t t i n g h a m Forest             supporters.



1 was      in poss es si on of my own personal                        issue M o t o r o l a       radio,     w h ic h

was    tuned          to channel       S3 for     the     purpose       of the d u t y .          There     had been

throughout             the day heavy traffic                 over    the    radio?     but as the kick of +

approached,             and from about 2 , 3 0 p m             (1430)      there was        very    little,       and

for a long             period whilst         I was having my meal,                  there was           no traffic

on the      radio.



The m a t c h was         started        on time,        and shor tl y after           the kick          off,    I took

my seat.              At this** point      1 noticed there were                   several        people w a lk in g

along     the         perimeter     track.        1 spoke        to one youth,             who    showed me a

ticket all             he w o ul d say was        "She told me             to come a long          here".        I was

unable      to a s c e r t a i n who       he was        referring         to,    and e sc or t ed him from

the    perimeter          track     to the e nt rance at the                 rear of the N or th Stand.

1 saw PC 234 8 H a ns o n              had also        d et ai n ed a y o ut h on the             track and was

also     esc o rt in g him off            the    perimeter          track.



When     I returned           to my      position a few minu te s after                     I saw that          there

was    some       problem at        the L e p p in g s Lane          terrace.         P eo pl e were        climbing

over     the      perimeter       fence,        onto     the    pitch,      and    it a p p e a r e d    to be an

attempt          to    invade    the     pitch.        The     centre      pen of the terraces                I could

see was          full,    where     as    there was          room at       the front        of both the N or th

and S o u t h         pens.     I h ea rd some very             broken m es sa g es         over     the    radio

but because             of the    crowd noise and the very poor                         re ce pt io n was        unable

to make          out a ny th i ng      that was        being     said.       B e ca us e    of the       s i t u at i on

and the          p o s s ib il it y of further           crowd problems             in the N o r th Stand,              1

remained s t anding              facing      the N o rt h Stand,            as    did other        officers,         on
                                                                                                          P AGE

either       side of me.           By this       time,   the    crowd,      w hi ch had been        climbing

over    the     perimeter         fence     of the L ep pi ng s Lane         terrace,        had b egun to

swell    and was now e n cr o ac hi ng             onto the      playing area of the               pitch

ad ja ce nt     to the     goal.         A number     of P ol i ce O ff icers        b egan app ea ri ng

from various           points a ro u nd the ground,             and began making              their way

towards L ep pi ng s Lan e              terrace.      I saw two         officers whom         I cannot

identify        come down the            centre aisle       of the N o rt h S t a n d , d i r e ct l y         in

front    of me.         T he y    climbed over        the   perimeter wall,           ju mp ed on to the

track and began to                run towards       the Leppings- Lane             terraces.        A

Li ve rp oo l      spectator       ju mp ed onto the        track,       after     the two       officers       had

left and began s ho ut i ng               "I want     his   number".         He said that          one    of the

officers        had strc.uk him.             I did not see either               of the o ff icers         strike

an yo ne whilst         jump in g       down onto     the track,         I p ersauded the m a n           to get

back    into the N o r th Stand,              and g rudgingly,           he did so,



I. a ga in    looked towards             the Leppi ng s Lan e       terraces,       where        I saw

several       hundred      s pe ct a to r s were      now on the         perimeter        track,    and

playing area.            There were          numerous Po li ce           O ff ic er s at the front            of

the    terraces,        but      the    crowd was     such that           I could not see what was

happening.           There wer e         still    people    climbing        over    the     perimeter

fence,       and    I saw that          now Po li ce O ff ic e rs       were a s si st in g      them    to

climb over.           P eo pl e were        climbing     from the        rear    of the      central      pen,

into    the West Stand,                and were    being a s s i s t e d    by people a l r e a d y       in

the West Stand.



The    crowd       in the N o r t h S ta nd were         b ec om in g    i ncreas in gl y more

agg res i v e , s ho ut in g a buse at myself               and other        officers       on     the

perimeter          track a nd      s h or tl y after     this we         were    r ei nf or ce d by

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20 other       officers.       This   a n t a g o n i s e d the   s up po rt er s

even more and they were                   becoming more and more aggressive..

W he n    I a ga i n looked          towards       the L e p p i n g s Lane       terrace,     I saw that

some      of the    crowd were al most                to the half way             line on the       pitch.

The      players and       of fi ci al s      had by this           time    left the       playing area,

a n d there were          now a p p r o x i m a t e l y    100 — 200 Police O f f i ce r s             on the

playing area,            the m a j o r i t y of Police             officers       being    o c c up i ed at the

L e p p i n g s Lane     terraces.           By this time           I saw that        several      peopie who

were      o b viously     inju r e d were          bing a s s i s t e d    by s pectators and Police

Officers,         to the     p erimeter           track.        It very soon became            obvious        to me

that      something was          s er i ou l sy wrong,          this      opinion was       r ei nf o r c e d whe n

I saw      people       being    carrie d across             the    pitch,       on s tr et ch er s and

broken bill b o a r d s .          T hey were         being        carried towards         the S p i o n Ho p       end

of the ground             w h er e    they were          being a t t e n d e d    to by St John's

A mbul a n c emen.



At this      point       1 left my          position and went              towards     the L e p p in g s     Lane

terrraces.          I was       j oi ne d    by several         s pe ct at or s who were        carrying an

e mpty     billboard.           1 went wit h them to the                   perimeter       track    in front          of

the L e p pings Lane            terraces,         just     to the      rear of the         goal.       The scene

was a b s o l u t l y    chaotic.           The    perimeter        fence     of the      cental    pen

adjacent         to the    e m e r g en c y gate had the m es h of the fence                       pulled out

from the bottom,             and was         curled upwards            and outwards         towards       the       top

of the fence. T here were               a large          number      of Police O f f i ce r s       a ss i st i ng

p e o p 1e out of         the     central         pen,    both over        the    top of the       fence and

from the e m e rg e nc y g a t e .            I could see what a p p e ar e d to be a

s ubstantial        number       of    people        lying at       the    bottom of the t e rr ac e            steps

who were         not moving,          I remember          h av i ng the     impr es si on that t hey were

just a tangle            of arms and          legs.        We   took      the h o a r d i n g boards      just       to

the      right    of the goals,             w here    lying     on the grass          on their      backs       I

saw a p p r o x i m a t l e y six      or seven          people.       Coats were         c ov ering    the

                                                                                                         R410

faces    of these       people.         1 checked the        first 3 or 4 of these                  people

a nd saw that       they were          ob v io us ly dead,     w it h faces        d i s c o l o u r e d as    if

they had been asp hy xi at ed .              S l i g h t l y to the     right of these            bodies,           I

saw a man       lying    face     down,     on the grass           he a pp ea r ed to be         in the

recovery       position.         1 e xa mined h i m , and          found that       he was       breathing,

his    eyes were       open,     but    1 was unable       to get any further                response          from

him.     Together       w it h several       other    s upporters,          he was      c a re fu ll y   lifted

onto    the    bil lb oa rd an d then taken to the S p io n Hop end of the

ground.        There    he was     carefully       placed on to the grass an d                    I placed

him    in the    r ec ov er y    position.        I again      checked him an d f ound that                     he

was    still    b reathing      but     I was unable       to get any futher               response.            X

remained wit h the man for seveal                    m i nu t es    until    I was a p p r o a c h e d        by a

man    in his early       thirties        who stated he was a doctor.                      He made a

qui ck exarni nation of the man ans                  st at ed he was         not    in any       imrnediat e

danger and that          he w o u ld take       charge     of him.



I then    returned       to the L ep pings Lane            end of the ground w here                   1 saw a

Police Officer who              I do not know.          He was attem pt in g            to lift a young

man,    in his early t w e n t i e s , who a p p e a r e d          to have a       leg    injury and was

having    d if fi c ul t y walking.          I assisted        the officers           to the      .lift the

man,    and we    b e tw ee n us,       carried him towards             the S pi on H o p end of the

ground,       where we sat        him down on the          perimeter         track.        T here were a

number    of a m bu l an ce me n,       and St John's a m b u l an c e men,             who at      that       time

were,    o cc upied wit h        the    injured    persons.          Having a s c e r t a i n e d he was

not    in any danger        1 r et ur ned towards          the L ep pi ng s Lane           end of the

ground»



When    1 reached       the half w ay        line,     1 saw that        there were a            line     of

Po li ce O ff icers      e x t e n d e d across    the entire w id th of the                 pitch.           I was

told try Inspector W hi te              to join the       line of officers an d                took      up a
                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                             R41Q

position near            to the S o u th S ta nd an d             players       tunnel.      Up until        this

time     1 had not s ee n any senior                  o ff ic er s       either    on the    pitch of at the

L ep pings Lane          end.



Whilst at this             location,          1 saw n um er ou s Liverpool             s up po r te r s who were

in an e x t re m el y d i s t r e s s e d state*                some were       so drunk     they     could only

wal k w ith a s s i st an ce .              Most   of the       suppo rt er s were      s ho ut i ng abuse at

us,     w hi c h under         the    c ir cumstances was          understandable«



O n several         occasions,          we had to       intervene,          when some No 11 i ng ham

Forest      s u pporters         swated       in the S o ut h Stand,            shouted at the Liverpool

s upporters         to    leave       the    pitch.     The Li ve rp oo l         s up portes were

responding          by t h re at en in g       the N o t t i n g h a m Forest       s u pp or te rs   a nd

at te m p t i n g   to get       into       the South Stand,



I remained at this                   location for a c o ns id er ab le             length    of time and

e v e n t a u l l y an a n n o u n c e m e n t was made          over     the   public a d dr es s       system to

the effect          that       the m a tc h had been            c a nc el le d and the      ground       should be

e v a c u a t e d as     soon as       possible.



Due     to the       c ir cumstances,          it was     some      time    before     the g ro u nd      cleared

and     1 was       involved         in clearing       people      f r o m the     pitch,    during       this

time     I found         two    or three m e mb er s        of m y serial,          w hom   I had      not   seen

since     just      before       the    incident.



W hen    the ground            had been       c om pl et el y    cleared of s up po rt er s           we were

i nstructed to s t an d by              in the N o rt h S t a n d         for a de-b ri ef in g.          Prior     to

going      to the N o r th Stand,              I a t t e n d e d at      the gymnasium,        w he re    I spoke

to Police C o n s t ab l e            Buckley.        I a sk ed     if    1 could assist,         but was        told

that     he was        unable        to a ll ow anyone          into     the gymnasium-          1 then..

Superintendent             Mole.       It was     p ar ti cu l ar l y     r eassuring        to see Mr Mole,

who had been my Divis io na l                  C o mm an de r    for a number          of years,        and had

only t r a n s f e r r ed     to B D iv is i on a p p r o x i m a t e l y one week            prior      to the FA

the    incident.



I have       been a P o l i c e Offi cer          for eight and a half years.                        During        that

time    I have a t t e n d e d the vast m a j o r i t y            of home fixtures              of S he f fi e ld

For    the    past    three and a half y ears                   I have     been a C o m m u n i t y C on stable

I have       been a l l o c a t e d    the same      p os it io n on the          perimeter        track      in

serious      incidents and have been well                        policed.          On the         last S emi-final

which     involved L i ve rp oo l          suppo rt er s       I noticed that as                  on this

occasion,       a large         percent age       of the       crowd,        in the N or th S t a n d , were

o b v i o u s l y under     the    influence        of   i ntox i c a n t s , which was             ref le ct ed        in

their ag g re si ve         beh av io ur    generally,          w hi ch      became worse whe n

decisions       on the field of play went a g ai ns t L i v e r p o o l .                           F o l l o w in g    the

Semi-Final           in 1988 w he n the ground had been cleared,                             there was

c o n s i derable      damage      to be seen to the                 seats    in the N o rt h Stand.                   In

spirits      found b e ne a th seats w hi ch had been vacated by L i ve rp oo l

sup po r t e r s .



Following       the     incident,         when    I was a s s i s ti n g       injured fans,              the

a tt empts    of all who were              present       on the        pitch were        very m u c h h am pe r ed

by members        of the       press who were            present        taking      ph ot og ra ph s         and

rnaking video          r e cordinga .



Following       the     b r ie fi ng     I did not either              before      or after         the      incident

  My   initial     r ea ct io n f ollowing     the events were             of shock and horrer

  that     such an      incident    could o c c u r .      I have always        been of the        opinion

  that     the   policing a rr an ge m en t s at H i l l s b o r o u g h were      of the best of

  an y ground w i t h i n S o u t h Yorkshire,            having w or ke d at all        of the

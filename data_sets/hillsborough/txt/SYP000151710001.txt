            SUBJECT:     HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - 15 APRIL 1989


                I have to report that on Tuesday, 18■.                 having been
                cancelled from a
                                 I was deputed to work a duty of 9<00 am to 5-00 pm
                                                motor vehicle: My initial duty was
                to attend at the Police Headquarters, Sheffield, and to be at the
                disposal of Lord Justice Taylor and the officers from West Midlands
                who were coming up to conduct enquiries into the Hillsborough
                Disaster.

                Together with the other Staff car, I attended at the Midland Train
                Station to collect Lord Justice Taylor, and conveyed him to the
                Police Headquarters for a meeting with the Chief Constable.  Later
                that date, I again transported Lord Justice Taylor to Hillsborough
                Football Ground in the black Staff Granada.   I waited outside the
                stadium for his return, together with the other Staff cars and
                after he had received a conducted tour of the Leppings Lane end at
                Hillsborough Football Ground, he returned to the vehicle, briefly
                speaking to the press that were gathered outside, prior to again
                sitting in the rear of the car.

                At this time he was joined by Mr Dear, the then Chief Constable of
                West Midlands Police, both men being seated in the rear of the
                Staff car.  Prior to the vehicle setting off back to Headquarters,
                Lord Justice Taylor and Mr Dear started a conversation, which I
                clearly heard, Lord Justice Taylor saying to Mr Dear, "I SUPPOSE
                YOU REALISE THAT TO GIVE THIS INQUIRY ANY CREDIBILITY WE HAVE TO
                 APPORTION THE MAJORITY OF THE BLAME ON THE POLICE?"        Mr Dear
                acknowledged this by saying, "I SUPPOSE WE DO."   I then drove them
                around to Leppings Lane where Lord Justice Taylor alighted from the
                vehicle for a short time to look at the turnstiles, before
                returning to the vehicle - after which both gentlemen were returned
                to Headquarters.   The general conversation throughout this journey
                revolving around the logistics of setting up the Inquiry and where
                they were going to site their offices to run the Inquiry from.

                During the course of my duties that day, I also transported the ACC
                of West Midlands, Mr Jones, to Hammerton Road Police Station, where,
                the Incident Room was.

                On concluding duty at 6.00 pm that night, I returned home and
                discussed the conversation I had overheard with my wife,
                                 m d although angry at the time about the comment
                that was said, I decided there was little point in submitting a
                report about this matter for what good is it - a mere           rord
                against an eminent Judge and a Chief Constable - and I believe that
                little   good  would  have   come  out  from  me   disclosing  this
                conversation prior to any Inquiry that was being made.        I was
                however so annoyed that to left off steam I did mention it to my
                close work colleagues for although I realised an official report
                would have no ultimate benefit, what I needed was close friends to
                realise what an injustice was likely to be done.

However, having discussed this matter recently with Superintendent
Bettison, I feel it only right that the record be put straight.  I
still believe that no one will take my word against the other two
gentlemen but pass the information for your consideration.

I have been asked to treat this matter in the strictest confidence and
I will do so.

NOTE FOR FILE:


DISCLOSURE


Was contacted by Peter Metcalf this date concerning the above, who said
that on reflection he thought it would be wrong and perhaps even dangerous
for me or South Yorkshire Police to "consume its own smoke" regarding the
disclosure.

His view is that this matter ought to be considered by someone other than
the South Yorkshire Police as it may indicate possible criminal offences,
for example, 'conspiracy to pervert the course of justice' or 'misuse of
public office'.

Mr Metcalf suggested that one way forward would be through Mr Wells who
has been uninvolved in Hillsborough, then possibly through the Chief HMI
to another Chief Constable, who may take Counsel's opinion or deal with
the matter as he sees fit.

I told him that I regarded his comments above as absolutely confidential
to me as Acting Chief Constable as his client and he agreed this was so.

                        RE: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER



Thank you very much for coining to see me today about this
matter on which you have sought my advice.


I have considered the report by           It is dated 12 April
1990 but relates to an incident which occurred on 18 April
1989. I assume that         [who was driving the Staff car,had
no opportunity to make any note of the fragment of conversation
at the time. When did he first make any written note ? Plainly
it is vital to assess how accurately          heard and
remembered the precise words used,since a small difference in
what was heard or recalled may be crucial to the interpretation
of what was said.


On the assumption that          |ieard and recalled the words
spoken accurately and cnat tneyexp re s se d an improper intention
(and on the further assumption that two very senior public
figures would have expressed such an intention in front of a
third party who was a South Yorkshire police driver) the
question arises whether there is any prima facie evidence of a
criminal offence. I do not believe that there is.I think that a
conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice must relate
to the course of actual or potential civil or criminal
proceedings,and not to the conduct of a non-statutory inquiry
set up by the Home Secretary.There is no evidence here of any
bribery of a public official (see Archbold,43rd edition,volume
2 at para.24-47) nor would there appear to have been misconduct
by an officer of justice,since Lord Justice Taylor was not
appointed by the Home Secretary to act as a judge in civil or
criminal proceedings (ibid.para.24-49).
It is therefore a matter for you to decide what further action
you should take. Plainly it would be open to you to consult Sir
John Woodcock or Sir Clive Whitmore at the Home Office. If you
wished to show this letter to Sir John or Sir Clive,I would
have no objection whatever.

Dear Sir,

Hillsborough

We refer to recent telephone discussions and, having reviewed the
authorities, we have the following comments:


          1.        The common law offence of conspiracy was abolished
                    by the Criminal Law Act 1977, save specifically in
                    relation to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy
                    to engage in conduct which would tend to corrupt
                    public morals or outrage public decency.

          2.        Subject to the exceptions above the statutory
                    offence of conspiracy can only be charged in
                    respect of a conspiracy which necessarily involves
                    the commission of an individual criminal offence.

          3.        In our view, the conduct under consideration would
                    not necessarily have involved the commission of
                    the offence of perverting the course of justice.
                    As has been pointed out, the inquiry to be
                    conducted was not judicial in nature.

          4.      Until 1974, it was widely believed that there was
                  a common law offence of "effecting a public
                  mischief".  This was often used to charge persons
                  making false statements to the Police about
                  imaginary crimes, but convictions were also


                                                                                                                      /... contd.

          obtained for such diverse acts as disseminating
          rumours calculated to cause widespread alarm and
          building defective air raid shelters.

     5.   We have no doubt that if there was such a common
          law offence as effecting a public mischief, then
          the conduct with which we are concerned (if it
          could be made out) would involve a commission of
          that crime.  We reach this conclusion because the
          inquiry was commissioned by the Secretary of State,
          expressly for the purpose of producing
          recommendations intended to ensure the future
          preservation of human life.  In our view, to
          commence the inquiry needed to produce such
          recommendations, having deliberately pre-judged the
          conclusions, must amount to the effecting of a
          public mischief.

     6.   However, in the case of DPP v Withers (1974)
          3AER984, the House of Lords ruled that conspiracy
          to effect a public mischief, in the sense of an
          agreement to do an act which, although not
          unlawful in itself, was extremely injurious to the
          public, is not an offence known to the law.  That
          case concerned impersonation of officials by
          inquiry agents attempting to obtain sight of
          government and financial records.  The Judgments
          of the various law Lords made clear that the
          offence could still be charged if, and only if,
          the conduct complained of was of a type which had
          already been recognised at common law or
          statutorily defined as a crime.


We are, therefore, drawn to agree with the conclusions of the DPP,
albeit reluctantly, because we do feel that if such conduct were
made out, then it ought to disclose an offence.

Finally, we should say that we do not hold ourselves out as experts
on criminal law.  It, therefore, occurs to us that if, from the
point of view of South Yorkshire Police, this matter is to be seen
as having been thoroughly examined, the Director might be asked if
he would be prepared to obtain an external opinion from Leading
Counsel.

Thank you, again, for your letter of 9 July.  I understand clearly what
you say and can now confirm that there was no original note made of the
conversation in question.

Would you be kind enough to run your professional eye across the attached
letter provided by our solicitors?

The last paragraph suggests that, with a view to the matters being seen
to be thoroughly examined, you might seek Counsel's opinion on the angle
now introduced, which I perceive to be fresh.   This thought is offered,
I'm sure, only in the spirit of canvassing the widest of independent
view.

I am due shortly to go back to                 originating the report and
would   like  to do   so  with   the  maximum   possible   collateral for
open-handedness. I do hope that this final enquiry will not prove the
last straw on the burden of your office.      I anticipate publicity when
I have seen         and we should be seen to have tried our best.

                     RE;      HTT.T.SBOROUGH DISASTER

     Thank you for bringing to my notice the details of the
report submitted by                        touching upon remarks
alleged to have been maae in m s presence by the     Rt Hon Lord
Justice Taylor to Geoffrey Dear (then Chief Constable of the West
Midlands Police) on 18th April 1990 at Hillsborough.

     As agreed, Sir Clive Whitmore, Permanent Under Secretary of
State at the Home Office, and myself saw Lord Justice Taylor by
appointment at 9.30am on Friday, 20th July 1990, at the Royal
Courts of Justice in London.     Sir Clive outlined the details
contained in the report which Lord Justice Taylor immediately
rejected and described as nonsense. Understandably he could not
recall the details of what was discussed but was perfectly clear
that there had been no comment as alleged by


     At 4.30pm the same day I saw Mr Geoffrey Dear, H.M.
Inspector of Constabulary, in his Worcester Office.         After
outlining the allegations, he stated that he could not recall
details of the conversation that took place but was emphatic that
had there been any suggestion of bias, either then or later, he
would have remembered and would have objected to it. He further
emphasised that at all times Lord Justice Taylor was scrupulously
fair, absolutely correct and quite unequivocal in his pursuit of
the truth.

     I feel that this matter cannot be taken any further.
However, it is worth mentioning that although Lord Justice Taylor
carried out the inquiry alone, he did have the benefit of
advisers, one of whom was Mr Brian Johnson, the Chief Constable
of Lancashire.
     I trust this                                          t you, jto finalise the
issue in question.

FILE NOTE TO DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE                              2 August 1990



You have been following with me my      pursuit   of               report dated
12 April 1990 to the point whe reP                 Should now be seen and told
the outcome.

Unfortunately,              Ls on annual leave until             and when
he   comes back I shall be away.   I do not think that thismatter should
be    held until my return and we are agreed that you will see him in my
place as soon after his resumption as possible.

The following are the points which I think you should make to

1.   From the moment that, encouraged by Superintendent Bettison, he made
     his written report, the substance of that report was taken seriously.
     Notwithstanding!              bwn doubts that he would not be believed
     (because of his    junior rank) you and I have acted on the assumption
     that his report was     an accurate and honest       recollection of a
     conversation which took place.

2.   You felt that the gravity of the allegation warranted my personal
     knowledge and   intervention as the new Chief    Constable as soon as
     practicable after my taking up office, and that you did so.

3.   We discussed!               beport and agreed that it needed action.
     In the first instance,    it was to be one of the subjects covered in
     a Senior Command discussion of the various aspects of the Hillsborough
     aftermath.   In the event, that discussion has not yet been     able to
     take place and so I      took action in respect of       report outside
     the framework of any general Hillsborough deliberations.

4.   On 2 July I telephoned Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddard, and Sir
     John Woodcock the HMCIC, to discuss the merits of what I intended
     to do w i t h )       (
                           report, namely to send it to the Director of
     Public Prosecutions. Both parties agreed.

5.   I sent a copy    of the report in confidence for the personal attention
     of the DPP in    advance of a private meeting with him on 9 July 1990,
     by which time    he would have had time to absorb the contents and to
     have formed an   opinion.

6.   When I met the Director, it was his professional view that no criminal
     offence was disclosed.   In a letter to me, dated the same day, he
     confirmed that opinion in writing, saying in effect that it was now
     a matter for me.

7.   After further conversations with Peter Metcalf and, as a courtesy,
     with our own HMI Mr Sampson, I determined to see Sir John Woodcock
      and did so on 18 July.    Sir John's view on hearing the detail of
      the report and of the Director's opinion was that we should both
      consult Sir Clive Whitmore, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State
      at the Home Office, since Lord Justice Taylor had been appointed
      by the Home Secretary.

8.   In discussion with Sir John and Sir Clive that same day, and on two
      occasions, it was determined - and I agreed - that the best approach
     would be for Sir John (representing an independent police approach)
     and Sir Clive (representing the Home Secretary's         concern) to see
     Lord Justice Taylor in order to acquaint him w i t h )          Report.

9.   On 20 July 1990 Sir Clive and Sir John saw Lord Justice Taylor.
     Sir John reports,   in a letter dated  23 July 1990 to me,  that Lord
     Justice Taylor immediately rejected the detail of the report and
     described it as nonsense.

10. On the     same day Sir John, alone, saw Geoffrey Dear. Mr Dear's
    response was that he could not recall details of the conversation
    that had taken place, but that he was emphatic that had there been
    any suggestion of bias, then or later, he would have remembered it
    and would have objected to it.

11. While this process was in train, Peter Metcalf had suggested that
    there might be one more angle to explore in respect of possible
    criminality, and he wrote me a letter dated 18 July 1990 suggesting
    that I explore with the DPP the further possibility of an offence
    of effecting a public mischief.

12. I wrote, as a consequence of Peter Metcalf's letter, on 23 July 1990
    to the Director of Public Prosecutions asking him to consider this
    further    suggestion and to ask if he would seek independent Counsel's
    opinion on the point of law.     This  was now, of course, after the
    Judge and Geoffrey Dear had been seen.        It meant that, had the
    Director or the independent Counsel come back with an acknowledgement
    that a criminal offence could have been committed, then I would have
    had to have caused Lord Justice Taylor and Geoffrey Dear to be seen
    and a statement taken under caution.

13. In the event, independent Counsel in the       person of Anthony Hooper
    QC reviewed the facts as reported and          concluded that they,  as
    reported, fell short of a criminal offence.

14. My remaining actions have been confined to telling parties involved
    of this final   opinion and to having^        jeen in order that he
    may know the     amount of energy we have put into following    up his
    report, and the outcome.

15. That outcome    is    not altogether satisfactory;   a blunt denial   of
    something equally     strongly asserted seldom brings satisfaction to
    either party.     I   can honestly, and with      thebest    interests ofthe
    Force at heart, see   no obvious further avenue to explore.

16. I would like you to thankl            bor having the courage to make
    the report.   I see no evident reason why he should have done so had
    it not been the truth as he heard it.

17. Short of further, unexpected light being shed on the inconclusive
    result - in which case I will happily take up the cudgels again -
    I think, with regret, that we must regard the matter as closed.

    Bradford BD1 3LR




    It was good          to speak to    you   on the telephone yesterday morning about
    the   latest         developments    in    the confidential report  we  have  been
    discussing.

    I now enclose a letter to me from Sir John Woodcock dated 23 July 1990,
    in which he describes what happened when the detail of the report from
              ras presented to Lord Justice Taylor and, similarly, to Geoffrey
    Dear.   I also enclose, as promised, the opinion of Counsel sought by
    the Director of Public Prosecutions at your suggestion, and you will see
    that, in Anthony H o o p e r 1s view, the conduct alleged would amount to an
    offence if it were seen by a court as an agreement to conduct an
    investigation in a biased way.       The opinion goes on to say that the words
    reported, even if accurately remembered, would not amount to such an
    agreement and prosecution, therefore, is not viable.

    My next stage is to h a v e ____________ een to let him know the full extent
    of what we have done on his behalf,        The last line of           Report
    indicates that he respects the confidence of the circumstances and I
    will see that this is reinforced when he is seen, though in a way which
    encourages him to confidence of his own volition; I have discussed with
    you already my fear that an arbitrarily imposed 'gag1 will only add insult
    to injury.   Much of what               reported is now out and about since

    this development will be too much for one man to hold unto himself.

          Bradford BDl 3LB




          It was good to speak to you     the N&elephone yesterday morning about
          the latest developments in  ^the  confidential report we have been
          discussing.

          I now enclose a letter to m<§ from Sir John Woodcock dated 23 July 1990#
          in which he describes what/happened when the detail of the report from
                   was presented to Jiord Justice Tailor and, similarly! to Geoffrey
          Dear.   I also enclose, a(u promised, the\ opinion of Counsel sought by
          the Director of Public Btosecutions at your suggestion, and you will see
          that, in Anthony Hooper/s view, the conduct alleged would amount to an
          offence if it were seen by a court as \an agreement to conduct          an
          investigation in a biased way. The opinion goes on to say that the words
          reported, even if accurately remembered, would not      amount to such an
          agreement and prosecution, therefore, is not viable.

          My next stage is to have            seen to let him know the full extent
          of what we have done on his behalf,    The last line of            eport
          indicates that he respects the confidence of the circumstances and I

NOTE FOR FILE;




With reference to your 'Note for File' of 2 August 1990 concerning                the
earlier revelations from                 [.n respect of Lord Justice Taylor       and
Mr Geoffrey Dear, as requested I s a w |          [this date.

I informed him in some detail    of   the action taken   since    the   submission of
his report and of the outcome.

I told him you applauded him for bringing this information to light                and
saw it as a responsible and, in some ways, courageous act on his part.

           pas extremely grateful for the      action    taken.    He   agrees   there
appears now nothing further which can done.

He told me that when the purported comments were made the car was stationery
and he is absolutely clear that his version of the conversation is correct.

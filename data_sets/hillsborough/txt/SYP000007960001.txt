 that          nobody          takes       alcohol             on       the    coach           and       I saw          nobody        break          that




We        travelled             straighlto                 Sheffield                without              stopping.               We       were       slightly

We        arrived          in S h e f f i e l d           at    about          12.45           pm       (^.45        h r s ), and          the       coach

was        parked          in       the    road       whiere a 11              the       other           c o a w e r e                being

 directed.                 About          4 miles          outside             Sheffield                 we       were \ t o p p s d           by    the

Police           a nd      officers             boarded             the       bus       and.    checked              that       we    had       no    drink

and. t h a t          nobody             was    drunk.

After           getting             off    the       bus       we       walked          straight              down        to    the       ground.           At

milk           and    we       sat       around       talking             for       a    while           and       drinking           the       milk.

After           20    mins          to    half       an    hour          we    walked           on       to       the     ground.


                                                C#^ y
 I attended                the       same       m^tch          last       year          and     at       that        match       there          was

a     cordon          of       Police          about       50       -    100       yds    from           the       turnstiles              in L e p p i n g s

L n,       stopping             and       checking             that       everybody                 had       a    valid        ticket          for    th e

game,           but       this       didn't          take       place          on       this        occasion              and    I thought             this

was        strange.

At        no    time       between             getting          off       the       coach           and       arriving           at       the       ground

did        I witness                any    disorder             or       violence              or       drunkeness              from       any       person,

 I saw          the       odd       one    or       two    people             drinking              beer          fs^om      cans,        but       they    did

not        appear          oKunk.

being        directed                 back    by       Police          Officers          on       the    other             side.                   The    crowd

were        by    this           t irns s c reaini ng             to    get       the    gates          open          at       the            front.

Some        kids        were          being       passed          over       our    heads          to    the          front               of       the    crowd,

they        were        only          about       13    or    14 y e a r s         old.           Other          people were                        being

pulled           up     into          the    West       stand          above.           I managed                to    stay               witl~

forwards               and       towards          the    fences.              The       pain       was       beginning                        to    become

unbearable                  and       people       were       screaming             and       shouting.                    I spent                  my    time

just        trying           to       stay    upright.

together               and       I saw       that                                 still       in       the       pen       and            Peter          told       me

a Policeman                  had       stopped          him       but    nfesjoined               us    shortly                after               that.

It     was       only        then       that       I    realised             people          had       probably                been            killed          as

there        were           bodies          just       lying       on    the       floor          not    being             treated.

1 decided               the       best       thing       to       do    would\to             be    get       out       of        the           way       so    all

three        of        us    went       back       into       the       terraces             in P e n > 6         and          we         remained             there

until        we        left       the       ground.

At     no    time           did       I witness          anything             that       I    consider                to       be         a    criminal

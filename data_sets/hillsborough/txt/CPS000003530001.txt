                           I
 I refer to your letter of 17 August 1989 and note your willingness to accept
 my invitation to undertake the full criminal enquiry into the events at
 Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 following the advice from the Director of Public
 Prosecutions.  Also that you will enquire into the related discipline or
 complaint matters including those specifically referred to in my letter of
 16 August and others which may emerge.

 Regarding the complaint matters I will advise further as requested after the
 planned meeting with Hr Trevor Hicks this date (23 August) and agree
 thereafter the meetings as necessary between the various parties you describe
 to clarify your terms of reference, responsibilities, lines of communication
 between ourselves and accountability.

 The South Yorkshire Police Authority have already met and considered the offer
 made by the Home Office as set out in the letter from Lord Ferrers and a
 subsequent letter from Hr H J Addison of the Home Office, both of which you
 refer to.

 Hy understanding is they are accepting the Home Office offer but I have asked
 Hr Stephen Walker (Deputy Clerk of the South Yorkshire Police Authority) in
 the absence of the Clerk who is on holiday, to correspond with you direct on
 this issue and you should regard his letter as authoritative on this point.

I am m o s t grateful to Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r for the Report,
w h i c h is a careful and t h o r o u g h a n a l y s i s o f w h y we have
had so m a n y m a j o r t r a g e d i e s a t football g r o u n d s o v e r the
y e a r s and w h y w e have had di s o r d e r and hool iganism.                              As
the H o u s e    familiarises         itself with             the     Report       it will
become     clear     it     is    addressed        as    much        to     the    football
i n d u s t r y as it is to the G o v e r n m e n t .          Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r

overcrowding          because        that       was          the      cause        of          the
Hillsborough disaster,              b u t n o w he goes on to t a l k of a
game, the image o f w h i c h has b e e n m u c h t a r n i s h e d , and of

        Lord            Justice          Taylor              does           not        spare           those         who     run        the
        industry.                He says indeed that the provision they make for
        their            customers               is often                  not merely                  basic         but squalid,
        and he says that squalid conditions can have an impact on
        safety but they also lead to lower standards of behaviour.


        Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r s a y s that the Football A s s o c i a t i o n and
        Football League have n o t seen it as any part of t h e i r d u t y
        to        offer         guidance                to         clubs          on      safety              matters           and      he
        questions                whether                 the            directors*                of         many         clubs         are
        genuinely                 interested                      in        the         welfare               of         t heir         own
        supporters                 or       their             good          beha v i o u r .                 Players         too        are
        criticised,                    with           Lord       Justice               Taylor          p o i n t i n g out            that

        the crowd.                 W h i l e he r e c o g n i s e s t h a t at some clubs c h a n g e s

        football              should             be,         he says              that        the g a m e                only     has     a
        f u t u r e if the d i r e c t o r s and the p l a y e r s can chan g e t h e i r
        own            priorities             and        give              a leadership                  which           is p l a i n l y
        lack i n g at present.


        He agrees with the G o v e r n m e n t t h a t t here m u s t be a m o v e
        towards               all-seater                     stadia              and      points              out          that % the

                   and will            improve behaviour,                 and     we   intend     to bring      it
                   about.         Lord J u s tice Taylor m a k e s c l e a r that the bulk of
                   the      finances        for     ground          improvements          will    have   to     be
                   raised by the clubs themselves.                              He m e n t i o n s ways in which
                   clubs'       finances m i g h t be im p r o v e d to help cover the cost

As I have said. Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r t akes t h e view that
b e t t e r f a c i l i t i e s and b e t t e r t r e a t m e n t o f fans will bring
better behaviour.               B e y o n d that, the R e p o r t r e c o m m e n d s the
creation        of    three          new     specific       offences           to    a p ply    at
d e s i g n a t e d sports g r o u n d s :        throwing a missile;                 chanting
o b s c e n e or r a c i a l i s t     abuse;         and g o i n g         onto    the pitch
without        reasonable            e x c use:           and        it     also     asks      for
c o n s i d e r a t i o n to be g i v e n to e x t e n d i n g t h e courts' powers
to impose a t t e n d a n c e c e n t r e o r d e r s and f o r the use of
e l e c t r o n i c t a g ging in t h e ‘case of o f f e n d e r s c o n v i c t e d of
football-related            offences.               I shall          look     carefully        and
sympathetically            at    the         case    for        making       these      changes
recommendations.
Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r then comes to the q u e s t i o n of w h e t h e r
t here shou l d be a national m e m b e r s h i p s c h e m e and he says
that he has grave d o u b t s about the f e a s i b i l i t y of the sort
of scheme e n v i s a g e d in the I n v i t a t i o n to T e n d e r issued by
the con s u l t a n t s e m p l o y e d by the football a u t h o r i t i e s , and
serious m i s g i v i n g s a b o u t the l i k e l y i m p a c t on safety.            In
the     light      of    that,       he    says      he    cannot       support        the
i m p l e m e n t a t i o n of P a r t 1 of the Act.
                                                                >

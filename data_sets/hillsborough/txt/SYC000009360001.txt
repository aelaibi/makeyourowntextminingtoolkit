            Dear Sirs,

            Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


            If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
            of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
            on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
            due course.

            I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
            evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
            coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
            inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

            Subject to the C o ro n er s ’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
            under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
            witnesses who wish to give evidence.        I am at present engaged in considering
            this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

            Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
            to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
            appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
            consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

             May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
             attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

             I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
             names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
             to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

             I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
             heard from you by the end of Septejjlier I will assume you have no names to
             submit.

             Yours faithfully,

Re:     SAEAH L. HICKS (deceased) So.64,

As you axe aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

 I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
 Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
 he may wish to undertake.

 I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
 or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
 matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
 a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
 on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 Yours faithfully,



 S. L.Popper,
 H.M. Coroner.

Dear Sirs,

You will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
in fact put in as evidence.

However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
i. am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
report of jour 2li«nt(s).

The release of these post mortem reports are cn the basis that:-

      a.         They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                 subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                 they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

      b.     They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
             conselling of the deceased*s relatives or for proper
             legitimate purposes in connection with any legal proceedings
             in which solicitors may be engaged.

      c.     Subject to thft'caQQVgj they are to be kept confidential until
             they come into the public domain at the resumed Inouests.

I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is        per sheet (total
Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

Yours faithfully,

NOTE FOR FILE



4.15 PM




Met Mr Hicks in corridor.  He spoke to me. Was not sure whether he should.
I said we should restrict ourselves to pleasantries.  We then parted but I had
another quick word with him.  Explained to him that I did not like being rude
and not speaking to him but it was very important that I should do things
properly and be seen to be doing them properly.  He entirely agreed.  He in
fact went on to say that I had to be seen to be impartial or he or somebody
else would complain but he could not resist making a comment that the girl on
the pitch had been Victoria.  I did not respond.

I hereby return the proforma duly completed.

Please accept my apologies for the delay in responding but as you will
see I have now moved and did not receive the letter until today, due to

            INQUEST INTO THE DEATH OF SARAH LOUISE HICKS


Questions and matters arising.

Q'S for DR.   Slater - Pathologist.

1) When Jenni cuddled Sarah at the gymnasium at 9.30pm, after some
hours wearing only a light t e e s h i r t , jeans and barefoot, she felt
at normal body temperature. Could you give an explanation and/or
comment.

2) When Sarah's body was recieved home, we noticed her hands from
the wrist down were very purple/black. Could you give an opinion
as to possible cause or if this is attributable to Sarah's attempts
to support   Victoria from 2.45pm.     when she was    seen to be
unconscious.

3)We heard at the opening session that approximately 4 -6 minutes
after the   final crush people would have       lost  c o n si ousness.
Presumably as the girls remained consious for some period there was
intermittant crushing below the level needed for loss of faculties
does this mean that they "suffered" pain during this period.

Q for S g t . McCombie

1) At the gymnasium DC's Greaves and Maddox were advised "by an
unidentified member of a medical team" that Sarah was beyond help.
Despite the actual diagnosis / result how can we be assured that
professional advice was being given.

    I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
    Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
    the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
    following the adjournment of the inquest.

    After consultation with Professor Usher,   I have no objection
    to this course of action.

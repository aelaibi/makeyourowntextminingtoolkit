    The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you for your
letter of 25 April with which you enclosed this one from your
constituent, Mrs               of
Chesterfield, Derbyshire, about the tragic events at
Hillsborough.


    As you know, an Inquiry under the Chairmanship of Lord
Justice Taylor has been set up to investigate the events of
Hillsborough and to make recommendations.                              As the points which
your constituent raises are ones which should be considered by
the Inquiry, I have forwarded yours and her correspondence to
Mr R Whalley, Secretary to the Inquiry, who can be contacted at
this address.




                                                           MISS C J BANNISTER

Neurologist gave evidence
 that bodies continued to
twitch for some time after

the brain stem has died. In

"They can twitch and very

   "There were so many
    bodies around and I
checked some for signs of
   life but found none".
 Mr Hart statement "As we
lifted him onto the board a
  policeman came forward
and pulled the lad's jumper
 up and over his face and I
 realised then that he was
           dead".
Mr Hart declined to assist
         further.
South Yorkshire Police



  At pertinent time, who
would have the knowledge
and expertise to carry out
    these procedures.

Medical evidence suggests
 Kevin already brain stem
           dead.

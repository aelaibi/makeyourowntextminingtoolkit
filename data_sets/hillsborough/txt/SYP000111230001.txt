                   On Saturday              15 A p r i l      1989     I commenced             duty       in full        uniform,            parading

                   the     build       up    of    fans.           Shortly       after      11am we         noted        that       there          was

                   beginning           a    considerable             movement         of    fans      around          our a r ea,           which

                   extended        to       the    ground          itself.        The      mood      of    the       f ans    appeared             very
                                                                                                                                       R49

happy ,         a    little        boisterous,                  and    confident.              At    that       t ime     we     did       not

h a ve     to       stop    to     prevent           any        disorderly             behaviour.

The      noticeable               licensed           premises           on     our      area were          The     Sportsman               Inn,

Middlewood                R oa d South.

At    11.30am             t hat    dale       we     noted a general                    progress          of    several          fans to

the      premises           of T h e         Horse       and Jockey,                I noted         that       this     gradually

began       to       be a h e a v y          c o n g r e g a t i o n at        those         premises,          and     before         12

n o o n we          were    moving           the     spillage           of     f ans     on the        forecourt            of      the

premises             from     the       road,        where        they       were       beginning          to     obstruct           the

junction.                 Some     of    the       f an s       were    actually             sitting       and      l y in g     on the

road       surface,           in o b v i o u s        danger           of    traffic,          and were           warned         against

this       practice.              The        Beehive            licensed          premises          were       in d a r k n e s s      and

the      doors        were        closed        with        a    'Closed*           sign      exhibited           thereon.             I

noted       however           that       a    continuous               sporadic          stream        in g r o u p s       between          two

a n d 8 or 9 w e r e               knocking           on the           d oor      and    b e in g    admitted.

At T h e        Middlewood              Tavern,          there         appeared          a good a t t e n d a n c e            of

Liverpool             fans,        and       two m ini           coaches          were       parked       outside,          the      car

park       was       relatively              full.          There       was       no    obvious        spillage           of     f ans      onto

the      car        park,     u n til        later       on w h e n         f ans      sat    in the       car      park,        an d also

gathered             on    the     pavement           opposite              the     licensed         premises.

About       1pm       I noted           th at      The      Horse       a n d J^CHjM<e^ was            packed         out      with        fans,

there       was       a gathering               of    possibly              two hundred             onjjLhe__car p a r k / f r o n t a g e

and a       large          group        of    fans       were         gathered,          possibly          fifty        in all         o^in^the

grass       verges          and      banking          opposite              and about          twenty were              seated actually

on g a r d e n w a l l s           and       steps       to      private          houses.           All    the      f ans      appeared

to    be    drinking              heavily,           some        e x c e s s i v e l y -so.         I often         saw     fans       com i n g

from       the       premises           carrying            several          p i nts     of    beer       each,       and      obviously,

from       their          actions,           for     their        own       consumption.

The    actions             of    the      fans       was     v ar i e d .         Some         were       drinking          and         talking

quietly.              The       majority         however              were     extremely              boisterous,                  and    the

litter       was       general            over       the a r e a w i t h             cans       and       bottles         everywhere,

bankings,             pavements,               roads        and       frontage.                We    approached             youths         sat       on

walls       to    private             housing         and asked              them         to    consider            the     residents,

and    eventually                one      fan m a d e        an       effort         to     clear         t hat     a r ea,        with    the

aid    of    several             black         bin     liners,

We    remained             in the         area,       on     one       occasion             liaising            with Superintendent

Marshall          and       appraising               him     of       the    situation.                   We    were      advised          that

if t h e r e      was       any       trouble,          for       the       f iv e     of      us    to    remain         in the          vehicle

until       assistance                came.          T he    ground          control            was       similarly            advised          of

the    situation                by P o l i c e       Sergeant            Miller.

From    1.30pm             or    thereabouts                we    took       up      static          position           opposite           The

Horse       and Jockey.                   I. saw      t hat       a    large         number          of    fans       had      be come

drunk,       one       or       two    excessively                so.        They         were       organising             themselves

into    groups             of    ten      or    twenty and               singing            football            songs,         containing

several          of    the       better         known        obscene           words.               Eventually            a number             from

two    to    six       fans        started           standing            on a b o u n d a r y             wall      with       a    private

house,       possibly              some        seven         feet high,           and          leading          the     singers.               It

was    unavoidable                 that        eventually they                   would          fall      from        the      wall,      and

many    did so,             falling            through           foliage          at      the       back       of   the     wall         and    into

private          property.                I could           not       see    that         any       person          received            obvious

injury,          or    t hat       there        was     any apparent                   damage         to       property.

During       t his         ti me      several          of    the       two     to      three         hundred          f ans        i n _ou_r__vi e w

                                      .    One       yo u t h ,       in his         teens          was    exceedingly                  drunk,

and    eventually                could         only         stand with           assistance                of     two     of    his

friends.              This       youth         and      two       or t h r e e    others            I witnessed                openly

urinating             on    the       forecourt             of    the       licensed            premises,             oblivious            as       to

who    could          see       them.          There        was       no a n i m o s i t y          shown       towards            us    except

good    natured             jeering,            gestures              and     ribald           co m m e n t s .

       Shortly     before          2,30pm          we    were        joined        by a f u r t h e r          transit          a n d a dog

      tandler.          Without            the     use     of    the     dog,        we      entered          the    forecourt             and

     premises          and       began       to m o v e       fans     towards            the     ground-            Many       were

     reluctant          to m o v e         and     had     to    be    persuaded,                 I did        not w i t n e s s       any

     violence          whatsoever,                either        by P o l i c e       or      towards          them.         I checked            the

     f a n who     was       incapable.                 He a p p e a r e d        lucid       but     had      no    control          over       his

     limbs.        His       two       supporting             friends          stated         that      they        had     not      got    any

     intentions             of    going         into     the     ground           even       though        they      ha d      tickets.

     They    intended             to    stay with             him a n d        care       for     him.         He w a s        not

     disorderly,             and       was      allowed         to    go w i t h        them.         I feel         t hat      had a ny

     attempt       been made               to     restrain,           or a r r e s t         him,     the      mood       of    many       fans

     watching          would       have         abruptly         changed,            for      the wor s t .

     Eventually,             in a       long       straggle           they moved              towards          the    g r o u n d a n d we

     slowly       followed             them,        I saw        very        little          tr o u b l e ,    and w i t ne ss e d          only

     one    person          detained            during        the     journey           to    the     ground.             This       was    by

     another       transit.

     On    our    arrival          I saw          that     entire        entrance             a r e a wa s       packed         s^y^d with

     situation          that       was       building           up.      F r om my           position          I could          see    a blue

'MICHAEL HEdllNALD PHIliCE; 48 YEARS, POLICE CONSTABLE 2172, SOUTH
 YORKSHIRE POLICE, SCCEE3FIELD SECTION, 1'+F2.



I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police, presently
stationed at Ecclesfielci Section of F2 Sub-Division.   My normal
work engagements are uniform patrol duties.

On Saturday the 15th April 198'?, I commenced duty in full uniform,
parading at Ecclesfield Police Station.     Shortly after 9o0ara that
that I was tansported with other officers to Sheffield Wednesday
Football Ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield, for duties at Liverpool
Football Club versus Nottingham Forest Football Club.    At that
ground I attended a briefing by senior police officers, commencing
at 1Gam.

Following this briefing, I commenced duties in TAEGO 3 EOBIiji, marked
Police Transit Van, and covering Wadsley Side of the ground, to keep
observations on various public houses in that area.    In charge of my
vehicle was Police Sergeant 19^8 Derek MILLER.    Also on duty in that
vehicle were Police Constables 3278 Jane STAGG, 893 iioger HAIGH
(probationery constable) and Andrew CHEiLtY (driver of vehiclej.

On commencing patrol we did a circuit of the entire area to assess
the build up of fans.    Shortly after 11am we noted that tnere was
beginning a considerable movement of fans around our area, wnich
extended to the ground itself.    The mood of the fans appeared very
happy, a little boisterous, end confident. At that time we aid not
have to stop to prevent any disorderly behaviour.

The noticable licensed premises on our1 area were, The SPORTSKrtK Ii*i«,
Worral Road, The HORSE and JOCKEY, Wadsley Lane, junction of Corral
Hoad, The BEEHIVE, Dykes Hall Hoad, and The MILDLEW00D TaVEHIm, a o 16
MiddleWood Hoad South.

At 11.30am that date we noted a general progress of several fans to
the premises of the 1IGKSE and JOCKEY, x noted tuat this gradually
began to be a heavy congregation at those premises, and before^ 12
noon we were moving the spillage of fans on the forecourt of tne
premises from the road, where they were beginning to obstruct the
junction.   Some of the fans were actually sitting and lying on_the
road surface, in obvious danger of traffic, and were warned o gams ^
this practice.    THE BEHIVE licensed premises were in darkness ana
the doors were closed with a CLOSED sign exhibited thereon. I noted
however that a continuous sporadic stream in groups between two and
8 or 9, were knocking on the door an being admitted.

At the Kiddlewood Tavern, there appeared a good attendance of
Liveroool fans, and two mini coaches were parked outside, the car
■Dark was relatively full.  'There was no obvious spillage of ,ans
onto the car park, until later on when fans sat in the car par*, and
also gathered on the pavement opposite th« licensed premises.

About 1x>m I noted that the H0H3E and JOCKEY was packed out with fans,
there was a gathering of possibly two hundred on the car_parK/fron^age,
and a large group of fans were gathered, possibly fifty in all on the
grass verges and banking opposite and about twenty were seated actually
on garden walls and steps to private houses.         A l l tne fane appeared
to be drinking h e a v i l y , some excessively so. I often saw fans coming
from the premises carrying several pints of beer each, and obviously,
from their actions, for their own consumption.              cont 2
continued 2.


The actions of the fans was varied.   oome were drinking and talking
quietly.   The majority however were extremely boisterous, and the
litter was general over the area with cans and bottles everywhere,
bankings, pavements, roads and frontage.    we approached youths sat
on walls to private housing and asked them to consider the residents,
and eventually one fan made an effort to clear that area, with the
aid of several black bin liners.

We regained in the area, on one occasion liasing with Superintendent
Marshall and appraising him of the situation.   we were advised that
if there was any trouble, for the five of us to remain in the vehicle
until assistance came.    The ground control was similarly aavised
of the situation by Police Sergeant XILain.

Prom 1 .30m or thereabouts we took up static posiTiou opposite cne
HOW S3 and*JOCKEY.  1 saw that a large number of fans had become drunk,
one or two excessively 3 0 . They were organising tneraselves into
groups of ten to twenty and singing football songs, containing several
of the better known obscene words.   eventually a number irotn two to
six fans started standing on a boundary wall with a private house,
possibly some seven feet high, and leading the singers.    It was
unavoidable that eventually they would fail from tne wall, ana many
did so, falling through foliage at the back 01 the wall, ana into
private property.   I could not see cnat any person received obvious
injury, or that there was any apparent damage to property•

Ouring this time several of the two to three nunurea xa.is iu our
view became very dr unk.  one yo\. tin, in m s teens iva& ey.cfctuingly urn*,
and eventually could only stand., witn assistance of two oi nis ii ienuo.
This youth and two or three others I witnessed openly urinating on
the forecourt of the licensed premises, oblivious as to who could see
them.    There was no animosity shown towards us except good matured
jeering, gestures and ribald comments.

Shortly before 2.30pm we were joined by a lurtaer transi t nnu a
handler.   Without the use of the dog, we enterea tne lorecoart ana
premises and began to mov- fans towards the ground.    Wiany were
relunctant to move and had to be persuaded. I did not Witness «ny
violence whatsoever, either by Police or towards them.     I checked tue
fan who was incapable. He appeared lucid but had no control over his
limbs. His two supporting friends stated that they had not got any ^
intentions of going into the ground even though they had tickets. Tney
intended to stay with him and care for him.    lie was not aisorderxy,
and was allowed to go with them.   I feel that had any attempt been^
made to restrain, or arrest him, the mood of many fans wakening w o u x g
have abruptly changed., for the worst.

Eventually, in a long straggle they moved towards the ground and we slo
followed them.   I saw very little trouble, and witnesses only one
person detained during the journey to the ground.   This was by anotner
transit.

we arrived at the ground at 2 .50pm and parked on tne ofxsiae of i-he
road, facing Grenoside, and near to the main LarrlhOs Liiita entrance.
On our arrival I saw that entire entrance area was packed solid with
fans, and there appeared to be a general crush at tne turnstile area.
Such was the volume of fans that I could not see any police officers,
                                                        cont 3.

    in the crush or at the turnstile area. Only those in the road area
    and near the main fence barrier.       After a very short while I saw
    Superintendent M a BSK a LL climb onto a stone buttress formed at the
    corner of the bridge, apparently to get a better view of the situation
    that was building up.        From my position I could see a Blue metal
    constructed, folding gate, that was closed, being violently shaken,
    and voiced my opinion that it would not hold for long if that treatment
    continued.

    The five of us were then detailed to leave the van, and I v/as then
    engaged with turning away fans without tickets, of whom there appeared
    to bfc hundreds, awag from the ground.    Very shortly after this,
    possibly about 3 .15p® I was directed, with my serial into the ground,
    by a senior officer, who I do not know.

    On entry through the gate into an area before the tunnel, leading to
    the WiST TliinKACL, 1 was confronted by a large congregation of fans.
    They were very noise, and it was some seconds before I realised that it
    was not their usual noise, but that of terror and panic.     as I neared
    the tunnel I saw two or three persons being carried therefrom.     Some
    people immediately began to work on them, as if in an attempt to
    ressucitate them.      i got closed and saw that two of tnese persons
    appeared to be dead.     Others were being carried from the uuimel, in a
    similar condition, and 1 then realised that something very serious had
    occurred, either in the tunnel, or the ground.

    An officer was directing as many oifxcers as possible into the ground
    and in accordance with this 1 entered the <vest Terrace, via tne tunnel.
    I found this to be almost blocked with hysterical people, ofall ages
    and sexes.   I shielded two youngsters out of the crush, and then went b«c..
    through the tunnel to the west Terrace.   This took several minutes.

    In the ground I saw that th gate to the pitch was open, and at least
    two openings had been made in the crowd control fence. _ I went onto
    the pitch and immediately saw several bodies of fans laid near tne
    goal at that end.   I went to a h ole  in the fence and with other
    officers and fans began pulling people out of the terrace.    oome were
    injured but could walk, others unharmed but obviously terrifieu. i-*my
    however had to be lifted bodily out any appeared to be dead. ^ whilst
    there and so engagaed I was struck several times by fans who naa been^
    already extricated from this terrace.   They also tried to pull me    c*y
    and were calling me a murderer, and in general blaming tne police for
    the carnage.

    I continued thus for about ten to fifteen minutes^altho ugh
    track of time.    One young girl i helped out we etui led ^   -P
    a First John's Ambulance woman, or a ambulance servuce wOuaa,   .*“ -
    b.^-an resucitation by the mouth to mouth method.  I bent co assist uer
        at S    tine eo/eone kicked » heavily in „y left side, knocking „
    ov°r the legs of the injured girl.    I saw a yo.th m a black preset
    running away shouting something incomprehensible to me.        *notn«r per.o
    then assisted the girl and I returned to the fence.     ^ere^were by no
    too many other persons gathered t-.ere for roe vO oe oi ^ny -Joe.
    gathered about five or six fans and assisted them in c a r r y i n g two of
    the injured fans, one apparently dead, to the KOP end and to tne gymnasium.
    At that time I saw that this was being used as an emergency reception

  area, and there appeared to be in the region of ten to fifteen bodie
  in the gymnasium itself.

  I and rny team returned to the KQL-' tad and continued carrying injured
  and dead to this area, until we could find no more.      Ey this time
  we were all exhausted.

  I then rejoined my serial who '*ere or the pitch and we assisted in
  forming a line across the pitch as directed by Inspector         of
  if'l Division.   Je remained there for a considerable time until
  directed back to our transit for further outside patrol in general,
  ive attended one or two minor ineicents, but dealt ■ith nothing furth
  of any consequence.

  At 7pq? we broke for meal at Claywheels Lane, and at 8.15pm were
  stood down.    I went off duty at 8.30pm.

  As a result of the aforementioned incident I received an injury in
  the form of a bruise about the size of my hand above my left kidney,
  and some very minor bruising to ray arms and right shoulder.   l did
  not require any medical treatment for these, and resumed v/ork tne
  following day.

  I have served in the Police Force for twenty six years and four
  months.

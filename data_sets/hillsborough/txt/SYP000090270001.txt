              On S a tu r da y     15th April            1989    (150489)      I was    on duty     in c onnection with

 arrested.          All    of my serial        had been deputed to travel            on earlier

. bu se s    to the     ground and       I had not seen them for some time.



 At about 2.35            pm    (1435)   I t ravelled on one        of the    buses wit h four

 other       officers      from another        serial    and we a r ri ve d at the      ground at the

 S p i o n Hop end,       P enistone Road.            I went    into the ground via entrance

 0 to the        gym.     My     instructions were         to take meal.       I a s ke d about meal

 tickets        but was        informed that we may         be deployed      in the ground

 regarding         some    trouble.       I met up w it h three        of my serial,         the others

 were       not to be found at this time.



 1 was      then    informed by an         Inspector,       the name    I cannot     recall,     to go

 to the West S tand             re the    report      of fighting    there       I went wLJrft 0

 I was       in possession of a radio w h ic h              I changed     channels     to the one

 covering        the match.



 We w a lk e d towards          the West      stand of the ground via the            rear     of the

 N or t h S ta nd and as we got            into the      open    I saw a line of supporters

 u r in at in g against s f L a . 11.         There was     so muc h urine     on the    floor     that

 it was        d ifficult      not   to walk    in it.      I saw Police C on stable 384 ROCHE

 nearby and a c k n o w l e d g e d him.         As    I a p p r o a c h e d the exit gate    close    to

 the    s hopyfn L ep pings L a n e .          I was    called by a unknown Police Constable

 to aVs-ifst officers             there as they were about            to open the      large gates          to

 a ll o w supporters           in.    There was an       Inspector     using a Police         radio    but

 I do not know who              he was.



 There was a gateman struggling                    to keep the gates         closed and then          it

 a p pe a r e d obvious        to me that the         crowd outside was       large.

                                                                                                 S3453



• We   lined up and the gates were              opened^anj^Ka large number                of supporters

 entered    the g r o u n d ,, some were       very dist re ss ed and          complaining      that

 so me bo dy might     get    killed outside.           It was       like shaking a bottle of

 fizzy    lemonade up and then opening                 the    top.     I had a look outside and

 saw that there was a large             crowd outside           still waiting         to get    in.



 I then made my way to the West Sta nd >t og ether with my serial                              via the

 connecting       gates.      I saw Inspector W HITE and had a short                      conversation

 about    the    opening of the      gatSs<r



 A m essage      then came over       the      radio   instructing all a vailable              personnel

 to go on to the          pitch.     I presumed that a fight                 or pitch     invasion was

 taking    place.      Once      on to the     pitch    I saw some          fans   climbing    over the

 fence and some        climbing      into the West Stand.               I could not u nderstand

 why we were a ll owing           it whe n we should         be putting        them back      into the

 terracing.        I wa lk ed along     the     pitch side       looking for memb er s          of my

 serial    but    could not find any.



 Some    of the    fans were       coming    onto    the     pitch gasping         for breath a nd      I

 assisted       in finding a place          on the     pitch for them to            lie down.     I

 could not       see   the crowd at    barriers        due    to the        large number      of Police

 there.     I    did not realise      the extent        of the       situation at this stage.



 Wh il st a s si sting     the    injured supporters           I saw through a gap            in the

 Police    line    some    of the fans       pushed against           the    fencing.      I saw a

 female w ith her head back and she a p p e a r e d badly                     injured.      It became

 more    chaotic as time          passed and     1 heard a           voice shout      5

 "Help us here"        1 rushed towards a gap in the fencing and was                           handed a

 male,    aged about 25 years and together wit h another                           officer we    carried

                                                                                         gave

              hiiti heart massage .



              We failed to
                        t  revive h
                                  him and his
                                          h   face was covered over.            I thei

                 about 4.30 pm <1630)         I went to the special buses with the

          "   Nottingham Forest fans back to the Midland Railway station and then

              back to West Bar Police Station.



              F rom receiving the instructions to go on to the pitch to getting on to

              the buses I did not hear any messages on the radio.

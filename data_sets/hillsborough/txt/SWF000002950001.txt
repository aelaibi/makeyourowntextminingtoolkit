Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough - Eastwood & Partners
We thank you for your letter dated 2nd August and acknowledge
cafe receipt of your supplemental list of documents and your
reply to the policc list of issues.

17o trust that you have now received from Hanmond Suddards a
copy of the Consolidated Body Plan pursuant to the directions
given at the hearing on 24th July.    We note from your letter
to then of 26th July, that you requested copies of the
individual body plans.    At the moment we are comparing the
same   but hope   that  it will   be   possible  to agree   the
Consolidated plan as a document to go before the Court on the
basis that it is an agreed document.   This of course will save
a great deal of effort in not having to refer to the Inquest
witness evidence and individual plans.

We should be grateful if you would kindly confirm as soon as
possible, whether you are prepared to agree to this document.

Tours faithfully,




DAVIES ARNOLD COOPER

   Dear Sirs
   Re: Hillsborough

   We enclose herewith the consolidated body plan referred to in the
   Order of the 24th July 1990, together with key to plan, and key to
   source plans.

   In connection with the circle dots, which indicate more than one
   sighting of a deceased person, the assumption is that spectators
   moved down the terrace rather than in any other direction, so that
   the lowest position on the terrace has been taken as the last known
   sighting.
   Yours faithfully

Dear Sirs

Hillsborough


We refer to your recent letter enclosing a copy of the
consolidated body plan in accordance with the directions given
at the hearing on the 24th July.

We shall write again shortly to confirm whether we are
prepared to agree this document.    We do not anticipate any
difficulty in this respect, although we would like to have the
opportunity of checking the plan as against the evidence given
at the inquest.  The document should obviate the need to refer
to the inquest evidence, but it does not of course deal with
the time of entry and means of entry to the ground.

Stuart Catchpole of Counsel has prepared a document dealing
with these two aspects based upon the evidence given at
the inquest.  In the event that this document is agreed, it
will hopefully obviate the need to refer to the inquest
cvidencc on these aspccta, and perhaps in conjunction with
your consolidated plan may result in the parties not having to
refer to the evidence given at the inquest.      There may be
some advantage in this as the evidence given at the inquest
was for the most part, given by Police Officers, and is
therefore hearsay evidence.

We would appreciate your comments upon the enclosed document
and would be grateful if you would kindly reply before the
15ta August.

Yours faithfully

        Dear Sirs

        Hillsborough - Eastwood & Partners

       We thank you for your letter of 6th August.

       We refer to your telefax of 6th August and our telephone
       conversation of 7th August and confirm that we have now
       clarified with you the request for further documents from the
       Public Inquiry made in our letter of 19th July. We understand
       that you do not have a full set of the documents either, but
       await hearing from you with any assistance which you may be
       able to give us.

       We enclose our clients' drawings numbered 11424/6, 7 and 8
       (item 197)    from the Treasury Solicitor's List.      We have
       requested our clients to provide us with a' further copy of
       drawing no. 11424/5 (item 199) and shall forward this to you as
       soon as the same is received from our clients.

       We discussed at some length on 7th August the Inquest evidence
       and the consolidated Body Plan.      We confirm that we have
       requested copies of the individual Body Plans from H.M. Coroner
       and shall then use those individual Body Plans to check the
       consolidated Body Plan.    We shall let you know as soon as
       possible whether we are able to agree to this document.

       You informed us that you have a full set of the Transcript
       Evidence from the Inquest and would be prepared to loan this to
       us for photocopying if we so wished.    We are grateful to you
       for this and shall contact you further in due course.

      Dear Sirs

      Hillsborough - Eastwood & Partners

      We thank you for the following: -

                1.         Your         letter of 20th August with enclosures.

                2.         Your letter of 21st August enclosing the video
                           dealing with "Plan for Disaster", "Brief for Success"
                           and "Stewards".

                3.         Your         second                        letter of 21st August.

      We note your comments in your letter of 20th August concerning
      the Consolidated Plan.   In your letter of 2nd August enclosing
      the Consolidated Body Plan you state that where more than one
      sighting of a deceased person occurs, your clients have made
      the assumption that spectators moved down the terrace, rather
      than in any other direction, so that the lowest position on the
      terrace has been taken as the last known sighting.    It is not
      clear why your clients      have made this   assumption.    One
      possibility may be that reference has been made to the timings
      of the sightings and the later timing in fact corresponds with
      the lowest position.   However, if this were so, we would have
      expected the reference to have been to the "latest", position,
      rather than the "lowest" position on the terrace.   Please will
      you clarify this.

       On   the basis    that our  explanation is    correct, we   are
       considering the Inquest evidence by reference to the timing or
       sightings.   This exercise will, of course, take some time.
       Please will you, therefore, confirm as soon as possible whether
       you have in a convenient form, such as a schedule, details of
       the timing of sightings for each of the deceased.

       On the Key to Source plans prepared by your clients there is


                  I.l<ivd's Office: Room 692, Floor 6, Lloyd's, 1 Lime Street. London EC3M "DQ. Telephone: 071 32~ 4 188
                                             Authorised by the la w Society to conduct   imv.sinx.Tibusim-ss.
constant reference to the phrase "elsewhere"      in the column
headed "identified apparently dead". This would    appear to be a
reference to an area which is not detailed on      the plan, and
usually means somewhere else on the pitch.        Please confirm
whether this is correct.

For some of the deceased, we consider that the Consolidated
Body Plan does not accord with the individual plans from the
Inquest.  These are as follows: -

Identified Apparently Alive

     Body numbers 11, 36, 54, 61, 71.

Identified Apparently Dead

     Body numbers 3, 7, 11, 54, 67, 74.

There appears to be a typographical error relating to body
number 52 in that the reference to C4 should be in the column
"Identified Apparently Alive" and the reference C5 should be in
the column "Identified Apparently Dead" and not as stated on
your list.

    Dear Sirs

    Hillsborough - Eastwood & Partners

    We thank you for your letter of 24th August and acknowledge
    receipt of the expert's Report by John Stalker.

    We   refe r  to  our telephone   conversation of  24 th August
    concerning   the  Inquest evidence   and,  in particular,   the
    Schedule prepared by Stuart Catchpole of Counsel.   As you are
    aware, we are interested to know the purpose for which this
    Schedule has been prepared.   With this in mind, we have noted
    the contents of your letter of 8th August to Hammond Suddards.
    Please will you let us know the reasons why this Schedule has
    been prepared.

    Subje ct  to  that   information,   we consider that     further
    information concerning entry time and means       of entry is
    available from the Transcripts of the Inquest Evidence in
    respect of the following deceased, but which have not been
    referred to either at all or in part in your Schedule: -

                            10            -             D. S. Brown
                            17            -             C. B. Devons ide.
                            22            -             B. C. Matthews
                            34            -             J. Owens
                            52            -             S. Bell
                            59            -             G. R. Horn
                            87            -             S. F. O' Neil.

   Neither in the Schedule prepared by you nor the Schedule
   prepared by Hammond Suddards is there reference to the cause of
   death.  It is clear that the overwhelming majority died from

    useful if the cause of death was identified for each deceased.

        Dear Sirs
       Re :        HILLSBOROUGH

       We enclose herewith our Revised Draft Index to the Core Bundle.

       Items which did not appear on the previous Draft Index are marked
       with a pencil asterisk. You will note that wherever possible plans
       and diagrams have nowbeen identified by number and where possible
       have now been stated as being enclosed to the relevant letters.
       This has resulted in a number of items being "removed" from the
       Draft Index, although in reality these items have simply been
       included with the relevant letters.   As an example we would refer
       to the letter from Eastwood and Partners to Sheffield Wednesday
       F.C. dated 26th April 1985,which now contains within the
       description the words "including plan 6705/4".    The plan referred
       to was previously listed (without a number) as the item immediately
       below that and you will note therefore that reference has now been
       removed.   The clarification, plans and diagrams has been done at
       the request of the Engineer's solicitors.

       Yours faithfully                                                                                                                 —

         Dear Sirs

         Hillsborough

         We enclose a copy of our letter to Reynolds Porter Chamberlain
         of the 29th August, together with a copy of our letter in
         reply and our amended Schedule relating to the time and mode
         of entry to the ground.

         Subject   to  the   comments   we  have  made   regarding  the
         consolidated body plan, it is our view that the plan is
         reasonably accurate.   We invite your views concerning our own
         schedule.   It is hoped that the plan and the schedule will
         obviate the need to refer to the inquest evidence, and in the
         event that these documents can be agreed, we do not see the
         need to refer to the inquest evidence at trial.

         Accordingly, until we have obtained a firm reply concerning
         our views on this subject, we must reserve our position with
         regard to the inquest evidence as a list of witnesses we shall
         provide shortly, has been prepared on the basis our suggested
         approach to the inquest evidence can be agreed.

         We look forward to hearing from you.

         Yours,faithfully

    Dear Sirs

    Hillsborough

    We refer to your fourth letter of the 22nd August to Hammond
    Suddards.

    In that letter, you have suggested that in certain cases the
    consolidated body plan does not accord with the individual
    plans from the inquest.    We have now reviewed that evidence
    and have the following comments to make

    Identified Apparently Alive

     11.                     The position given is just about correct taking into
                             account the difference in scale between C66 and the
                             consolidated body plan.

    36.                    On the consolidated body plan, the deceased is shown
                            slightly to the right of the position shown on C71.

    54.                    On the consolidated body plan, the position of the
                            deceased is possibly very slightly behind that shown on
                            C119.

    61.                    The position on the consolidated body plan is                                                                                                                                  slightly
                            to the right of that shown on C17.
                                                                                                                                                             #

        schedule of the time and mode of entry to the ground.    As we
        indicated in our letter of the 8th August to Hammond Suddards,
        we hope that our schedule in conjunction with the consolidated
        body plan would obviate the need to refer to any inquest

                                                                    Contd../..

     evidence at the trial.    That evidence is contained in three
     lever arch files, and consists for the most part of evidence
     given by Police Officers, and hence by its nature is hearsay
     evidence. The consolidated body plan serves a clear function,
     but we also regard the time and mode of entry to be highly
     relevant to those issues raised by the opening of gate C at
     2.52 pm.   We do not readily see the need to refer to the
     inquest evidence in any other respect, although of course it
     is essential that any summaries or schedules prepared from
     this evidence are accurate.


     In reply to the queries raised in respect of our schedule we
     have the following comments to make :-

     10.   P S Brown


     We have given the time of entry as 14.15 with the mode of
     entry as being through the turnstiles. The time is taken from
     the first statement of Andrew Brown (see page 666 C - D). In
     a supplemental statement the same witness puts the time of
     entry at about 14.25 (see page 667 D - E).    We have amended
     the schedule to read 14.15-14.25.

     17♦   C B Devonside


 We have given the time of entry as being 14.30 and the mode of
 entry as being through the turnstiles. The time of 14.30 is
 the time given for the arrival at the ground (see 720 B and
 720 G). Some witnesses put the time at which the group met up
 on the inside of the turnstiles as being 14.45 and the time of
 going down the tunnel between 14.50 and 14.55.    However, the
 deceased is shown on a video in pen 3 at 14.40. Thus it seems
 that the time of 14.30 is likely to be more accurate. We have
 amended the schedule to read 14.30-14.40.


                                                      Contd../.
    4/                                            5th September 1990



         22.   B C Matthews


         We have not given a time for entry but have simply recorded
         the mode of entry as being through Gate C. The summary of the
         evidence of             at the Inquest reads as follows

         "At about 14.50 hours____________ saw a gate to the right of
         the turnstiles open, gate C, and they entered the stadium."
         (see page 935H to 936A).


     We do not think that this description is sufficiently precise
     to identify which opening of gate C was being referred to and
     therefore we have not put a time into our schedule.    You may
     be concerned that the witness with the deceased has been
     identified outside the ground on a piece of film that was
     taken at some time between 14.37 and 14.50 (see page 938 C).
     This piece of film was not accurately timed but the Officers
     giving evidence believe it was taken some point between those
     two times; thus it could have been a shot depicting the crowds
     at 14.46 (before the first opening) or at 14.49 (after the
     first opening). As such it is of no help in determining which
     opening of gate C allowed the deceased to gain entry to the
     ground.

         34.   J Owens


     A similar problem arises in this case. Again, we have only
     recorded the mode of entry. The evidence given at the inquest
     was that "at about 14.40 hours they joined the crowd outside
     the Leppings Lane turnstiles and entered the stadium via the
     concertina gate to the right of the turnstiles, gate C". (see
     page 731 A-B). One witness, Mr Robertson stated that "near to
     3.00 pm they were near to the concertina gates and they came
     in that way".    (see page 733 D).    The deceased is also

                                                          Contd../..

     identified on the same piece of film of the crowds outside the
     ground taken at some point between 14.37 and 14.50. Again, we
     do not think that the evidence is sufficiently precise to
     pinpoint which opening of gate C allowed the deceased to enter
     the ground, and therefore we have not entered any time on the
     schedule.

     52.   Simon Bell


 This is an error in our schedule.    The entry was at        14.45
 through the turnstiles. We have amended our schedule.

     59.   G R Horn


 This is another case where we have simply given the mode of
 entry. The evidence given at the inquest was that s -


 "At 14.50 the deceased and a witness was still outside the
 turnstiles.  A short time later gate C was opened and they
 entered the stadium via this gate." (page 574 B).


 The deceased is also shown on the film believed to have been
 taken at some point between 14.37 and 14.50 (page 575 H).
 Although the time is given positively in the evidence, it does
 appear to have been taken from the statement of the witness,
 and whilst it is probable that they entered on the second
 opening of gate C, in the absence of any other evidence to
 confirm it, we thought that the evidence was not sufficiently
 clear to put down a positive time.

 87.       S F O'Neill


 We have given the time of entry as being 14.50 to 14.55. The
 evidence was that the group including the deceased arrived at
 the ground at 14.50 to 14.55 (page 108 E).

         A copy of the amended schedule is enclosed.

         We   would now ask you to give further consideration to       our
         schedule and to confirm whether you are prepared to agree the
         consolidated body plan prepared by the Police. We take the
         view that the consolidated body plan is reasonably accurate.

         A copy of this letter has been sent to Hammond Suddards.

          Dear Sirs
          Re:       HILLSBOROUGH
          We thank you for your letter of 5th September, together with
          enclosures.
           In view of the comments made in the second paragraph of your
           letter, please confirm the Consolidated Body Plan is agreed.
           In relation to the Schedule prepared by Mr. Catchpole, we note
           the amendments you have made as a result of the points raised by
           Reynolds Porter Chamberlain. We also have a number of comments
           upon the Schedule in its revised form which are as follows

           l.      Rov Harrv Hamilton (12 ).
           Page 127 of the Transcript states Mr. Hamilton arrived at the
           entrance at 2.20 (although there does not appear to be any
           evidence as to what time he actually entered the stadium).
           Further, Mr. Hamilton has been identified on video in pen 3 at
           14.46.   We conclude that    the column relating to entry time
           should read "after 14.20 and prior to 14.46".
                                                                                                     Continued

2,   Colin Andrew Hugh William Sefton (61)

Page 173 of the Transcript .states Mr. Sefton arrived at the
ground between 14.00 and 14.15. Page 175 of the Transcript says
he arrived between 14.00 to 14.50, but that he went down the
tunnel at approximately 14.50.    Page 176 of the Transcript
refers to a video identification at 14.49 on the terraces.   We
conclude the column relating to entry time should read "after
14.00 but before 14.49".

3.   David William Birtle f47)

On page 239 of the Transcript Mr. Birtle is identified in pen 3
on a photograph timed at 14.45.     We conclude that the column
dealing with entry time should therefore read "prior to 14.45".
4.   Stephen Francis Harrison (91)

Page 249 of the Transcript states that Mr. Harrison's brother
saw Stephen Harrison and Gary Harrison standing in Leppings Lane
at about 13.45, so they must have entered after that time.    At
page 253 of the Transcript, Mr. Harrison has been identified on
video in pen 3 at 14.50.   We conclude that the column relating
to entry time should read "after 13.45 and before 14.50".

5.   Gary Harrison (3)

Please see comments in respect of Stephen Harrison above.    See
also page 265 and 267 of the Transcript.   Entry was after 13.45
and before 14.50.   We conclude    the column relating to entry
time should be the same as Stephen Harrison.

6.   Stephen Paul Cq p o c (71)
Page 359 of the Transcript states Mr. Copoc left a public house
at about 14.25 and page 360 of the Transcript states he arrived
at the ground at 14.35. JJe 'O&nctudte.that the column relating to
entry time should therefore read "after 14.35".

7.   William Rov Pemberton (65)
Page 397 of the Transcript states Mr. Pemberton was identified
in pen 4 at 14.45.    We conclude the column relating to entry
time should therefore read "prior to 14.45".

fij   Paul Anthony Hewitson (42)

Pages 539 and 540 of the Transcript state that Mr. Hewitson was
still on the bridge outside the ground at about 14.55 and he
therefore entered after 14.55. We conclude the column relating
to entry time should therefore read "after 14.55".
9.    Ian David Whelan (6)

Page 658 of the Transcript states that Hr. Whelan was identified
alive in enclosure 3 at 14.49. We conclude the column relating
to entry time should therefore read "before 14.49".

10. Vincent Michael Fitzsimmons (21 )

At page 677 of the Transcript Hr. Fitzsimmons is identified
outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles (albeit very close to gate
3) on a photograph at 14.57. We conclude the column relating to
entry time should therefore read "shortly after 14.57".
11. James Robert Hennessey (7)                            ‘

Page 742 of the Transcript states that Mr. Bickerstaff went to
the turnstiles at Leppings Lane at about 14.40 and was separated
from Mr. Hennessey.       On page 743 however Mr. Hennessey is
identified on video on'the terraces-at 14.56.    We conclude the
column dealing with entry time should therefore read "after
14.40 and before 14.56".<              *

Mr. Delaney was with Mr.’ Hennessey (see 7 above) and we would
refer you to pages 759 and 761 of the Transcript. . Mr. Delaney
was also separated outside the turnstiles at 14.40 but again has
been identified on video on the terraces at 14.56. We conclude
the column relating to entry time should therefore read "after
14.40 but before 14.56".     t          4  ..........


13. Philip John Steele (62)                       ~                    ;

Page 803 of the Transcript states         that Mr. Steele went into
enclosure 3 shortly after 14.00.          He in fact arrived at the
ground at 14.00 hours. We conclude       the column relating to entry
time should therefore read "shortly      after 14.00 hours".

14. Eric George Hughes (41)
Mr. Hughes has been identified on video in pen 3 at 14.56. We
conclude   the column relating to entry time should therefore
read "Gate C open (but before 14.56)”.

15. Michael David Kelly (72)
On page 961 of the Transcript, Mr. Kelly has been identified
from a photograph at 14.45 in pen 3.     We conclude the column
relating to entry time should therefore read "before 14.45".

Page 956 of the Transcript states that Paul Kelly saw Mr. Kelly
enter the ground through a turnstile.   The column dealing with
means of entry should therefore state "turnstiles".

16. Carl Darren Hewitt (44)

Page 969 of the Transcript states that Mr. Hewitt was identified
on video in enclosure 3 at 14.50.    Page 971 of the Transcript
states that Mr. Hewitt was seen outside the ground at 14.09. We
conclude the column relating to entry time should therefore read
"after 14.09 and before 14.50".

17.   Nicholas Michael Hewitt (55)

At page 980 of the Transcript Mr. Hewitt is stated to have been
identified on video in pen 3 at 14.50. On the same page he has
been identified with his brother (Carl Hewitt, see above) from
his clothing on a photograph outside Leppings Lane at 14.09. We
conclude   the column relating to entry time should therefore
read "after 14.09 and before 14.50".

18.   Paul David Bradv (84)

At page 1231 of the Transcript Mr. Brady has been identified in
pen 3 on video at 14.56.    We conclude the column relating to
entry time should therefore read "before 14.56”.

19.   Gary Collins (48)
On page 276 of the Transcript, Mr. Malone states Mr. Collins
entered through the turnstiles at 14.45.  The reference in the
column dealing with entry times is therefore arbitrary and the
correct time should read "14.45".

We have a number of further comments in respect of the points
raised by Reynolds Porter Chamberlain in their letter of 29th
August and your response thereto in your letter of 5th
September.

a)   B C Matthews (22)

            rs evidence is quite clear the entry through gate C
was "at about 14.50".   We see no reason why these words should
not be included in the column relating to entry time.
b)   J Owens (34)

We appreciate that the video film outside the ground which has
been given the time as having been taken between 14.37 and 14.50
cannot be precise, but the Transcript evidence is that entry was
somewhere between 14.40 and 3 p.m. The column relating to entry
time should therefore read "Gate C, after 14.51 but before
15.00".

c)   G R Horn (59)

We note your comments but feel the column relating to entry
times should read "after 14.50".

We are in agreement with your own views (expressed in your
letter to Reynolds Porter Chamberlain of 5th September) that if
the Schedule is to be of use it is essential that it is
accurate.   As all the points we have raised in relation to it
are taken directly from the Transcript,        we await your
confirmation that the Schedule will be further amended as we
have suggested.

Finally, we note that Reynolds Porter Chamberlain are suggesting
reference should be made to the cause of death.       We suggest
Professor Usher's Generic Report (a copy is enclosed) prepared
for the Inquests would be appropriate for this purpose. Please
confirm you are agreeable to this. :

Dear Sirs

Hillsborough

We thank you for your letter dated the 12th September. As we
have already indicated, we agree the consolidated body plan.

In relation to our schedule, we note your comments and agree
the proposed amendments save as to the following t-
18 - Paul David Brady (84)

We suggest that the relevant entry should read "after about
1445 and before 1456.*    Page 12-26 of the transcript shows
that Mr Brady joined the crowd outside the turnstiles at about
14.45 pm.

19 - Gary Collins (48)

Page 277 refers to the photographic data base which shows Mr
Collins outside the turnstiles, taking into account the error
in the data base, at some point between 1437 and 1450.
Accordingly, we propose that the entry tine should read "at
about 1445".

We enclose a further schedule taking Into account your
amendments and our proposed amendments. Please confirm your
agreement to the schedule. A copy of this letter has been
sent to Reynolds Porter Chamberlain.

Yours faithfully

                          THE CONSOLIDATED PLAN


I have   attempted   to    give    the       references        and   times    for    the

identifications marked on the consolidated plan along with any

summary of the evidence (if appropriate). I have also sought to

refer to any other relevant plans by reference to the "C" number

ascribed to them at the Inquests.

                 there was no evidence given at the Inquest as to

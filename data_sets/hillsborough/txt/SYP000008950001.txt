ground.           The       other         lads           knew        the       way    to       the    ground           from       previous

visits.

We    went       into           the      p ub      f or       a drink. I had                   three        pints        andI think            most

of    the    others             had      the       same.             There were                other       fans        in th e       p u b , but no

one    was       drunk          and      there           was        no     ba d b e h a v i o u r .

All    ten       of    us       left      th e         pub      to w a l k to          the          ground        at   about        .12.15        pm

there       were       no       crowds.                On     the        way    I d i d n ’t s e e          any        Police       Officers

the    way       anyway.              There            were         no    problems             with       any     fans       on    the    way      to

could        have       done.           It    took        about       ten minutes                or    so    to      get    to    the

of    the     turnstiles.We                   were        standing          n e xt    to     a     large        concertina              gate

the    t u r n s t i 1 e s .A t         that       point        we    decided         that        w e ’d b e t t e r        get     in to             get

a    decent        vie w .         We    went        for    the       tunnel         because           we    thought          it w a s         the

only     way       to    get       to    the       terracing.

I w a s n ’t a w a r e         that          there        was    any       other      access           to    the      terracing.                  I

We    walked        together             down        the    right          hand      side        of    the      tunnel.           Although

it w a s      busy and             there        was       lot    of     jostling,            it       seemed         perfectly              normal

under        the    circumstances,                    a n d we        walked         down        quite       easily.

was    fencing           dividing                the       terrace           up     into       pens.              At    this        point         when        I

c o u l d n ’t t r a v e l         any       further             I. r e a l i s e d         that        a    large          crowd        had      come        in

behind        m e and         I was          trapped             with        my a rms          at       my    side.              I d i d n ’t h a v e

any    control           over          my    movements.                    I was         aware          that       Eric          H A W K IN w a s

somewhere           just          in f r o n t of               me.        I immediately                     knew       the re w a s            going         to

be a       ser i ous         problem and                   I could           see       all     gate          in the          fencing            in f r o n t

of    me,     that       was       just          to    the       right         of      th e    goal.              I realised               that

someone          would        have          to     open         the     gate        at      some        stage          to    release            the

pressure           and       I was          shouting             to     th e      others           to       try    to       get     down        to     the

■force m y         w a y over           towards             th e      gate.            It     took          about       five        rnintues           or     so

for    me     to    get       there          and       then          1 got a           few yards              away          from        it.       I was

aware       that        it    had       been          opened,           although              I d i d n ’t see               who        ha d    opened            it.

1 spilled           through             the        gate         onto       t he     pitch and                immediately                 sa w

            and                                            in    front         of      me.         1 doubled                over        with      a    pain

point       I w a s n ’t e v e n             aware          that        it     had       started.                 Almost          immediately                 we

were       all     together             with          the       exception              of                               and Eric               H A W K IN,

Police        Officer             c a me     up       to    us       and     pushed           us    over          to    the       right         side        of

the    goal        and       told       us       to    go       i nto      the      pen       on    the       terracing                 which         we    did.

As    we    went        into       t he      pe n      I saw a young                     boy who             looked about                  10 y r s

collapse           on    the       pitch           near         to    the      corner          flag.              I think           I saw         someone

jump       out     of    th e      stands             and       run a c r o s s          to    him.           Then          it    just         seemed

quite a f ew mi nut es to get                   to the      location       concerned,         but      t op s peed

was m ai n t a i n e d and       I estimate         it took        10 to     13 minutes           to a c t u a l l y    g

rear    of the L e p pings Ln stand                 1 was met          by constant          verbal      abuse       and.

threats       from m any        of the football             fans    outside        the     ground.      M any were

obviously emotionally                  upset and        could be seen to be                 crying.       1

ascertained        that     there       had been a crush               inside      the     ground      in the

Leppi n g s    Ln stand and that many                   people were          injured.

along    that     service        road     for    emergency         vehicles,        in order         that     they

could enter        via L e p p i n g s     Ln,    and     exit     via P e n i s t o n e    Rd.    Whilst      at      th

location a young            boy of about            9yrs was        brought        out of the ground                nea

              ambulance,          w hich was about          100 yards away.         Whilst      carrying          this    boy

              was    verbally a b u s e d     by a number          of football        fans who all           spoke wit h

              Liverpool          accents,    one    in particular         called me a         *Bas t a r d , " and spat-

              It was apparent            to me that a         lot of the       football       fans     outside       the

              s tand were         very drunk.       They were a b u s i v e and a g g r e s s i v e         and    hindered

              there     seemed      to be only       light     traffic      on the motorway.            Football

              traffic         in particular        never    seemed heavy at any time                  during my          patro

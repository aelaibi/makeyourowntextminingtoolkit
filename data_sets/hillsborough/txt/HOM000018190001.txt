Thank you for your letter of 17 April to the Prime Minister which has been
passed to this Department in view of our responsibilities for sports ground
safety legislation.


We are very grateful to you for your offer of assistance and for your
condolences to the families of those who died at Hillsborough.   I have
arranged for copies of your correspondence to be passed both to the Sport and
Recreation Division of the Department of the Environment and to the Sports
Council for information.


I have also copied your letter and enclosures to the Inauiry under
Lord Justice Taylor, which was set up by the Hone Secretary to look into the
Hillsborough tragedy in case there are any points which it might wish to
pursue with you.

                                                Private Secretary

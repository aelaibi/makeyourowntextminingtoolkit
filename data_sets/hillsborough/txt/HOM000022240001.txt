      Dear Sir

      Re:        Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry

      Further to our previous correspondence on this matter, one of the
      A & E Consultants involved in the hospital response to the
      Hillsborough Disaster has been invited to speak at a National
      Conference on Major Disasters and also to prepare an article for
      publication in the British Medical Journal.  He has asked for our
      advice on whether it would be appropriate to partake in either
      activity in view of the currency of the proceedings at the Public
      Inquiry into the Disaster.  The A & E Consultant is Mr J Wardrope
      of the Northern General Hospital and you will recall we have
      submitted a copy of his statement in draft.

      We have provisionally advised Mr Wardrope that he may find
      himself in difficulties by virtue of the Contempt of Court Act
      1981, insofar as it relates to Tribunals of Inquiry.  However, to
      be absolutely certain in our advice to him, we would like
      clarification of whether Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry is one to
      which the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 applies.  We
      should be grateful if you would advise us of the position
      immediately as our client is due to partake in the National
      Conference in early June.

      It would also be of great assistance to ourselves and our clients
      if you would advise whether any of the hospital staff are likely
      to be called to give evidence to the Inquiry.  You will
      appreciate our clients find it strange that we are advising them
      not to partake in professional discussions about the medical
      issues raised by the Disaster, when they do not yet know whether

HILLSBQRODGH: COSTS OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE




In irry letter of 27 June I made an offer of a special payment towards the costs
of the investigation, in view of the special factors which apply in this
case.


I had hoped that I would have heard from you by now that your Authority agrees
to the proposal.   I am most anxious that this issue should be resolved as soon
as possible.


The costs to the West Midlands Police are high and are mounting daily.               Until
the refunding arrangements are resolved the Vfest Midlands remain out of
pocket.   This is manifestly unfair.   The offer of additional finance cannot be
held open indefinately, and I would be grateful if you would be kind enough to
let me know your Authority's view as a matter of urgency.

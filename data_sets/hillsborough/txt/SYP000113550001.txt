2.4 0 P.M.       raucous           shouting and         chanting     of Liverpool        fans       intimidating

even though         coming         from some        distance away,        coming       towards Leppings

Lane    turnstiles,            down Leppings Lane.                (Sound of either a drun k e n mob

or high spirits,               difficult          to tell which).

 :„43 p.m.       sudden arrival              of    innumerable Liverpool           fans,       1 d i d n ’t see

the    resulting         crush develop as               it happened that         quickly from kneeling

down to search someone                  by the       time    1' stood up,     a serious         crush had

developed on the               turnstiles.

I was     now unable           to search or          check    for alcohol        due    to    crush of

people.     The     s i t u a t i o n was     now very dangerous,           young       children,          old

persons     etc.        were       in very    real      danger    of fainting      and/or       being

crushed at the turnstiles.                        The    crowd did not      respond at all             to

repeated shouts               by myself       to move       back and ease the           pressure.

In light        of si t u a t i o n at       (4) went       through turnstiles           and sought          out

unknown Sergeant               of the    s i t uation outside the turnstiles.                       People

were    now coming            through    stiles         in a state of      partial       faint,       stating

“Someone's         going       to die    out there,"          etc.

U nable    to    return to designated                   position outside         ground       due    to the

pressure        of the        crowd outside          the ground.

infuriated members                 of    public.

Youths were           visible       climbing       over   the wall        above   the West S tand

L eppings          Lane    end.     (This    had also       been apparent         since about 2.30 or

2.4 3 when youths were first                      seen climbing       onto the walls           dividing        the

N orth and West Stands                   entrance).       I a p p r e h e n d e d one y outh    of about          14-

15 who had just              jumped down from the wall?                   but was    told by

supervision,              I c a n ’t remember who,          to    release    him.

(?)

The       noise and        commotion from outside was                continually getting worse,

it was a p p arent           that       someone    or more       likely several       people?        would get

se r i o u s l y    injured       if something was          not done       quickly.

The gates were              then opened at the West Stand,                   I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y

 ^000       fans     upwards       rush through       the    gates    straight       into    the tunnel

    eading     into the West Stand.                 There was a solid mass              of    people

streaming           in for what          seemed    like a long time maybe a minute.                      Anyone

in front           had no option but           to go forward straight               down the      tunnel       due

to the mass           of people          pushing them from          behind.       Those at       the sides

could have           broken off,          but d i d n ’t appear      to.

1 immediately went                 outside and       rejoined my serial             on the     turnstiles

outside        the N o r t h Stand,         Leppings Lane          end.     There were        now virtually

no fans outside              the    turnstiles,        I w ould say only about               twenty.       I-or

the       first     time    I heard the        public address         system asking           fans    * to

move       back at L e p pings Lane            end’.

(   12)

Police Sergeant              458 Whit l a m shouted out             something       like,     "COME ON I-ANS

ON THE PITCH," after a message                       he had heard on his             personal        radio.

At     that,       in company with other members                   of the serial,         we followed

               Police Sergeant                W h i t l a m and        r e-entered the ground and               ran round onto

               the     pitch from the S outh Stand.

               (-13)

               On going           onto     the    pitch,       an      invasion a p p e a r e d to be         in the    process    of

               taking        place.         Fans were           climbing        over    the   security fencing at           the

               L e p pings Lane            end.        At this         point    I d i d n ’t appreciate what was            taking

               place.            I c o u l d n ’t see       immediately what was wrong                   but was       informed by

               a Traffic Officer what was                             happening.

               (14)

               In company with Police Sergeant W h i t l a m and other                                   officers we       entered

               immediately the                left hand side                 of the West 'Stand? as you            face    it.     It

j              then        became      fully apparent what                    had happened.        We were       told to form a

               line        to push       people        back so others            could get       to those       in the    central

               portion.            I tried        for some            time    but, it was almost         futile as too many
’   9$ m X l
               people were             ignoring and             pushing        from behind.

               (15)

               I looked up and saw a young                             boy who    looked about          12?    who was    green

               and obviously dead,                     being hauled over               the    central    fencing       behind the

               goal    .
               (16)

               At     this       I felt      I had to help other                 people who may have a chance?

               still        in the       central        section?         so I climbed over          the s e c u r i t y fencing

               into        the    central        section of the West S t a n d to help.                        At this time

               there were            still       too many         people       in the    central    sect i o n to be able             to

               move        properly and admin i s t e r                 first aid       correctly.        I then       checked

               pulses        of     cas u a l t i e s / b o d i e s    etc.     I helped with what             emergency    first

               ai d    I could,          I removed bodies                (too many to          remember any details),             I

               passed some             over      the    fence         to other    officers.        I also       p rioritised      the

               evacu a t i o n of          casualties who               still    had    pulses wherever          possible.        I

               was helped            by many Liverpool                  supporters       initially,       as    there were       not

         many officers    in the       central   section    initially,    however,     some were

         still   obstructive,     only three      or four   though.      The m a j o r i t y were

         excellent    in that    they did what       they were   told to and as        such,    we

         were able    to get    some    casualties   out quicker      than without

         assistance.     There    was    no room to give m o u t h to mouth as the           room     it

         would take    up w o u l d have meant     there w ould not have        been enough         room

         to   remove/aid other     casualties.

The      journey           to S h e f f i e l d      took about            3 hours           as      I k n o w we           left

Liverpool            at a b o u t        8 . 3 0 am,        (0830)       & got         t * M 3 h e f f i e l d at           11.30 am

We     parked        the M in i          bus     in a s t r e e t        about         a ten minute                   walk       from       the

stopped            for     a drink        in the        City & then made                     our w a y           to    the S t a d i u m .

There         were        a few     supporters              s till      drinking            outside          a    pub       but    nothing

out      of    the        ordinary.            1 can        remember          seeing         one       or    two       police          officers

I d o n ’t k n o w w h a t        time       this    would      be       I sat     down      on the       terracing           to

recover       when        other       fans    l i f t e d me    out       & jyfer      the    dividing        fence       &    into

Pens    1-2.

I never       s aw     the    barrier         co1lapse/although                  I realise          I must      h av e    b ee n

very    c lo se      to    it.

When    I sat        down     on the         terracing         I could            see a      pile      of b o d i e s         to my

left,      the    bodies         at    the    bottom     had        no    chance       they must           have    been

trampled         on.

Once    I was        in P e n     1 -2,       I searched around                  to    see    if    I could       find my

friends.          I was       cr yi n g.       I k ept      telling            supporters          that    fans     had       died

in t h e     crush.          I d o n ’t t h i n k     any      of    them       b e l i e v e d me.

I saw an a m b ulance                 come    onto    the      pitch &            at   t hi s      poi nt I j us t            walked

out    the    way      I had      entered.




I did      not w i t n e s s      anything          I consider            to    be a    criminal          offence.




My    views      & observations               on the     tragedy are               t ha t    although        it was

chaotic       outside         th e     ground & having               experienced             the    crush     outside          I

would      not    blame       anyone         for    opening         the    gate.

PERSONAL



Dear Peter,

     I am enclosing a progress report on the services provided post Hillsborough
which sets out the position in respect of the Co-ordination and Regional Unit. / It
appears that we are likely to receive some financial support towards this development
to cover about £85,000 in a full year (pro rata for the period to 31.3.90), burt we are
still seeking at least funding for the core element of the service and ideally for the
original submission.                                                         I
     My reason for writing to you is to explore if there is any financial assistance
which the Club is able to offer.    I understand that you are considering the income
generated from the Cup Final.    It may be that you have already decided on a particular
course of action, but if not I hope you may be prepared to give this request favourable
consideration.

     I am also enclosing correspondence with the F.A. I did send you a copy of my
original letter and am still hopeful that there may be a favourable result when the F.A.
consider the disbursement of the proceeds from the Charity Shield Match.

     The Local Authority Social Services Departments working with other agencies are
still very committed to the provision of help and assistance to supporters who are
experiencing problems following Hillsborough. Where there are a large number of victims
and survivors the Authorities are making provision for direct services.   Here in
Liverpool, for example, we are currently committed to expenditure of the order of
£200,000 p.a. for our Counselling Services, in addition to the Regional Unit.


                                                                  / you may

Mr. Peter Robinson,                                       25th July, 1989.
Chief Executive, Liverpool F.C.

     You may be able and prepared to make some small space available in the
Match Programme at the beginning of the new season to carry the Helpline 'phone
number and possibly other promotional material.

     Thank you for all your help in the past and I look forward to our continuing
collaboration in the future.

    With best wishes.


                                  Yours sincerely,
HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER UNIT AND DROP-IN CENTRE           PROGRESS SUMMARY


1. Following the Disaster in Sheffield on 15th April action has been taken to ensure
   that victims have been assisted and the Social Services Departments have co-ordinated
   the disaster response.

2.   On 29th April the seven Councils of the area, together with Nottinghamshire and
     Sheffield, considered a Report (After Hillsborough - already circulated) which
     stressed the continuing need for co-ordinated response. The Report was agreed, in
     principle, and officers requested to investigate sources of finance. The services to
     be provided by the Unit have been maintained to date by Liverpool Social Services staff
     with support from the other Departments.

3. From the beginning Social Services Departments agreed a concerted approach to
   Hillsborough. It was recognised that direct services to survivors and families would
   be provided within each Authority, but that certain services should be provided across
   all Authorities from one Unit.

4.   The Helpline has continued to provide a 7 day/week service since midday on 16th April
     and nearly 3,000 people have used this service from all over the country. A Database
     (computerised) has been established to ensure that people are not either missed from
     service or experience intrusive visiting. This database will also be expanded to track
     people involved in Hillsborough who may be identified from other sources. Many people
     involved live outside the seven Authorities involved and co-ordination of both
     information and outreach work across the country is necessary.

5.   There is a continuing need for training and staff development to tackle this sensitive
     and often intensive work. The interest of the media has predictably diminished follow­
     ing the first week and it is necessary to promote positive publicity. The production
     of a Newsletter for circulation has begun. There are obviously major support require­
     ments within a Core Unit. Plans are finalised for a permanent outreach, centre near
     Anfield to be run with maximum user involvement.

6.   The proposals, contained in After Hillsborough, can be reduced by creating a shared
     Administration System for the Liverpool and Unit services. The Unit services can be
     progressed from their present uncertainty through the appointment of a core of staff
     supported by the Liverpool Counselling Team and staff from other Local Authorities.

7.   The proposal approved on 29th April would cost £350,000 during 1989/90, basic elements
     can be provided for £125,364. The service will be exceedingly difficult to maintain
     without this minimal level of funding. Staff have been diverted from the substantive
     responsibilities and carried increased workloads. This demonstrates a high level of
     personal commitment, but leaves this service, which is crucial to the services to
     families and survivors, in a marginal position. An initial appraisal of the service
     carried out recently shows that the uncertainty and lack of substantial co-ordination
     leads to problems and breakdown.

8.   Drop-In Centre

     Plans have been prepared for a Centre as a base for activities for victims and their
     families. This would be a module construction by Premier Building Systems and would
     provide for interview facilities; group meetings/activities rooms; kitchen; offices and
     storage facilities. The estimated cost of such a Unit is £72,000 plus fees of £3,500
     and furniture and equipment of £20,000.

     The builders have indicated that they would carry out the construction immediately
     provided that a guarantee was given that the costs would be met in due course.

9.   Newsletter
     Experience from other major disasters indicate that a very effective method of assist­
     ing victims is through a Newsletter/Magazine enabling victims to share their experience;
     and make contact with others similarly affected. It also reaches out to victims who are
                                                                           /unable

    unable/unwilling to seek help via Helpline or other agencies. Production of such a
    Newsletter costs approximately £800 per edition; the annual cost will be £2,400.

10. Personnel

    A Unit which combined the need for a regional approach with the staff already approved
    by the Councils could provide a way forward. In this connection the following posts
    are required, viz:-

    Assistant Director (Hillsborough Disaster Unit) Grade P.0.6 (£18,942-£20,232)
    Co-ordinator (Helpline/Outreach) Grade P.0.2 (£14,178-E15,417 p.a.)

Dear Mr Mason,


                                       Hillsborough Tragedy

      Further to our recent correspondence, I can now inform
you that your proposal was considered by the Executive
Committee of The Football Associaton at their meeting last
week.

      I regret to have to tell you that the Committee were not
willing to make funds available additional to the payments The
Association is making to the appeal fund.

      I am sorry we are unable to help you, but I hope that,
nevertheless, the local authorities find themselves able to
fulfil these important commitments satisfactorily.




                                           Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Kelly,

                                     Hillsborough Tragedy

     Thank you for your letter of 3rd July indicating the position of the
Association.

     I am enclosing a progress report which sets out the position in respect of
co-ordination and the Regional Unit. It appears that we are likely to attract around
£85,000 p.a. (pro rata from the period to 31.3.90) towards the running of the Helpline,
Outreach and Database.

     Local Social Services Departments are committing very scarce resources to their
direct services for victims of Hillsborough.   Here in Liverpool, for example, we are
projected to spend £200,000 p.a. on our counselling service. This is in addition to
the Regional Unit.

     My reason for writing again is to enquire if the Association would be prepared to
consider providing financial assistance from the money which will be allocated from the
Charity Shield Match on 12th August.

     Any assistance you are able to offer would be much appreciated and if you require
any further information in order to consider this request I would be happy to provide
it.
                                       Yours sincerely,



                                       Director o:             /ices.

As       normal,           having             booked          on,       myself                  and                                                   sent       for       a

walk          to    see        how      many           of    the       crowd         had             arrived.             We    did        this        by    going

up       a    stair        entry          to       the       North          Stand               seating.             It     would          now        be    about

2pm.          I would           have          said          the    Spion          Kop            was       very        full      for        that           time       as

was          the   South          stand.               The    West          stand               seating          was        filling             lup        but     where

I stood             I would             say        very       few       were         in          the       North          Stand.           Looking           towards

the          Leppings           Lane          terracing                but    not               that       many        to      the    sides.               I knew

that          that        end    was          for       Liverpool             fans               and       we     commented                amongst

ourselves                 how     few         fans          there       were         for             that       time.

Having             looked         briefly               about          the    ground                  we    returned             to        the        First        Aid

I    looked           over       to     our        corner          and        saw      the       hand          held        stretcher             w e    had

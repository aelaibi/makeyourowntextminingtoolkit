             This     statement          is about       the    incident         at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football     Ground,

             P e n i s t o h e Road,      Sheffield,          on Saturday,            15th April,       1989       (150489).

              I became aware             of having        to attend          the FA Semi-Final           by the usual          and

              customary means             of teleprinter messages                     followed by an a d v i s o r y

             m inute with details                of Officers            in my command and finally a full

             Operational           Order was sent to me w ith                    copies     for the      two S e rgeants

             who were to work with me.                        My first         task was     to attend a pre-brief

              for    Inspectors          and above,         in the N o r t h S tand at the S h e f f i e l d

              order     stated that           full    serial          orders w ould       be handed out            on that

              date,     in fact        I received them by D i visional                     mail    previously.

              These     documents         can be       produced         by me    if required.

              9.00am      (0900),        Friday,       14th April,           1989     (1404895

              On this       date     I came on duty at R a w m a r s h Police S t a t i o n                  and in     company

              of my colleague,              Inspector John N’ewey from this station,                               we travelled

              to H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m and took          up a position          in the N orth S tand of

              the ground where              briefings         normally         take    place.

              A public address              system was used to speak                    to the a s s e m b l e d    Officers.

              The    principle address               to the      ground        commanders was         given by Chief

              S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d who    spoke    from     pre-prepared notes w hich

were    in effect a reiteration of the w r i t t e n operational                                     plan.     The

whole     of the operational               scenario was             related to us                clearly and with

emphasis       on the      public safety aspect.                      I made a few brief               notes on

the writ t e n order           in relation to where                   to    collect         radios,    rneals and

reporting         off duty.           We were       then further add r e s s e d by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

M u r r a y who    r e - e m p h a s i s e d the     public      safety      procedures           to be followed

in case the ground had to be evacuated,                                  the e vacuation            procedure    had

been tested and had a p p a r e n t l y been found to be excellent.

Subsequently,          when the         largest         group broke          up with their            respective

g round    commanders,           in company with S u p e r i n t e n d e n t C h a p m a n we walked

the area of         concern       in Herries Road and were                      given a visual

e -plana t i.on of our duties.                     S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Chap m a n    pointed      out all

the    places      of concern to me and gave me further                               verbal        instructions

to not a l l o w N o t t i n g h a m     supporters            to de-bus at the D e v o n s h i r e Public

H ouse and the Five Arches Public House                               in Herries Road.                The    buses

a nd m i ni-vans were           to be directed to their                      d e signated         parking     places

near    the ground         before       dise m b a r k i n g     passengers.           I was       told what     to

do before,         during      and after           the match.            In particular            to have     both my

serials       in Pen i s t o n e Road by kick-off                   time.

Just    before      -12 noon      (1200)      that        date,     Inspector Newey and myself                   took

a Police       vehicle       to the area of Herries Road and obtained a good view

of the task         in hand.           My job t h erefore was to supervise                           two serials

of Police O f f icers            in    Herries Road to Police                     the arrival of the

Nottingham         football       fans before and after                     the match.

Saturday,         15th April,          1989        (1504895

This    day    commenced at            8 . 00am       (0800)      when anumber          of C2       Sub

Divisional         personnel          and myself          paraded for duty at R a w m a r s h Police

Station,       we boarded a bus and t r a v e l l e d via R o t h e r h a m DHQ to

H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium,       arriving         at 9 . 3 0 a m     (09305.          At   10.00am     (1000)

we were seated            in the North Stand,                  I was       sub-sector 23 and
                                                                                                           PAGE

responsible          for       serials 57-58,         I had two Officers absent                   from the

serials,        Police Co n s t a b l e 2940 F a r n s w o r t h and Police Co n s t a l b e 794

Palmer,       one from each serial.                   1' gave    the Sergeants            their written

O perational         Orders       and    informed them of the directions                        given to me by

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Chapman.        Chief     Inspector Price,             my    immediate

supervisor         for the duration              liaised w i t h      us and       criminal       information

about     travelling Liverpool                 pick-pockets         was d i s s e m i n a t e d amongst      the

serials.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    10.00am     (1000)     the   briefing        of the entire          contingent

of Police O f f icers             commenced.         Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    Duckenfield

repeated his well                stru c t u r e d address       in the same manner as the

previous        day and all          ground      commanders       stood up and            identified

t hemselves        to the        collected Officers.              Superintendent Murray                  repeated

the    evacuation          procedure        details a n d CID Officers                  spoke about       their

role     in the operation.

The serials          then d i s persed and            collected       raios and meals,             and at

10.30am       (1030)       refreshments were             consumed         in the    form of a packed

lunch.

At    10.45am       (10455       this date,       together with            both my serials,             we walked

to Herries Road - A 6102 - and spaced O f f icers                             in pairs along a two

mile stretch of this road.

This     particular            road was     being    used as the main a p p r o a c h             road for

vehicular        traffic         from N o t t i n g h a m s h i r e and    contained two          public

houses on the            route.         We took up position               on the    road and Officers

were     stationed at            both    public     houses with           instructions          to turn away

buses and min i - v a n s           from the      public      houses.        I was       joined by Chief

Inspector Price and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t C h a p m a n was               visible         in a Police

vehicle along the                length of Herries Road throughout                        our    time    in that

location.

                                                                                                            R251A

with    some      cons i d e r a b l y heavy verbal            traffic.        I found no        reason to

use the       radio myself as most                  of my    commu n i c a t i o n had to be done

verbally to the Officers                    in my      command without           radio     contact,,      in fact

I had only to           respond to the              radio    twice,        once to    locate myself          for

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t C h a p m a n who    then gave me verbal             instructions and once

to take a message              for a serial            S e r geant    to    contact R o t he r h a m CID on

an urgent a d m i ni s t r a t i o n task,             S e r geant    -1771 John s o n      in fact      did this

by public         telephone.          Most       of the     radio     traffic       that    I can    remember

was about        the    location of travelling                  groups       of fans and       trouble       spots

e lsewhere        in the      city.       Generally         I found the        radio       communication

adequate.

My   instructions as             stated were           complied with and Chief                Inspector

Price and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t C h a p m a n were          in constant         s u p e r v i s i o n at all

times,      as    time went        by, and        it is now difficult- to be specific about

i ntermediate          times,      vehicular         traffic      even t u a l l y gave way         to

c onsiderable          foot    traffic          in Herries      Road,       several      walking     fans

reported         to me that        buses had drop p e d them off as far away as

B u r n g r e a v e Road    some 2 to 3 miles               further away than the              1 to 2 miles

we were a l r e a d y d i s tanced              from the     ground.         Most    of the enquiries

from N o t t i n g h a m fans were about                how to get back to B u r n g r e a v e Road

after     the match.

It was quite a p p arent              that a p roportion of the N o t t i n g h a m                 fans were

taking adv a n t a g e        of the      fine weat h e r and          the    long march       to equip

t hemselves        with adequate            refreshments,            about 50       percent    of the       people

w alking      down H e r r i e s Road were             carrying       packs and       cans of beer and

lager.        However,        there was          no u n p l e a s a n t r i e s and no     incidents within

my s ig h t .

The D e vonshire Public House at the                         top of Herries Road soon filled

with families w ith              pre-arranged           luncheon       bookings and          instructions

were     left with the           supervising Police Cons t a b l e s                 to direct al 1 n t.Hg r

persons       arriving at      the Devo n s h i r e       to the      football       ground area.

At    12 noon     (1200)    this date,        I liaised with Su p e r i n t e n d e n t            Chap m a n at

the Five Arches          Public House at the               junction of Herries               Road and

(Teynham Road)?            This was      in response           to a radio          call,    on arrival          at

the Five Arches          I saw that       the     public       house was       full    to brimming with

a queue outside          "10-20 persons         long.        A doorman was           operating a per--

capita       basis    of entry and exit,            the    pub was         noisy but was well

s upervised       by Officers.         Many N o t t i n g h a m fans who            could not enter             the

public       house went     immedia tely to a nearby off-licence and                              consumed

cans and bottles           of beer     in the       pub car        park.      The    o ff-licence was

eventually        practically        bought     out of stock,              again there was          no

trouble and everyone was               in good heart.

2. 3 0 p m   (1430)   - This    situation continued                just     like this and            at this

time     I was    concerned to        advise m a t c h      control        that Herries Road             was

now a solid          phalanx   of    people all        walking        to the match,          still about

50 percent       of them were         carrying a l c o h o l i c          drink,    they were       noisy but

not quarrelsome.

2. 4 5 p m   (1445)    - The Five Arches            pub was        still     full    but    the    car   park

was    now devoid of        people all        of whom were            now walking          the    remaining

mile     to the ground,        there was        plenty of noise              from pedestrians and

passing       vans,    we had no trouble            here     but    the     radio was alive with

incidents        of fighting and d runkenness at other                        locations.

2. 5 0 p m   (1450)    - The   pub    was     thr e e - q u a r t e r s   full and without

problems.         I instructed        all my Officers              to follow the           crowd     to the

ground and        re— group    in Penistone Road,                this      is p r e - a rranged and        is

done     principally by hand signals                  passed       up the     chain of Officers

along Herries Road.             I then      personally           commenced to walk               towards

Hillsborough          roughly between two groups                   of Police Officers,              some well

in front       of me and a few behind me.                    I was alone at this                 time.

the    radio    reports      from       inside and outside             the ground           relating mainly

to what      I assu m e d    to be the L e p p i n g s Lane            end of the ground.                  I heard

about    crowd trouble with               lots of       pushing and           shouting,       it was

possible       to hear      the       noise    of the    crowd on the           radio system             in the

b a ckground of the Officers                   transmissions.              The sound of the              crowd was

alarming       in so m uch that           it did not          sound    right,     it    is difficult            to

say why but the          sound f r ightened and                perturbed me quite                 strikingly.

I heard S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     Marshall    on the         radio asking         for       *A*    gate   to

be opened,       I know Mr.           Marshall     quite well          due to working              with him and

knowing     him for m any years.                 I know him to be an              intelligent and

sound Policeman,            quite       pragmatic at times and                 certainly an

experi e n c e d Police manager.                 I could hear Mr.              Marshall       asking

persistently for a gate                  to be opened          to avoid        loss of       life and the

word    ’catastrophe'          was      used several          times    to emphasise the                 need for

the    crowd sit u a t i o n to be            relieved.       I    heard a request for                  the start

of the m atch to be delayed and a reply to the effect                                       that    it was      now

too    late as the        players        had set off for            the      pitch.     Superintendent

Marshall       persisted with his               requests       to open a gate,              his    request was

refused and        clarified           by control       and e v e n t u a l l y the d e c i s i o n to opieri

the gate was         taken but several             dif f i c u l t i e s     seemed    to be met          during

the    process     of getting           officials       to a c t u a l l y    physically open the

gate.      At this      time      I    paused to speak with                Inspector Wallace and a

group of Offic e r s         in a team van near                to the ground,           we    passed       comment

to each other about               the    requests       for    the gate to be opened.

Superintendent          Marshall         could still          be   heard patiently asking                 for the

gate    to be opened w ith the sound of                       an a ngry crowd          in    the

background.          I wa l k e d on towards            the Penistorie Road             end of

H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium.

message - “E v e ry b o d y onto           the    pitch    immediately" - this was                    repeated

three     times    I believe,

3.02pm     (1502)      - I a p p r o a c h e d Pe n i s t o n e Roa d where        1 saw about          100-200

fans waiting         to effect          entry to the S p i o n Hop,           there was        no,trouble

and    only normal        cheering        could be heard           from the ground.              I assumed

that a pitch         invasion had taken place and my Officers were                                   clearing

the    field.      I entered the ground and went                       to the    pitch entrance              to

find my serial.             I went       s p e c i f i c a l l y down the slope       between the North

S t a n d and the S p i o n Hop and m e t . d ir e c t l y with S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marsh

who    greeted me and           requested me to take               charge of a group of Officers

at the S p i o n Hop end and to face and                       control     the N o t t i n g h a m

supporters at          this     end.      I collected a group of O f f icers                   just arriving

an d spread them along                 the end of the          pitch,     a number      of dogs and

handlers were          present and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t        M arsh gave     instructions            for

them to be kept           out of sight           so as    not    to a g gravate       the    crowd.          He

told me then that               probably more       than 30 people were dead at                       the

L e p p i n g s Lane End of the field.                  I then     looked s p e c i f i c a l l y towards

that end and saw Police Officers and fans                              rendering      first aid         to

people on the          pitch,      there were more             than enough O f f i c e r s       to    contain

the situation.            People were         climbing         over    the fence,       through the

gates and up the           front       of the     rear stand.

It seemed quite           calm at this           time    but    nothing     could be heard for the

sound of N o t t i n g h a m      supporters       jeering       at the Liverpool            fans,      they

also    thought      it was a pitch           invasion.

L ook i n g at this       incident        from the other           end of the field,             it seemed

well    organised,        senior Officers           were       present and       people were           being

m o v e d and a t t e n d e d    to.     I assu m e d that       sufficient        personnel          were

present due to a line of Officers                        containing        the   incident across              the

field of       play.

facing    the other way,           not an easy task when                 I wa n t e d to get    ’stuck

in* with my sect i o n who were                in the      thick    of    it, most       of the Officers

at the S pion Hop end were               feeling      the same       but with the strong

command       re-inf o r c e d by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t C h a p m a n and Chief

Superintendent          Nesbit,       who were      e ncouraging and giving               support    to

everyone,       we    event u a l l y mana g e d    to focus our a t t e n t i o n on the

N ot t i n g h a m supporters.

I cannot,       under any       circumstances,          be    precise about         times at all

during    this       stage,    the extent      of the        disaster was         now known to

Offic e r s    but    not a pp a r e n t l y to the N o t t i n g h a m supporters who were

jeering and          chanting abuse at everyone.                   On this       basis,    I myself went

to the    crowd and told           people at the front what                 had happened.           I asked

Officers with rne to do the same,                    we told them          people were       dead and

injured and asked             them not to jeer.              The message was soon            passed back

into the       crowd who were          quick   to    respond and at the same                time dead

bodies were          being    placed near the S p i o n Kop end for                 collection,          this

sobering       sight    soon    changed the         jeering      to applause        for    the efforts

of the    rescuers who were             by now bringing            injured and stretcher

casualties          to the exit areas.             An unusual       aside at this          point    is the

fact    that the       bodies    that were         being     placed down at         the    point    near me

all    seemed       to be heavily       built males w hich seemed                 to contradict          later

reports       of young       people    being   the m a j o r i t y of victims.             Two Brit i s h

T r ansport     Police Officers          had become          involved at the S p i o n Ko p end of

the ground.           They had spotted five Liverpool                     fans    in the S p i o n Kop

end,    they were       removed and sent            to the N orth Stand            for    their own

safety.

My group persisted             in m aintaining        our superv i s o r y        role at the Spion

Kop end of the ground when the ground s u d denly became                                 invaded    by

press    photographers who went amongst                      the a c t i v i t y at all     parts    of the

ground.        At    this    stage,    the fans and ourselves               broke    up the

ad v e r t i s i n g   hoardings      to use as stretchers,                  the    crowd was       by now well

s ubdued as the            reality of the            s i tuation       pervaded the ground.

Suddenly,         without warning,            a charge          by Liverpool         fans    in the       casualty

a rea took         place as       they a t t a c k e d the       photographers         on the       pitch,       many

of them were a s s a u l t e d          before we were able                to quell     the matter          by

reasoning with them and asking                        them to        return to the          casualty area

and    be of use.           No arrests were made,                  it was a case of the

photographers             pride    being    injured,          they were frightened.                 They were

m a r s h a l l e d together and told to stay                    in the      penalty area          of the Spion

Kop end,,         Most     of them      chose       to put their          cameras     on the       floor and

ceased       recording,         some of course did not.                    In response        to this       the

ground       commanders         brought a further               cordon of Police O f f icers               onto

the    pitch to         contain     the    casulaty area more securely,                      this was well

appreciated            by everyone        in particular            the    photgraphers who were              not

happy.

No w   commenced a long s u cc ession of                      casualty movement             off    the    pitch

and out of the ground by what a p p e a r e d                        to be a well       org a n i s e d    chain

of events.             Looking around         I could see that many                  people and Police

Officers were            now declining           into shock.

This     procession of the dead and                    injured        past our       point seemed to

continue for an eternity,                     I myself          cried on a number            of occasions

and the tension              physically and m e n t a l l y was awe                 inspiring,        I felt

alert      but out of time?            most      strange.          At this moment a

S u perintendent,            not known to me,              a d d r e s s e d all   sections       of the    crowd

with a loudhailer asking                   for      co-operation,          he was a p p l a u d e d      by the

crowd,       I then heard K enny D a l g l e s h on the                   tannoy system doing              the

same     thing.

The    next Police           instru c t i o n was an          intention to cancel             the match,          the

dogs were          brought      out to face          the    crowd at the Spion Kop end in case

of problems            by the N o t t i n g h a m    crowd.        The a n n o u n c e m e n t was giu-ejn— cm

the tannoy system that                    the match was             cancelled and          could the      crowd

delay their           exit from the ground                   for    five minutes          to facilitate

removal       of    casualties.              No   problems arose and the dogs were                      removed.

W i t h i n minutes       of this anno u n c e m e n t             the S pion Kop empt i e d orderly.

I redeployed my group of Officers                              outside        the ground      in Penistone

Road    to supervise             the    removal        of the       crowd by bus to the train

station.           Outs i d e    the ground most O f f i c e r s               seemed fully employed              but

some who       had been          called       in later seemed at a loss,                    drivers     in

vehicles were            d i r ected      by me      to escort ambul a n c e s and foot Officers

were    directed to             collect       relatives         together         for    i d e ntification

purposes at the g y m nasium and to direct                                persons       to the Force      coaches

being    used to transfer                 relatives          to the       receiving       hospitals.         I was

re-quested at this               point       by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t   Bates     to go mobile with my

serial and supervise                   the     crowd     in Herries Road.                Unfortunately,          we

had arri v e d        in a bus and            I had no         idea where my serial             was,    we were

all well       dis p e r s e d    by now.           In view of this,              at 5.30pm      (1730)      we were

given an order to                re-group         in the N orth Stand,                 a good decis i o n at

just    the    right      time.         We     re-grouped and sat down for a spell,

everyone was           dist r e s s e d      but we were all             willing        to keep going.

It is at this            point     that my direct                involvement with this              event

ceases.        I was a p p r o a c h e d          in the stand by Inspector Cooper with

instructions           from S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Bates           to gather together a team and

to go to B a r n s l e y M o r t u a r y to set up a body                        reception     facility.          I

called together a group of R a w m a r s h O f f icers                            present     in the stand,

they were a mixed                group but at             least     I knew most          of them.      The

s i t uation was         e x p lained        to sixteen Officers                 that we had another             grim

job and they were                given the option not                   to go,     they felt that         it was

better    to have an objective,                       and we all          went    to C l a y w h e e l s Lane

transport          garage       where after           brief      refreshments and obtaining

t ransport         I left a Sergeant and three Police Const a b l e s                              in the

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER:      CORRESPONDENCE FROM MR R EDEY

You  asked Mr Turney for advice on Mr Edey's          letter      of
20 September by close of play tonight. I attach a draft.

2.   You have already had a note from Mr Moriarty proposing a
reply to be sent to Mr Edey in response to his telephone
conversation with you.   I assume that letter has not been sent
and the attached draft is on similar lines.

3.   In my opinion we should not be too concerned about Mr Edey.
He appears to misunderstand the law.      The Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975 already places a duty on local authorities to
issue a safety certificate for a designated sports ground on
receipt of an application.   The Act does not give any specific
supervisory responsibility to the Home Secretary and regulations
under section 6(2) of the 1975 Act would not give the Secretary
of State the authority to oversee safety certificates.        As
Mr Moriarty1s note pointed out, there is no power under the 1975
Act for regulations made under it to change the provisions of
that Act.     (Section 15A provides limited powers to modify
provisions of the Act as respects any specified class of sports
ground, but this falls short of permitting the introduction of
what would be in effect a new provision.)

4.   I do not think that other matters in Mr Edey's letter
require a response.    Nobody was injured in the Preston incident
which merely revealed that the safety arrangements in the event
of fire were adequate.    The Sunday Times' survey was carried out
over a month ago.    We know that some clubs have had practical
difficulties with some of the recommendations and there are
possible legal difficulties over the agreements called for
between the police and football clubs which are currently being
addressed by the Police Department.     I do not think that you
should be called upon to respond to the other points in Mr Edey's
letter, which are largely expressions of opinion.

5.   As to the proposed application for judicial review, there is
little I can add to paragraph 6 of Mr Moriarty's note of
22 September.

Roy Edey Esq

Middlesex    NA1 3ER




Thank you for your letter of 25 September to the Home Secretary.


I    am    sorry    that      you    were     not     satisfied      with     my    letter   of
18 September.           You say that it is simply not good enough to place
the responsibility for safety of spectators at football grounds
on local authorities,               but I have to point out that that is how
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 is drafted.


The statutory power under section 6(2) of the 1975 Act does not
enable the Secretary of State to make regulations which would add
to    the provisions          of the     Act,       for   example     authorising      him to
oversee safety certificates.                   That is why,         as I have explained,
the   Government         is   seeking       appropriate powers          for    the    proposed
Football Licensing Authority in its Football Spectators Bill.


I should         like   to    assure    you    again      about   the   Home       Secretary's
concern over safety at football grounds and the importance that
he attaches to a proper response by local authorities and clubs
for       the    recommendations        contained         in   Lord     Justice       Taylor's
Interim Report.              That response is being carefully monitored and
in the light of it and of the final report of the Taylor inquiry,
consideration will be given to the need for any further action.


When you         spoke to me on the telephone you asked me                           about the
status      of    the proposed         Football      Licensing      Authority.         Present
proposals are that the FLA will be an independent
non-departmental public body.                   Appointments to the FLA will be
made by the Secretary of State for Environment                              in consultation
with the Home Secretary in respect of those appointments which
have a bearing on the authority's safety role.

            I find your letter of the 18th September in reply to mine of the
       24th August profoundly unsatisfactory. It is not good enough to place
       the responsibility for spectators at football grounds on local
       authorities.    Your Department has a duty to ensure that designated
       grounds have safety certificates.

            Lord Justice Taylor's report draws attention to the fact that
       Sheffield United had been operating for years without a safety
       certificate. The first paragraph of your letter makes it clear that you
       have still not bothered to ascertain whether or not clubs have valid
       safety certificates. Th^ interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor
       being put into effect can only be controlled and ensured through the
       safety certificate.   This is confirmed in your letter.    So also can
       compliance with the Green Guide.

            Grounds are still not safe as evidenced by an incident at Preston
       North End's ground five weeks after Hillsborough and at Coventry City's
       ground on the first day of this football season, i.e. the 19th August
       the date on which "The Times" published my letter accusing you of
       dereliction of dutyl I also enclose details of a survey carried out by
       the Sunday Times at the same time.

            It is clear beyond peradventure that a lead from the Government in
       the shape of yourself as Horae Secretary is absolutely vital. That lead
       must be by way of regulations by statutory instrument laying down
       minimum requirements for safety certificates to secure safety at
       football grounds pursuant to Section 6 of the Safety of Sports Grounds
       Act 1975.

            Mr. Justice Popplewell in his report on the Bradford fire said:
       "Had the Green Guide been complied with this tragedy would not have
       occurred." That is not necessarily the case as- regards the Hillsborough
       disaster because that tragedy exposes two glaring deficiencies in the
       Green Guide.   Mr. Justice Popplewell in his report recommended that
       safety certificates were issued on an annual basis and that before
       re-issue there was a duty on the local authority to inspect grounds.
       The Green Guide at Paragraph 36 merely provides for an inspection by
       club management which is of course not independent. Had the re-issue of
       the safety certificate depended on an inspection by the local authority
       at Hillsborough it is unlikely the disaster would have occurred.
     The other deficiency regards perimeter fencing where Lord Justice
Taylor at Paragraph 264 draws attention to inadequacies in this regard.
I am concerned that Lord Justice Taylor made an interim recorrmendation
that clubs should provide cutting equipment "to release numbers of
spectators if necessary." The report shows that in a crushing incident
irreversible brain damage is caused in four minutes, and if longer
without relief, death will ensue.   There would be no time to use the
cutting equipment.

     I have already said that local authorities should use the
Prohibition Notice procedure to close grounds or part of grounds which
they consider unsafe for use by spectators. Perimeter fencing is likely
to be so dangerous that no terraces should be used unless local
authorities are satisfied that immediate access to       the pitch is
available in an emergency as provided by Paragraph 215 of the Green
Guide.

     Unless you can assure me within the next seven days that you intend
to take immediate action to safeguard the safety of spectators at
football grounds by the introduction of regulations, I intend to seek
judicial   review    of your refusal to carry out your statutory
responsibilities laid upon you by Parliament.

     When   the river boat tragedy occurred Mr. Cecil Parkinson
immediately assumed responsibility to ensure so far as possible another
similar tragedy would not occur. He at once issued safety regulations
bearing the force of law.     There have been four football disasters
involving heavy loss of life and three of them have been due to
crushing. You have yet to try to ensure such a tragedy will not happen
again.

                       Yours sincerely,

intent, one from the police, one from the club.

uncertainty. There must be mutual clarity and
certainty - John is going to strengthen the
penultimate paragraph accordingly.

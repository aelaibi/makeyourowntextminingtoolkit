    1.       Further to my hand written note to the Director of today’s date, I have clarified with
             George Croston the queries I raised:

             •      7.4      George is satisfied that from the correspondence he has seen we could
                             reach our decision now without awaiting sight of the statement.

             •      8.18   Unless the Director is concerned about the medical evidence, there is
                           no need to hold things up by asking either Dr Slater or Professor
                           Usher to comment on what Dr Walker has now said, as any comments
                           they may make do not affect the "decision" we have to make on advice
                           to the police on a further police enquiry.

    2.       The necessary corrections to George Croston’s note are being made and a full pack
             including the annexes will be sent down today for onward transmission to the Law
             Officers under cover of a note from the Director.

    3.       The handling issue so far as any explanation to HFSG will need to be considered with
             the Law Officers and the Home Office. There are other alternatives to an explanation
             by the Police Policy Directorate:

             •      we could be involved in any meeting at official level ourselves;

             •      alternatively we could offer a meeting with the HFSG ourselves (or perhaps
                    jointly with the police) to explain openly the constitutional position of the
                     Director in this matter and the reasoning why it is not considered a further
                     police enquiry is justified. Clearly great care would need to be given to what
                     was said.

    4.       A meeting may, of course, be unnecessary if the Home Office decide to re-open the
             public enquiry into this matter.

                                             HILLSBOROUGH


        1       ISSUE

                 1.1    To consider the expanded report prepared by Mr. Croston following his
                        further review of material supplied by the Hillsborough Family Support Group
                        (HFSG) and their recent correspondence.

        2       ACTION REQUIRED

                 2.1    Response to the HSFG re allegations of criminal misconduct by the Police.

                 2.2    The above response to be co-ordinated with that of the LSLO and the Home
                        Office.

        3       TIMINGS

                 3.1    A preliminary indication of our views has been given to the Police Policy
                        Directorate at the Home Office in the latter part of last month, to the effect
                        that we had not found any new evidence as alleged by the HFSG.

                 3.2    The HSFG had been told that while a full response could not be given within
                         14 days, the matter was receiving our immediate consideration.

        4       BACKGROUND

                 4.1    For those unfamiliar with the Hillsborough disaster or requiring the refreshing
                        of their memory, the background note prepared for the Attorney General in
                        1990 is attached at Appendix 1. It sets out the facts of the incident together
                        with a precis of the CPS decision prior to the conclusion of the Coroner’s
                        Hearings.

                 4.2    The CPS Central Casework briefing note of the 29th January 1997 (author
                        Peter Pearson) gives the detail of events up to that day. See Appendix 2.

                 4.3    The latest correspondence relevant to this review is contained within the
                        report.

                 4.4    Peter Pearson’s briefing note of 3rd April 1997 (Appendix 3) is still relevant.

        5       KEY CONSIDERATIONS

                 5.1    There are 3 crucial questions that need to be considered.

                        5.1.1          Has any ‘new’ evidence come to light arising from the
                                       screening of the TV programme?

        MMS/247.97
07/05       '97   15:45     ©                             CPS 4th floor                                     @005




                          5.1.2         Does this evidence support the view that one or more police
                                        officers may have committed perjury at the Coroner’s Court?

                          5.1.3         Is there now sufficient doubt for the Attorney General to once
                                         more be asked to consider exercising his powers under Section
                                         13 of the Coroner’s Act 1988 to require a fresh inquest to be
                                         held or other form of enquiry.

        6         RECOMMENDATIONS

                  6.1     That Mr, Croston’s recommendation, namely that there are no grounds for
                          asking the police to re-open the investigation, be accepted.

                  6.2     That the CPS write to the HFSG informing them of our decision on the
                          criminal aspects.

                  6.3     That in accordance with earlier requests by Stephen Wooler at LSLO, the CPS
                          response should be co-ordinated with those of LSLO and Home Office.

                  6.4     That other than for a public relations exercise, no useful purpose would be
                          served by CPS representatives meeting the HFSG or their counsel.

                  6.5     Whilst it may be useful, having regard to continuing concerns for public
                          officials to meet the HFSG to explain the decision, since the Home Office
                          have already had at least one meeting with them it would be appropriate, in
                          order to avoid any possible risk of giving conflicting signals, for any further
                          meetings to take place under the auspices of the Home Office.

        7         CONCLUSIONS

                  7.1     There is no new evidence as alleged by the HFSG and their legal
                          representatives.

                  7.2     There are no grounds for re-opening the police investigation into the
                          Hillsborough Disaster.

                                 HILLSBOROUGH REVIEW



1        BACKGROUND

         1.1     In early December 1996, GranadaTV screened a drama-documentary
                  programme concerning the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. It has since been
                  said by the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG) in a letter of the 4th
                  March 1997 that the pre-production research for the programme and its
                  subsequent airing has brought to light fresh evidence and/or new witnesses
                  proving that suppression of evidence, perjury and conspiracy to pervert the
                  course of justice featured in the legal process that followed the disaster. In
                  addition letters have been received from the families of some of the deceased
                  requesting re-examination of the circumstances of the tragic events. As a
                  result of the above, internal correspondence has been generated between the
                  South Yorkshire Police, the Home Office, the Legal Secretariat to the Law
                  Officers (LSLO) and the CPS. A letter of 23/1/97 from Stephen Wooler of
                  the LSLO to Peter Pearson at Central Casework, York stated that at present
                  there was nothing in the television programme that materially affects the
                  applications (for consent to apply to a High Court Judge for an order directing
                  the hold of a fresh inquest) which the Attorney General had already
                  considered. In each of those cases it was concluded that there was not a
                  realistic prospect of the high Court granting such an order. In addition the
                  television programme itself was not evidence.

         1.2     On the 4th March 1997, Ms Anne Adlington, a solicitor representing the
                 HFSG wrote to the Director enclosing a bundle of documents and counsel’s
                 opinion. A fax was then received from Trevor Hicks, the chairman of the
                 HFSG, with his copy letter making allegations of the suppression of evidence
                 etc. as noted above. It was supported by a draft statement. Both this
                 statement and counsel’s opinion contained representations as to what should
                 happen now on the basis of the ‘new evidence’. A request was made for a
                 meeting with a senior CPS lawyer. The correspondence was acknowledged
                 by the Director’s office stating that a substantive reply would be provided
                 when the contents of the reports had been considered.

         1.3     The LSLO had considered it to be important that while each of the various
                 Government Departments must form their own judgement in relation to the
                 discharge of their own duties, it was equally important that there was a co­
                 herent and co-ordinated response to the representations made. Accordingly
                 on the 10th March 1997 a meeting was held at the Home Office with
                 representatives of their Police Policy Directorate (PPD), of the LSLO and of
                 CPS Central Casework. It was decided that each of the three groups should
                 report back to the PPD having conducted separate reviews of the allegations
                 made by Mr. Trevor Hicks and Alun Jones QC.

         1.4      On the 13th March 1997 the reviewing lawyer had a full days conference with

                 Chief Superintendent Lowe and D.C. Greenaway of South Yorkshire Police
                 at their offices in Sheffield. Original video tapes exhibited to the Taylor
                 enquiry and to the Coroner’s Hearing were viewed and access was made to
                 the transcripts of those hearings and to original witness statements.

         1.5     On the 1st April 1997 the Daily Mirror printed a report on Hillsborough. It
                 included a comment that the CPS had said "the nature and volume" of the new
                 evidence had forced it to re-open the enquiry into the crush that killed the 95
                 Liverpool fans. The nature of this report was indeed much of the earlier
                 correspondence from the HFSG being made public.

         1.6     On the same day South Yorkshire Police issued a statement in response to the
                 press report to the effect that there was no new evidence.

         1.7     On the 7th April, a letter from Miss Adlington drew CPS Central Casework
                 attention to points made in the police statement and the HFSG rebuttal of
                 them. A reply was made to the effect that a full response could not be given
                 within 14 days of the previous acknowledgement from the CPS, but the matter
                 was receiving immediate consideration.

2       NEW EVIDENCE

         2.1     The new evidence is said to be:-

                 2.1.1 A video tape of footage from the scoreboard camera, known as camera
                       5, of the Leppings Lane Terraces area where the deaths occurred.

                 2.1.2 An affidavit (dated 25th November 1996) and statement (dated 11th
                       May 1989) of a Roger Houldsworth, the engineer responsible for the
                       design and maintenance of the Club and Police CCTV systems
                       operation at Hillsborough Stadium. Exhibited to the affidavit are
                       comments on 13 points concerning the police evidence to the Taylor
                       enquiry and to the Coroner’s Inquest.

                 2.1.3 The statement of a Doctor Walker who volunteered his services at the
                       Northern General Hospital where many of the crush victims were
                       taken. He was involved in the resuscitation of the injured.

         2.2     This ‘new evidence’ would be considered in detail in parts 6 to 8 of this
                 report.

3        ALLEGATIONS

         These are divided into two parts, those concerning the video evidence and those of
         the medical evidence. They have been made by Trevor Hicks, Alun Jones QC and
         Roger Houldsworth and will be considered in that order.

         Video Evidence -

         Trevor Hicks says that:

         3.1     P.C .’s Ryan and Bichard perjured themselves in giving evidence of the
                 footage from camera 5 and the extent to which that camera could be used to
                 view the Leppings Lane terraces.

         3.2     The person who edited the inquest exhibit 021%, known as the ‘compilation
                 video’, must have been aware of the extensive footage from camera 5 but this
                 footage was not produced despite several requests from the Inquest Jury.

         3.3     Had the footage been produced and shown to the Jury it would have totally
                 changed their view of what the police could see.

         Alun Jones QC says that:-

         3.4     Video Tapes were deliberately suppressed and a number of officers committed
                 perjury.

         3.5     The evidence of Mr. Houldsworth was also deliberately suppressed.

         3.6     The HFSG have acquired from Yorkshire Television tapes which appear to be
                  those, or copies of those, taken away or stolen immediately after the disaster.

         3.7     A tape (containing footage from camera 5) indicates that police officers were
                 lying and that pictures of all relevant areas of the ground were clear, detailed
                 and uninterrupted, contrary to the police evidence referred to by Mr.
                 Houldsworth in his affidavit of November 1996. Events in the relevant area
                  (Leppings Lane Terraces) may not, for various reasons, have been recorded
                 on tape between 14.30 and 15.00 hours, but they were clearly visible on the
                 monitors to those on duty at the time.

         3.8     The Coroner had said that the assessment of the Terraces "may be the single
                  most important factor" or a "very important factor" which the Jury have to
                  weigh. The above evidence was not available in 1993 and yet it touched the
                  core issue before 15.15 hours, the cut off time. It would have been of crucial
                  significance to the High Court in 1993 as well as the Jury in 1991.

         Roger Houldsworth says that:

         3.9     At 0800 hrs. on the day of the disaster he had given all the cameras a final
                 check. There had been a problem with the score-board camera involving
                 flaring (picture white-out) due to an electrical fault when the score-board came
                 into use. There was no problem with the quality of the picture. By the time
                 he had finished his check, everything was working OK. P.C. Ryan came in
                 during this check and he would have shown both him and P.S. Goddard that
                 the cameras were working when he had finished. His 13 comments on the

MMS/246.97.V01
                                                 3
                 police evidence are as follows:-

                 3.9.1 P.C. Ryan (who was in charge of telephones and public address system
                       in the police control box) says in his evidence to the Taylor Enquiry
                       re camera 5 that there was an apparent fault with it, the picture was
                       very distorted and was never satisfactory as far as he could recall, it
                       was not as clear as you would hope the picture to be and it was the
                       quality of that picture which was the problem.

                 RH:    The quality of the picture was never a problem, the flaring was fixed
                        by disconnecting the earth during the morning.


                 3.9.2 PS Goddard (who was in charge of the radios in the police control
                       box) says in his evidence to the Taylor Enquiry that it was not possible
                       to tell from the control box that the pens three and four (the central
                       pens where the injuries occurred) were full and that at no stage before
                       he saw people climbing over the pens did he notice any over-crowding.

                 RH:    He was able to see what the police could see on their monitors and he
                        specifically remembers that when the order was given to open the gates
                        he could see pens three and four were full to the point of over­
                        crowding.


                 3.9.3 P.S. Goddard gave evidence of a blind spot down at the front of the
                       fencing whereby the first two rows of the Terrace were obstructed and
                       although you could see figures you would not be able to pick them out
                       individually.

                 RH:    Based on his knowledge of the control box the evidence did not make
                        any sense to him.


                 3.9.4 P.C. Bichard in his evidence to the Taylor Enquiry claimed, just like
                       P.C. Ryan, that there was a problem with the score-board camera
                       over-looking the Terraces (camera 5). He said that there had been
                       difficulty with that camera over a number of weeks; when the system
                       was switched on the picture would go white. It was thought to be a
                       problem with the electrical supply to the camera. On the day it was
                       not up to the mark but was a lot better than it had been. "We were
                       getting pictures, that is the best way of describing it." At the inquest
                       P.C. Bichard said that camera 5 had been faulty and you were getting
                       what was called flare, that is, a reflection of light and coloured objects
                       whereby the picture was lost. He went on to say that the camera was
                       not being used as much as it normally would be because of the sub­
                       standard picture. It was inadequate.

                 RH:    While P.C. Bichard gave an accurate description of what the problem
                        had been the engineer disagreed that the camera was not up to the
                        mark. As far as he was concerned the camera was working perfectly
                        after had had fixed it during the morning.


                 3.9.5 At the Inquest, P.C. Bichard gave his opinion that it was not possible
                       to get what he would call a "view" of the centre pens from any of the
                       cameras and agreed with a comment that it was not possible to zoom
                       in so that one could clearly identify a given individual and clearly see
                       facial features.

                 RH:    He considers that it is possible to pick out facial features with the
                        camera and says that this is borne out by the evidence of the families
                        and lawyers who went to the ground. He does agree that it would be
                        more difficult to pick oufe facial features while events are happening
                        but considers that this was not the specific question that     Bichard
                        was asked and responded to.

                 3.9.6 P.C. Bichard in evidence to the Taylor enquiry said that because of the
                       position and angle of camera 5 it gave a false impression about the
                       crowd that was there. The picture created was a bit of an illusion
                       about the crowd that was in there. The position was that it was
                       difficult to assess that the pens would be getting over-crowded.

                 RH:    He did not consider that the above explanation made any sense at all.
                        He considers that there was a perceptive depth which would give an
                        indication of density and disagreed that it was difficult to assess that
                        the pens were getting over-crowded from the view of camera 5.


                 3.9.7 Again in his evidence to the Taylor enquiry P.C. Bichard said that
                       whilst the colour camera (camera 2) provided a better angled view of
                       the terraces it did not provide a close up picture as camera 5. The
                       zoom facility of the colour camera was not good enough to see
                       whether or not people were being crushed against the perimeter
                       fencing in pens 3 and 4. While the view enabled you to see the fence
                       you could not get a close up of the people there, that is, at best 30 or
                       40 heads and shoulders. At the inquest the officer said that the zoom
                       magnification of the colour camera was insufficient to create
                       identification.

                 RH:    He considers that the magnification of the colour camera, which was
                        designed for identification purposes was reasonable. He says that the
                        evidence of P.C. Bichard was contradictory and not altogether truthful.
                        You could certainly identify individuals with it as well as
                        distinguishing their clothing. A shot could give you six or seven heads
                        and shoulders depending on the crowd density.

                 3.9.8 During the Taylor enquiry P.C. Bichard describes the camera looking
                       down on Leppings Lane (camera 1) by saying "when you are using
                       your zoom facility the picture you are getting at the extreme is a rather
                       large and general one".

                 RH:    The camera had been replaced 6 months earlier and was so good that
                        a car number plate could be picked out at the end of Leppings Lane.


                 3.9.9 At the Taylor enquiry P.C. Bichard admitted that there was a video of
                       the situation on the west terraces/ (Leppings Lane Terraces) from
                       about 14.30. The officer also claimed that of the two video recordings
                       that were made, one expired at just after 15.00. The mode of
                       operation of the other tape was altered inadvertently between 14.30
                       and 15.00 when the officer believed that his knee caught an operating
                       button changing the recording from continuous to time lapse (that is
                       two frames per second rather than the normal continuously moving
                       picture). At the inquest he said that he could offer no explanation of
                       why there was no video material available from camera 5 before
                       15.02. He admitted that it would have been recording before then.

                 RH:    He says that no pictures from camera 5 were ever made available to
                        the enquiry or to the Inquest. He considers that the buttons on the
                        video machines are so tiny that it is unlikely that the officer could have
                        knocked one with his knee and more importantly says that it is actually
                        i m possible to flick a switch and go into time lapse mode as P.C.
                        Bichard claims, when the machine is already recording.


                 3.9.10 Later during the Inquest P.C. Bichard says that the video pictures of
                        the Leppings Lane Terraces that were shown to the Jury were greatly
                        enhanced. He agreed with the Coroner that the image seen by the Jury
                        was infinitely clearer. He also said that the pictures which the court
                        had seen running on a time lapse system were not running at the same
                        speed as they would have been seen on the monitor.

                 RH:    He disagrees with P.C. Bichard’s evidence in that the information
                        obtained from watching the 14" monitors in the Police Control Room
                        was exactly the same as that seen on a larger screen in Court. He also
                        says that the pictures shown to the Court were taken from Camera 5,
                        the allegedly faulty camera, and showed the Leppings Lane Terraces.
                        He states that you will only get a time and date imprinting on the
                        recording if things are recorded at normal speed.


                 3.9.11 Also at the Inquest, P.C. Bichard says that camera 3 (a camera with
                        the maximum zoom facility) was not trained onto the Leppings Lane

MMS/246.97.V01
                                                6
                        Terraces because of an incident at the other end. The camera would
                        not have been good enough to enable identification of individuals at the
                        front of the Terraces as it would give an overall picture only.

                 RH: The camera was extremely powerful and it would have been able to
                     give a very clear picture of the Leppings Lane Terraces. The Officer
                     contradicts himself about which location this camera was focused
                     upon.


                 3.9.12 P.C. Bichard told the Jury that the reason the pictures from camera 3
                        when it was re-trained onto the Leppings Lane Terraces did not
                        become part of the recording was as follows "the system operated
                        where by 2.30 I should have replaced both tapes. Because of what
                        was happening on Leppings Lane I didn’t replace those tapes and
                        eventually it ran out after 3.00. The camera was used but it was not
                        taping".

                 RH:    He considers it very unusual for the police to have needed to have
                        replaced both tapes at 2.30. It would suggest that they had been
                        recording everything in real time since 11.30.


                 3.9.13 The evidence of Chief Inspector McRobbie (who was an observer in
                        the police control box) is that he was impressed by the zoom facilities
                        of camera 5. It was used to pick out someone directly beneath the
                        control box who had dropped his trousers. He says that the definition
                        was quite reasonable.

                 RH:    He says that this appears to be the same camera that P.C. Ryan
                        described as "never satisfactory". The Chief Inspector is directly
                        contradicting the evidence of his colleagues and goes on to say to the
                        Taylor enquiry that you could see quite clearly that Pen 3 was full but
                        that Pen 2 (one of the side pens) had got space.

         Medical Evidence

         3.10    Alun Jones QC says that in February 1997 the evidence of a Dr. Ed Walker
                 came to light. This new material discloses that Philip Hammond Junior had
                 sinus rhythm and cardiac output after his arrival at the hospital. The Doctor’s
                 evidence shows serious criticism of the reactions to the disaster and that other
                 victims were alive. It conflicts with the evidence of Dr. Slater. Dr. Walker
                 was not called at the Inquest.

         3.11    In his opinion, Alun Jones goes on to say "it is difficult to exaggerate the
                 significance of the concealment of Dr. Walker’s evidence. At page 10 of the
                 Divisional Court’s Judgement, November 1993, the Court pointed to the
                 Coroner’s reason for the 3.15 cut off. In all cases, it was said, the evidence

MMS/246.97.V01
                                                7
                 disclosed the same pattern, of a rapid unconsciousness leading to rapid death.
                 Dr. Walker expressly disagrees, especially with Dr. Slater. He states that a
                 revealing remark was made by a senior hospital physician who said that
                 almost immediately his department was flooded with large numbers of acutely
                 ill patients requiring urgent resuscitation. However the whole inquest,
                 spanning over 90 days, was structured by the Coroner on an utterly different
                 factual assumption.

         3.12    The reviewing lawyer considers that the above opinion is intimating, as with
                 the video evidence, the suppression of material facts which would have
                 affected the decisions made at the Taylor Enquiry, Coroner’s Hearings and
                 Judicial Review.

         3.13    In general Alun Jones considers that "one of the most striking aspects of this
                 history is the way in which the evidence presented to the Inquest was evidence
                 which tended to exculpate the South Yorkshire Authorities and the police from
                 blame. Very serious questions arise as to the process by which evidence was
                 selected by the West Midlands Police who assisted the Coroner".

4        HFSG REPRESENTATIONS

         4.1     The material provided to the CPS by the HFSG in support of their allegation
                 is composed of 8 volumes of papers and three video tapes. The index is
                 attached at Appendix 1. It is understood that a full copy of this material is
                 held at Ludgate Hill.

         4.2     The Crown Prosecution Service has been formally requested by Trevor
                 Hicks, Chairman of the HFSG, to examine the evidence and to initiate a full
                 and urgent criminal investigation into these matters. He states that all that has
                 ever been sought is a proper and even handed investigation into the events that
                 cost the lives of their loved ones. It is his belief that the footage from camera
                 5 between 12.00 and 15.23 hrs. has never been included in any police
                 compilation and/or other tapes that he had seen. In addition the footage
                 totally supported the position of Mr. Houldsworth.

         4.3     Alun Jones’ conclusions are that these new pieces of evidence called for a full
                 police enquiry or public enquiry, that exhibits such as the tapes must be
                 secured and subjected to Forensic Analysis by some independent body with
                 powers to investigate and compel the production of evidence, and that
                 witnesses must be identified.

         4.4     Following the South Yorkshire Police Statement of the 1st April 1997 in
                 response to the Daily Mirror report on Hillsborough, the HFSG issued their
                 own response on the 8th April. Full details of these rebuttals and counter­
                 rebuttals are contained within the relevant review section of this report.

5        JUDICIAL REVIEW

         5.1     The skeleton argument presented to the Divisional Court in the application for
                 Judicial Review to quash the Inquest Verdicts of Accidental Death was
                 concerned with the following main points

                 5.1.1 In deciding the statutory question ‘how’ the Coroner breached the
                       Coroner’s rules re the procedure to be followed in taking evidence.

                 5.1.2 Because the Coroner imposed a cut-off time of 15.15, evidence in the
                       possession of the Coroner and the police that four of the deceased were
                       alive for a considerable time after sustaining injuries in the crash, was
                       not adduced to the main inquest. There was a systematic failure by the
                       Coroner to address the statutory questions of ‘who’, ‘when’, ‘where’
                       and ‘how’. The Coroner had an apparent desire to establish rapid
                       death. The imposition of this cut-off point was to prevent any further
                       enquiry into the individual circumstances of the 95 deaths. Relevant
                       witnesses were not called to give their controversial evidence.

                 5.1.3 The Coroner was wrong to leave only the conclusions of unlawful
                       killing, accidental death or an open verdict to the jury. He mis­
                       directed the jury upon the elements of the offence of manslaughter.

         5.2     The Divisional Court’s judgement was given on the 5th November 1993. The
                 applicant’s abandonment of the point concerning the breach of the Coroner’s
                 rules was accepted by the Court. They found that the Coroner had cut off the
                 evidence at a reasonable and sustainable point bearing in mind the exhaustive
                 public enquiry which had already been conducted by Taylor L.J. It was also
                 a compassionate point from the aspect of the victim’s relatives. There was a
                 sensible cut off point based on the plain and virtually unchallenged evidence
                 of the pathologists as to when the deceased would have died. There was
                 overwhelming medical evidence that death occurred by 15.15. The court were
                 far from concluding that the Coroner wrongly exercised his discretion as to
                 whom he should call to give evidence.

         5.3     The Court’s conclusions were that the inquisition was correctly completed, the
                 Coroner’s direction to the Jury was impeccable, and there was no good reason
                 for ordering a new inquest. In fact the court queried the purpose of a fresh
                 inquest. Criticism of the police had been firmly levelled by the Taylor Report
                 and the police had admitted fault and paid compensation. It was doubted that
                 more would be learned from the further examination of the last minutes of the
                 lives of the deceased. It was accepted that the families were pursuing the
                 matter because of their deep instinct to know the circumstances in which their
                 relatives died but the objective view and considering the interest of all
                 involved was that this was not a case for ordering fresh inquests.

         5.4     The Court stated that the essential complaint made against the Coroner was
                 that having introduced evidence from the various pathologists into the causes

MMS/246.97.V01
                                                9
r


                     and probable time-scale of the deaths, he proceeded to limit or exclude
                     evidence from the main inquest which might have lead the Jury to form a
                     different conclusion. In fact the Coroner lead further evidence that might
                     have persuaded pathologists to form different conclusions than those
                     previously expressed, as well as exploring in the presence of the Jury an
                     alternative factual basis for the pathologists’ conclusions.

             5.5     It was said that there was clear evidence that bodily functions may continue
                     and give a semblance of life when the prior occurrence of brain death renders
                     the existence of life unlikely, if not impossible. The overwhelming burden of
                     evidence was that there was no prolongation of life beyond the period of about
                     10 minutes from the occurrence of the injury which lead to asphyxia.

    6        REVIEW OF ALLEGATIONS: VIDEO EVIDENCE

             6.1     The allegations and comments made by Trevor Hicks, Alun Jones QC and
                     Roger Houldsworth are overlapping, but the only ‘new’ evidence comes from
                     the last named. The others take inferences from and make representations
                     about that particular evidence as well as evidence already heard at either the
                     Taylor Enquiry or the Coroner’s Hearing. In essence they are saying that
                     because the Jury or the Divisional Court did not have the benefit of Mr.
                     Houldsworth’s evidence nor of hearing argument on the proper inferences to
                     be made based on that evidence, there should be a full investigation leading
                     to a re-opening of the inquests or enquiry. They are also saying that the ‘new
                     evidence’ supports the allegation of the suppression of video evidence by the
                     police.

             6.2     On the 13th March 1997 I held a full day’s conference with Chief
                     Superintendent Lowe of South Yorkshire Police at his Sheffield office. I was
                     able to view original video tapes exhibited to the Taylor Enquiry and also
                     those shown at the Coroner’s Hearing. I had access to the transcripts of those
                     hearings and original witness statements which had not been exhibited but
                     were unused material. This report is concerned with 4 video tapes; TB/1 and
                     TB/2 which were exhibited to the Taylor Enquiry, the Coroner’s Exhibit C539
                     and the video recording that was generally known as the ‘compilation tape’.
                     TB/1 and TB/2 were the original tapes taken from the two police video
                     recorders in their control room above the Leppings Lane Terraces. There
                     were 5 television screens showing views from the 5 roving cameras fixed at
                     high points on the stands and directed both inside and outside the ground.
                     There was also a master screen which flicked in rotation from one camera
                     view to another and which made one of the two video recordings. A further
                     screen was connected to the second video recorder which could be switched
                     between the five main cameras as required by the operator. P.C. Bichard was
                     tasked with the operation of the video recorders as directed by his superior
                     officers. The tapes could record in two ways, that of continuous movement
                     or normal play, and of time-lapse where a different still frame was shown
                     every half second. This latter procedure gave a rather jerky sequence of
                     pictures but allowed for the longer use of any particular tape.

    MMS/246.97.V01
                                                   10
         6.3     At the end of the day the video tapes from the two recorders were secured and
                 eventually featured as evidence obtained during the police investigation of the
                 disaster.

         6.4     The Exhibit List produced for the Taylor Enquiry has document number 109
                 described as containing recordings from 5 separate locations at regular
                 intervals and that the material is of relevance. A copy of 109 shows it to be
                 a VHS video tape reference TB/1. TB being the initials of P.C. Bichard, the
                 video operator. Document 110 is described as a two part film of various
                 locations also containing relevant material. A copy of 110 shows it to be two
                 VHS video tapes reference TB/2 parts 1 and 2.

         6.5     TB/1 and 2 are described in detail in the video schedule prepared for the
                  Taylor Enquiry. TB/1 switches between the various police cameras at
                  intervals of 1 minute between the times 13.02 and 14.02. However there are
                 no views from camera 5 overlooking Leppings Lane Terraces. The video
                  recording TB/1 then appears to be under manual operation and only shows the
                  camera 5 viewpoint for a total of approximately 5 minutes between the times
                  14.59 to 15.04.

         6.6     TB/2 is switching between four of the police cameras, including camera 5, at
                 approximately 20 second intervals. It starts at 11.59 and ends just before
                 15.35. A new schedule prepared for me by the West Yorkshire Police
                 showed that the views from camera 5 featurgpn^l occasions up until 15.00.
                 The final part of this tape from 15.03 until/is tfte camera 5 view of the fence
                 behind the goal area where fans can be seen climbing over onto the pitch,
                 followed by some footage from a camera across the pitch.

         6.7     I am informed by Dr. Stefan Popper, the Coroner for theHillsborough
                  Inquests, that all the exhibits prepared for the Taylor Enquiry were made
                  available to the legal representatives at the Inquest. The police say that
                  material required for each day was placed in a side room to the hearings. The
                  rest of the Unused Material, including Taylor Enquiry documents were kept
                  at a local police station (Nechells Green), where access was given to any
                  legal representatives that required it. Much of this material was unused at the
                  Inquest including Exhibits TB/1 and 2. A ‘compilation’ (Taylor Enquiry
                  Document 142) was edited from the footage made available by the police, club
                  and media. That particular video included little of TB/1 and 2 as much more
                  striking coverage of events was obtained from the other sources. None of the
                  TB/2 footage from camera 5 after 15.04 was shown on it. This compilation
                  was also seen by the Jury (Inquest Reference C278).

         6.8     During the hearing on the 13th March 1991, the Coroner said that the Jury
                 had twice asked about the video evidence of the Terraces. He stated that the
                 videos had been looked at and there was actually next to nothing on them
                 because not everything was recorded; there was a tiny bit on the compilation
                 tape, with another little bit which started at 15.03 and went on for a few
                 minutes. He said that it had been clipped and will be shown to the Jury but

MMS/246.97.V01
                                                11
                 was of poor quality and he did not think it would help very much.

         6.9     On the 15th March, Exhibit C539 was shown to the Jury. It was produced by
                 a P.S. Killoch who said that he had taken a short sequence from one of the
                 South Yorkshire Police videos showing scenes of the Leppings Lane pens, that
                 is, the West Stand. The sequence, most of which was in time-lapse, began
                 at 15.02. After the video was shown to the hearing, it was identified as being
                 C539 and P.S. Killoch stated that the original identification was TB/1, being
                 the West Midlands Police reference. No comment was made by any person
                 as to the quality of this specific footage.

         Reviewing Lawyers Comments

         6.10    The original police video tapes exhibited to the Taylor Enquiry as TB/1 and
                 TB/2 are still in existence and are in the hands of the West Yorkshire Police.
                 Two original master copies of C539, that were taken from the master copy of
                 TB/2, are also with the West Yorkshire Police. One of these was produced
                 by P.S. Killoch to the Coroner’s Hearing and was shown to the Jury. My
                 assessment of this particular footage is that whilst it is reasonably clear, the
                 position and angle of the view from the camera makes any assessment of
                 overcrowding in the centre pens to be difficult if not impossible. If the
                 camera had been panned or its angle of view increased then more might have
                 been seen in those crucial minutes after 15.03.

         6.11    As TB/1 and 2 were available to the Taylor Enquiry, it cannot be said that
                 they were suppressed. All of the enquiry exhibits were known to legal teams
                 involved at the Inquest. I have seen copies of correspondence between the
                 police and other organisations (Hillsborough Steering Committee and Borough
                 of Sefton) concerning video footage. This shows that access was granted at
                 Nechells Green Police station during May to August 1989 to the interested
                 parties (including Mr. Trevor Hicks) to view video evidence in police hands.
                 A police incident room message (see Appendix ) dated 24/5/89 is a note of
                 a telephone conversation between an Inspector Layton and a D.C.I. Tope to
                 the effect that solicitors acting for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club had
                 been given permission to view video footage referred to as TB2/A/Part 4.
                 This is the footage of the Leppings Lane Terraces between 15.03 and 15.25
                 and the evidence alleged to have been suppressed. I am also satisfied that this
                 particular recording was therefore available for the purpose of the Inquest.I
                 am satisfied that while TB/1 and 2 were not themselves shown to the Jury, the
                 ‘compilation ’ and C539 videos were.

         6.12    C539 covers most of the camera 5 footage between 15.03 and 15.25 and was
                 shown to the Jury during the evidence of P.S. Killoch. A copy of the relevant
                 part of the inquest transcript is attached (Appendix ). However it can be
                 seen that the officer makes a mistake when he describes the exhibit as having
                 the original identification of TB/1. My viewing confirms that the material
                 contained within C539 comes from Exhibit TB/2 and agrees with the relevant
                 schedule (Appendix ).

         6.13    The HFSG have provided a copy tape to the CPS which is said to be the one
                 shown to the Inquest Jury. It is in fact what appears to be a re-recording of
                 C539 that is of poor quality as accepted by Alun Jones QC in his opinion. I
                 am satisfied that the Jury saw the best copy available, that is, one of the two
                 original tapes taken from the master TB/2. This particular tape was referred
                 to by the Coroner as follows (transcript of 13th March 1990):-

                 "I do not think it is worth starting before lunch, but there is just one thing
                 which the Jury have mentioned to me. In fact they have mentioned it twice,
                 and that is what about the video evidence at the terraces. I have the videos
                 looked at and there is actually next to nothing on the videos because of
                 course, not everything was recorded. That does not mean to say they were
                 not possibly scenes but there is, I understand, a little tiny bit which is actually
                 in the compilation which you have seen. There is another little bit which
                 starts at 15.03 and goes on for a few minutes. What we have done is that we
                 have clipped it, if that is the right word, and we will show it to you, but it is
                 a very poor quality and I do not think it is going to help us very much. As
                 far as I can tell there isn’t much recorded. Does that help?"

         6.14    On the 15th March, prior to the C539 footage being shown to the Jury, the
                 Coroner said:-

                 "We are going to press on today, but what I want to do is you will remember
                 you were asking about the video, and I think we will show this video now of
                 the scene as far as we have got it at Leppings Lane. In fact, it was, of
                 course, taken by Mr. Bichard so it is a convenient time to actually look at it,
                 but I am going to get Mr. Killoch who has actually selected the piece out that
                 we need to describe it."

         6.15    The relevant parts of the transcript are exhibited at Appendix       .

         6.16    I have ascertained that the Coroner had authorised the recording by video tape
                 of all the main inquest proceedings. There are 186 tapes in all. The cameras
                 view point (from a higher level gallery) shows the Coroner, Jury, witness
                 stand and lawyers benches as well as the bottom part of the large video
                 screen. From the relevant tape I can confirm that C539 was shown in its
                 entirety and at one stage early in the viewing the Coroner remarks "I think we
                 can recognise him", presumably with reference to some un-named person on
                 the terraces. This remark is not noted in the transcript.

         6.17    The points I note from the above are that:

                 •        C539 was a 13 minute excerpt of camera 5’s view of the Leppings
                         Lane pens and was shown to the Inquest Jury. C539 was taken from
                         police video TB/2 (not TB/1 as stated by P.S. Killoch).

                 •       P.C. Bichard and other officers gave evidence of their perception that
                         monitor pictures from camera 5 were not of good quality, and that

MMS/246.97.V01
                                                 13
                       they therefore disregarded them, especially as their attention prior to
                       15.03 was focused on the obvious danger area at the entrance gates.

                 •     The Coroner told the Jury that having had the videos (presumably
                       TB/1 and TB/2) looked at, a little bit starting at 15.03 and going on
                       for a few minutes (to 15.25) had been clipped and it would be shown
                       to them. He said that this tape was of very poor quality and would not
                       help very much.

                 •     The ‘new evidence’ from Mr. Houldsworth is that from his perception
                       the tape was of good quality and overcrowding in the pens could be
                       clearly seen. He therefore strongly disagrees with the police evidence
                       concerning the use of camera 5.

         6.18 On the 1st April 1997, South Yorkshire Police released a press statement
              following a report in that mornings Daily Mirror paper. They stated that the
              tape from a CCTV camera showing the terraces had never been missing and
              was made available to both the Taylor Enquiry and the Inquest. The
              confusion over missing tapes seemed to arise from the fact that two tapes
              recorded at the ground on the Club’s own CCTV system had gone missing
              from a locked room. Neither tape was relevant to the enquiry.

         6.19 The HFSG response of the 7th April to us was that footage from camera 5 did
               go missing and therefore could not be shown to the Inquest Jury. They said
               that P.C. Bichard in his evidence confirmed that shots from camera 5 had
               been recorded prior to 15.02 and he could not explain why relevant footage
               could not be found. The HFSG also showed concern as to their understanding
               that South Yorkshire Police were in a position to ‘select’ evidence for
               admission to either the Taylor Enquiry or the Inquest, rather than the West
               Midlands police who were the investigators. They make the point that the
               South Yorkshire Police have changed tack in accepting that camera 5 was
               indeed in working order, but that this is contrary to the evidence of P.C.s
               Bichard and Ryan and P.S. Goddard who all disparaged the capability of that
               camera. The camera could pan, tilt and zoom and produce pictures of
               sufficient quality and detail to identify facial features. They considered the
               police are now alleging that it was the quality of the transmission via the
               monitors rather than the camera which was the problem. As regards the
               stolen tapes, while the HFSG accept that they showed nothing of probative
               value, the fact is that they were taken from a locked cupboard in an alarmed
               and locked room with a massive police presence at the ground over-night.
               The security could not have been breached by a stranger. The South
               Yorkshire Police cannot dismiss the matter so lightly as clearly the thief
               thought he/she was stealing something of value. We are then asked to take
               these comments into account before coming to a decision.

7        REPORT: VIDEO EVIDENCE

         Allegations made by Trevor Hicks: -

         7.1     (Refer to 3.1) It cannot be proved to the required standard that P.C.s Bichard
                 and Ryan gave false evidence. Their perception of the camera 5 footage was
                 based on the monitor picture within the police control room not on a viewing
                 of any video recording. They consider that as the pictures were of poor
                 quality they would therefore disregard them. P.C. Bichard stated in his
                 evidence to the Inquest that the pictures on the large screen there were clearer
                 than on the control room monitor. This would support the proposition that
                 regardless of any previous fault on the camera there was a lack of picture
                 quality due to a monitor problem. Even so the Coroner considered that C539
                 was not of good quality (as opposed to Mr. Houldsworth’s different perception
                 of the quality). The tape was shown to the Jury and they, having also heard
                 the evidence of the police officers were able to make up their own minds as
                 to what the police in the control room could see of the events unfolding both
                 at the turnstile and gates, and on the terraces. Mr. Houldsworth’s evidence
                 in 1996 is that he could clearly see on the Club CCTV monitor that the pens
                 were full to over-crowding when the gate was opened leading to the fatal
                 crushing. His evidence from 1989 is not so precise, only that a dangerous
                 situation was developing. Here he says that it was not for two to three
                 minutes after going down onto the pitch and viewing the pens that he realised
                 the true situation and that there was not a pitch invasion. His later evidence
                 is therefore at variance with his early perceptions and may well have been
                 contaminated by subsequent events.

                 Findings: Any accusations of perjury or perverting the course of justice
                 based on a witness perception differing from that of the police officers, and
                 already considered by the Jury will not pass the evidential test.

         7.2     (Refer to 3.2). I accept that the editor of the ‘compilation video’ had access
                 to TB/1 and 2 as well as to all the many other tapes available. The Coroner
                 also accepts that C539 was a clipped part of another tape (TB/2). He said that
                 the Jury had twice mentioned video evidence of the terraces. Because of that
                 he had had the videos looked at and C539 was then prepared. It was of poor
                 quality and he did not think it would help very much.

                 Findings: The Jury’s request for footage of the terraces was actioned by the
                 Coroner in what he obviously considered to be a satisfactory way. The
                 appropriate inference must be that TB/1 and 2 were looked at and that the
                 footage from Camera 5 prior to 14.30 was not considered to be of sufficient
                 relevance. There was no footage from that camera between 14.24 and 14.58,
                 the crucial time period where over-crowding began to occur. C 539 tape was
                 an edited version of TB/2 showing the pens between 15.03 and 15.16.

         7.3     (Refer to 3.3) The Jury viewed some of the relevant Camera 5 footage
                 between 15.03 and 15.16 and they came to their verdicts having considered

MMS/246.97.V01
                                                15
                 all the evidence put before them.


                 Findings: That the Jury did not see the last 9Vz minutes of the camera 5
                 footage on TB/2 would not, in my opinion, have affected their overall
                 judgement and the decisions that they came to.

                 Allegations made by Alun Jones QC:-

         7.4     (Refer to 3.4) I have obtained copies of the Exhibit List to the Taylor
                 Enquiry showing that TB/1 and 2 were properly exhibited together with a
                 schedule breaking down the footage into details of camera locations, timings,
                 and a description of the scene shown. These tapes were available to the legal
                 representatives of the HFSG. Part of them was contained within the
                 ‘compilation video’. South Yorkshire Police have reported to me that all the
                 Taylor Enquiry material was available for the Inquest Hearings. A room in
                 the Inquest Building was set aside for original documents and all those exhibits
                 needed on a day to day basis. The remainder of the Exhibit material was kept
                 at the local police station and made available to the Coroner, lawyers and
                 HSFG for viewing. I am awaiting a statement from a senior officer concerned
                 with those arrangements to confirm the police report. However the previously
                 mentioned correspondence (para 6 .10) corroborates that report. The Coroner,
                 Dr. Popper, has also confirmed to me that all Taylor Enquiry material was
                 available.

                 Findings: I consider that there is no evidence to show that video tapes were
                 ever suppressed by the police or others. Counsel for the HFSG is obviously
                 confused as to which tapes went missing or were stolen. The two tapes that
                 were taken from the Club CCTV room were never recovered, but the police
                 video tapes have never been missing. I see no merit in the HFSG intimation
                 that the police are in some way responsible for the theft of the two club tapes.
                 There is no evidence that this theft is of any relevance to the present review.

         7.5      (Refer to 3.5). Mr. Houldsworth has provided a copy of his statement made
                 on the 16th May 1989. He says how he re-designed and improved the
                 ground’s CCTV system, both for Club and Police use. He describes the 20
                 Club and 7 police monitors, 2 of the last being connected to video recorders.
                 He rectified a fault on one of the police cameras by re-adjusting the iris
                 controls. By 14.45 on the day he was able to see the build up of supporters
                 outside the turnstiles but while some stands were full the West Stand
                 (Leppings Lane Terraces) was only two thirds full. He commented to others
                 in the Club CCTV box that the kick off should be delayed to enable people
                 to get into the ground. Some time later he heard a radio request from a senior
                 police officer that a gate be opened in order to prevent deaths. A gate was
                 opened and a huge number of fans flooded the area. From the numbers
                 displayed on a monitor he realised that a dangerous situation was being
                 created. He went down to the pitch as the referee stopped the match. He saw
                 fans climbing over the West Stand fence and thought that there was a pitch
MMS/246.97.V01
                                                16
                 invasion. It was only after he watched for 2 to 3 minutes that he realised
                 what was really occurring. Later that afternoon he ejected the VCR tapes in
                 the club CCTV room (leaving them in the machines in the eject position) and
                 later locked the VCR cupboard and set the room’s alarm system. However
                 he did not specifically recall if all the tapes were still with each machine at
                 that time. He then asked a security guard (not police) to ensure that no one
                 entered the CCTV room. The next morning the room was still locked with
                 the alarm operative. He discovered that two tapes were missing, one from a
                 camera overlooking gates 9 to 16 and the other from an inactive VCR.

                 Findings: Mr. Houldsworth’s evidence concerns background material of the
                 CCTV workings and of a brief view of his perceptions. Other witnesses gave
                 similar evidence. The West Midlands Police Hillsborough Enquiry Master
                 Index shows that his statement was included within the investigation and was
                 therefore presented to the Taylor Enquiry. That he was not called to give live
                 evidence does not surprise me. I find no evidence of the deliberate
                 suppression of his statement.

         7.6     (Refer to 3.6) The HFSG tapes are copies of those provided by the police to
                 Yorkshire Television at their request.

                 Findings: There is no evidence that the tapes TB/1 and 2 were ever involved
                 in a theft or had been improperly taken away.

         7.7      (Refer to 3.7) It would be well nigh impossible to prosecute a case involving
                 allegations of police lying (and therefore the perverting of the course of
                 justice) based on the different perception of one witness (Mr Houldsworth)
                 who did not view the actual police monitor showing the Leppings Lane
                 Terraces at the relevant times.

                 Findings: There is insufficient evidence to support the allegation.

         7.8     (Refer to 3.8) The TB/2 tapes were available in 1991 and 1993.

                 Findings: The tapes do not have the significance attributed to them by Mr.
                 Hicks.

         Allegations made by Roger Houldsworth:-

         7.9     (Refer to 3.9.1 to 13) Most of his comments have been addressed in the
                 previous paragraphs where Trevor Hicks and Alun Jones QC tender their
                 version of the inferences to be taken from his ‘new evidence’. Roger
                 Houldsworth considers that as Camera 5 was working properly and the
                 evidence of police officers, is, as he has put it, "not altogether truthful". He
                 identifies contradictions in the evidence of P.C. Bichard and generally
                 denigrates the perceptions of the police officers as to the capabilities of the
                 camera. The thrust of these comments as picked out by Mr. Hicks and Alun
                 Jones QC must be that these perceptions (and also the alleged loss of tapes)
MMS/246.97.V01
                                                17
                 are told as deliberate lies in order to cover up the gross negligence of the
                 police in the control room in not noticing the crush in the pens at an earlier
                 stage.

         7.10    Particular comment is made by him (at paragraph 3.9.9) that P.C. Bichard
                 was asked why there was no video material for Camera 5 before 15.02, and
                 that the officer could offer no explanation although he said that there would
                 have been a recording. As P.C. Bichard was not involved in exhibit
                 production I accept that he could not have had any explanation as to
                 unsupported allegations, re matters not under his control or within his
                 knowledge.

         7.11    Mr Houldsworth goes on (paragraph 3.9.10) that there is only a time and date
                 imprinting on a recording if it is made at the normal speed. He is thus stating
                 that with a time-lapse mode there is no such imprint. This expert opinion of
                 his is patently false as the time-lapse recording between 15.03 and 15.25
                 clearly shows the time and date imprint.

         7.12    He says (at paragraph 3.9.13) that a Chief Inspector’s evidence contradicts
                 that of P.C. Ryan as to how satisfactory Camera 5 was. However the Chief
                 Inspector’s view from the Camera was a close up from a very short distance
                 while Camera 5 was focused at the far end of the pens between 15.03 and
                 15.25. As Mr. Houldsworth admits (see para 3.9.5) it would be difficult to
                 pick out facial features while events are happening.

                 Findings: Mr. Houldsworth’s evidence and comments are generally a matter
                 of his perception versus that of the police officers. I do not consider that it
                 any way comes close to the sufficiency required for obtaining a realistic
                 prospect of conviction on the criminal allegations. The police have fully
                 admitted civil liability and an extension of their negligence into the realms of
                 criminal misconduct by way of an alleged cover up operation is not tenable
                 on the evidence available.

      8        REVIEW OF MEDICAL EVIDENCE

               8 .1    While any application by the HFSG for a re-opening of the Inquest based on
                       new medical evidence is within the province of the Home Office, Alun Jones
                       QC does allege at paragraph 11 of his opinion that Dr. Walker’s evidence was
                       concealed. In which case there must be consideration of that evidence going
                       towards the offence of Perverting the Course of Justice. The HFSG
                       intimation must be of a Conspiracy to Pervert the Court of Justice by the two
                       police forces involved, the West Midlands and South Yorkshire Police, and
                       also by the Coroner if it can be shown that he knew of the evidence of Dr.
                       Walker.

               8.2     Dr. Walker’s evidence: The HFSG have produced in their Annex F the
                       following documents: -

                       8.2.1 Dr. Walker’s none Criminal Justice Act and undated statements re the
                             events at Hillsborough.

                       8.2.2 A letter of the 3rd May 1989 from a Hospital Consultant (Mr.
                             Wardrope) describing how Dr. Walker (a Senior House Officer in
                             Anaesthetics) as instrumental in bringing speedy treatments and
                             resuscitation to patients on the 15th April 1989.

                       8.2.3 A standard form letter of the 15th June 1989 from the same consultant
                             to (presumably) Dr. Walker warning him that he may be asked to give
                             a statement to the police for the benefit of the Coroner.

                       8.2.4 A letter of the 3rd May 1989 thanking Dr. Walker for his report and
                             the work he did.

                       8.2.5 A letter of the 8th February 1997 from Dr. Walker to that consultant
                             stating that Mr. Philip Hammond (junior) was the first victim that he
                             attempted to resuscitate. He asks why he was not contacted by the
                             police to provide an official statement or to appear at the inquest. He
                             confirms his statement made to the consultant in that Philip Hammond
                             had sinus rhythm and cardiac output which was obviously at odds with
                             Dr. Slater’s evidence.

                       8.2.6 Dr. Walker’s letter of the 30th February 1997 to the BMJ asking for
                             contact to be made with other Doctors who were involved in the day
                             but not asked to provide statements.

               8.3     The question for consideration is whether or not the alleged omission in not
                       taking his statement was done with criminal intent so as to suppress his
                       evidence because, for example, it would have embarrassed the police or lead
                       to a different verdict from the Jury.

               8.4     The Judicial Review of the Medical Evidence found that the pathologists who

                      were Drs. Gumpert, Dr. Slater and Professor Usher were as one in that once
                      a victim’s chest was fixed (when crushing occurs) then irrecoverable brain
                      damage will ensue in 4 to 6 minutes. The courts conclusions have been noted
                      above.

             8.5      Dr. Walker’s statement begins with his description of how he came to
                      volunteer his services to the Northern General Hospital when he hears of
                      problems at Hillsborough Stadium. On arrival at the Hospital he went to the
                      Casualty Department to be told that a paediatric cardiac arrest was coming in.
                      The first child received was in cardio-respiratory standstill and he with others
                      instigated routine cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. There was evidence of gross
                      inhalation of stomach contents and as far as he could recall sinus rhythm and
                      cardiac output was established, although the boy’s pupils were fixed and
                      dilated. He believed that the boy had since died. A second child arrived in
                      cardio-pulmonary arrest during resuscitation of the first patient. Similar
                      measures were carried out and this child was also brought back into sinus
                      rhythm with a good output though he again had fixed dilated pupils throughout
                      and has since died. Dr. Walker then continues in the statement with details
                      of other victims that he dealt with and that are not relevant for the purposes
                      of this review. The statement does not give patient names.

                      Findings:

             8.6      I do not consider that Dr. Walker’s observations as made in his personal
                      statement of 1989 and the letters of 1987 comprise such vital new evidence as
                      to show that the life of Philip Hammond continued after the cut off period of
                      15.15.

             8.7      Dr. Walker contends that he was not asked to make a statement by the police
                      (whether it be the West Midlands or West Yorkshire (sic) police as he states
                      in two different letters). However the police file which I have seen contains
                      Dr. Walker’s original manuscript statement of the 20th July 1989 as obtained
                      by the West Midlands Police Force. Each page is signed by him and
                      witnessed by two other persons. It is somewhat different to his undated
                      personal statement which is said to have been made in 1989. In the police
                      statement he says that he attended to the first casualty to arrive, a boy he
                      knows only as ‘Lee’ and who he believed was declared brain dead in the
                      Intensive Care Unit two days later. This patient was in cardio-pulmonary
                      arrest with fixed dialated pupils. The heart had stopped beating but the
                      medical team managed to re-establish normal rhythm. While the boy was
                      being treated the second victim arrived also in cardio-pulmonary arrest. This
                      boy was also established in a normal sinus heart rhythm but again the pupils
                      were fixed and dialated through and it is believed that the boy has since died.
                      The description given by Dr. Walker of the second boy fits that of the victim
                      Philip Hammond.

              8.8     The Doctor’s evidence concerning these first two victims shows that both
                      arrived without signs of life apparent. Although a normal heart rhythm was
     MMS/246.97.V01
                                                     20
07/05 '97   17:03       Q                            CPS 4th floor                                     1^1004




                      established it could not be sustained and the two boys eventually died. I
                      understand that Lee’s bodily functions were maintained for two days as he was
                      to be an organ donor.

             8.9      However, the doctor’s letter of 8th February 1997 to Mr. Wardrope says that
                      Philip Hammond was the first victim that he attempted to resuscitate. That
                      recollection is presumably based on the undated 1989 personal statement.
                      Here he describes the establishment of sinus rhythm and cardiac output in the
                      first two victims he treated (no names are given) and that both had fixed and
                      dialated pupils throughout and subsequently were believed to have died.

             8.10     A police action message dated 2nd April 1990 shows that an officer was
                      directed to contact Dr. Walker and warn him that he may be required to
                      attend the Inquest. The Doctor’s contact telephone number was to be
                      obtained. There is a manuscript note of a telephone number on this message.
                      The result of the above action is noted that the doctor was not required.

             8.11     The statement of Mr. James Wardrope (a consultant in Accident and
                      Emergency Medicine at the Northern General Hospital) dated 6th June 1989
                      gives details of the various Hillsborough Patients as contained within the
                      medical records in his possession and the post mortem evidence provided by
                      the Coroner. The paragraph concerning Philip Hammond is as follows

                      "There is no definite documentary evidence in the medical notes that Mr.
                      Hammond received resuscitation, but the post mortem states that there were
                      three ECG electrodes attached to his chest. I would interpret this as being
                      probable he did enter the resuscitation room of the Northern General Hospital,
                      but a cardiac tracing showed no cardiac activity and in view of the large
                      number of patients present at the time, resuscitation attempts were not taken
                      any further.

             8.12     His comments concerning a Lee Nichol are as follows:-

                      "This young boy was brought in as a cardiac-arrest. Resuscitation resulted in
                      return of normal cardiac output, but he did not breathe on his own. He was
                      therefore transferred to the General Intensive Care Unit and I believe he died
                      on the Intensive Care Unit three days later.

              8.13 Later in the statement Mr. Wardrope says that no patient admitted in the state
                   of cardiac arrest had survived.

              8.14 In his evidence to the Coroner’s Hearing, this consultant confirmed that there
                    was no documentary evidence as to what had happened with Philip Hammond
                    apart from the post-mortem report concerning the electrode marks. He was
                    asked to give his best guess as to how that may have happened and replied:-

                      "In the initial part of the incident I was sending people who came in with a
                      cardiac arrest, patients undergoing mouth to mouth resuscitation and external
     MMS/246.97.V01
                                                    21
07/05 '97   17:04       Q                             CPS 4th floor                                       1^005




                      cardiac massage, I sent to the resuscitation room initially to see whether they
                      could have a chance of being brought round to start the heart going. The fact
                      that the only post-mortem evidence were three ECG electrodes, I think
                      possibly he was sent to the resuscitation room but the ECG showed no cardiac
                      activity, and because of the great pressure on the resuscitation beds at that
                      time he would be sent to the mortuary."

             8.15     A P.C. Taylor who was at the football ground gave evidence that he
                      approached a youth who was identified as Philip Hammond who was laid on
                      the ground and appeared to be unconscious. He took the boy to an ambulance
                      and attempted to revive him with the assistance of others. Heart massage was
                      performed and they were able to re-start the heart and feel a pulse. However
                      it is said by the officer that later at the hospital, the doctor could not detect
                      signs of life after 20 minutes of resuscitation.

             8.16     The West Midlands Police report for the coroner concerning the death of
                      Philip Hammond contains further evidence. A statement from a Dr. Doore
                      refers to a body number 93 which is the deceased reference number for Philip
                      Hammond. She says that this body was one of 11 casualties that she
                      examined on being brought into the hospital. In total she examined 11
                      casualties that day, found no signs of life in any, and in her opinion all were
                      dead on arrival at the hospital. In a later statement she confirms that one of
                      the persons she examined was Philip Hammond. Dr. David Slater conducted
                      the autopsy of Philip Hammond and his conclusions were that the injuries
                      were consistent with a severe intensive blunt compression of the chest
                      especially on the right side.

             8.17     Based on the above findings I consider that there has been no suppression of
                      medical evidence by either the police or other persons as alleged by Alun
                      Jones. I agree that Dr. Walker’s evidence conflicts with that of Dr. Slater,
                      however it also conflicts with that of every other witness who has made a
                      statement concerning Philip Hammond. Alun Jones states that it is difficult
                      to exaggerate the significance of the concealment of Dr. Walker’s evidence,
                      a remark that I find to be completely misguided when the overall evidence is
                      considered. That this evidence tended to exculpate the South Yorkshire
                      authorities and the police from blame may well be because there was no
                      evidence to inculpate those organisations. I cannot accept the intimation that
                      there was misconduct in the selections by the West Midlands Police of the
                      evidence to put before the Coroner.

              8.18    Consideration should be given to allowing either Dr. Slater or Professor Usher
                      to comment on what Dr. Walker has now said.

     9        RECOMMENDATIONS

              9.1      There are no grounds for the Crown Prosecution Service to recommend to the
                       Home Office that there should be further investigation of criminal allegations
                       against the police or other persons.

              9.2      Alun Jones QC has requested the meeting with a senior lawyer of the CPS to
                       allow him to expand upon his advice. I note the Chief Crown Prosecutor’s
                       initial reaction is to refuse based on the fact that there are only powers to
                       invite the police to investigate the matter further. I appreciate the difficulties
                       which the HFSG has where the allegations of criminal conduct are made
                       against the police forces involved in the Hillsborough Investigation. My
                       overall view is that no new material has been put before us. It would be
                       politic to explain any reasons for our decision to the HFSG or at least to their
                       legal representatives. However, perhaps this should be done by the officers
                       of the Police Policy Directorate at the Home Office following consultation as
                       to the handling of the reporting of any decisions made in this matter.

     2.1    Present position to be established with the South Yorkshire Police and all other
            interested parties.

     2.2    A response is required to an enquiry raised by David Alton MP on behalf of the
            Hillsborough Family Support Group.

     3.     TIMING

     3.1    Response/to David Alton is required by 31 January 1997

    4.      BACKGROUND

    4.1     The Hillsborough Disaster was and still remains an unparalleled occurrence of our
            time and led not only to a fundamental re-appraisal of safety at public events, but has
            since resulted in precedents being set in the Civil Courts as to what might constitute
            post traumatic stress.

    4.2     For a detailed understanding of what then followed the original background note
            prepared for the then Attorney General together with its accompanying annexes
            remains valid. (Appendix I)

    4.3     At the conclusion of the re-commenced inquesttverdicts of accidental death were           ^
            returned on all the victims.

    4.4     The proceedings at the Coroner’s Court were challenged by way of Judicial Review.
            The Divisional Court however found nothing upon which they felt that they could
            question the actions of that Court.

     4.5    On Thursday 5 December 1996 the independent television network screened a
            drama/documentary based on the disaster written and produced by one Jimmy
            McGovern.

Cf'lQ 4^5   The screening of this programme and in particular certain parts of its content has
       /    resulted in eight of the deceased families writing both to this Department and in some
             cases to either the Home Secretary, the Attorney General or both asking that both the
             original inquest be set aside and that a new criminal investigation be commenced in
             the light of the new evidence disclosed in the programme. In addition it would appear
             that the Hillsborough Family Support Group has also written to every member of
             Parliament generally, and in particular to David Alton MP. who has forwarded a
             copy of the same to the Director,
          . 6
     ‘t
                On the 17 December 1996 the Home Secretary was required to respond in the House
                to an Adjournment Debate specifically on this matter. A transcript of what then took         <<
                place is attached. (Appendix II)

n               Following on from this debate the Home Secretary wrote to the Chief Constable for
                South Yorkshire Police asking him to express a view on certain issues that have been
                raised by the programme and requesting answers to 10 specific questions. A copy of
                this letter has been obtained via LSLO and is attached. (Appendix III)

                A copy of the programme has been obtained and this has been viewed by this office.
                Contact has also been established with the South Yorkshire Police Officers who are
                dealing with this matter land they have been invited to attend these offiees during the—          <4
                waalf mmmqncing 27 January' 1997^so that we can be briefed as to what the current
                position is.             Cwt&fiCe,             ^     ^                 ^ ^               ^

    5.          KEY CONSIDERATIONS

    5.1         The three crucial questions that fall to be considered are:-

    5.1.1 Has any "new" evidence come to light arising from the screening of the TV
          programme ?

    5.1.2 Does this evidence support the view that one or more Police Officers may have
          committed perjury at the Coroners Court jeand ^                                                   'T-

    5.1.3 Is there now sufficient doubt for the Attorney General to be asked once more to
          consider exercising his powers under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 to require
          a fresh inquest to be held.

                RECOMMEND ATI ONS

                At present this Department has insufficient evidence upon which any substantive
                decision can be made.

                Once the Chief Constable has reported to the Home Secretary it is recommended that
                a meeting is held between this Department, the Home Office and the LSLO (as LSLO
                propose) so that it can be established, 1) whether or not a further enquiry is to
                commence and if so 2) in what form and 3) to agree how any further enquiries either
                from the HFSG, relatives of the deceased or the media generally will be handled so
                as to avoid any possibility of confusion between us.

CONCLUSION

That until such time that this Department is satisfied whether a further criminal
investigation is justified or not, that no action is taken from which it could be
misconstrued that this Department either has or intends to re-open the Hillsborough
Enquiry.

1       ISSUE

         1.1    To consider briefing note and minute prepared by Mr. Croston following his
                review of material supplied by the Hillsborough Family Support Group and
                their recent correspondence.

2       ACTION REQUIRED

        2.1     Response to Hillsborough Family Support Group in co-ordination with LSLO
                and Home Office.

3       TIMING

        3.1     The HFSG will be expecting a response about the 8th April.

4       BACKGROUND

        4.1     This is detailed in Mr. Croston’s minutes.

5       KEY CONSIDERATIONS

        5.1     These are set out in Mr. Croston’s briefing note. In responding the HFSG,
                the CPS have 3 options.

                5.1.1        If it is now concluded that there are grounds for believing that
                              criminal offences may have been committed, to ask the police
                              to re-open their enquiries;

                5.1.2        If it is concluded that there is no fresh evidence to cast doubt
                              upon the original decision, to decline to take the matter further;

                5.1.3        Before making any final decision as to 5.1.1 or 5.1.2 above, to
                             take up the request of HSFG to see their counsel Alun Jones,
                             QC and representatives so that they can explain their reasoning
                             personally in more detail.

6       RECOMMENDATIONS

        6.1     That Mr. Croston’s recommendation, namely that there are no grounds for the
                CPS asking the police to re-open the criminal investigation, be accepted.

        6.2     That the CPS should write to HFSG informing them of our decision on the
                criminal aspects.

         6.3    That in accordance with earlier requests by Stephen Wooller at LSLO, the
                CPS response should be co-ordinated with those of LSLO and Home Office.

         6.4    That other than for a public relations exercise, no useful purpose will be

MMS/193.97
                served by CPS representatives meeting HFSG or their counsel.

         6.5    Whilst it may be useful, having regard to continuing concerns, for public
                officials to meet HFSG to explain the decision, since the Home Office have
                alreadyhad at least one meeting with them it would be appropriate, in order
                to avoidany possible risk of giving conflicting signals, for any further
                meetings to take place under the auspices of the Home Office.

7        CONCLUSIONS

         7.1The following observations are     pertinent to points made by HFSG:

                7.1.1        The use of the BBC film in preference to the police film at the
                              enquiry was presumably because it gave a better impression of
                              what had been happening. This, of course, gives some
                              credence to police claims of not appreciating the disaster
                              unfolding albeit that the BBC reporters did. The police
                              monitors did not give as clear a picture (metaphorically) as the
                              BBC’s. There is nothing sinister in not using the police
                              footage if the purpose was to show what actually happened
                              rather than what the police could see was happening.

               7.1.2         Having regard to the article on new video evidence in the
                             Yorkshire Evening Post of 1st April 1997, I am satisfied that
                             the "new" video mentioned in the Daily Mirror and other
                             papers in the last few days was the one recently considered by
                             CPS, LSLO and Home Office; it therefore contains nothing
                             new.

               7.1.3         As pointed out by Mr. Croston, the current recollection of so
                             called new witnesses differs from that in 1989. Their
                             credibility would thus be destroyed under cross-examination.

        7.2    Finally, for the sake of completeness, I should add that having regard to the
               recently reported signs of recovery by one of the victims said to be in a
               persistent vegetative state, the HFSG could be expected to renew with
               increased vigour their criticism of the Coroner’s decision to impose a 3.15 pm
               cut off. Whilst we have some sympathy with their concerns, they have not
               produced any expert evidence to cast doubt on the conclusions of the
               pathologists at the inquest and whilst it may be argued that it raises questions
               which the Coroner by his decision excluded, that is a matter for the LSLO.
               It does not affect any criminal liability.

ISSUE

1.1   What action should this department take following the approach made by the
      Hillsborough Family Support Group and their legal representatives in their
      correspondence of 4th March 1997.

ACTION REQUIRED

2.1     A decision should be made taking into consideration the CPS Central
        Casework Report and its appendices of the 20th March 1997 (Appendix 1 to
        this briefing note).

2.2     A co-ordinated approach is required by the various legal departments involved
        in reviewing the HSFG representations.

TIMING

3.1   A substantive answer should be given to the HSFG as soon as possible.

BACKGROUND

4.1   The background is fully set out in Appendices 1 and 2 to the attached Central
      Casework Report.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS

5.1   The Central Casework briefing note of 29th January 1997 mentioned three
      crucial questions that fall to be considered:-

5.2   Has any "new" evidence come to light arising from the TV screening of the
      Hillsborough Drama/Documentary on the 5th December 1996.

5.3   Does this evidence support the view that one or more police officers may have
      committed perjury at the Coroner’s Court or otherwise attempted to obstruct
      the course of justice.

5.4   Is there now sufficient doubt for the Attorney General to be asked once more
       to consider exercising his powers under Section 13 of the Coroner’s Act 1988
       to require a fresh inquest to be held.

RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1   That the Central Casework Report of the 20th March 1997 attached at
      Appendix 1 be adopted.
                  6.2   The evidence put forward by the HFSG concerns two separate aspects of the
                        Hillsborough disaster enquiry, that is, alleged suppression of video evidence
                        which would go towards proving criminal misconduct by police officers and
                        the suppression of medical evidence that would show grounds for the re­
                        opening of inquests based on a later cut off point for the death of the victims.

                  6.3   On the first point there has been no suppression of any video evidence and the
                         inquest jury were able to consider the relevant videos and compare them with
                        the observations made by police during the giving of their evidence under
                        oath. The jury’s verdict was therefore made after all the relevant material
                        was put before them. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that police
                        officers committed perjury at the Coroner’s Court or were involved in
                        Perverting the Course of Justice.

                  6.4   On the second point, the credibility of the medical witness put forward by the
                        HFSG is greatly weakened by the mistakes and discrepancies in the evidence
                        that doctor would put forward. Similar evidence was considered by the
                        Divisional Court during judicial review of the Coroner’s Hearings and was
                        found to have little merit.

                  6.5   There are no grounds for asking the Attorney General to consider exercising
                        his powers under Section 13 of the Coroner’s Act 1988 in requiring a fresh
                        inquest to be held.

                  6.6   It is understood that both the Police Policy Directorate at the Home Office and
                         the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers have come to the same conclusion.

7                 CONCLUSION

                  7.1   That a co-ordinated approach should be taken by the various departments
                        involved as to how the HFSG representations should be actioned.

                         RE: HILLSBOROUGH


ISSUES

1.1   I have been asked to review the Hillsborough Family Support Group letter of
      4th March 1997 and the attached Counsel’s Opinion with supporting
      documents. The letter requests the Director to convene a meeting with the
      above group and their legal representatives (Alun Jones QC and Ann
      Adlington, Solicitor) to discuss their ‘new’ evidence and the legal advice
      based upon it.

1.2   A meeting was held at the Home Office on the 10th March 1997 with
      representatives of their Operational Policing Policy Division, of the Legal
      Secretariat to the Law Officers and of CPS Central Casework. It was decided
      that each of the three groups should report back to the OPPD having
      conducted separate reviews of the allegations made by Mr. Trevor Hicks and
      Alun Jones QC.

1.3   Our Chief Crown Prosecutor, Dru Sharpling, has asked that she be given an
      indication of the likely time-scale for consideration of the papers by the 17th
      March 1997.

1.4   On the 13th March 1997 I held a full days conference with Chief
      Superintendent Lowe and DC Greenaway of South Yorkshire Police at their
      offices in Sheffield. I was able to view original video tapes exhibited to the
      Taylor Enquiry and to the Coroner’s Hearing. I had access to the transcripts
      of those hearings and original witness statements.

BACKGROUND

2.1   A copy of the Background Note concerning the Hillsborough Disaster and
      prepared for the then Attorney General in 1990 is attached (Appendix 1). It
      sets out the facts of the incident together with a precis of the CPS decision
      prior to the conclusion of the Coroner’s Hearings.

2.2   The CPS Central Casework Briefing Note of 29th January 1997 (author Peter
      Pearson) gives the detail of the events up to that date (Appendix 2).

ALLEGATIONS

3.1   The HFSG letter enclosed a further letter and a draft statement from Mr.
      Trevor Hicks, the opinion of Alun Jones QC and their Annexes A to G
       (comprising 7 volumes and 3 video tapes).

3.2   The Director has been asked to examine the material and the key issues which
       are said to be involved, that is, fresh evidence proving suppression of
       evidence, Peijury and a Conspiracy to Pervert the Course of Justice in the
                legal process following the disaster.

         3.3   Mr. Hicks states that he has viewed certain video material provided to him
               from Yorkshire Television Archives (which had been supplied by South
               Yorkshire Police originally). He says that the videos clearly show that the
               scoreboard camera (No. 5) was working so that it could pan, tilt, zoom and
               show a picture clear enough to identify individuals. The clarity of the image
               was more than satisfactory and showed that therefore P.C.s Ryan and Bichard
               peijured themselves when giving evidence at the inquiry and inquest.

         3.4   He believes that the editor of the ‘Compilation Video’ shown to the Jury must
               have known of the existence of the extensive footage from Camera 5, and that
               this footage was not produced despite several requests from the Jury. This
               was the suppression of critical evidence that would have totally changed the
               Jury’s view of what the police could see.

         3.5   The Opinion of Alun Jones QC sets out the skeleton argument presented at the
               Divisional Court in 1993 at the application for Judicial Review of the Inquest
               Verdicts. The relevant points for the purpose of my report are those at 2.1
               and 2.2 concerning the 15.15 evidential cut-off point and exclusion of
               evidence that was said to indicate the later time at which many of the victims
               died.

         3.6   The Divisional Court rejected all the grounds put forward (and in fact stated
               that the overwhelming burden of evidence was that there was no prolongation
               of life beyond the period of about 10 minutes from the occurrence of the
                injury which led to asphyxia, and that there was clear evidence that bodily
                functions may continue and give a semblance of life when the prior occurrence
                of brain death renders the existence of life unlikely, if not impossible).

         3.7   However the Opinion states that the HFSG have a deep conviction that the
               legal system failed them and that they have been deceived about the
               circumstances of the deaths.

         3.8   Attached to it is the affidavit of a Roger Houldsworth, the engineer who
               repaired and maintained the football ground’s camera equipment on the day.
               His evidence is that Camera 5 specifically gave clear pictures of the Leppings
               Lane Terraces where the deaths occurred. If this evidence is correct then it
               is said that the video tapes and Houldsworth’s evidence were deliberately
               suppressed and that officers therefore committed perjury (concerning the use
               which they could make of pictures from Camera 5). The point is made that
               Camera 5 pictures were visible on the police monitor between 14.30 and
               15.00 (although no video recording of them was taken).

         3.9   Alun Jones describes a video shown to him that depicts very badly duplicated
               and blurred pictures of individuals escaping from the stricken pens shortly
               after 15.00, and in which it is not possible to identify individuals. He has
               been told that this is the tape that was shown to the Jury. I agree with him
MMS/150.97
                that it appears to be a copy at several generations removed from the original
                video tape (Exhibit TB/2 to the Taylor Enquiry), but one that presents only
                the events after 15.00.

         3.10 He says that a central issue at the inquest would be whether or not the police
              could and did notice the pressure on the Leppings Lane pens before 15.00.
              The evidence from the police (including P.C.s Ryan and Bichard) was that
              none of them noticed problems in the pens until 15.00. He believes that the
              existence of the evidence would have been of crucial significance to both the
              Divisional Court and the Inquest Jury.

         3.11   The Opinion then considers the evidence of a Dr. Walker which came to light
                in February 1997. The Doctor’s letter of the 8th February and the 13th
                February 1997 state that he was voluntarily involved in resuscitation efforts
                of many of the Hillsborough victims who arrived at the Northern General
                Hospital. He says that the boy Philip Hammond was the first victim to arrive
                at the hospital and the first one that he attempted to resuscitate. He goes on
                to query of a senior hospital consultant why he was not contacted by the West
                Midlands Police to provide an official statement nor asked to appear at the
                Inquest. He states that in his statement (of 1989) he said that Philip had sinus
                rhythm and cardiac output which was at odds with the evidence given by a
                Dr. Slater to the Inquest. This undated statement describes the arrival of the
                first child in cardio-respiratory standstill and the instigation of routine cardio­
                pulmonary resuscitation. He continues that as far as he could recall sinus
                rhythm and (unidentified word) output were established at one stage although
                the boy’s pupils were fixed and dilated throughout. He believes that the boy
                has since died. He then gives detail of a second child arriving, also in a state
                of cardio-pulmonary arrest. Similar measures were carried out and this child
                was also brought back into sinus rhythm with a good output, though again
                with fixed dilated pupils throughout and subsequent death. This statement
                does not give patient names.

        3.12 Alun Jones says that Dr. Walker’s statement shows serious criticisms of the
             reaction to the disaster, and that other victims were alive. Dr. Walker was
             asked by a consultant, Mr. Wardrope, to stand by to make a statement to the
             West Midlands Police. Dr. Walker was not called at the Inquest. Counsel
             considers that it would be difficult to exaggerate the significance of the
             concealment of Dr. Walker’s evidence which especially disagrees with that of
             Dr. Slater (where the evidence discloses the same pattern of rapid
             unconsciousness of victims leading to rapid death).

         3.13 The conclusion of the Opinion is that these new pieces of evidence call for a
              full Police Enquiry or Public Enquiry, that Exhibit Tapes should be secured
              and subjected to Forensic Analysis and witnesses must be identified.

4        VIDEO EVIDENCE

         4.1    The allegations are of Perjury by P.C.s Ryan and Bichard who were attending
MMS/150.97
               to the radio communications and camera monitors, of a Perverting the Course
               of Justice by way of suppression of vital video evidence of the crushing in the
               Leppings Lane Terraces and of Houldsworth’s evidence.

        4.2    P.C. Bichard’s evidence to the Taylor enquiry details the problems that had
               occurred with Camera 5 (the camera which gave the best view of the terraces)
               involving a loss of picture due to an electrical fault. He said that on the day
               the quality of the picture had improved but was still not up to the mark. He
               agreed that control facilities, for example, zoom, were fully available, but that
               because of the cameras position and angle of view there was a false
               impression created of the crowd and a difficulty in assessing overcrowding.
               It was said that the camera was not used as much as it normally would be
               because of these substandard pictures. There was some discussion about the
               accidental knocking of the video recorder control so that a particular recording
               ended earlier than it should have done. He told the Coroner that his
               recollection was that camera 5 was not really being used, just left in position.
               He first realised that there was anything untoward when people were seen
               climbing over the fence, but thought it was a pitch invasion. It would not
               have been sound judgement to make a decision on overcrowding based on the
               monitor. Because of what had been happening on Leppings Lane he did not
               get the chance to view the terraces until after 15.00

        4.3    P.C. Ryan’s evidence to the enquiry was similar to that of his colleague. The
               (monitor) picture was said to be very distorted and Houldsworth had worked
               on the equipment for some considerable time. As far as the officer recalled
               the picture was never satisfactory and it was its quality that was the problem.


        4.4    P.S. Goddard, another officer in the control box, said in evidence that it was
               not possible to tell that the pens were full from the control box. Nothing
               unusual was seen until people were seen climbing over the pens fence at about
               15.00

        4.5    Roger Houldsworth 1989 statement includes his perception of the crowd at
               Leppings Lane turnstiles seen from club CCTV end room monitors of the
               views taken from both the club and the police camera systems. He describes
               the pressure building up at the outside gates and turnstiles, the initial opening
               of Gate C and later the radio conversations regarding the likelihood of persons
               dying if a gate is not then opened. He saw the gate opened and a huge
               number of fans flooding in. Believing that a dangerous situation was being
               created he went down to the pitch. As the match was being stopped by the
               referee, he believed that a pitch invasion was in progress. It was not for two
               or three minutes before he surmised the correct situation that of crushing.

         4.6   His 1996 rebuttals of the police evidence concerning Camera 5 are:-

               •      Having checked Camera 5 and repaired the electrical fault it was
                      working correctly.
MMS/150.97
                •     He would have shown Ryan and Goddard that the cameras were
                      working correctly.

                •     The quality of Camera 5’s picture was never a problem (although he
                      admits that there was ‘flaring’ or whiteout of the picture).

                •     When watching the view from the police cameras he could clearly see
                      that the pens were full to the point of over-crowding when the order
                      was given to open the gates.

                •     Camera 5 was working perfectly.

               •      Facial features can be identified from the Camera 5 pictures except
                       while events are happening.

               •      P.C. Bichard’s assessment of camera angle and crowd density does not
                      make sense.

               •      He disagrees that it was difficult to assess that the pens were getting
                      over-crowded.

               •      It is highly unlikely that P.C. Bichard could have knocked the video
                       buttons and impossible that a switch could be flicked as claimed.

               •      Houldsworth makes further comments on police evidence concerning
                      their operation of other cameras in the system.

        4.7    There is no evidence to support the allegation that video evidence has been
                suppressed, only the belief of Mr. Hicks as to what was seen by the Jury.

5       REVIEW OF VIDEO EVIDENCE

        5.1    I have viewed the Taylor Enquiry Exhibits TB/1 and TB/2 and the Coroner’s
                Exhibit C 539.

        5.2    The latter is a large part of Exhibit TB/2, Part 4 which is a recording from
                Camera 5 between 15.03 and 15.25 of the front of the pens on the Leppings
                Lane Terraces. There are two original master copies of C 539 (taken from
                master copy of TB/2) and while they are reasonably clear the position and
                angle in my opinion makes any assessment of over-crowding to be difficult if
                not impossible. If the camera had been panned or its width of view increased
                then more might have been seen in those crucial minutes after 15.03.

         5.3   As TB/1 and 2 were available to the Taylor Enquiry, it cannot be said that
                they were suppressed. All of the enquiry exhibits were known to the legal
                teams involved in the inquest. I am satisfied that while TB/1 and 2 were not
                themselves shown to the Jury, the ‘compilation video’ and C 539 video were.
                The compilation included elements of both TB/1 and 2 tapes as well as the
MMS/150.97
               more colourful and harrowing media film.

        5.4    C 539 covers most of the Camera 5 footage between 15.03 and 15.25 and was
               shown to the Jury during the evidence of P.S. Killoch. A copy of the relevant
               part of the Inquest Transcript is attached (Appendix 3). However it can be
               seen that the officer makes a mistake when he describes the Exhibit as having
               the original identification of TB/1. My viewing confirms that it comes from
               the Exhibit TB/2 and agrees with the relevant schedule (Appendix 4).

         5.5   The video evidence has not been suppressed and I am satisfied that Alun
               Jones’ instructions about a poor quality copy of C 539 being shown to the
               Jury are incorrect. No mention is made in the transcript of any failing in that
               video, and the original copy held by the police is of a satisfactory quality.

        5.6    The HFSG case therefore depends on the perception of the value of any
               Camera 5 pictures whether seen on the monitor or as recorded by video
               taping. Houldsworth has one point of view based on his observations of all
               the monitors seen in the club CCTV room). His evidence in 1996 is that he
               could clearly see that the pens were full to overcrowding when the gate was
               opened leading to the fatal crushing. In 1989 his evidence is not so precise,
               only that a dangerous situation was developing. Here he says that it was not
               for two to three minutes after going down onto the pitch and viewing the pens
               that he realised there was not a pitch invasion. His later evidence is therefore
               at variance with his perceptions in 1989 and may well have been contaminated
               by later events.

        5.7    The HFSG would say that the control room police officers must have realised
               that crushing in the pens would occur just after 15.00 because there was a
               monitor able to show the camera view of those pens. Because this evidence
               of the ‘police view’ was deliberately not shown to the Jury then there was a
               Perverting of the Course of Justice and the Jury and Divisional Court would
               have come to a different verdict if it had been shown.

        5.8    My conclusion is that as the Jury did see Exhibit C 539 tape then they were
               able to assess what the police officers perceptions were said to be as against
               the Camera 5 pictures. There is no evidence to rebut the police account that
               they were concerned with a serious incident at the turnstiles and disregarded
               what they thought of as poor quality pictures from Camera 5. The Jury were
               able to compare the police account and the relevant video pictures and still
               come to a verdict of Accidental Death.

         5.9   I consider that the new allegations made concerning videos and what the
                officers must or should have perceived is not supported by evidence of
                sufficient quality to even pass the civil standard of proof.

6        MEDICAL EVIDENCE

         6.1   While any application by the HFSG for a re-opening of the Inquest based on
MMS/150.97
               new Medical Evidence is within the province of the Home Office rather than
               the Crown Prosecution Service, Alun Jones QC does allege at paragraph 11
               of his Opinion that Dr. Walker’s evidence was concealed. In which case there
               must be a consideration of any evidence going towards the offence of
               perverting the course of justice. It is said that very serious questions arise as
               to the process by which evidence was selected by the West Midlands Police
               who assisted the Coroner. Alun Jones considered that one of the most striking
               aspects of the history of the case was the way in which the evidence presented
               at the Inquest was evidence which tended to exculpate the South Yorkshire
               authorities and the police from blame. The intimation must be of a conspiracy
               to pervert the course of justice between at the very least the two police forces.
               Following the conclusions of the Divisional Court in the Judicial Review of
               the Coroner’s Hearings it would be difficult for further allegations to be made
               against the Coroner without sufficient supporting evidence. That only leaves
               the two police forces as possible offenders.

        6.2    Dr. Walker’s evidence which is contained within Annex ‘F ’ of the HFSG
               papers has been described previously In essence he is saying that
               Hillsborough victims arrived at the Hospital, where he had volunteered to do
               emergency duty, in a state of cardiac and respiratory arrest. Because the
               hearts of a number of these persons were re-started, although they
               subsequently died, the intimation must be that for the purposes of the Inquest,
               death occurred after 15.15.

        6.3    The question for me to consider is whether or not the alleged omission in
               taking a statement from him was done with the intent to suppress that evidence
               because it would have embarrassed the police and/or led to a different verdict
               from the Jury.

7       REVIEW OF MEDICAL EVIDENCE

        7.1    The Judicial Review of the Medical Evidence found that Drs. Gumpert and
               Slater and Professor Usher were as one in that cnce a victim’s chest was fixed
               (when crushing occurs) then irrecoverable brain damage will ensue in 4- 6
               minutes. It was submitted before the Divisional Court that the Coroner
               wrongly refused to call evidence of the two doctors because that evidence fell
               after the cut-off point. This evidence also concerned alleged signs of life in
               victims after 15.15. The court stated that this other evidence would not have
               made the slightest difference to the result if it had been given at the Inquest.
               They commented on the plain and virtually unchallenged evidence of the
               pathologist. That new evidence would not have caused the Coroner to change
               his cut-off point. There was clear evidence that bodily functions may continue
               and may give a semblance of life when the prior occurrence of brain death
               renders the existence of life unlikely if not impossible.

         7.2   The court held that the inquisition was correctly completed and that there was
               no good reason for ordering a new inquest or for merely quashing the existing
               verdicts. The purpose of fresh inquests was queried. If it was to get a verdict

               criticising the police, then such criticism had already been firmly levelled by
               the Taylor Report. The police had admitted fault and paid compensation.
               Further there was no evidence to justify criticism of the emergency services.
               The words of Turner J at page 42 of the Court Transcript shows the detail in
               which the Coroner led evidence that might have persuaded pathologists to
               form different conclusions from those expressed at the preliminary inquests.

         7.3   I do not consider that Dr. Walker’s observations as made in his personal
               statement of 1989 and the letters of 1997 comprise such vital new evidence as
               to show that the life of Philip Hammond continued after the cut off period of
                15.15.

        7.4    Dr. Walker contends that he was not asked to make a statement by the police
               (whether it be the West Midlands or West Yorkshire Police as he states in two
               different letters). However the police file which I have seen contains Dr.
               Walker’s manuscript statement of the 20th July 1989 as obtained by the West
               Midlands Police. Each page is signed by him and witnessed by two other
               persons. It is somewhat different to his undated personal statement which is
               said to have been made in 1989. In the police statement he says that he
               attended to the first casualty to arrive, a boy he knows only as "Lee", and
               who he believed was declared brain dead in the Intensive Care Unit two days
               later. The patient was in cardio-pulmonary arrest with fixed dilated pupils.
               The heart had stopped beating but the medical team managed to re-establish
               normal rhythm. While the boy was being treated the second victim arrived
               also in cardio-pulmonary arrest. This boy was also established in a normal
               sinus heart rhythm but again the pupils were fixed and dilated throughout and
               it is believed that the boy has since died. The description given by Dr.
               Walker of this second boy fits that of the victim Philip Hammond.

        7.5    The Doctor’s evidence concerning these first two victims shows that both
               arrived without signs of life apparent. Although a normal heart rhythm was
               established it could not be sustained and the two boys eventually died. I
               understand that T/*e’s bodily functions were maintained for two days as he was
               to be an organ donor.

        7.6    However, the Doctor’s letter of 8/2/97 to Mr. Wardrope says that Philip
               Hammond was the first victim that he attempted to resuscitate and that
               recollection is presumably based on the undated 1989 personal statement.
               Here he describes the establishment of sinus rhythum and cardiac output in the
               first two victims he treated (no names are given) and that both had fixed and
               dilated pupils throughout and subsequently were believed to have died. The
               HFSGT Annex F concerning his evidence is attached at Appendix 5. This
               includes the part of Mr. Wardropes evidence that applies to Philip Hammond
               where his interpretation of the Medical Notes is that a cardiac tracing at the
               time showed no cardiac activity, and a typed copy of Dr.Walker’s police
               statement.



MMS/150.97
7.7   P.C. Taylor was at the football ground and gave evidence that he approached
      a youth who was identified as Philip Hammond who was laid on the ground
      and appeared to be unconscious. He took the boy to an ambulance and
      attempted to revive him with the assistance of others. Heart massage was
      performed and they were able to re-start the heart and feel a pulse. However
      it is said by the officer that later at the hospital the doctor could not detect
      signs of life after 20 minutes of attempted resuscitation.

7.8   Having reviewed the papers, I again considered that there has been no
      suppression of evidence by the police or others. Dr. Walker’s statement does
      little to advance the proposition that a proper cut off point for the Inquest
      would be later than 15.15. The Pathological evidence is still overwhelming
      and fully supports the Coroner’s original decision as to that cut-off.

7.9   Consideration should be given to allowing either Dr.Slater or Professor Usher
      to comment on what Dr. Walker is now saying.

RECOMMENDATIONS

8.1   There are no grounds for the Crown Prosecution Service to recommend to the
      Home Office that there should be further investigation of criminal allegations
      against the police or others.

8.2   Alun Jones has requested a meeting with a senior lawyer of the CPS to allow
      him to expand upon his advice. I note that the CCP’s initial re-action is to
      refuse based on the fact that there are only powers to invite the police to
      investigate the matter further. I appreciate the difficulties which the HFSG
      has where the allegations of criminal conduct are made against the two police
      forces involved in the Hillsborough investigation. My overall view is that no
      new material evidence has been put before us. It would be politic to explain
      any reasons for our decision to the HFSG or at least to their legal
      representatives. However perhaps this should be done through the offices of
      the Police Policy Directorate at the Home Office.

HILLSBOROUGH:      CORRESPONDENCE FROM MR PATNICK OBE MP

As requested a draft reply is enclosed for Mr Patten's signature
to the attached correspondence from Mr Patnick MP.

2.   The Government have already welcomed the thoroughness of the
Interim Report and Mr Patnick concedes that it does not gloss
over the causes of the events which took place on that fateful
day.  Whilst the main criticism of the report is levelled at the
police, they are not the only ones who are criticised.        Both
Sheffield City Council and the football club (together with the
club's professional advisers) are the subject of criticism.    Nor
does the report overlook contributory factors such as the
behaviour of fans outside the ground.      It will probably be as
well to comment on these in a general way in reply Mr Patnick.
It seems unnecessary however to comment in detail on the list of
individual points raised by £         ] some of which appear to be
                                     s40 personal idenfication information

rhetoric.

3.    The cost of the Inquiry is being met by the Government.                      It
is the police investigation costs which are probably giving rise
to s4opersonalidenficationinformant] displeasure. The draft explains the position on
this.

4.   The Inquiry has already said that it will be addressing
wider, longer term issues such as perimeter fencing and pre-match
drinking by football fans in the Final Report.        As for the
constituent's comments about a disaster fund (to which the
Government contributed), the tragedy touched the whole nation
whose sympathy manifested itself by way of voluntary donations
for the families of victims.

5.      A draft reply is attached.

I am now receiving various letters and I enclose one of
these to you, which are creating the impression that "a
whitewash" was the outcome of the Hillsborough disaster
enquiry.    I know this not to be the case, and that work
is still proceeding on this, but I have to report that the
feeling in Sheffield is running pretty high that South Yorkshire
Police are a good police force and that they are not responsible
for the tragedy that occurred.

I did feel it was my duty to inform you of the situation
and just enclose, as I stated previously, one sample letter.

               LETTER DRAFTED FOR SIGNATURE BY ...MR PATTEN.........
                                                  (NAME OF SIGNATORY)


               Thank you for your letter of 29 August to the Home Secretary
               with    this    one   from                               las an       example   of the
               feeling in Sheffield following the findings of the Interim
               Report of the Hillsborough•Inquiry.


               As you say,        any suggestion that the outcome of the Inquiry
               has glossed over the causes of the terrible events of that
               day     is    quite   wrong.        The     Inquiry       did     not    set    out    to
               apportion blame for what happened but to find out the causes
               and make       recommendations       to prevent such an accident                      from
               happening again.            Although      the police were             criticised the
               Interim Report highlights several other contributory factors
               which    led to the        accident,       for    example       the    absence of an
               authorised maximum capacity for the pens, the layout of the
               crush        barriers     and      inadequate           signs     and     ticketing.
               Criticism was not therefore confined solely to the police.


               The    Report      also   concluded       that    a    substantial       minority       of
               fans who had had too much to drink aggravated the problems
               outside      the   ground    but   that     the       evidence    did not       suggest
               that there was a very significant number of ticketless fans.
               The problems of pre-match drinking and fans without tickets
which will be considered in the second stage of the Inquiry
which is now addressing the more general,                      long term issues
of safety at sports events.


The immediate costs of the             Hillsborough Inquiry will            be met
in full by the Government.             With regard to the costs             of the
investigations         undertaken     by     the     West     Midlands    police,
although their results were made available to Lord Justice
Taylor they were originally started at the initiative of the
Chief   Constable       of   South     Yorkshire       as      they    concernedthe
policing of his area.             In addition to the investigation of
policing and related events on the day,                      the investigations
by West Midlands police are necessary for the presentation
of   evidence     to     the   coroner's        inquests,       complaints     and
discipline matters and,           more recently,            from allegations of
criminal liability.


The Government by way of police specific grant at 51% plus
block grant already pays a sizeable proportion of the costs
of policing      in South      Yorkshire.           However,    in view of the
exceptional and unforeseen circumstances of the Hillsborough
tragedy,   the    Government         has     offered    the    South     Yorkshire
Police Authority an additional special payment from central
funds to assist them with the additional costs they now face
in respect of the work carried out on their behalf by the
West Midlands police.


Finally,    the        disaster      fund,     to     which     the    Government
contributed, was set up to receive donations from the public
wishing to express their sympathy for the family and friends
of victims of a national disaster.

              I am presently stationed in Doncaster Town Sub Division, Doncaster

              Division,          as a uniform patrol sergeant.

              At 8.30 am on Saturday,              13th April   1989,    I reported on duty at

              Doncaster Poli ce Station for my duties at Hillsborough,                        I knew from

              correspondence              received some days earlier that I was in charge of a

              serial of eight officers and that our duties were to be at each end

              of Vere Road and Fielding Road at the i r junctions with Leppings Lane

              and Peni stone Road North,             preventing access to these        Zmf streets by
              anyone except          residents.

              We were transported to Hillsborough by bus and were briefed in the

              North Stand at 10 am that morning.

              Shortly after 11 am, the eight officers                   in my serial   in four pairs,

              took up duty at their points.                 Metal   barriers were placed across the

              road junctions              immediately the officers got to their points;
                                                                                        . /     '        I

              I was    issued with a radio at the briefing,                the officers on my serial

              were n o t .        I had therefore no way of contacting them other than by a

              personal       visit to their        place of duty.       This could involve a walk of

              perhaps three hundr^tl yards,             from one point to the next.

The officers working at the Penistone Road North end of the two

streets we were supervising we re involved with Nottingham Forest

supporters.

Officers working at the Leppings Lane end were involved with

Liverpool supporters.

I visited alternately all four pairs of officers       in my serial.

At the junction of Vere Road and Penistone Road North,        there is a         ft
fish and chip shop on one side and an off-licence on the other side.

F rom quite early in the day,    large queues had formed at both s h o p s .

A large percentage of supporters of both clubs were drinking as they

were walking along and carrying     cans of beer.    I saw one youth

drinking from a seven pint party can of beer.

It was also apparent that both sets of supporters were intermingling

at both sides of the ground, mainly I think by accident having got

lost and 1ooking for their way into the ground.

Throughout the day,     I did not see any problems   involving   rival sets

of supporters.      The mood of the fans going to the match was good, and

I saw no animosity from them towards either the Police or fellow

su p po rte rs .

I was approached by several     persons from about S pm asking where

there were some public toilets.      I did not know of any and told them

that as far as I knew the only toilets were       inside the ground.       All

said that     it was too early to go in, obviously because it would stop

them from drinking.      I was also approached by several obvious

Liverpudlians asking where the ticket touts were as they had not got

tickets.      Only one admitted to travelling without a ticket,     the

others said their tickets had been stolen.

At about 2.20 pm I joined two offi cers PC 2526 Ayres and PC 2042 Drury

in Leppings Lane at the junction with Vere Road.        At this time      it was

busy with supporters making their way to the Leppin gs Lane turnstiles.
There was still the odd Nottingham Forest supporter mixed in with the

Liverpool         fans.   Many were asking for directions to their       particular

part of the ground,          having no idea where they were going.       These

people took up most of our time.

At about H.45 pm it was brought to my notice that people                could not

get to the turnstiles at Leppings Lane end for the North or West

Stands because of a crush of people whi ch had buiIt up.                I was told

by several        supporters all brandishing tickets who were asking if they

could gain entry anywhere else.            I did not notice the crush of people

build up and did not realise anything was wrong until             I was told.        A

few peo p le , mainly        women or persons with children asked if they could

get out of the way nearby until          the crowd had cleared.        I mentioned

the problems to an Inspector who was walking past us - not our

Inspector and I do           not know who he was.   He went off in     the direction

of the turnstiles.            I could see that there were Police officers there

with the crowd.           I could see the mounted off i cers above the heads of

the cro wd.         I did not appreciate the seriousness of this crowding

until about four Liverpool supporters at separate times said that if

something was not done about          it, there would be another Heysel

disaster.

There were still at this time a steady stream of supporters walking

along the road towards the turnstiles.              There were still   in evidence

a lot of cans of beer.

A short time after          Ifirst noticed the congestion,   I saw     that it   was

beginning to clear.            I was not aware of the reasons why it was

c 1 ear i n g .   I did not hear any radi o messages but with the no i se of

the crowd and being constantly in conversation with someone,                it was

easy to miss what was being said.

It seemed to me that           the congestion cleared some minutes        before the

kick off although it is difficult to tell as I can only judge f r o m ^
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                R2Q2

the noise of the crowd inside the ground.            I could tell by the noise

of the crowd that the match had started.           There was no crush outside

at this t i m e .    There were over a hundred people in Leppings Lane who

were making no effort to get into the ground and who obviously did not

have tickets.        They we re fairly w e 11 behaved but shouting and I

considered that all had been drinking.           They were on the other side

of Leppings Lane from the football         ground on the footpath.

I heard a radio message shortly after the game had started asking for

all available officers to go into the ground.            My job was to prevent

any harrassment of the residents nearby and as there were a lot of

people outside the ground,        I did not consi de r, myself or any of my

serial to be available.         In any case,    I was only in contact with two

of them.       I could have contacted another two within a short time.

Had I known what was a c t u a 11y happening      inside the ground,    my

decision might have been different.            From listening to the messages

on the radio,        I was none the wiser as to what was going on.           1 heard

a call for an ambulance be cause someone was seriously i njured but was

still unaware of the situation inside the ground.

Shortly after the incident developed, a few people started leaving

the g r o u n d .   I was asking them what was happeni ng .     At this time they

had no idea of the disaster which had occurred but were aware that

people were hurt.

Fire engines and ambulances started arriving           in Leppings Lane and

shortly afterwards        I heard on the radio of the need for a mortuary.

It was only then,        perhaps 20 minutes after,    that I realised the

seriousness of what had occurred.          It was too late by then to be of

any help inside the ground and in any case, a lot of people were

leaving the ground requiring supervision.            Some of t h e m , mainly

teenagers who had been drinking were shouting and swearing at the

Police officers        present that it was all our fault.      Many were crying
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    R202

         and all were upset.       The situation outside became even more volatile

         when the crowd began to leave e n m a s s .      Even more people were shouting

         accusations at the Police although I would say that they were only a

         small   percentage of the people there.          The fire engines parked in

         Leppings Lane were getting           in the way of the crowd who were   1eaving

         and 1 took steps to have them parked out of the way.

         None of the Police Offi cers in my view responded to the abuse they

         were getting from the small           percentage of the supporters   leaving the

         ground.    All these people we re ignored.         To have re-acted to them

         would I am sure have sparked wholesale violence against the few

         Police left in the s t r e e t s .    The mood of the crowd at this time was

         one of anger against Police who they we re blaming for the inc id e n t .

         The crowds dispersed and I saw no incidents           invo1ving the crowd,

         other than the few people abusing the Police.

         We were all called back to the North Stand when the crowd dispersed

         and I took no further      part in the incident and went off duty from

         Claywheels L a n e .                                           .

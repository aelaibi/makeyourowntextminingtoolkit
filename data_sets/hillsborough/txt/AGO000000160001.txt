ATTORNEY GENERAL


During your absence from the Department I have taken forward in
conjunction with      the   Solicitor    General      consideration of       the
application   under    section    13    of   the    Coroners   Act   1988    for
authority to seek an order from the High Court directing a fresh
inquest in relation to the Hillsborough disaster.                    A lengthy
note by myself analysing the application to assist the Solicitor
General is marked with a white flag.               The Solicitor General has
also prepared a note setting out his views.


The Solicitor General and I both advise that authority should be
refused in all six cases.        Our reasons will be apparent from our
respective notes.      You will wish to consider whether you agree.


If you have doubts about declining the application, it would be
preferable for you to defer any further action pending the return
to the Department of the Solicitor General and myself (1 Septem­
ber).    I have however prepared all the material necessary for
you to implement a decision refusing authority without further
delay.   You will need first to consider the question of timing.
 It is desirable on the one hand that the applicants should be
informed without delay of your decision;              there is on the other
hand substantial Parliamentary interest and those Members of
Parliament who have made representations to you may be displeased
if an announcement is made in mid-August when they are likely to
be away and therefore unable to comment on your decision.                   That
is however a matter of judgment for you.                The Legal Secretary
has been alerted to this point and stands ready to advise.                   Her
provisional view is that we should not delay the announcement.


Assuming that you decide to go ahead and implement the decision,
the following steps need to be taken:


A letter must be sent to the Solicitor acting for the applicants.
A letter has been prepared and signed by myself.               If you approve
it, I should be grateful if Private Office/Juliet Wheldon would
insert the date and despatch.

        2.        You must write to Robert Wareing MP, Peter Kilfoyle MP, Robert
                  Parry MP, and Eddie Loyden MP and Mrs Jane Kennedy MP.                   The are
                  the Members who you met at the House of Commons on the 15 June.
                  You undertook to write to them once you had taken a decision.
                  I have prepared the necessary letters which have been approved
                  by    the   Solicitor      General.         They   are   annexed opposite     for
                  signature or use as drafts.


        3.        Three Members of           Parliament   (George Howarth MP,       Sir Malcolm
                  Thornton MP and David Alton MP) who did not attend the meeting
                  have also written to you.             Letters have been prepared, adapted
                  to individual circumstances but based on the same letter used for
                  those Members who attended the House of Commons meeting on 15
                  June.       Each letter is in the relevant pink folder for signature
                  or use as a draft.


        4.        Mrs   Teresa      Glover    has   written    separately    in support    of   the
                  application.        She is one of those represented by Messrs Malcolm
                  J. Gregg & Co.             Out of courtesy I suggest that an official
                  letter goes to her also.              Mrs J. McBrien is the mother of a
                  youth who died at the Hillsborough disaster.                   She represented
                  herself at the inquest and we have treated her letter as an
                  application to be considered alongside the formal application
                  from the six represented by solicitors.                  There is no reason to
                  reach any different decision.               An official letter needs to be
                  sent.        Those letters are in a white folder attached to this
                  file.       You are asked to approve them.           They will then need only
                  the date inserting and despatch.


                  The Legal Secretary will make arrangements within LSLO for the
                  handling of any press enquiries.               It would seem appropriate to
                  maintain the line adopted in the letter to the solicitors and add
                  nothing.         That would be consistent with the normal approach of
                  not     giving    detailed    reasons   in    relation     to public    interest
                  decisions.

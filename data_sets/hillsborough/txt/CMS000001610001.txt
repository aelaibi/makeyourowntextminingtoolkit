   HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY INTERIM REPORTS          TWERTON PARK                        z/v/)
   Avon County Council telephoned in response to your letter of                       ,.i
   6 December.   The main purpose of the call was to ask if the                          fv
   question of the capacity cut should be considered urgent enough
   to convene a special public protection sub-committee (or full
   committee) meeting before the Christmas/New Year fixtures; or
   could it wait until the next scheduled meeting on 18 January
   1990.    I said it was up to them:       but that the Inquiry
   recommendation was "urgent", intended to be put in place by the
   start of the season ie last August, and that I could not advise
   thaar£¥ore anything other than immediate consideration of
   implementation of it.
   2.   Two further questions were put. First, the timing of the
   Final Report.    I advised that we thought about the middle of
   January was most likely. The second point was whether a Home
   Office official would be willing, if necessary, to address the
   sub-committee or full committee. I did not rule this out, saying
   that I was personally always willing to offer assistance if at
   all possible. I added however that I was unsure of the propriety
   of an official from the Home Office attending/addressing elected
   council members and would need to take advice.       The council
   officials may come back on this if they are asked by their
   elected members.

   HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY FINAL REPORT

   I attach a suggested timetable of the Parliamentary events
   leading up to the statement on Monday 29 January.

   As there is no time for conventional CFR copies of the Report
   to be printed Parliamentary Section will have to produce
   copies for use in advance of publication by removing the
   outside covers and placing an embargo label over the
   publication date (so that details are embargoed until the
   Home Secretary stands u p ) .

   However, in the absence of proper CFRs Ministers may wish to
   consider whether in fact we should issue CFRs to the press in
   any numbers at all.  There could be points of order raised
   before the Statement about their precise status and also
   adverse comment in the House about the pains evidently taken
   to inform journalists in advance of Members themselves.
   Whatever is decided we should, I suggest, lay the report
   before Parliament slightly before CFRs are given to the press.

   We have also considered whether we need to make advance copies
   of the Report available for parties to the Inquiry, most of
   whom are based in Sheffield.  However, in view of the fact
   that the contents of the Final Report are less dedicated to
   the circumstances of the disaster itself than the interim
   report was, we have agreed with the inquiry team that making
   courtesy final copies available to these parties on
   publication will be perfectly adequate.

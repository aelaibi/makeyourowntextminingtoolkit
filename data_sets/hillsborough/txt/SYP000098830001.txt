THE IMPORTANT POINTS.



EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURE

ONE OFOUR MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS IS TO SAFELY EVACUATE

THE STADIUM SHOULD THE NF.F.D ARISE.   THIS CAN ONLY BE

ACHIEVED IF ALL OFFICERS KNOW THEIR SPECIFIC DUTIES .     IF

AN EMERGENCY SITUATION SHOULD ARISE, WHEREBY IT MAY BE

NECESSARY TO EVACUATE ALL OR A SECTION OF THE STADIUM, THE

FOLLOWING MESSAGE WILL BE PASSED OVER THE STADIUM PUBLIC

ADDRESS SYSTEM:-

" THE ATTENDANCE OF MR MEADOWS IS URGENTLY REQUIRED AT

POLICE CONTROL"

THIS WILL BE YOUR SIGNAL TO TAKE UP THE SPECIFIC POSITIONS

AND DUTIES DESIGNATED TO YOU AND STAND BY THERE.

IF IT IS NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT THE EVACUATION A MESSAGE

TO THAT EFFECT WILL BE PASSED OVER THE PUBLIC ADDRESS

SYSTEM AND THE STADIUM WILL BE EVACUATED.     IF WE AS POLICE

OFFICERS ACT IN A PROFESSIONAL? DISCIPLINED AND ORDERLY

MANNER WE WILL SET AN EXAMPLE TO THE PUBLIC WHICH WILL

GIVE THEM CONFIDENCE AND PREVENT PANIC.

IF, AFTER BEING PLACED ON A STAND-BY -SITUATION IT TRANSPIRES

THAT THEREIS NO NEED FOR AN EVACUATION THEN THE FOLLOWING
           MESSAGE WILL BE PASSED:-

           " MR MEADOWS IS NO LONGER REQUIRED AT POLICE CONTROL"

                       will say as follows

1.   I was born on the 6th May 1944.



2.   My present position with Symas is Standards and Efficiency

     Officer.         I joined the ambulance service approximately 23
     years ago,       where I initially worked in control which was

     based at Corporation Street, Sheffield.                  I generally carried
     out administrative duties and thereafter became the personal

     assistant to the chief ambulance officer at that point in
     time, Mr Kennedy.           I then transferred with ambulance HQ to

     Netherr^dge       Hospital     in    Sheffield,        and   after     a    further
     period     of    time    I applied      for    and   obtained    a post          as   a

     Liaison Officer at the Royal Hallamshire hospital.                           After

     approximately       8 years        in   this    post    I    applied       for    and
     obtained the post of Standards and Efficiency Officer, where
     I am based at Rotherham.


3.   My basic roll as Standards and Efficiency Officer is to act

     as   a    link    between    the    various     hospitals       and    ambulance

     services within the Symas area.                I am one of four Standards

     and Efficiency Officers within Symas.                       I normally work a
     five day a week because Standards and Efficiency Officers

     are initially responsible for all outpatient transport ( a
     very major       task)    which only      operates      between Monday            and
     Friday.



4.   I was not on duty on Saturday 15th April 1989.                         I was at
home when I received a telephone call from Control asking me

to go immediately to the Royal Hallamshire hospital.                       I was
informed that there had been an incident at Hillsborough.                      I

immediately put on my uniform and drove straight to the

Royal hallamshire.           I initially thought that an excercise

was taking place, but during my journey to the hospital I

tuned into Radio Sheffield and heard that the football match
had been stopped.



As    I   approached    the   casualty      department     via    Claremount
Crescent,      I saw a number of ambulance vehicles with their

emergency lights turned on.           To avoid any confusion I drove

into A road at the hospital and parked on the outpatients

ambulance apron.        I ran into casualty and noticed a number

of casualties being ferried into the hospital at that time.
It    should    be   noted    that   there    are   two   entrances        into

casualty; the first entrance is the normal casualty entrance
whilst door 10,        known as triage is used            for access into

casualty when ever there is a major incident.



I was filled in with details of the Hillsborough incident by

some      police   officers   who    were    at   the   Royal    Hallamshire

hospital.       I telephoned Control to inform them that I had
arrived and spoke to                         who is a fellow Standards

and    Efficiency      Officer.                         asked    me   if    the

ambulance vehicles leaving the Royal Hallamshire could be

mobilised so as to stand by at Netherthorpe Parkway because
at that point in time no ambulances were required back at
Hillsborough.                       asked me to keep in touch with him

on a regular basis, and I tried to telephone him every 30
minutes or so.



I recall a large number of hospital staff always waiting at

the     casualty      entrance when    ever ambulances      arrived    with

further casualties.           The whole exercise was extremely well

organised, and there was never any delay in transferring the

casualties      in to hospital        from   ambulances.     Whenever    an

ambulance       crew    had    offloaded     some   casualties    at    the
hospital, I made a point of speaking to every crew to inform

them to make          sure all equipment     was put back into their
vehicles, and         that they were then to travel to Netherthorpe

Park and wait         on standby.     I also made a point of informing

each crew to radio Control when they had arrived at that
location.



As the number of ambulance vehicles arriving at the hospital
began to slow down,           I recall telephoning                      at

Control to ascertain whether there would be any transfers of

casualties from the Northern General or Royal Hallamshire

hospitals.      I then went down to the admissions office within

the hospital to find out whether some patients required a

transfer to any other hospital.


At a later stage,                        informed me that a couple of

casualties with minor injuries from Hillsborough would be
taken    down    to    Barnsley     District   General     Hospital.     I
proceeded to inform the sister                    in charge on the triage

door,    and also Doctor Egbrook,              a consultant anaesthetist,
that we were not expecting to bring anymore casualties from

Hillsborough to the Royal Hallamshire.                      It should be noted

that I continually contacted                                  on the internal

radio system in the hospital known as the monarch system

which enabled me to make direct contact with Control.



I then began telephoning a number of wards,                        in particular
FI,     F2    and   Gl,    to    see    whether    any   patients        required

transfer.       I then spoke to                             again and informed
him that I would be moving round to B road reception and

that I would stay at this location until I was satisfied
that    all    patients     who     required    transferring        had been   so

transferred.        When    I arrived at reception I contacted

              again and requested some vehicles                   for transfers.

These vehicles arrived in a few minutes, and I proceeded to
organise the removal of a number of patients off different

wards, at all times liaising with the ward sister.                         During

this time,       an ambulance man informed me that Control had

been    trying      to    contact      me   because   one    of    the   hospital

doctors, I believe Doctor Crosby, had informed Control that

he had not seen anybody from the ambulance service at the
Royal Hallamshire.              I immediately went down to see Doctor

Crosby and brought him up to date with the situation, namely

that no more casualties from Hillsborough were expected.


After I informed                             that all transfers had been
taken, he gave me an up date on the Hillsborough casualties.

At the same time, he notified me of a large fight going on

at Ecclesfield with a possible number of casualties - the

incident had nothing to do with Hillsborough.



When I arrived back at casualty,                    there were a number of

hospital staff milling around,                 and I was informed that a
number      of    bodies    from      Hillsborough       were   expected     to    be

brought up to the hospital mortuary.                      I did consider this

rather peculiar because whenever I had previously spoken to

                        he informed me that no bodies were to be
conveyed by the ambulance service at that stage.                            I then
contacted                        , informing him that I would proceed

to   the    hospital       mortuary     to    ascertain     what      was   exactly
happening        and pass      this    information back         to him.     When I

arrived at the Mortuary, there were two police officers in

attendance and a number of hospital staff.                      I asked them for

an up date on the position, and they replied by saying that
they were waiting for a number of bodies to arrive although

no one was sure were the information had originated from.                           I

informed everybody at the mortuary that no bodies would be
arriving by ambulance.


After approximately 15 minutes I said I would go back to the

porters lodge on B Road and contact                                    to confirm

that   no    bodies      had    arrived.        Everybody       present     at    the
hospital mortuary then quickly dispersed.                      I contacted
            and    he   informed       me    that   he   had    had   Mr    Qureshi
          (Consultant at Rotherham District General hospital) on the
          telephone enquiring as to whether any casualties would be

          transferred from the Royal Hallamshire down to the R.D.G.H.

          I checked out this enquiry with casualty,                  I believe with

          Doctor Crosby, and he replied by saying they were more than

          able to cope.       I then telephoned casualty department at the

          R.D.G.H and informed them that the Royal Hallamshire would
          not be transferring any patients.



â€¢   14 . I believe I then went back to the administrative office of

          the Royal Hallamshire,          and I was informed that they were
          experiencing problems       trying to contact the police incident

          room.      They wanted an up date on the number of Hillsborough

          casualties and the extent of injuries.               I was able to leave

          a message for the police to contact the Royal Hallamshire,
          by initially speaking to Control.


    15.   I   was    later    informed      by                         one   of   the

          administrators       at   the    hospital,     that    the   police     had
          telephoned,     but had not provided the information that was

          required.      The situation at the hospital began to ease and

          after     approximately   another      half   hour   I contacted

                     again, who informed me that an ambulance crew could

          be coming to the Royal Hallamshire hospital to collect one
          body - there was only one fatality at the Royal Hallamshire

          at that point in time.          The body was to be collected on the
          authority of the coroner, and I proceeded down to the charge
          nurse     at   casualty   who   was    in   charge    of   the   temporary
        mortuary in the plaster room to inform him of the situation.

        Within   minutes       the    ambulance   crew    arrived     to    take      the
        fatality.


16 . I also received a message from                                   that Mr Don

        Page wanted to speak to Tony Mapplebeck, who is the General

        Manager at Sheffield District Health Authority.                I was aware

        that Mr Mapplebeck was with all the hospital administrators

        within   the    administrative wing.          When     I arrived         at   the

        administrative       wing,     I   noticed   that    Mr   Mapplebeck          was
        already giving an interview to a television crew.                         I was

        able to leave a message with                                   who is the

        publicity officer for the Trent Regional Health Authority,

        requesting     Mr   Mapplebeck     to   contact   Mr   Page   as     soon      as

        possible.      Very little happened after this point in time in
        connection      with    the    Hillsborough       incident,        and    after
        telephoning                        once again at approximately 2100
        hours, I left the hospital and went home.

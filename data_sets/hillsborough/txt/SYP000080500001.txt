               We    travelled             directly          to       Sheffield,          but    encountered                traffic        delays         as

we    approached                Sheffield.                    The    coach          driver          in       fact       made    a    diversion             in

order       to    avoid             more       delays.




We    arrived             in    Sheffield                at    2.20pm          (1420)          and       the       coach       was    parked          on    a

long       straight             road       along          with       other          coaches,             approximately                one       mile

from       the    ground.




Myself          and                       walked          directly             to    the       ground.              As    I walked             along       I

noticed          lots          of    fans       d r i n k<iinn gg    at        is a n d
                                                                           pireii                  sitting          on    walls.           I    saw

Police          stopping             fans       who       were       drinking             and       preventing             them       from

carrying          on       to       the    ground             unless       they          got       rid       of    their       beer.




Everyone          en       route          to    the       ground          seemed          happy          and       everyone          was

s ingi n g .




I arrived             at       the    ground             at    the    Leppings                Ln    end       at    about       2.40pm          (1440).




There       was       a    huge       mass        of      people          in    front          of       me    so    we    just       joined          the

back       of    the       mass\^There                        was    no    form          of    que^jj^iq^t               the    turnstiles.                I

noticed          several             Polic\          Officers             on    foot          and       about       four       or    five       on

horseback,                trying          to    control             the    crowd.              I was          starting          to    be       crushed

as    we    got       nearer          to       the       turnstiles,                so    I    said          to    my    cousin       to       come    out

of    the       crowd          and    stand          a        bit    back      and        wait          till       the    crowd       dispersed a

little.          We       then       moved        to          the    side       and       waited             five       minutes.




At    about       2.50pm             (1450),                   I was       waiting             I    saw       a    side    gate       to       the

ground          being          openedPXqd                the    Police          eject          a    s u p p o r t e r.         As    they       did

this       about          twenty          fans       pfcvshed        through             the       gate       and       into    the    ground.




The    Police             then       managed             to    close       the       gate          as    a    cordon       was       formed
                                                                                                                                                                                   PAGE               3
                                                                                                                                                                                   S2476

           preventing                      anymore                fans       entering.              I    then          saw          a       Polite             horse          near          to

           this          gate             which          began          to    kick          out    at    fans.              Because                   of       this       I       jumped

           over          a    fence             which             led    to       the       river       embankment                      to       avoid             being          kicked.




           We    eventually                         climbed             back       over       the       fence          and          my          cousin             said       that          the

           side          gate             hacr^jeen               opened          again       and       that          we       should                go     through               it.           It
cC^$L C—
           was       a       blue          concertina                   type       gate       that       was          open.                 I    thought             at       first

 QnJsiJ.   that          it       had          been          forced          open       and       I was          reluctant                      to     go      through.


                                                                             P<3U^      UV^              0        C

           However,                   I    saw          the P o l i c e           beckoning             us       to    come             t h r o u g h,             which          we       did.

           As    I walked                      through             I went          to       get    my    ticket                out          of       my     back         pocket,                but

           the       Policeman                      said          to    just       come       through.                 So       I       didn't              hand         my       ticket

           in    at          all.




           I    could             ^Xe          lots          of    fans       climbing             on    top          of       the          turnstiles                   and

           entering                   the^sround                   that       way.           There       was          still             a       huge        mass         of       people

           at    the          turnstile                      area.




           As    I       walked                through             the       gate       I    started             to    look             for          SB'       entrance                to       the

           stand.                 I       saw       a    large          s8'       over       the    tunnel             entrance                      that          led    to          the

           standing                   area          in       Leppings             Ln.        It    was       our       intention                       to      get       positioned

           so    that             we       would             be    behind          the       goal.           I    knew          that             the        tunnel            led          to

           that          area.


                                                        cfit T .
           As    I walked                      along          the       tunnel          I    had    free          movement                      and       came       to       a       halt       at

           the       mouth                of    the          tunnel          as    it       opened       onto          the          standing                   area.              I    didn't

           see       any          Police                or    stewards             at       this    point.                 I    stood                for       a    few       minutes

           at    the          back             of       the       terraces           and      decided             to       push             my       w a y x< T o r w a r d           to    the

           front             of       the       pen          because          I    thought          it       would             be       less           crowdeiKat                     the

           front.                 So                          and       myself          began       pushing                forward.                       We       were       in       pen

t h r ee"I       As    I    got          half          way    down          the       pen    I    realised                that          the       crush       was

getting          tighter             so       I    turned          around             to    tell       ________           to       go    back,          but       he

w a s n ’t      there.




I also          realised             that          I    couldn't             force          myself          backwards                   and       because             of

the       pressure             of    people             behind          I was          forced          forward                to    the       front          of       the

pen       and    was       about          6       yards       from          the       perimeter             fence.                 Although             it    was

uncomfortable                   the       crush          was       bearable                and    I    decided                to    stay          there       as

the       teams       had       already                come       out       onto       the       pitch          and       the       match             was    about

to    start.




The       match       started             at       3.0pm          (1500)          and       the       crush          got       a    lot       worse.

People          about          me    were          crying          and       pleading             to       the       Police             for       help.           I

saw       people       trying             to       climb          the       perimeter             fence.                 One       lad       panicked             so

much       that       he       pulled             himself          up       and       ran    across             people's                heads          to    get       to

the       fence.           I saw          people             fall       down          in    front          of       me,       but       I    couldn't             do

anything.              I was             pinned          down       and       because             I was             scared          to       go       down    I

forcibly          pushed             my       hands          upwards          so       that       I    could             grab       hold          of    someone

if    I    did    feel          myself             falling          down.




People          were       still          climbing                over       my       head       to    get          out,       it       was       getting

more       difficult                to    breath             and    the       pressure                of    people             was          building          up

behind          me.        I    couldn't                move.           I    realised             that          I    couldn't                go       forward          so

I    decided          to       try       and       make       my    way       backwards                to       the       tunnel.                 I    had    to

get       out.




As    I approached                   a    barrier             that          was       in    the       middle             of    the          pen.        I    got

squashed          ag a i n s t ^ a ^ ~ ? ~ r 3 t s h         barrier.                 I was       facing             towards                the       tunnel          and

I    was     doubled            over          this       barrier.                 A    man       then       came          up       and       pushed

everyone          back          and       pulled             me    under          the       barrier.                 I    eventually                   made       my

                                                                                                                                                           S2476

          way       to    the    back     of    the       terrace             and    was       about       to    be       hoisted             up       into         the

          seating          area       above,        when    I       noticed          that       I was       near          the       tunnel,                so   I

          made       my    way    through           the    tunnel.




          I    cannot          recall     seeing          anybody             in    the    tunnel          but       once          through             the

          tunnel          I saw       lots     of    people          dazed          and    shocked          and       sitting                about.             As       I

          came       out       there     was    four       men       behind          me    who       all    collapsed                   as    they          came

          out.           The    Police        rushed       over          to    them       and       began       helping             them.             A

          Policewoman             began        pumping          a    man's          chest       and    was       shouting                "Breathe               you

          bastard".




          I    leant       on    the     wall       shocked          and       dazed.           People          about          me       were          crying.

          A    man       was    laid     on    the    wall          beside          me,    who       had    difficulty                   breathing                  but

          someone          ran    over        and    lifted          his       chin       and       assisted          him          in    breathing.                      I

          think          the    four     men    who       followed             me    out       of    the    tunnel             died.              I    have         no

          idea       what       they     looked       like,          I was          still       completely                shocked             and          upset.

          I    then       realised        that       my    cousin             wasn't       with       me.        Just          then          he       walked

          around          the    corner        to    me.




          As    a     result      of     the    crush       I had             aches       in    my    left       arm       as       it       had       been

          pinned          down.




          I    cannot          remember        what       time       I    left       the       ground.           I    saw          ambulances

          outside          and    I     saw    the    first          fire          engine       arrive.              We    walked             to       a    phone

          box       and    telephoned                                                     > our      way    back          to       the       coach.             As       I

          walked          out    of     the    ground X s a w                 amart        who       was    visibly                upset          and       who


ov.       was       s c rearr|i n 9 '    run    UP          a       Policeman             and       punch       him.           I    carried                on

          walking,             looking        away.

          I    feel       that    the     emergency             services             were       slow       in    reacting                to       the

             disaster.              It       was    a       long        time    before          the    ambulances             or    fire       brigade

             arrived.           Also,          as       I    had        been    sitting          at    the    back       of    the       stand       for

             about       ten    -    fifteen                minutes           before       more       Police      Officers              arrived.




             I    feel    lh><ongly            that          the        Po\ice organistation                      outside          the       ground       was

             poor.        People             couldn't          get        out       of    the    way    of    the    horses             at    the

 t           turnstiles.




             I also          believe          that          someone           should       have       been    directed             to    stand       by    the

             entrance          of    the       tunnel          and        diverting             fans    to    the    outer          pens.




             Also,       I    saw    P o l i ce         pushing           fans       back       into    the       pens    initially             as    the

             tragedy          began,          and       as    people           pleaded          for    help       some    Police             just    looked

             away    and       didn't          know          what        to    do.        However,          further       along          the    pen       there

             was    Police          helping             to    g<t        people          out.




             I also          heard       a    Police          Officer           swear       at    the       man    who    lost          his    two

       \     daughters          in       the       tragedy,              as    he    shouted          for    help    to       the       Officer,

            Further to the statement                  I made on 16th June           1989   (160689), when       I

            spoke about a Policeman swear at the man who had lost his two

            daughters           in the tragedy at the time                I was standing      in Pen 3 near to

            the front not too far away from the dividing fence between Pens 3 and



            Around kick off time                I cannot be too certain a man to my left started

            to sc ream and shout at a Policeman who was on the perimeter track,                                     he

            carried on for sometime                  pleading to the Policeman.               I could not hear

            his exact words but it was obviously about the crush and that he could

            see his daughters were                  in trouble.      He continued to scream and shout

            but the Policeman ignored him.                    I cannot        identify or describe the

            Policeman he was just one of quite a few there.

            I    later realised from seeing him on television and in the papers that
                                                                        PAGE

       , the man who had been shouting was Mr HICKS whose two daughters died in

   #     the crush.

         I lost sight of Mr HICKS after this because I was more concerned with

         helping myself to get out of the crush.

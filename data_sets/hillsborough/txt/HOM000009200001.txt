                 But Mr Duckenfield's counsel, William Clegg,    Links to top UK stories
                 QC, successfully argued that a new trial, which are at the foot of the
                 might not take place for several months,        page.________________
                 would put unfair pressure on the former officer
                 and his family.

                 He also said that there was no realistic
                 prospect of a conviction if a new trial were to
                 take place.

                 Outside court the chairman of the Hillsborough
                 Family Support Group, Trevor Hicks, said
                 although the families were "bitterly
                 disappointed" the decision brought an end to
                 the court proceedings for them.

                 "We said we would be bound by the verdict,"
                 he said.

                 "We were not looking for scapegoats. We've
                 put our case in a court of law and we have
                 nearly won. We have not lost."

                 Mr Hicks added: "We
                 think we are totally
                 exonerated in what we
                 have done."

                 The prosecution
                 claimed the two
                 policemen were
                 responsible for the
                 deaths because they
                 ordered the opening of
                 an exit gate to relieve Hicks: "We were not looking

                 turnstiles, without
                 blocking off a tunnel leading to the already
                 overcrowded Leppings Lane terraces.

                 Mr Clegg argued that the tragedy was
                 "unprecedented, unforeseeable and unique"
                 and that Mr Duckenfield, who did not give
                 evidence, was not responsible.

                 After his acquittal on Friday, Mr Murray, of
                 Pontefract, West Yorkshire, said he had
                 "suffered deeply" over the past 11 years but

                 his suffering could not compare with that of
                 the victims' families.

                 The case is estimated to have cost a total of
                 £4m in prosecution and defence costs.

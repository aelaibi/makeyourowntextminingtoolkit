              trouble at all            either         before      or a f t e r      the    game.

              I reported on d u t y            at D o n c a s t e r       D H Q at    S.30am       on S a t u r d a y ,     15 April,

              was     f o l l o w e d by a    p a c k e d meal      taken        in the      stand before             deploying

              onto     the s t r e e t s .     I don't          remember         a great         deal     about      the briefing,

              it was      the    usual       format       describing          who     was    g oing w h e r e        etc.       I do       '

them a r r i v e d w i t h o u t       tickets         and tried              to    get       in t h e n he       could well

be w r o n g in that            assumption.

About    11am,     my     serial         w a l k e d f r o m the          ground             to    the    roundabout at the

end of L e p p i n g s      Lane,        w h e r e we w ere           deployed               in    pairs at various            point

a r o u n d the    roundabout.                 I was        paired       up w i t h PC 9 1 9 Evans and we

c o n c e n t r a t e d on the       shops        leading          just       from       the       roundabout       to

Penistone Road            for      fear        of the         fans    smashing               windows,       and    causing

trouble at a            ’Ho t    Pie     and Pastie              Shop*        tha t      was       open    just    before      the

turn off to N i a g a r a S p o r t s                Ground.

There w e r e n ' t      many      fans        a r o u n d at this            time,          but    I soon noti c e d that

certain fans            in g r o u p s       of 2 or 2 wer e               walking            b a c k w a r d s and forwards

from L e p p i n g s     L ane,        past     us,        up t o w a r d s    W a d s ley B r i d g e          and back down

again,     as k i n g     other        f ans    for        tickets       and        had a n y o n e        any spare      tickets

or tickets         for     sale.

It soon became             evident           that as          time       passed and               the     crowds   got    bigger

there were         even more            fans       who      ha d t r a v e l l e d        to the          game without

tickets.

The m o o d of       the     fan s      prior         to     the    game      was       jovial,           and neither myself

or PC Evans          received           any       abuse       f rom a n y          of   the       fans.      We had to speak

to quite a few             fan s       who     were walking               towards            the        ground   carrying       cans

of beer an d         lager.            These         fans wer e          told       that          if they went any

further      t hen t n e y        probably would                   not    be a l l o w e d          into    the ground and

thsy a g r e e d     to    go    to     a    garage          just     round         the      corner w here acc o r d i n g

to PC Kent,          who     was       outside         the      gara g e ,         they      sat        on the wall and

 consu m e d wha t        beer       they      had     left        before          walking          up Leppi n g s Lane

 towards     the     ground.            There         was     also       quite          a few fans          sat on             wall

opposite       the      road      to    us,       drinking           beer,         etc.,          but    there was no

 trouble w i t h a n y          of     these         people.

The     crowds     got     bigger           and      bigger and           quite          a    lot were          leaving   it

 late,     in my      estimation,               to    get      into      the       ground and             get    comfortable

 before       the s c h e d u l e d      kic k      off    time.

 Indeed         I remember         a group          of o lder         fans       in their- 30*s             and 4 0 * s asking

 me,    about 2.30pm,              where       the G ate         Inn was.              I t old them an d awa y they

 w a l k e d towa r d s      the     pub,      in the         opposite           direction            to the      ground with

 only half an hour                 before        k ick     off.        It was           obvious        a lot      of the      fans

 had bee n d r i n k i n g ,            and myself         a n d PC E v a n s           ha d   to stop t h e m using                the

 rear a l l e w a y        behind        the   shops       as     a toilet,             this     being      the    first

 s e c l u d e d spot       they        had after         getting          off     their       buses       on C i a y w h e e l s

 Lane.          A^ .3 pm a r i v e d      there       wer e      still      a few         fans       making     their way to

  the ground,             most     of    these      running         or      jogging,           but    nownere       near     the

  large       amount       there        had    been       some    10 m i n u t e s        previously.

  All    our       serial        started       to wal k       up L e p p i n g s        Lane,        as   our     brief was         to

  wait       there    on a bus           until       half     time         when       we w e r e     to go to C i a y w h e e l s

  Lane       for a hot           meal,     if t here        was       no    need       for     us    to    remain there             on

  standby.

  I d i d n ’t have          a    personal          radio       but    I can          remember         hearing        somebody

  e l s e 's as we w a l k e d           up L e p p i n g s      Lane.           We     ha d b e e n jo i n e d by other

  officers and              one    t o l d me       fans      had     broken          a gate         dow n at     the L e p p i n g s

  Lane       end of       the     ground.           We all        started         to     run towards            the    ground as

  assistance           was        required.          T his       would      be    s h o r t l y after 3pm.

   On a r r i v a l    at    the        ground      I cannot          remember            if there were            still a n y

   large        numbers      of     fans       outside        the     turnstiles,               but we <.,_re o , i g ^ n - l l y

   fo r m e d      into a     large       cordon outside                 the      ground        next      to the      road.         I

   don't        k now why,         nobody        said what          was      happening.               Little      bits     of

      information          filtered           through       tha t     there        had       b e e n some trouble an d

      near    to    the    fence        ne:<t to the            river.           I knew        immediately            some   of

these     people       were          dead.         There       were       people         lying       there w i t h t heir

eyes     still     open,         clothes missing,                      blu e     in    colour        and ha v i n g        nad cowel

an d b l a d d e r m o v e m e n t s .           I have        seen        enough        dea d bodies          in my service

to k n o w s o m e t h i n g         really         terrible           had      happened.            We were         f o r m e d up in

a cordon by          Inspector               Sykes          at this        location,            to guard t h e s e          bodies,

facing      towards         Gate           C . T h e        gates      kept      being        opened and            other

policemen          kep t     bringing              m or e    pe o p l e    out.         S ome were         dead,         others   were

injured.           They were               kep t     sep a r a t e ,      awaiting           ambulances         which       by    now

were     arriving           at       the    scene.           The     road       was     kept      clear     for      t h e m to

arrive,         pick    up a n d           depart.           I still            had    no     idea what        had       happened

 inside      the    ground.                I estimated              there        were       about     12 to     15 bod ies

 right      b e h i n d me.

 A short        time       later       the       Liverpool             f ans     started         leaving       the        ground,

 hurled abuse              at    us,        saying          it was        all    our     fault       for   opening          the

 gate.         I d i d n ’t e v e n          k n o w what          they      were       t a l k i n g about,         but what

  could     I say,         they might               be      right,        I didn't           know.      By now           there were

  lots    of    injured          outside            G ate C a n d m e d i c a l              teams    had a r r i v e d      in

  response         to a      radio          call.           Folice        vans        were    used to       f e r r y some        of the

  i n j u r e d to h o s p i t a l .

  As the        crowds       built          up     outside          the L e p p i n g s        Lane     end,    a

  superintendent                 whom        I did not          know,          took      10 of us away              to    gen t l y move

  the     crowds       to    the       o ther        side      of    the        bridge        and stop an y o n e

  approaching           the          ground without                 good        reason.          What    a futile          exercise

   that was.           As       we    tried         to m ove        people,           m ore    came     out b e h i n d us,

   fill i n g     in the         empty          spaces.           Fans       were      coming        up to me         looking       for

   their       sons,      asking           me    w h a t was        happening.                I coulun         * tell       them,

   d i d n ’t know.             I made          something           up so        t hat       it a p p e a r e d e v e r y t h i n g was

   under       control.

   I felt as         if     I should               be d o i n g      something           mor e     to help          the    injured,

 I never a c t u a l l y w e n t           into    the       ground      u ntil    we w e r e all       called       in for

 de-briefing           in the N o r t h St a n d .             I w a s n ’t a l l o c a t e d a b o d y to deal

 wit h o u t s i d e     the    grou n d .         I didn't        know     the    full      extent        of what       had

  h a p p e n e d until       I saw        the   news    on TV         l ater    that     night.       I felt       so

  helpless,         in t hat        I ’d b e e n    there and           d i d n ’t feel as        though         I ’d done

  enough to help.                I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r     seeing          any Club Stewards                on my

  arri v a l   at    the      grou n d .

  I r e m ember      thinking when moving                     fans      away      fro m the       s cene     that we had

  to be v e r y      careful          and     d i p l o m a t i c as    one      slight     i n c ident      could have

  sparked       off a         riot,    w h i c h we w o u l d n ’t h a v e         been a b l e to         handle.

  I saw      Inspector          Harry Whits             at   the    de-brief.            He tol d me that            his

/serial        u s u a l l y got      the. jo b of           putting      the     crowd      in the     different          pens

  at the r ear           of    the    goal       mouth,       working       f r o m the     outside        to the

   centre,      but      for    s ome       reason      h e ’d b e e n    t o l d to      let    the   fans       find their

   own level,          on thi s       occasion,          resulting            in too m a n y      going         into the

   area     immediately             behind       the    goal.          I c o u l d tell      he was        really

   distressed          by w h a t     had happened.

   The     p e r sonal     radios          I could hear were               going        non-stop.          If    I'd had one

   I w o u l d n ’t hav e        been able          to get         on air,        but    the n a g a i n     I w o u ldn't

   have     had a n y t h i n g       to    say.

   Wha t    caused       this        incident?           I c a n ’t r e a l l y say,           too m a n y

   circumstances              all     happening          at -the sam e           time,    at    the w r o n g     time and

    place.       How many wo ul d                have    died      outside        had the       gate not         been o p e n e d

   Who     knows,        it m a y     have       been more         than    died     inside the ground.

   Perhaps       fans w i t h o u t         tickets          should      hav e    been s e g r e g a t e d from those

    with tickets              before       they     got a n y w h e r e     near    the      ground.         if only       it

    had gone        so    s m o o t h l y as       1988.       I t ’s a d a y      I ’ll never         forget!

           y e a r ’s Semi Final           when    I was      on duty      on L e p p i n g s Lane,         w here      I saw no

            trouble at all         either         before      or after         the   game.

            I reported on d u t y at D o n c a s t e r DHG at 8 . 3 0 a m                    on S a t u r d a y , 15 April,

           We     travelled by P o l i c e        T r a n s i t V a n to H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m where           the

           was      followed by a p a c k e d meal            taken       in the       s t a n d before       deploying

           onto the streets.                I d o n ’t remember a great                   deal    about     the briefing,

           it was the usual           format        d e s c r i b i n g who was        g o i n g w here     etc.        I do

 About    11am,        my serial        walked       f r o m the         ground     to     the   roundabout at the

 end of L e p p i n g s       Lane,     w here we were             deployed         in     pairs at various           point

a r o u n d the       r oundabout.           I was     paired        up w i t h PC         9 1 9 Evans And we

 conc e n t r a t e d on the         shops     leading        just       f r o m the       roundabout      to

Penistone         Road     for    fear       of the       fans     s m a s h i n g w i n dows,    and    causing

t rouble at a           ’Hot Pie and P a s t i e             Shop*       that      was    open just      before      the

turn off        to N i a g a r a S p o r t s    Ground.

There -weren’t m a n y           fans a r o u n d       at    this       time,      but    I soon noticed that

 certain fans           in groups        of S or 3 w ere w a l k i n g                ba c k w a r d s and forwards

from L e p p i n g s Lane,           past    us,     up t o w a r d s      W a d s l e y Bridge and back down

again,        asking     other       fans    for     tickets and             had a n y o n e an y spare tickets

or tickets         for sale.

It soon became             evident       that as        time       passed       and      the   crowds    got bigger

there were        even m o r e        fans who        had t r a v e l l e d . t o        the   game without                '.

tickets.                  °

The m o o d of the            fans    prior to the            game was          jovial,        and neither myself

'or PC Evans          r e c e i v e d any a b u s e     fro m a n y        of the        fans.    We    had to speak

to quite a few fans who were w a l k i n g                          towards        the     ground      carrying      cans

of beer and           lager.         These     fans were           t old    that      if they went any

furt h e r then t h e y         probably would               not    be a l l o w e d      into the ground and

they a g r e e d to go to a garage                    just     round.the           corner where a c c ording

to PC Kent,           who was        outside       the garage,             they    sat     on the wall and

consumed what           beer     t hey had         left    be f o r e w a l k i n g      up L e p pings Lane

towards       the ground.             T here was       also        q uite     a few fans sat on the wall

opposite        the    road to us,           drinking        beer,         etc.,    but    there was      no

The ..crowds got b i g g e r and bi g g e r a n d q u i t e a                      lot were       leaving      it

 Indeed      I r e m e m b e r a group^ of older, fans                    in their 3D* s an d 40*s asking

 the ground,          mos t     of these       running       or j o g ging,          but    nowhere         near the

 large amount           there       had been some           10 m i n u t e s     previously.

 All    our serial           s t a r t e d to walk     up L e p p i n g s       Lane,      as   our brief was to

 wait    there     on a bus          until     half    time w h e n we were                to go to Ciayw h e e l s

 Lane    For a hot          meal,      if there was          no need           for   us to      remain there on

 I d i d n ’t have a personal                radio     but       I can     r e m ember      hearing         somebody

offic e r s a n d o n e . t o l d me fans             had    b r o k e n a gate down at the Leppings

Lane     end of the           ground.        We all     started           to    run towards the              ground as

a s s i s t a n c e wa s    required.          This w a u l d      be s h o r t l y a fter 3pm.

On arrival         at      the g r o u n d I cannot          remember           if there were           still       any

formed      into a         large     cordon o u t s i d e     the     ground         next .to the           road.     I

d o n ’t know why,           no b o d y said what          was    happening.             Li t t l e    bits of

Our    serial was           t hen t aken towards            the a c c e s s      road outside G ate C on

the -attached map.                 As we a p p r o a c h e d ,    I saw        people      lying on the ground,

near    to the      fence       next     to the      river.         I knew       i m m e d iately some of

these p e o p l e . w e r e     dead.       There were           people        lying there w i t h their

  a cordon by I n s p e c t o r S y k e s at this                    location,           to guard these bodies,

  facing towa r d s G ate C.                  The     gates kept          being        o p e n e d a n d other

  p o l i c e m e n kept      b r i n g i n g m ore      people      out.        Some      were    dead,      others were

  injured.         T h e y wer e kept          separate,           awaiting         ambulances            w h i c h by now

 wer e a r r i v i n g at        the scene.              The    road was         kep t     clear for         them to

 arrive,       pick up and depart.                       I still       had no       ide a wha t had happened

 inside      the ground.               I estimated             there w e r e a b o u t       12 to         15 bodies
 right      be h i n d me.

 A short      time       later the L i v e r p o o l            fans    started          leaving      the    ground,

 where      the    first       people      they saw were               us,      guarding      bodies.         They

 hurled a buse at              us,     saying      it was all           our      fault     for opening the

 gate.       I d i d n ’t even know what                   they were          talking       about,         but what

 could      I say,       they m i g h t      be   right,         I d i d n ’t know.           By now there were

 lots of inju r e d outs i d e Gate C and m e d i c a l                           t eams    had a r r i v e d    in

 response         to a radio          call.       Police         vans w e r e      used     to ferry some of t he

injured to hospital.

As    the   crowds        built       up outs i d e        the L e p p i n g s     Lane     end,      a

superintendent               whom.-I did not             know,     took      10 of       us a w a y       to gently move

the    crowds      to the        other      side      of    the    br i d g e    and     stop anyone

approaching            the    gr o u n d w i t h o u t     good    reason.          What     a futile        exercise

that was.          As we       tried      to move          people,      more       came    out be h i n d us,

filling      in the e m p t y spaces.                    Fans were        coming         up to me         looking for

their sons,            as k i n g me what was              happening.            I c o u l d n ’t tell       them,     I

d i d n ’t know.         I made       something          up so that             it a p p e a r e d e v erything was
under    control.

I felt as         if    I s h o u l d be doing           something more              to help the            injured,

instead of m o v i n g          people away,             getting       lots       of a b u s e    in the      process.       '•

I never actually went   into   the   ground until we were   all called in for

de-briefing in the North Stand.      I wasn't allocated a body to deal with

outside the ground.   I didn't know the full extent of what had happened

until I saw the news on TV later that night.     I felt so helpless,   in that

I'd been there and didn't feel as though I'd done enough to help.      I can't

remember seeing any club Stewards on my arrival at the ground.

For the attention of Mr. P.P. Nicholas


Dear Paul,
                                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Disaster
                      When Superintendent Roger Marshall was giving evidence
yesterday, a statement was made to the effect that when the fans
decided to arrive rather late, the layout of the Leppings Lane end
of the ground is such that a disaster was inevitable.                                                                                           My own view
is that the disaster would probably have been avoided if the Police
had not taken the decision to restrict entry to the North stand to
the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
                      There are just under 10,000 seats in the North stand which are
normally served by 8 turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end and 12
turnstiles on Penistone Road.                                                            I understand that on the day of the
game,                  all 12 of the turnstiles on Penistone Road were closed. The
number of turnstiles to serve the North stand at Leppings Lane end
was incraesed from 8 to 10 by opening a gate and extending the fence
with a temporary barrier.                                                      This meant that the number of turnstiles
to serve the West stand seating plus the West terrace was reduced
from 15 to 13, thus adding to the load on those turnstiles.

       However the most important effect of closing the 12 turnstiles
  on Penistone Road was that all 10,000 spectators in the North
  stand had to enter at the Leppings Lane end.      If the normal
  arrangement of 8 turnstiles at Leppings Lane plus 12 turnstiles
  on Penistone Road had been in operation, 6,000 of the ticket
  hdlders would have entered from Penistone Road and 4,000 from the
  Leppings Lane end.    In effect, an extra 6,000 spectators had to
  be catered for which in my view was probably a dominant factor in
  the build-up of a crowd waiting to enter the Leppings Lane end.
       The Police argument will no doubt be that they considered it
  important to avoid confrontation between Liverpool and Nottingham
 F ore st fans.   Referring to the attached drawing it will be seen
  that the 12 turnstiles on Penistone Road which serve the North
  stand are numbered 77 - 88 and they form part of a run of 16 turn­
  stiles, 4 of which normally serve the Kop.      It would have been
  possible to close the 4 turnstiles numbered 73-76 and indeed 8 other
  turnstiles numbered 65-72 without creating excessive difficulties for
  entry to the Kop.    This would have given a separation of 50m between
  the turnstiles used by rival supporters     (turnstiles 64-77).
       Closing turnstiles 65-76 would still have left 28 turnstiles
  serving the Kop   (Nos. 37-64 inclusive).    Each turnstile would have
 had to cope with 750 people    (on average) which is a very easily
  attainable target.    Indeed, there would have been 28 turnstiles
  to serve 21,000 people on the Kop compared with only 23 turnstiles
  to serve 24,500 people in the North stand,the West stand and terrace.
       I should add I was completely unaware of the closure of the
 No r t h stand turnstiles at Penistone Road until I read about it in
  the press on 17 April.     It was certainly not envisaged by this firm,
 n or so far as I am aware, by the Club at the time when we re-organised
  the arrangements at Leppings Lane end in 1985, that the whole of the
 N o r t h stand would have to be catered for by the Leppings Lane turn­
  stiles .
       I am enclosing three copies of the drawing so that two can be
  sent to                       together with a copy of this letter if
 y ou think that appropriate.    If it is decided that the matter
EASTWOOD » PARTNERS                                      SHEET   3




 should be brought to the attention of Lord Justice Taylor
 this could be done by either a representative of the Club or
 I could do it.   If my evidence came first it would be difficult
 to avoid raising this matter as I am bound to be pressed about
 the adequacy of the turnstile arrangements at Leppings L a n e .    It
 may be, of course,   that both the Club's representative and I
 will have to speak on this matter.

For the attention of Mr. P.P. Nicholas


Dear Paul,
                               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Disaster
                      I have had long telephone conversations today, first with
Mr. Bill Carter who is a partner in Corderoy, who you will remember
are the quantity surveyors who deal with the certifying of
grants for the Football Grounds Improvement Trust.                                                                                        I have got
to know Bill fairly well through dealing with him and his staff
on several grounds and he quite often telephones for advice.
The second call was from Chris Whalley of the Football League.
Both were ringing about the same matter.
                  Apparently the Football League have been to France to inspect,
gates which can be opened by radio control and have a magnetic
bolt.                  These are meant for use as perimeter fencing.                                                                        Tfte Football
League representatives had thought that the gates looked rather
flimsey and were doubtful about their ability to resist the design
pressure for a crush barrier as is required by the Green Guide.
The French hacl told the Football League representatives that the
gates were test loaded to 220 kg per metre length.                                                                                     I explained
that 220 kg per metre length is about 480 lbs on a length of 3.3ft.
which is only 150 lbs per foot.                                                            This is only just over one third of

 not be strong enough.
        I also explained that the magnetic bolts must be capable
 of opening when the gate is under full pressure.     If loaded
 to 400 lbs per foot,    the friction force on the bolt would be
 very large indeed and it might have to be a very powerful
 magnet to open the gate.
        I described our own opening device which we have shown
 to be easily operable even when under full crowd pressure.        I
 also stressed that it is very undesirable to have the gates
 opened by remote control.      The judgement as to whether the
 gates need to be opened should be made by someone very close
 to the fence rather than someone sitting in a very remote
 control box which may be at the other end of the ground.        This
 inevitably means a delay whilst they get into radio contact with
 each other, which from my experience of the radio communications
 at Hillsborough could be undesirably longer.      It is much better
 that the gate is operated by the man who has taken the decision
 that it is appropriate to have the gates opened.       With our
 device this can be done very quickly.
        I also pointed out that where the gate is being opened by
 a policeman, people behind can at least see what is going to
 happen and are less likely to be catapulted forward when the
 gate o p e n s .
        Both conversations were quite lengthy,and at the end,I believe
 that both Bill Carter and Chris Whalley had decided that the
 arrangements at Hillsborough    are probably far superior to what
was seen in France in all respects.      I am enclosing an additional
 copy of this letter so that it can be sent to
 if you think it appropriate.

           Dear Mr. Makrell

           SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS INVESTIGATION

           Further to the conversation between us on the evening of the 15th April, I
           now write to confirm that I require a list of all casual employees and
           stewards who were in attendance at the ground on the 15th to be provided as
           soon as possible.

           This list should indicate the job carried out by the named person, e.g.
           senior steward, steward, turnstile operator and the position at which they
           should have been working at the start of the match.

           I also inform you that officers from the Department will be carrying out an
           assessment of the whole of the ground to ascertain compliance with the above
           legislation. All officers will carry identity cards and in particular I
           expect the following officers to be attending:-



           As you are doubtless aware we are being assisted in. this investigation by
           officers from the Health and Safety Executive and I; understand they are
           already known to you but if not they will also have identity cards with
           them.

           I would also like to visit the ground with a delegation from iLiverpool
           (Councillors and Officers) on Tuesday, 18th around mid-day if this is
           possible.




                                                                                                          /Contd

     Dear Sir,

     Safety of Sports Grounds - The Hillsborough Inquiry

     The Council is in the course of preparing its written submission to the
     Public Inquiry into the tragic events at Hillsborough.   As you know, is
     the Inquiry due to recanmence on 15th May.

     I notice fran the former South Yorkshire County Council files that I have
     no information as to the history of pitch perimeter fencing at
     Hillsborough prior to 1st January, 1979.

     I should be grateful if you would supply any information which you have
     on this subject in order to ccnplete my records.

     You will no doubt be aware of the structural problems with the wall
     running fran the lighting tower near the south stand to the turnstiles at
     the Leppings Lane end of the Stadium. Would you please indicate whether
     or not the Club were aware of any problems with the structure of this
     wall prior to the disaster at the Stadium. Thank you for your
     co-operation.

     Yours faithfully,

  Dear Mr. Mackrell,

  Annual Inspection of Sheffield Wednesday Stadium

  I refer to the Inspection which commenced on 10th May, 1989, at which you will
  recall that you produced certain records to my Chief Licensing Officer,
  Mr. Bownes.

  I have had a chance to look superficially at the certificates you have provided
  and also at my records. I have the following preliminary comments to make:-

                                             Dr. Eastwood’s Inspection report dated 2nd August,
                                             1988, but I would also appreciate copies of the 1987
                                             and 1986 certificates. If your records show that
                                             these have been supplied please let me have an
                                             Indication of the date they were supplied so that I
                                             can further check my records.

                            would confirm how long these types of records are
                            kept.

out at the Stadium)

During your conversation with Mr. Bownes you indicated that the turnstiles show
the numbers of people passing through them by both electronic and manual means.
You also mentioned that the turnstiles are occasionally serviced and checked.
Would you please provide details as to when checks were last made on the
turnstiles and what these checks consisted of.

Moving on to a slightly different subject I think you are probably aware that
the Council is, and has for some time, been considering replacing the existing
Safety Certificate issued in respect of your Stadium. This may be an
appropriate opportunity for you to make comments on the existing Certificate if
you feel it appropriate to do so. You will, of course, be supplied with a copy
of the draft new Certificate when it has been prepared.

I am returning with this letter the book of stewards' tickets which you lent to
Mr. Bownes on 10th May - as I understand that they have some-monetary value.

I look forward to hearing from you shortly.

Yours sincerely.

                              would confirm how long these types of records are
                              kept.

During your conversation with Mr. Bownes you indicated that the turnstiles show
the numbers of people passing through them by both electronic and manual means.
You also mentioned that the turnstiles are occasionally serviced and checked.
Would you please provide details as to when checks were last made on the
turnstiles and what these checks consisted of.

Moving on to a slightly different subject I think you are probably aware that
the Council Is, and has for some time, been considering replacing the existing
Safety Certificate issued in respect of your Stadium. This may be an
appropriate opportunity for you to make comments on the existing Certificate if
you feel it appropriate to do so. You will, of course, be supplied with a copy
of the draft new Certificate when it has been prepared.

I am. returning with this letter the book of stewards’ tickets which you lent to
Mr. Bownes on 10th May - as I understand that they have some monetary value.

I look forward to hearing from you shortly.

          Dear Mr. Mackrell

          SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS - SAFETY MANAGEMENT AUDIT

          You will recall no doubt that on Wednesday, 10th May, as part of the annual
          inspection of the Stadium, we commenced a series of interviews with members
          of the staff and management of the Club in order to make an assessment of
          safety management. Though on the 10th we were only able to complete an
          interview with yourself, it is my understanding that you were intending to
          arrange the subsequent interviews at a time and place mutually convenient to
          those concerned. As yet, these interviews have not been arranged and
          consequently I am not in a position to report fully to the City Council on
          the safety management position within your organisation.

         I fully appreciate that the disaster and the judicial inquiry will still be
         to the forefront of your minds, however we must look to the future and I
         would be obliged, therefore, if you could assist me in completing the safety
         management audit by facilitating the arrangement of interviews between
         myself and the following individuals:—

                              Mr. B. Magee      Chairman

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds

 I refer to the ongoing Hillsborough Inquiry and have noted from the evidence
 that apparently works have been done at the grounds without the Council as
 Certificating Authority being notified of them.

^As I am sure you are aware any alterations to the stadium which may affect
 safety must be notified in advance to the Council in accordance with Section 8
 of the 1975 Act and Conditions of theSafety Certificate. Would you please
 confirm as soon as possible what alterations have been made to the stadium about
 which notice has not been given since 1st April 1986.

 In addition I would like to receive your written confirmation that in future no
 such alterations will take place without proper notification being given to the
 Council.

 I 3m sure you will appreciate that it is essential for at least the minimum
 notice to be given so that the Council may look into the safety implications of
 any proposals.

 I look forward to receiving your response to this letter, and also to my letter
 of 22nd May and 8th June, as soon as possible.

 Yours faithfully.__________

 Dear Mr. Mackrell,

 Annual Inspection of Sheffield Wednesday Stadium

 I refer to the inspection which commenced on 10th May, 1989, at which you will
 recall that you produced certain records to my Chief Licensing Officer,
 Mr. Bownes.

 I have had a chance to look superficially at the certificates you have provided
 and also at my records. I have the following preliminary comments to make:-

 engineer of the Stadium)                    file. On 10th May you provided a copy of
                                             Dr. Eastwood’s inspection report dated 2nd August,
                                             1988, but I would also appreciate copies of the 1987
                                             and 1986 certificates. If your records show that
                                             these have been supplied please let me have an
                                             indication of the date they were supplied so that I
                                             can further check my records.

                               would confirm how long these types of records are
                               kept.

out at the Stadium)

During your conversation with Mr. Bownes you indicated that the turnstiles show
the numbers of people passing through them by both electronic and manual means.
You also mentioned that the turnstiles are occasionally serviced and checked.
Would you please provide details as to when checks were last made on the
turnstiles and what these checks consisted of.

Moving on to a slightly different subject I think you are probably aware that
the Council is, and has for some time, been considering replacing the existing
Safety Certificate issued in respect of your Stadium.   This may be an
appropriate opportunity for you to make comments on the existing Certificate if
you feel it appropriate to do so.  You will, of course, be supplied with a copy
of the draft new Certificate when it has been prepared.

I am returning with this letter the book of stewards’ tickets which you lent to
Mr. Bownes on 10th May - as I understand that they have some monetary value.

I look forward to hearing from you shortly.

Yours, sincerely.___________

    Dear Mr. VJebster,

    Re:   Safety of Sports Grounds,

    I am in receipt of your letter dated 6th July 1989, which 1 assume has crossed
    with my letter dated 4th July 1989.

    Ihe alterations to which I think you refer were the fitting of Gate 7 to the ■
    North West terrace and the increasing in size of the gate in the wall to the
    rear "of the West' Stand-in'-'IS8?. Both "these'-tasks;'were undertaken -following' a- :
    request from South Yorkshire Police and a member of the Official Working Party.

    I note the third paragraph of your letter but would wish to point out that the
    club acted in good faith in response to a request free a constituent member of
    the Working Party. I feel that at our next meeting correct lines of
    communication for similar matters need to be clarified.

    With regard to your letter dated 22nd May 1989:-

    a) Enclosed are copies of the Inspection Certificates for 1986 and 1987.
    b) Records of the numbers of spectators admitted to the stadium are permanently
    retained. .           . ..   ';                 ■      •
    c) Stewards: Training evenings for stewards, gatemen etc. were held on 6th and
    13th August 1987 and 16th and 23rd August 1988. On each occasion they were
    addressed by representatives of the South Yorkshire police, South Yorkshire Fire

                Thank you for your letter of 24 May enclosing the copy
of the letter from City of Sheffield.
                Dealing first with certificates relating to an inspection
of the ground by a chartered civil or structural engineer,                                                                                           I
suspect that we have not issued such certificates in a number
of the years since about 1982.                                                          I was not aware of the precise
terms of the certificate of safety in two respects.                                                                                    Firstly,
I did not know that the inspection by the chartered civil or
structural engineer had to be carried out in company with a
representative of the local authority.                                                                  Secondly, I did not know
that the Club had to actually send a certificate to the local
authority each year.                                       As a result,                   I have generally been carrying
out an inspection on m y own and writing a note which was put on
bur file.
               We do not have our files relating to ground safety at the
moment as they were taken away by the Police.                                                                          However they left
us phota-copies and although many of the pages of manuscript are
not readable,                       in this particular case there are notes which are
sufficient basis for John or me to write a retrospective certificate.

        You will see that on 2 June 1987 I made a ground inspection
and wrote a note which was placed on the file.           However,    in view
of the fact that the inspection has to be carried out in company
with a representative of the local authority we shall rely on the
walk rounds which took place with the Working Party.           I took part
in the inspection on Thursday,    6 August 1987, at 10 a.m.            A photo­
copy of the notice of that meeting is attached although I cannot
find the minutes of the meeting on our file.           We know that Sheffield
City Council have failed to minute one or two of these meetings.
        With regard to the 1986 inspection,      I have in my diary
that I attended walk rounds of the ground with members of the
Working Party on 22 January and on 7 August.           I cannot recall the
August meeting but we have on our file a note written by John
Strange who was also present.     I have the minutes of the meeting
on 22 January from which you will see that David Vaughan made
detailed comments about all parts of the ground.
        That meeting was attended b   y      o     f      Sheffield City
Council Building Surveyors Division who is a chartered structural
engineer.
        In view of this documentary evidence I am able to produce
retrospective certificates, copies of which are enclosed.
        Turning now to the certificates relating to the electrical
installation, you already have the certificates which followed the
work carried out in 1988 and early 1989.         These were valid at the
date of the disaster.
        We know that a full inspection and testing took place in 1979
to 1980, and that we issued certificates at that time.              I have
asked                to look those certificates out.        He may have
certified that the wiring was in such a good condition that the
certificate is valid for more than one year.           In addition, various
minor items of electrical work have been carried out in the
intervening years.     This work will have been checked on completion
which would enable a certificate to be issued for those individual
items.     But there are bound to be gaps.

       Now that we know the requirements of the Safety Certificate,
I suggest that, subject to the Club's agreement, we should
systematically do the necessary inspection and tests, and issue
certificates, each year without waiting for a formal request
from you.


                                  Yours sincerely,

                                   Annual Inspection at Hillsborough Stadium
                                 Required by the Certificate of Ground Safety


                                            Date of Inspection 6 August 1987


                    On 6 August 1987,1 made a visual                                                        inspection of the ground,
one of the days when part of this year's quota of crush barriers
    and fences were being tested.
                   The results of the crush barrier                                                        and fence testing are given
    in our report dated 18 August,                                                      1987.
                   I made a visual inspection of all the main structural features
of the ground.                             Particular attention was paid to gates, entry and
exit routes, terraces, barriers,                                                               fences and boundary walls.                                          No
significant defects were found, although a list of maintenance
items requiring maintenance was drawn up.                                                                              The items are of a minor
nature and will be included in the maintenance programme which is
carried out on a continual basis by the Club.
                   I therefore certify that,                                            in my opinion, the various structures
on the ground were on that date in a satisfactory condition and
appropriate for the stadium to be used for football matches and
other e v e n t s .                                                             ______________________________________________

                                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                                   Annual Inspection at Hillsborough Stadium
                                 Required by the Certificate of Ground Safety


                                               Date of Inspection 7 August 1986


                    On 7 August 1986,                         I made a visual inspection of the ground,
one of the days when part of this year's quota of crush barriers
and fences were being tested.
                    The results of the crush barrier and fence testing are given
in our report dated 26 September 1986.
                    I made a visual inspection of all the main structural features
of the ground.                           Particular attention was paid to gates, entry and
exit routes, terraces, barriers, fences and boundary walls.                                                                                                  No
significant defects were found, although a list of maintenance items
requiring maintenance was drawn up.                                                         The items are of a minor nature
and will be included in the maintenance programme which is carried
out on a continual basis by the Club.
                    I therefore certify that,                                     in my opinion, the various structures
on the ground were on that date in a satisfactory condition and
appropriate for the stadium to be used for football matches and
other events.

                      portion of the Stand, (with sprayed non-slip surface) had proved to be of an
                      acceptable appearance in use, and generally appeared to provide a compromise
                      solution to the flansnability problems inherent in such wooden structures.

                     IT WAS AGREED that its condition would continue to be monitored.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds - The Hillsborough Sports Ground

As you know the Hillsborough Inquiry concluded on Friday 14th July, 1989
with closing submissions by Counsel representing the various parties and
also by Mr. Collins the Counsel for the Inquiry. These submissions give
the Council and others a basis on which to start reviewing procedures
following the tragic events of 15th April.

The Council will, of course, shortly be looking at its own administrative
procedures but as part of the wider review into Safety of Sports Grounds
there are a number of issues which need to be considered at the earliest
opportunity. For ease of reference these issues are set out in a list
form in the remainder of this letter. I need your written comments on
the points which I raise as soon as possible and in any event by the end
of this month.

The West Terrace and Stand

Would you please let me have a note of your intentions in relation to the
use of the West Terrace and the West Stand for the accomodation of
spectators. It seems to me that in view of the evidence before the
Inquiry it would not be appropriate for the West Terrace (which term
includes the "wings" at either end of it) to be used for the
accommodation of spectators at this time. Obviously the Council will not
come to a final decision on this matter without consulting in detail
members of the Councils Advisory Group and of course taking into account
any comments which you wish to make.

Stewarding and Crowd Control at Football Matches

The Inquiry as you know raised severed issues in relation to stewarding
and crowd control. It is recommended that you discuss these issues with




                         For telephone enquiries on this matter please ring.........................     (STD Code 0742)     R4602

                                                   Telex 54243 (Administration & Legal)
    the Police with a view to determining accurately responsibilities and
    suitable practiced arrangements for crowd control and that I be given a
    detailed note setting out the revised working procedures in this area.
    "Crowd control" in this context edso means ensuring as far as possible
    the even distribution of spectators in the standing areas.

    The Clubs Management Responsibilities

    Please confirm in writing that the Club fully intends to observe and
    perform its management responsibilities which are listed in paragraph 29
    of the Green Guide (chapter 2 pages 13-15) and provide details of the
    proposed courses of action in this regard.

    Football Association Interim Recamendations

    I would like to draw your attention to pages 10 and 11 of the F.A's
    written submissions to the Inquiry and in particular to paragraph 19.     As
    I do not anticipate that the West Terrace will be used for the
    accomodation of spectators for the time being it does not seem to be
    necessary to set capacities for the pens the future of which are in
    doubt at this stage. However interim reccnmendation (ii) seems to
    suggest that there should be (subject to local conditions) a 20%
    reduction in capacity on terraces. I would like your views on this
    point.

    Action proposed to be taken in the light of the Inquiry

    Would you please let me have your views on what action the Club proposes
    to take in the light of the matters raised in the Inquiry where they are
    not covered by answers to other points raised in this letter. Obviously
    in view of the limited time scale prior to the beginning of the next
    season your proposals will probably be divided into those which are
    immediate and those which will take longer to implement.

    Other Matters

    The evidence presented to the Inquiry indicated that there were sane
    questions about the extent of Dr. Eastwood's authority in relation to the
    Club and Safety of Sports Grounds matters. I propose in future to rioal
    direct with your Club so as to ensure that as far as possible that there
    is no difficulty over this sort of issue. Obviously the Council would
    not wish in any way to prevent you from seeking your own independent
    advice on matters which are raised but I am sure you will appreciate that
    there is a need for complete clarity in this area.

    In a recent letter you indicated that you would like to have a meeting
    with the Council fairly shortly and I propose to make suitable
    arrangements as soon as possible. I would hewever appreciate your views
    on the sort of items you would wish to discuss as soon as possible.

    There are just two other matters which I should bring to your attention
    at this stage:- (a) a copy of this letter has been sent to the Police
    and (b) a meeting of the Council's Advisory Group will shortly be
    convened to discuss various matters resulting for the Inquiry.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Eastwoods letter of 21st July

I refer to Messrs. Eastwood's letter of 21st July (a copy of which I enclose for
ease of reference) and to my reply (copy enclosed).  I think that the letters
are self-explanatory.

I would also like to confirm that Officers will attend at your Sports Ground at
10.00 a.m. on Friday 28th July 1989 to inspect the west stand which as you know
was not available at the annual inspection. The Fire Service have indicated
that they would like talk to your electrician particularly in relation to the
emergency lighting batteries, etc.. It would perhaps also be helpful if you
personally were available at that time.

Yours faithfully,                            ____

 For the attention of Mr. D. Bownfes

 Dear Mr. Bownes,

                                                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

                                                                                       Safety Work 1989

                   At the annual inspection and meeting held at Hillsborough
 in May this year, we gave an undertaking to Arthur Butler and
 Gordon Swan,                      representing the Building Surveyor's Department,
 to survey the condition of the barriers at both ends of the ground.
 This we have done, after being given permission to do so by West
 Midlands Police on 11 July.                                                                    We find that the repair work is
 extensive,                  not necessarily because of corrosion, but in addition
 we have decided to replace all the existing barriers which are
 less than 0.95m high, above the step on which spectators stand
 behind the barrier.                                              Barriers less than 1.02m high have in the past
 been accepted by the Officer Working Party, although those
 considered to be too low were replaced in 197 9-80.                                                                                                     We would not
 be surprised to see recommendations made ^shortly, reducing the
 height of new barriers to something less than 1.02m high, but we
 feel that ones less than 0.95m are probably no longer acceptable.
                   As you will know,                                      the season begins on 19 August,                                                           leaving
 little time to organise contract documents, drawings,                                                                                                         grant assistance
 on behalf of the Club and to have the work complete.                                                                                                         We have

spoken to Don Sherrif    about   the matter and he suggested that the
work be phased, beginning with the most heavily corroded barriers
and those say directly behind the goal area on Spion Kop.         It is
unlikely that even that work will be started before the 19 August
but we shall see.
      Over the next few days we will be preparing details and
schedules of the work,   copies of which will be forwarded to you.
In the meantime your comments would be welcomed.

           Dear Mr. Webster,

           Re:   Safety of Sports Grounds ~ Billsborou#)

           I am in receipt of your letter dated 26th July 1989.

           In respect of points you have raised, many have been covered by ny letter dated
           14th July 1989 and meeting of the Officer working Party held here at
           Hillsborough earlier today.                                 '

           West Stand and ftertace

           It has been agreed that the West Stand only will be used for the first matches
           with Norwich and Everton. Turnstile arrangements and other associated matters
           were agreed at today’s meeting.                     :

           Biis has teen the subject of a meeting and correspondence between the Club and

Further Action
I believe that the Club and its advisors have addressed all short-term measures
in conjunction with the Police and St. Johns Ambulance Brigade. I have a
meeting with S.Y.M.A.S. next Hiesday and will keep you advised. Once the
interim report has been published we will obviously have to discuss how its
findings should be implemented. I will, of course, be pleased to clarify any
specific points you wish to raise.

Dr. Eastwood

I note your intentions.

An area of concern to me in the short-term is the police intention to   access
supporters to the North Stand via the Penistone Road turnstiles only.    We have
several objections to these proposals, ranging fran the inconvenience   caused to
our paying customers, through to the criticism made at the Inquiry of   the
similar policy which was adopted on 15th April.

It was agreed to leave the matter in abeyance until the publication of the
interim report next week. If agreement cannot be reached then the Local
Authority will be called upon to make a written ruling on the matter. Mr.
Bownes of your Department can report further to you on this subject.

It is obvious to all parties that the existing Safety Certificate is patently
flawed and therefore once Lord justice Taylor has published his report I believe
the preparation of a new and effective Safety Certificate should be a matter of
sane priority. In order to give the subject matter as much time as possible for
consideration I would welcome a sight the draft Safety certificate which has
been circulated as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely,




G.H. Mackrell

             Dear Mr. Webster,

             Pe:       Safety Certificate

             At a meeting I had with the South Yorkshire Police earlier this week it was
             noticed that the wording of the Emergency Evacuation Procedure in the Safety
             Certificate is differen^ to that whichisin effective use.

             The revised wording was drawn up by the South Yorkshire Police and South
             Yorkshire Fire Service, and I understand is in use at all five South Yorkshire
             Football League Clubs.

             I have no record of whether the Local Authority have ever been notified and
             therefore I enclose a copy in order for you to amend your records.

             Yours sincerely.

Car parking:

Cross hatched for access and egress. The whole area need not be done, just a
path. Is there sufficient room for ambulances to travel full length of South
Stand. Yes, though there is a problem for fire appliances. Car park stewards
will be responsible for this area. Hatch markings are required for emergency.
SYMAS happy with road markings being made. Clearway necessary there is plenty
of room for clearway and parked cars.

Access

Problems with Gate 0 and access onto pitch. Difficult to turn right on to the
pitch - very tight. Access to pitch difficult because of wheelchair ramp.
The gym is perfect for both mortuary and casualties. Routes to hospital are
straightforward. Plan to use Herries Road Bus Garage for parking of
ambulances. Problems in reversing vehicles in and out of Gate 0. Operate a one
way system.

We must ensure somehow that we can get vehicles onto the pitch and off easily.
Modifications to the central reservations would be welcomed. Does this mean
closing down the disabled area and taking out the ramp. SYMAS stated that there
is a need for good vehicle access. Dr. Eastwood accepted this fully and asked
SYMAS if the disabled ramp needed to be removed for the first match of the
season. SYMAS stated that it did. It was recommended that a width of 3.1
meters was the requirement for the fire service but SYMAS stated that their
appliances were a width of 2.8 metres.

Stretchers and Equipment

SYMAS stated something that needs to be discussed. Need to look at the
equipment required for medical room. Requirements with regard to equimpent and
first adi are at the moment subject to consultation with St. Johns and
Hallamshire Hospital. It would be wrong at this point to start agreeing levels
of equipment.

St. Johns and Red Cross to cane under control of SYMAS. Ohe subject of medical
equipment needs further discussion. SYMAS requested consultation on medical
equipment purchased to ensure that it was compatible with their equipment

St. Johns to deal with minor domestic injuries and illness.    SYMAS in the event
of a large incident.
Medical Practitioner

SYMAS would need to meet any other doctors who may be involved with the Club and
likely to be here on a regular basis. Dr. Purcell is already well known.

We are talking about a doctor over and above the one that takes care of the
team. The role of Team Doctor and the role of additional Medical Practitional
in attendance for other persons are not one of the same. Two doctors required
to be in attendance. Provide doctor with a bleep. The positioning of the
additional doctor to be decided upon. SYMAS stated that in their opinion
medical facilities should be used and doctor located in that area. K. Addy
stated that doctor should have access to Police Control Roan. Necessary to
carry ID and be easily identified to enable easy access to any parts of ground.

Trained First Aiders

Mr. Addy stated that members of SWFC staff had undertaken first aid courses
carried out by SYMAS and that we have the number of trained first aiders
necessary. SYMAS stated that they would be in a position to provide this.

Spectators - Safety Cert.

Mr. D. Bownes stated that the Council will be clearly examining the Certificate
and a meeting is to be made next week. The council were not prepared to state
figures for spectators. Dr. Eastwood stated 2,300 is the figure SWFC were
working on but the Council would not make a decision at this stage, it was
agreed that unless SWFC hear fron the Council the figure of 2,300 will be used
for Pen 7. The figure for the Kop given by Dr. Eastwood was 17,850 - 15% less
than the 21,000. Dr. Eastwood asked if in the absence of a reply from the
Council that the figure be used. Mr. Bownes replied that the Council would
review the Certificate by the end of next week. Mrs. Woodhead fron the
Licensing Department of City Council stated that 3 days were required before a
meeting can be called and they would not be able to get reports together before
tanorrow afternoon. They may be able to call a meeting a short notice.

Perimeter Fences

Mr. Addy stated that this is something the Club has in hand. SWFC are to paint
the gate and framework and signs positioned accordingly. A meeting was
scheduled for 10th August to discuss the positioning of signs around the ground.
The Police stated that it might be a good idea to number the gates along the
perimeter fencing consecutively around the ground.

Cutting Equipment

Two sets of bolt croppers to be provided by SWFC to be operated by trained
members of SWFC staff. It will be the clubs reponsibility to bring them out of
store on the day of the game. Box should be marked "Emergency Equipment"

Barriers

SWFC are in the process of doing this and any remedial work will be carried
out. Mr. Bownes asked if the club were reviewing the layout of barriers. Dr.
Eastwood stated that^the matter of expense relating to altering the layout of
barriers considered in relation to seating accommodation in a few years time.
Any standing area will be examined and an agreement reached on what the barrier
layout will be. Then there will be an assessment of what the capacity is.




                                                                       ; ‘ ••   • r l"

Turnstiles

Mr. Addy stated that SWFC have had all the turnstiled inspected. Correspondence
is expected from the company who undertook the work. Dr. Eastwood stated that
the potential rate of flow was 750 when there is no crowd pressure. All
turnstiles were inspected and only one was found to be incorrect, this was
repaired and is now in good working order. Mr. Bownes stated that the Council
would want the potential rate of flow measured and requested something in
writing on this matter. Dr. Eastwood stated that realistic experiments would
have to be undertaken to achieve an accurate measurement. The experiment needs
to be conducted on a suitable match day.

Dr. Eastwood stated that provided the North Stand was being filled from both
ends it is possible to achieve the new capacity.

On item 20 Dr. Eastwood stated that there was no difficulty in this. The club
was requested to provide a written statement that turnstiles would be provided
with a telephone link for an oral warning on capacity.

Om 18 - 20 Dr. Eastwood had written to the Council.

Postpone Kick-Off

The Police have requested a direct link with the referee.   Police require notice
before players ccme out onto pitch.

        Re: Safety of Sports Grounds - Hillsborough

        I enclose, for your attention, Notice of Amendment of the Safety
        Certificate.  The amendments are as enumerated in Appendix 1 and additional
        conditions are as enumerated in Appendix 2. The amendments and additions

        these will be in force in the near future.

Dear Sir,

The Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1987 - Regulation 5

I refer to the amendment of your General Safety Certificate, a copy of
which was lodged with your Company on Friday, 11th August, 1989.

In accordance with the above Regulation, this letter is formal notice in
writing of the Council decision to amend your General Safety Certificate
and a copy of that Safety Certificate and the amendments made to it is
available for inspection at the Licensing Section, Administration and
Legal Department, Town Hall, Sheffield 1, fron 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.
and frcm 1.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m., Monday to Friday.

Please note that on this occasion, Dr. W. Eastwood has been separately
notified of these amendments, under the Regulations. However, I should
point out that notices will normally be served on your Company direct and
you should therefore make your own arrangements to notify Dr. Eastwood of
them if appropriate.

Yours faithfully,




Acting Head of Department

Dear Sir,

Re:   Safety Certificate - Hillsborough

I am in receipt of your letter dated 11th August 1989.

With regard to the items in Appendix 2 where a response has been requested:

No. 3)     A copy of a report fran Mayor Turnstiles is enclosed. A replacement
           for Turnstile 50 which is situated at Penistone Road is on order.

No. 4)     A copy of the   Agreement is enclosed.

No. 7)     A copy of the   necessary letter from Dr. Eastwood is enclosed.

No. 8)     Amendments to the signposting of the ground and     the printing ofthe
           tickets have been undertaken to the satisfaction of the South
           Yorkshire Police and Fire Service.

I would point out the amended ground capacity figures are# in fact, incorrect.
The area of the Lower North West Terrace is in fact Pen 6, part of the West
Terrace which is excluded from use (Appendix 2 No. 10) Oie capacity for the
North West Terrace should therefore be 2,300.

Finally, I would refer to the penultimate paragraph of my letter dated 28th July
1989 to your Administration and Legal Department. Last week the Working Party
approved the Police request that access to the North Stand should be via
Penistone Road using turnstiles 77-88. Our concern over this policy was
confirmed in the findings of the Interim Report (para 290). I would therefore
confirra ny request for a written ruling on this matter prior to Saturday's match.

Yours faithfully,
                                                                                                                      No. M T L           2 1 8 6 1

This agreement signed on behalf of both parties is created in pursuance of

recommendation four            of the Interim Report of the Inquiry held by The Rt Hon

Lord Justice Taylor            into the Hillsborough              Stadium Disaster of 15 April 1989.




The agreement between The Police and The Club is as follows




Maximum Capacities for Terraces

The Club will be responsible for limiting the number of spectators entering

each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity figure assessed in

accordance with recommendation two of the Interim Report.




The Club will do this by means of the computerised system which records the

number of persons passing through each turnstile.




The Club will inform the police control room when a particular pen or area is

approaching capacity.              The Club will be responsible for closing off further

access to a pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.                                      The

Police accept The Club may on occasions have difficulties in this regard,

therefore, The Police will provide assistance if necessary.




The Police accept that denial of access to any part of the ground may create

public order problems in respect of spectators so excluded and The Police will

prepare contingency plans to deal with such situations.




Filling and Monitoring Terraces

The C lu b w i l l p r o v i d e on t h e p e r i m e t e r t r a c k a s t e w a r d f o r e a c h p en o r

terraced area during such times that there are spectators in that pen or
terraced area.     The sole duty of these stewards, who will be in addition to

any other stewards employed by The Club, will be to check crowd conditions in

the pen or terraced area to which they are assigned for possible overcrowding

or distress.     The Club will provide The Police with a plan of the ground

showing where the stewards with this responsibility will be situated.




The Police will provide in respect of each gate in the perimeter fence (or

group of gates if they are close together) police officers authorised to

decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve

overcrowding.




All police officers deployed at perimeter gates which will be kept fully open

at all times when spectators are on the terraces, will be authorised as above.

Each will be in possession of a police radio in direct contact with police

ground control and will be identifiable by a distinctive coloured tabard.




The stewards checking the crowd for overcrowding or distress will not be

issued with police radios but the police officers on the gates and perimeter

track will communicate to police ground control any relevant matter brought to

their attention by these stewards.




Cutting Equipment

The Club will provide and make readily available suitable and sufficient

cutting equipment to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release

numbers of spectators if necessary.    This cutting equipment will be operated

by employees of The Club who will be trained in its use.     The use of such

equipment will be at the discretion of the nominated senior police officer who

will be the officer in charge of policing the event.
Liaison

Before each match both parties to this agreement will liaise in respect of the

following matters

     i)   the anticipated number of spectators expected having regard

          to the separate supporter groups;




    ii)   the method of crowd segregation (if any) intended to be used;




   iii)   any information in relation to crowd problems;




    iv)   the number and location of turnstiles to be made available

          to each group;




     v)   an estimation of the time it will take each group to pass

          through the turnstiles;




    vi)   where tickets are used, that the information on those tickets

          corresponds with the planned arrangements for admitting

          spectators to the ground.




Postponement of kick-off is at the discretion of the police officer in command

at the ground.   It is therefore essential The Club provide a telephone link

between the referee's room and the police control room.




The Police have prepared contingency plans for the event of emergency services

being called to the ground.   These include routes of access, rendezvous

points, accessibility within the ground and routes of egress.   The Police will

liaise with The Club concerning these arrangements whenever these plans are

amended or as otherwise appropriate.
The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police has nominated his Deputy,

Mr Peter Hayes QPM LLB MA, as the Chief Officer with responsibility for

liaison with the management of each football club and local authority

concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.




Any variation of this agreement in respect of a particular match will be

agreed by the parties in advance in writing.

Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                                                               Hillsborough Stadium
                           Amendment of General Safety Certifieste
            I understand that under Appendix 2, item 7, which contains
additional conditions to the Safety Certificate,                                                                                     there arc
requirements under sub-paragraphs                                                         (a) and                    (b) regarding
inspection of crush barriers and a review of the layout.
I am pleased to report to you as follows


C ondition 7 (a)
            Following Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations, Mr. John
Strange immediately carried out a visual inspection of all crush
barriers for signs of corrosion.                                                          indeed,                the inspection was
much more thorough than required by X^ord Justice Taylor's
report because it included scraping with a sharp instrument
immediately inside the ends of tubes so as to better reveal the
true extent of corrosion. As a result of Mr. Strange's inspection
I am able to report that none of the barriers was found to be
sufficiently affected by corrosion for it to be necessary for
it to be repaired or replaced by 16 August,                                                                               1989,

  Condition 7 (b)
       The layout of all barriers in the ground has been
  reviewed.     As you will know, variations from the Green
  Guide were reported and were accepted at the time when the
  original Safety Certificate was issued in 1979.      Since then,
  various other modifications have been requested by South
  Yorkshire County Council or Sheffield City Council.          There are
  further departures from the criteria contained in chapter 9
  of the Green Guide.      We are currently preparing scheme
  drawings for re-arrangement of the various barriers so as
  to satisfy the guidelines.      When tenders are invited for the
  necessary works, we will also Include such alterations or
  strengthening as may be necessary to cure incipient corrosion
  or other defects.
       As soon as the scheme drawings and specification are
  complete, we shall, of course, be submitting them on your
  behalf to the Sheffield City Council as licensing authority
  for their approval.


                                    Yours sincerely,

Acting Head of Department,

Dear Mr. Webster,

Re;   Safety of Sports Grounds - Hillsborough

I am in receipt of your letter dated 26th JUly 1989.

In respect of points you have raised, many have been covered by my letter dated
14th July 1989 and meeting of the Officer Working Party held here at
Hillsborough earlier today.

West Stand and Terrace

It has been agreed that the West Stand only will be used for the first matches
with Norwich and Everton. Turnstile arrangements and other associated matters
were agreed at today's meeting.

Stewarding and Crowd Control

This has been the subject of a meeting and correspondence between the Club and
the Police. Final points will be clarified at a further meeting to be held
early next week.

Management Responsibilities

These are noted and confirmed. I believe that you are in possession of all the
necessary information and the relevant officers have inspected the ground.

Football Association's interim Recommendations

I am of the opinion that recommendation (ii) pre-empts possible areas of comment
that may be made with the publishing of Lord justice Taylor's Report. This
matter should be looked at once the findings of the interim report have become
known.


                                       continued . . .




                 f
Further Action

I believe that the Club and its advisors have addressed all short-term measures
in conjunction with the Police and St. Johns Ambulance Brigade. I have a
meeting with S.Y.M.A.S. next Tuesday and will keep you advised. Once the
interim report has been published we will obviously have to discuss how its
findings should be implemented. I will, of course, be pleased to clarify any
specific points you wish to raise.

Dr. Eastwood

I note your intentions.

An area of concern to me in the short-term is the Police intention to   access
supporters to the North Stand via the Penistone Road turnstiles only.    We have
several objections to these proposals, ranging from the inconvenience   caused to
our paying customers, through to the criticism made at the Inquiry of   the
similar policy which was adopted on 15th April.

It was agreed to leave the matter in abeyance until the publication of the
interim report next week. If agreement cannot be reached then the Local
Authority will be called upon to make a written ruling on the matter. Mr.
Bownes of your Department can report further to you on this subject.

It is obvious to all parties that the existing Safety Certificate is patently
flawed and therefore once Lord Justice Taylor has published his report I believe
the preparation of a new and effective Safety Certificate should be a matter of
sane priority, in order to give the subject matter as much time as possible for
consideration I would welcome a sight the draft Safety Certificate which has
been circulated as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely,

The Fire Service

1.   South Stand

     Ground Floor


     (a)   The following fire resisting self closing doors failed to close
           when opened fully: -

           (i)      corridor door adjacent east egress stairs frcm the upper
                     level and the old gymnasium

           (ii)     kitchen entrance from the office area.

     (b)   The folding door adjacent turnstile 29 was difficult to open.

     (c)   The combustibles stored in the internal kitchen yard enclosure to
           be removed.

     (d)   The one hour fire resisting self closing door frcm the kitchen to
           the yard was vredged open.

     (e) A 'Walk In' cold store has been installed in the area known as the
         "kitchen yard" without the approval of the Advisory Group and
         should it be involved in the fire the means of escape frcm the
         upper levels would be affected. It should therefore be removed.
         If there are any alternative proposals however that vrould maintain
         the integrity of the means of escape from the upper levels of the
         stand, the kitchen and the office section/ then these should be
         submitted for the attention of the Advisory Group.

     (f)   The extract ducting from the Director's Board Room terminates in
           the internal "kitchen yard" and therefore would discharge smoke
           directly onto the means of escape frcm the upper levels of the
           stand. This ducting should be extended so as to discharge to open
           air.

           It was noted during the inspection that no danper was provided
           where this ducting passes through the one hour fire resisting wall
           forming the protected area. This should be brought to the
           attention of the Building Surveyor as it vrould not appear to meet
           the requirements of Building Regulations.

     (g) Where the above ducting enters the "yard" it requires fire
         stopping around the duct.

     (h)   The spirit store should be separated from the interned corridor
           and false ceiling above by half hour fire resisting construction,
           the door also to be half hour fire resisting and made self closing
           onto 25mm rebates using a positive action self closing device.
           Confirmation is required that the fire resisting separation
           between this store and the escape route from the upper levels of
           the stand is to one hour standard.
                                -2-



Upper Level


(i)   Paint Store

      (i)     Die storage of rags and other combustibles should cease
              and the items removed.

      (ii)    The rebates to the fire resisting door frame should be
              inproved to 25ittn.

      (iii)   Die air vents should be infilled with one hour fire
              resisting material.

              Notwithstanding the above natters and the comments
              contained in the letter frcm Eastwood and Partners dated
              3rd February, 1988, it is strongly reccmrended that this
              store be relocated to same suitable position away from the
              public areas.

(j)   Hillsborough Lounge

      (i)     A fire damper with a one hour fire resisting rating must
               be fitted to the central extract fan. Hie danper should
               be operated by the actuation of a smoke detector sited at
               ceiling level adjacent to the fan on the lounge side

      (ii)    Confirmation is required that the large amounts of
               artificial foliage and the furnishings in this room have
               been treated with fire retardant substances. Otherwise
               they should be so treated or removed so as to comply with
               BS 5867: Part 2: 1980.

(k)   Press Roan

      (i)     'Hie left hand extract fan does not appear to be fitted
               with a fire danper, therefore a danper to the same
               standard and method of operation as that detailed in j(i)
               above mast be installed.


      Stand

(1)   One of the emergency lights on the concourse was defective, and
      requires replacement or repair.

(m)   The wooden cupboards used for storing the seat cushions should be
      replaced by fire resisting construction.

      (i)     It is not known what type of foam is used for these
              cushions and those in the sponsors area or if the covering
              material is flame retardant, confirmation of this is
              required.

              Any replacement cushions should have flame retardant foam
              and coverings, so as to satisfy B.S. 5852 Part 1: 1979 and
              the crib ignition source 5 of B.S. 5852 Part 2: 1982.
                                            -3-



     (n)   Die laundry extract fan has an accumulation of fluff etc.   This
           should be removed on a regular basis.

     (o)   Die windows that form part of the wall that adjoins the exit
           corridor frcxn the front seated area should be made half hour fire
           resisting, if they are onto roans other than toilets.

     (p)   It appears that on recent inspections to the ground, alterations
           have taken place and additional fans provided for ventilation
           purposes betvreen accommodation and the concourse level, without
           adequate fire stopping arrangements. Any further fans for this
           purpose will only be acceptable subject to installation in
           accordance with the method detailed in j(i) above.

           It is strongly recommended that all existing fans be similarly
           dealt with as this is the only way that smoke from a fire in any
           such area can be prevented from affecting the means of escape
           route from the upper levels of the stand.

     South Stand, Seated Area

     (r)   Die following seats were either loose or broken:-

           Row   X Seat     Numbers   200   - 201
           Row   y Seat     Numbers   220   - 221
           Row   G Seat     Number    136
           Row   J Seat     Number     78
           Row   Q Seat     Numbers   133   - 132
           Row   IX) Seat   Numbers   163   - 162
           Row   GG Seat    Number     52
           Row   HH Seat    Number     40

2.   Spion Kop

     (a)   There was an accumulation of rubbish on the horizontal steel work
           under the kop adjacent to the south stand, which should be
           removed.

     (b) An emergency light was defective on the lighting tower adjacent to
         the north stand, and should be replaced or repaired.

     (c)   Die external gate at the Kop/north stand area does not open fully,
           and should therefore be adjusted to achieve this.

3.   North Stand, Ground Floor

     (a)   Due to the erection of screening in the three tea bars, the fire
           alarm break glass call points are not immediately available,
           therefore they should be resited to the front of the screens.

     (b)   Die L.P.G. cy linder and portable heater in the press darkroom
           requires removing. Die use or storage of flammable gases or
           liquids is not allowed without the prior written approval of the
           Licensing Authority.

     (c)   Die former liquor bars are new used for various functions, e.g.
           storage, rest areas, and cooking purposes, therefore the potential
           fire loading of these areas has probably increased. Consultation
           with the Fire Authority is required on their future use.
     (d)   The groundsman's store beneath the stand oust not be used for
           storing potentially flammable materials, fertilisers, weed killers
           etc.

     North Stand, Upper Level

     (e)   The mobile lottery kiosks on the concourse constitute an
           obstruction to the means of escape, and should be resited or
           removed.

     (f)   Sonne emergency lights on the external approaches at the west end
           of the stand were not vrorking, and should be replaced or repaired.

     (g)   The following seats were either loose or broken:-

           Row   47   Seat   Number    101
           Row   11   Seat   Numbers    97 - 98
           Row    6   Seat   Number     89
           Row   28   Seat   Numbers   202 - 203
           Row   29   Seat   Numbers   152 - 151
           Row   33   Seat   Number    132

           Also, the first six rows of seating across the full length of the
           stand require checking as numerous seats were broken and rows were
           loose.

Additional Ocmnents

1.   South Stand

     First Floor - Cleaners Store

     (a)   The wall at the rear of this store is to be made imperforate to
           the passage of smoke and heat.

     (b)   The timber wall between the store and the adjacent 'Press' room is

      (c)   Die following seats had broken backs and require attention

            Rcm 28 - Seat Number 83
            Row 11 - Seat Number 131

      (d)   There was a pile of debris on rcw 1 in front of seat 137 that
            requires removing.

4.    Emergency Lighting (West Stand)

      (a)   The emergency lamp on the concourse adjacent to Exit 'V' was not
            lit and requires attention.

      (b)   It was noted during the inspection that certain areas were not
            covered by the emergency lighting system, e.g. toilets on the
            concourse, the north west comer under the stand and toilets in
            other parts of the ground. A further inspection is to be carried
            out by this Authority, when dark evenings can be expected at about
            2000 hours to 2100 hours to ascertain the level of luminosity of
            the system and also to determine which, if any, additional areas
            frcm that presently covered, require emergency lighting.

The Building Surveyor

1.0    Spion Kop

1.1    A bracing member to the pitch perimeter fence between gates 5 and 6
       has been very badly bent, and one weld onto the perimeter fence post
       has broken as a result. New bracing should be provided at this
       point.

1.2    On barrier 138, the northern end bracing member is bent out of
       alignment and the base of that same member is badly corroded.
       Replacement of the bracing member is required.

1.3    On barrier 122, the gusset plate on the end support to the barrier
       rail was rusted through, and the barrier rail was rusted through
       under the support clip.

       Similarly, many other barrier rails in the old Rop area were found to
       have rusted through under the support clips.

       All barriers in the olrf^ffop area should be visually inspected by the
       Club's engineers, and anyjtember found to have rusted through should
       be replaced and retestedr

1.4    At exit Z (south entrance to lower Kop area), the upper bracket
       fixing the fencing to the brick wall had broken. Repair is
       necessary.
        H tb top section of walling, referred to in 1.4 above needs
        repointing.

1.6    On exit Z, the underside concrete cover on the reinforced concrete
       raking brace to the retaining wall was spalling off. It was also
       noted that the brace was also fractured. The member should be either
       repaired or removed, in the case of its removal, the adjacent steel
       brace should be modified to achieve four bolt fixing to both the
       retaining vail and the base slab.

1.7    Barbed wire on the lighting pylon legs (adjacent exit Z) should be
        renewed to prevent unauthorised cliirbing.

1.8    The scaffolding barrier around the base of the banking adjacent to
       turnstiles 43 and 44 should be removed and replaced by a properly
       constructed fence and barrier system.

1.9    Unauthorised entry onto the fire escape stairway leading to the roof
        of the Hillsborough Suite, should be prohibited.

1.10   Hie brickwork at the base of the fire exit from the Hillsborough
       Suite should be repointed at least for the first four courses above
       ground level.

1.11   Loose brick on edge copings to the inner walls of the gents toilets
       adjacent to turnstiles 43 and 44 should be repaired or removed.

1.12   The temporary timber fencing to the side of the tunnel access at the
       north end should be removed and replaced by nan-ccnfcustible
       construction capable of withstanding the relevant design loading.

1.13   Consideration should be given to installing rings of barbed wire or
        other similar construction around the roof trusses of the Kop/ so as
        to prevent fans from cliirbing on the roof structure.

1.14   Pointing required to south car park side of wall to gents toilets
        betvreen Hillsborough Suite and South Stand.

2.0    North Stand

2.1    Adjacent to vcmitory L, loose seat uprights need tightening.

2.2    Adjacent to vomitory L, pointing required between concrete units in
        gangway.

2.3    External thickness of wall sheeting on upper corridor needs refixing
       or replacement.

2.4    Loose plywood plates on underside of terracing above raking beam
       adjacent to vcmitory H to be removed.

2.5    Grouting at the base of the column adjacent to seat 1 row 22 (near
       vcmitory F) needs repair.

2.6    Step between seats 12 and 13 on row 17 between vcmitories A and F
       needs rebedding.
                                         -7-



3.0    Leppinqs Lane End

3.1    Base of door posts to turnstiles 1 to 8 need repair.

3.2    Guttering to turnstiles 13 to 16 to repair or replace.

4.0    West Stand and Terracing

4.1    Pitch side advertisement boards to north end of terracing need
        securing.

4.2    External wall sheeting to northern entrance stairway to stand needs
       replacement.

4.3    Consideration should be given to installing an additional barrier
        between barriers 146 and 147 at the south end of the west terracing.

4.4    Similar to the Spion Kop, barrier rails were noted to have suffered
       rust through under support clips. A complete survey and necessary
       repair and retesting should be carried out by the Club's engineers
       and the results reported to the Council.

4.5    Cracks were noted in the concrete of the column at the south eastern
       c om e r of the west stand directly adjacent to the terracing. The
       concrete needs to be cut back to the depth of the cracks and a
       professional repair carried out.

4.6    Cracks were noted in the comers of the cantilever landings to both
       stairway entrances to the west stand - the area of the landings
       affected being directly adjacent to the reinforced concrete columns
       of the west stand - whilst not of immediate concern the cracks should
       have tell-tales fixed over them and the results monitored.

4.7    Reinforcement was noticed    on the external face of the cantilever
       landing slab of the south    reinforced concrete stairway to the west
       stand. Repairs should be     carried out in order to limit the effects
       of damage to the concrete    during the winter months.

4.8    Hangers for signs over the front parapet wall of the west stand
       should be removed or the signs adequately replaced.

4.9    Spa1ling of the concrete at the base of the precast concrete units,
       forming the stepping of the west stand, was noted in the following
       positions

       Row 3 between        seats34      and41
       Row 5 between        seats36      and39
       Rcw 16 between       seats6 and   8

       Adequate repairs should be carried out.

4.10   The base of the seat fixing upright members generally in rows 1 and 2
       were suffering from considerable rusting and lack of painting
       (especially in the low seat numbers). These matters should be
       checked, cleaned and painted. Any members suffering rust-through
       should be replaced.

        4.11   Stalling of concrete around the seat fixing channel   in the vertical
               face of the precast concrete unit, holding seats 25   and 26 (Row 2)
               was noted. 'Hie seat upright matters to these seats   were also
               suffering rust through and thus leaving those seats   in a dangerous
               condition. In this case, the concrete and the seat    upright members
               need repairs.

        4.12   In the landing area of the vrest stand immediately in front of the
               gate to the north vest terrace, some parts of the concrete were seen
               to be loose and in need of repair.

        4.13   On the concourse level of the west stand, brickwork adjacent to the
               bottom of the doorframe to the gents toilets (between vomitories U
               and V) was seen to be loose and in need of repair.

        4.14   On the rear landing level of the north west terrace, the following
               ware noted

               1.   The mesh panels were unrestrained at their base.

               2.   The upright member of the balustrading, adjacent to the first
                     stairway from the west stand, was suffering rust through at its
                     base.

               3.   Hie steel sheeted bridge link adjacent to the lighting tower had
                    rusted considerably. Large lamina of rusted metal had dropped
                    fran the underside of the steel plates. The remaining thickness
                    needs to be checked for structural adequacy.

        4.15   On the concrete parapet wall betwaen the west stand and the north
                vest terrace, reinforcement bars could be seen on its west stand side
                - Repairs are recommended in order to inhibit any further danage to
                this relatively thin structure which is exposed to external elements.

        4.16   Many of the bases of the timber frames on the inner ground side of
                the turnstiles were noted to be suffering fran rot.

        5.0    South Stand

        5.1    Loose plaster to the ceiling of the gents toilets, adjacent to
                turnstile 22, to be removed.

        5.2    Loose weather louvre at head of window above seats 167 to 172 on row
                Z to be removed or repaired - others should be checked for their
                stability.

        5.3    Scaffolded access stair to t.v. gantry should be modified so as to
               prevent injury to any spectators in that area of the stand.

        5.4    Loose materials on the overhead walkway should be removed.

        5.5    Loose materials on the external camera platform should be removed.

        5.6    The timber hut to the western end of the external platform should be
               restrained by guy wises.

        5.7    Considerable bounce was noted on the external platform area.  The
               Club's engineers should be requested to carry out a structural survey
               of the construction to prove its present stability.

5.8    Consideration should be given to increasing the height of the
       balustrading to the edge of the external camera platform, for the
       safety of its users.

5.9    Spalling to the concrete face of the T rain structural elements of the
       building was noted in the following locations:-

       1.   Concrete beam over gate G between turnstiles 26 and 27.

       2.   End of concrete beam at colum connection over turnstile 32.

       3.   Column over entrance to the Riverside Suite.

5.10   Consideration should be given to asking the Club to prepare a scheme
       for providing alternative means of lighting and ventilation to the
       ground floor rooms now using opening windows, louvred openings and
       mechanical extracts directly into the gangway at the back of the
       lower seated area, so as to reduce the risk of fire and smoke fran
       any occurrence in those roans directly affecting the spectators on
       the stand.

5.11   Hie Club should be reminded of their obligations regarding the south
       stand roof, in accordance with the minute of the General Purposes
       Panel dated 2nd February, 1987.

       In particular, they should be reminded of the need to inspect the
       roof at least twice a year in conjunction with my staff.

       securely fixed to the wall.

41.   In the service roans on the ground floor corridor, it was noted that
       there vrere glass windows. The glass did not appear to be toughened
       or safety glass and consideration should be given to either boarding
      the windows or providing safety glass.

42.   In the ground floor corridor next to entrance L, it was noted on the
       inspection that there was ladders propped up against the wall
      covering fire extinguishes. These ladders should be removed.

          panels at the boundary immediately adjacent to the ramp to the first
          floor at the Penistone Road North end. If these panels are the
          responsibility of Sheffield Wednesday, they should be replaced where
          appropriate.

47.      A number of seats in the north stand were found to be defective
         either by missing or broken laths/structural members or they were not
          secured properly (for example, row 6 seats 213 to 216). All the
          seats should be surveyed and repaired/secured as necessary.

48.      In the seated area of the north stand, nortar was found to be
         missing in many places between the concrete floor sections which
         posed a trip hazard. Hie area should be surveyed and the gaps
          repaired where appropriate.

The West Stand


49.       In the seated area of the west stand, it was noted that the headrocm
         to the lateral gangway at the rear (near row 32) had only 1.95 metres
         of headrocm. The steel girders which limit headroom should have
         hazard markings complying with the relevant British Standard, i.e.
         BS5378 Part 1 1980.

50.       It was noted that in the main exit/entrance area, the concrete paving
         was cracked and broken in parts and this requires to be corrected.

 Dear Sirs,

 Amendment to Safety Certificate

 As you are aware, the General Purposes Panel of the City Council met on
 Thursday, 17th August, 1989 to consider amendment of the Certificate for the
 Sports Ground.

 At that meeting, the General Purposes Panel confirmed the action of the
 Chief Executive in amending the Safety Certificate for Sheffield Wednesday
 Football Club on the 11th August, 1989. The General Purposes Panel also
 authorised the issue of a further Notice of Amendment. This further Notice
 is enclosed for your attention.  You will note that there is a further
 amendment to Schedule 3 which has the effect of stating that the maximum
 capacity for the upper area of the North West Terrace shall be 2,300. Thus,
 the maximum total capacity for the Sports Ground is reduced to 43,724. For
 the sake of clarity, additional Condition 10 of the amended Certificate is
 amended to reflect that only the upper part of the terracing of the North
 West Terrace shall be used and only upon a contingency basis should the
 Police find it necessary.

 Pursuant to Dr. Eastwood's comments in relation to the North Stand (i.e.
 that the capacity figure did not take account of the disabled facilities)
 the Panel reduced the capacity of the North Stand to 9,700 as an interim
 measure.

 The General Purposes Panel also considered an emergency item pursuant to
 your letter dated the 16th August, 1989. Upon hearing representations from
 the Police and yourself upon this issue, the Panel decided that on condition
 that the number of turnstiles available for the use of spectators using the
 North Stand was increased from 12 to 14, the Panel was satisfied that it was
 appropriate to make use of the North Stand and that since additional
 turnstiles would be available, the existing capacity figure would remain
 unchanged.




                                                                                  734004
                        For telephone enquiries on this matter please ring........................................ (STD Code 0742)   R4602
                                                      Telex 54243 (Administration & Legal)
It should be emphasised that this is seen as an interim measure only in view
of the difficulties there were in segregating fans at the Leppings Lane end
of the Ground.   It is understood that the matter is the subject of
discussion with the Police. The Panel have insisted that they are made
aware of all discussions which take place and in any event wish to review
the matter further in September.   I, therefore, look forward to hearing from
you further in this respect and in any event no later than the 22nd
September, 1989.

Yours faithfully,




Acting Head of Department

  Dear Sir,

  Re; Safety of Sports Ground

  It has come to my attention that from time to time, meetings take place
  which concern the Safety of Sports Grounds and that these discussions are
  not referred to the Council for their consideration.  I understand that this
  is particularly so vis-a-vis the Club and the Police in view of the fact
  that there are frequently meetings to discuss operational matters.

  You will appreciate that the Council is keen to improve                                             its administrative
  procedures. It is therefore essential that the Council                                              is aware of all
  meetings which are taking place.  In future, therefore,                                             I would be grateful
  if you will advise me of the dates, times and places of                                             meetings and the
  matters to be discussed at them.

              Dear Sir,

              Amendment to Safety Certificate

              I refer to my letter of 18th August and to the enclosed Notice of
              Amendment to your Club's General Safety Certificate.

              I notice in fact that the total crowd capacity as listed in Appendix 1 of
              the amendment of the Notice of Amendment should in fact read 43,542 and
              not 43,724 as shown in the document. I therefore enclose a revised
              Appendix 1 with the correct figure inserted.

              Yours faithfully,

                       Capacity of Standing Accommodation on the Kop

                As requested I have pleasure in enclosing information for
transmission to Sheffield City                                                                     Council regarding the capacity
of the Kop as it exists at present when calculated in strict
accordance with the Green Guide and when the Green Guide figure
is reduced by 15%.
               Attached is a coloured up print of our drawing 11237/5 on which
the areas which are properly protected by crush barriers are marked
in blue.                 It will be seen that on some parts of the old Kop there
are white areas where the rows of barriers are too far apart
or whether there are gaps in barriers.
               The blue areas have a total area of 3893.7m2 which gives a
permitted, capacity of 21,026.                                                                     After a reduction of 15% this
gives a total of 17,872.

                                                                                                     Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,

Re Safety of Sports Ground

I refer to previous correspondence and discussions concerning the issue
of calculation of capacity.  I particularly refer to interim
recommendation No. 2 of Lord Justice Taylor which lays down a clear
formula for calculating the capacity levels for terraces. Although it
has been implicit from previous correspondence and from the discussions
which have taken place, I thought it may be useful to make it clear that
the Council expects that you will be making a calculation for capacity at
the ground in accordance with that formula.  I therefore look forward to
hearing from you within seven days with that calculation.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr. Webster,

Re:   Annual Inspection - Officers comments

I am in receipt of your letter dated 17th August 1989.

As you will appreciate the schedule provided is comprehensive and requires
clarification on many points.

We have met the Fire Service and have arranged site meetings with the Local
Authority Surveyors Department and Health and consumer Services.

Once these meetings have taken place we will be in a position to report,
hopefully within the next seven days.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,

Safety At Sports Grounds Act

I write to confirm the opinion already expressed at a meeting of the Advisory
Group that no officer of the Council, in whatever capacity he purports
to act, has any authority whatsoever to amend, vary, modify or revoke in
any way any safety certificate or any amendment, alteration or similar
matter, in any respect whatsoever. Any such amendment, alteration or
revokation can only be made by the Council acting in its official capacity
as the certificating authority under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act,
and formal notification in the appropriate statutory form will be issued.

I have informed all the other appropriate statutory services, and the
operators of the three stadia who mare potentially or actually the subject
of the certificating process. Dr. Eastwood has also been informed, and
appropriate steps are being taken to ensure that all Council Departments
are aware of this rule.

Yours faithfully,




Acting Head of Department

Dear

Re:    Safety of Sports Grounds

I am in receipt of your letter dated 5th September 1989.

I confirm that the required information will be in your possession by 7th
September 1989.

In addition to the above I should be grateful   if you would advise me why i have
not had a reply to my letter dated 1st August   1989 re the evacuation prodedure.
I find this particularly disturbing as I have   received three aaended Safety
certificates (two of which were incorrect) in   which no nention is made of the
revised procedure.

I should be grateful if you could give this natter your earlyattention,     perhaps
by close of business on 7th September 1989?

Yours sincerely,

 D e a r Mr. M a c k r e l l ,

 Re; Safety of Sports Grounds

  I refer to previous correspondence in connection with this matter and your
  letter of 24th August. The General Purposes Panel of the City Council met on
  the 4th September 1989 to discuss the outstanding items of the interim
  recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.

 As far as the matters which required implementation before the commencement of
 the football season are concerned, there are three outstanding matters

  (a) Although you have confirmed that the Police are satisfied that the
      information on tickets is unambiguous and correlates with information
      provided inside and outside the ground, you have not yet supplied a copy of
      the revised tickets to enable the Local Authority to satisfy itself that
      this is in fact so.

  (b) You have not confirmed that the medical practitioner you propose to employ
      is trained and competent in advanced first /lid.

 Please also supply, as requested, a copy of ydhe 'jtfpeWarding plan" showing the
 location of the stewards.

 I look forward to hearing from you with^/response to these particular matters
 and also a substantive response to my ]£tter of 17th August. The members of the
 General Purposes Panel indicated that &nless a satisfactory response is received
 by the close of business on the 7th September, 1989, they feel they have no
 option but to consider the issue of a Prohibition Notice in respect of the
 Sports Ground.

I Yours EincerelyO

Dear Mr. Webster,

Re;   Safety of Sports Grounds - Capacity

I am in receipt of your letter dated 8th September 1989*

/As you are aware our Consulting Engineers, Messrs* Eastwood and Partners, are
 submitting plans in respect of the barriers on the Kop. we have agreed that
 included in these plans will be proposals to increase the perineter gates to 1.1
 metres.

In the meantime the Club acknowledges that the capacity will be reduced to
16,800 persons until the necessary work has been completed at which point the
capacity will revert to its existing level*

I lode forward to receiving your agreement to

Mr. G. H. Mackrell,

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds - Capacity

I refer to previous correspondence in relation to the capacity question of the
Sheffield Wednesday Sports Ground. The Fire Service have now completed their
assessment of capacity particularly in relation to means of escape from various
areas of the sports ground.

The Spion Kop

The Fire Service noted that there are five exit routes from the Kop excluding
forward routes on to the pitch. The following table has been produced in
respect of these exits:-

The units of exit width available via these exit routes is:

V      -    8    units    catering      for 3.840          people     in eight minutes
w -         8    units    catering      for 3.840          people     in eight minutes
X      -    6    units    catering      for 2.880          people     in eight minutes
Y      -    6    units    catering      for 2.880          people     in eight minutes
Z      -    7    units    catering      for 3,360          people     in eight minutes
           35    units    catering      for 16,800          people     in eight minutes

The Fire Service point out that exits X and Y whilst being accepted as six units
each are very tight on the limit and it is only by accepting an allowance for
overlap over handrails that they were accepted. To avoid any doubt in the
future the Fire Service wish to make it clear that constructions such as these
should have 1.1 metres clear between vertical uprights supporting the
handrail/barriers. The table makes it clear that the available units of exit
width would only permit 16,800 people to leave the Spion Kop in eight minutes as
is mentioned in paragraph 56 of the green guide. The Fire Service note that the
current capacity of the Kop (18,200) could only be evacuated in 8.6 minutes.

The Fire Service go on to point out that in previous calculations relating to
capacity, four of the pitch perimeter gates (numbered 2, 3, 4 and 5) were used
in the calculations at two units of exit.with each. However on recent checking
of the widths of these gates there were found to measure 950 mm, 1070 mm, 990 mm




                          For telephone enquiries on this matter please rin g ? ? .^ A ? P ...~ .N f.\. .®9fS?S%ode 0742)   R4602

  and 990 mm respectively when a minimum width of 1100 mm is required. Until the
  gates can be widened to 1100 mm it will be reasonable to accept each gate as one
  unit of exit width instead of two units. This would reduce the evacuation time
  for the 18,200 spectators to 7.8 minutes if the gates were used in an emergency
  situation.

  In view of the comments of the Fire Service the Council now has to decide what
  to do in relation to the capacity question and to the width of the gates in the
  pitch perimeter fence. Judging by recent comments made by Members of the
  General Purposes Panel it is unlikely that the Council will accept any standard
  lower than that set in the Green Guide and I imagine that the Panel will wish to
  reduce the capacity on the Kop to 16,800 people. I also imagine that it will
  require the pitch perimeter gates to be widened to a minimum of 1100 mm as soon
  as possible. Another point raised by the Fire Service is that in addition to
  the perimeter gates being at least 1.1 metres wide they should be provided with
  a level walk through arrangement off the terrace.

  The North West Terrace and West Stand

  The Fire Service have considered these areas again and regard them as reasonably
  acceptable in the short term pending a review of the whole of the west end of
  the sports ground*

  North and South Stands

  These stands are subject to separate review which is being conducted at the
  moment.

  I would like to have your comments on these points as soon as possible.   I
  anticipate that the General Purposes Panel will meet again to discuss the
  question of capacity fairly shortly and almost certainly by 16th September.

^^Yours faithfully,

   Dear Sir,

   Safety of Sports Grounds - Emergency Evacuation Procedure

   I refer to your letters of 1st August and 5th September in relation to the
   above procedure which is operated at your sports ground.

   I can confirm that your letter of 1st August was not in fact replied to
   although copies of it have been sent to the Fire Service, the Police, the
   Building Surveyor and the Council's Director of Health and Consumer
   Services. I have to say that on looking at the wording of your letter it is
   clear that the copy of the emergency evacuation procedure was sent to the
   Council in order that the Council's records could be updated.

   The question of emergency evacuation procedures will in due course be
   considered by the Council along with many other matters relating to safety
   of sports grounds as soon as possible. I anticipate that in due course an
   entirely new General Safety Certificate will be issued in respect of your
   sports ground.

   I take it from your letter of 5th September that you would wish that the
   emergency evacuation procedure be included in any new Certificate and I will
   keep your views in mind.

   If you need any further information on this matter please let me know.

 Mr. G. H. Mackrell,
 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic.,
 Hillsborough,
 Sheffield,
 S6 1SW.

 Dear Sirs,

 Safety of Sports Grounds - Electrical Certificates, etc in respect of the
 Sheffield Wednesday Sports Ground

 The Fire Service have recently written to me in connection with various
 Certificates, etc which have been recently submitted by you in respect of
 your sports ground.

 The Fire Service make the following points (which have been abbreviated)

  1.    The electrical test certificates which were handed over at the annual
        inspection in May this year do not include the public address system as
        is required by General Safety Certificate Condition 12.

 2.     It would be desirable if there was an annual test certificate in respect
        of the fire alarm system and although this is not included in the
        current General Safety Certificate, it is likely to be included in
        future Certificates.

 3.     The results of the 1988 inspection in relation to the emergency lighting
        appear to be satisfactory other than the duration of the battery test,
        this being only one hour instead of the required three hours. A test
        certificate for 1989 is now outstanding and should be submitted
        immediately owing to the reported state of the batteries.

  4.    On 27th January 1981 the South Yorkshire County Council accepted to what
        appears to be a variation of General Safety Certificate Condition 26
        relating to the timescale between electrical tests in accordance with
        the IEE Regulations. The timescales accepted at the time were five
        years for the South Stand and every two years for the North and West
        Stands. No certificates were received by the Fire Service between 1980
        and 1988. It is recommended that any revised General Safety Certificate
        Conditions should require electrical certificates every two years for
        all parts of the ground.




                                                                                          R4002
5.   As far as the certificates received in May 1989 are concerned, the
     emergency lighting test report dated 14th June 1988 refers to tests
     carried out on a one hour maintained system (denoted by "M/1") the
     emergency lighting system should in fact be of three hour duration and
     it is essential that the duration of the batteries is determined
     particularly as the electrical contractor has indicated that the system
     may not last for much longer than 30 minutes. The contractor did state
     on a later visit to the ground however, that he may have been mistaken
     on this point. A full battery discharge test must be carried out as
     soon as possible in order to determine the duration of the batteries,
     but if, as indicated they are coming to the end of their life, they must
     be replaced with batteries having a discharge capacity of at least three
     hours.

6.   The emergency lighting system must comply in all respects with BS5266:
     part 1 and thereafter be maintained in accordance with that standard.

7.   The 1988 IEE Certificate covering the general electrical installation
     listed numerous defects, but there is no indication that these were ever
     remedied other than the 1989 certificate which listed a much smaller
     number of defects. Again there is no indication to date that any work
     has been carried out to rectify these defects.

Would you please consider the points made by the Fire Service and let me
have your views on them as soon as possible.

Yours faithfully,

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds - Capacity on the Spion Kop

 I refer to my letter of the 8th September and your reply of the 12th. I
 note that you have no objection to the capacity on the Kop being reduced to
 16,800 persons until certain works on the Kop have been completed. The
 General Purposes Panel at its meeting on Friday 15th September is likely to
 amend your existing General Safety Certificate to reflect the reduced
 capacity. If the Panel does follow that course of action, it will be for
 the Club to apply at a later date for a further amendment to the Certificate
 to reflect an increased capacity.

 I think it is onlyfair to point out that the General Purpose Panel is
 likely to in future strictly apply the Green Guide in relation to all
 aspects of Safety at Sports Grounds and I imagine that it will not, without
 very weighty reasons, depart from the Guide.

 I will, of course, be in touch with you as soon as possible after the
 meeting on Friday. If I can be of further       assistance please do nothesitate
 to let me know.

 Dear Sir,

 Recommendation 17 of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report

 I refer to your letter of 18th September in which you enquire about progress
 on implementing Recommendation 17. In your letter you point out that many
 of the other recommendations have been either implemented or are in a fairly

 For your information the Policy Committee of the City Council will consider
 amongst other things the question of Recommendation 17 and when guidance is

Dear Mr Webster

Re: Safety of Sports Grounds Act

Further to my letter dated 7th September 1989, please find enclosed a
copy of our plan showing the deployment of Stewards. I would point out,
of course, that this is a basic plan and subject to amendment in agreement
with the police for individual matches.

Should there be any further fundamental alterations, I will of course
send a revised plan.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Webster

Fe: Safety of Sports Grounds - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
Pitch Perimeter Pence Gates

I am in receipt of your letter dated 21st September 1989.

I must say that I believe you have rather overfeacted with regard
to the correspondence. The Club and its professional advisers
were merely seeking the opinion of the Police to assist it in
formulating it* plans for submission to the Local Authority.

If we are not able to proceed in this way, then progress would
take place at an unacceptably slower pace.

Yours sincerely

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
 - Pitch Perimeter Fence Gates_____            ____________

 I attach for your information a copy of a letter I have received from
 Messrs. Eastwood & Partners which as you can see was directed to Chief
 Superintendent Nesbitt.

 I am merely writing to confirm that any agreement reached between the Club
 and the Police in relation to this issue will not be in any way binding on
 the Council as Certificating Authority.

 1 have written to both the Police and Eastwoods in similar terms and have
 asked the Police for details of the discussions so that reference can be
 made to the Council's Advisory Group

  Yours faithfully,

                        After our telephone conversation on the morning of 13 September
         I had another conversation with Chief Inspector David Beal that
         afternoon.                   He was returning my call to him made to Hammerton Road
         that morning.
                        He said that the gates should in fact be provided in the
         openings.                 Clarification on whether or not gates are to be installed
         would be welcomed.                                        We propose that the clear width between the
         frames is 1200mm so that if gates are to be fitted, sooner or later,
         the clear exit width will be not less than 1100mm.                                                                                      If gates are
         to be fitted they would be installed with the same quick-release
         device that is on them at present.                                                              Your comments would be welcomed
         about the width and release device.

                                                                                                       Yours sincerely,

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
    - Pitch Perimeter Fence Gates___________________ . ________

    I have received a copy of a letter from Messrs Eastwood & Partners to
    Mr. Nesbitt dated 15th September, which appears to reflect some discussions
    between the Police and Eastwoods about pitch perimeter gates, I enclose a
    copy of Eastwood's letter for your information.

    The letter implies that there has been some kind of Agreement.as to the
    existence or otherwise of pitch perimeter fence gates. 1 am extremely
    concerned about this in view of the fact that the matter has not been
    discussed by the Advisory Group or referred to Members of the Council.

    I am writing to make it clear that any agreements that may be arrived at in
    connection with matters of the sort referred to in Eastwood's letter will
    not in any way be binding on the Council as Certificating Authority. This
    type of issue was referred to in my letter to you and to the Club's of 30th
    August.

    Please advise me immediately of the full terms of the discussions so that
    the matter can be referred to the Advisory Group.   I havecopied this letter
    to Sheffield Wednesday and to Eastwoods in similar terms.

    Yours faithfully,

   obviously sensible that the Club and its professional advisers discuss
   matters with the Police, and indeed other members of the Advisory Group
   when formulating its views upon safety issues. The purpose of my letter
   was merely to remind everyone that the City Council is the Certificating
   Authority and as such the booty empowered to make decisions.

   I look forward to hearing from you when matters are in their conclusive
   stage so that the matter can be referred to members of the City Council
   if necessary.

   Yours sincerely,




   Acting Head of Department

       Dear Mr. Strange,

       Re: Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
       Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975_________

       I refer to your letter of the 15th September concerning replacement of
       gates. I have now obtained the views of the Fire Service upon this matter
       and enclose a copy of their letter for your information.

       The Advisory Group plans to meet shortly to discuss the items of work which
       have been carried out pursuant to the annual inspection and list of
       requirements. I propose to refer this matter to them for their
       consideration.

       Yours sincerely,

  Dear Sir

  SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS - HILLSBOROUGH

  In reply to your letter dated 20th September, 1989 and enclosing letter from
  Eastwood and Partners dated 15th September, 1989, with respect to replacement
  of existing sliding gates with outward opening gates, as far as this
  department is concerned there is no reason to change the view that the sliding
  gates should be replaced with outward opening gates as and when due for
  replacement for whatever reason.

  On reading through this authorities' submission to the Hillsborough Inquiry,
  there does not appear to be any reference to the use of sliding gates or the
  Fire Service attitude to them.

  If there are any further queries on this matter, please do not hesitate to
  contact the officer concerned.

  Yours faithfully




  Chief Fire Officer

       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
       Hillsborough,
       SHEFFIELD.
       S6 1SW

       Dear Sir,

       Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group

       I refer to your letter of 17th October and to your previous conversation with
       Mrs* Woodhead of my Department.

       Firstly I enclose a copy of the report which I have recently submitted to the
       Policy Committee of the City Council with regard to this issue. I believe the
       report is self-explanatory and my purpose in writing to you is to attain your
       views on various matters in relation to the proposed Advisory Group which was
       described by Lord Justice Taylor in his interim report. The Council propose to
       set up a group along the lines described by Lord Justice Taylor but for ease of
       reference and to avoid confusion with the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory
       Group (which will continue in its present form) X propose that it be called the
       Safety of Sports Grounds Forum. Obviously this title is subject to review and
       could be changed at any time.

       1 have thought of a number of points which need to be considered at this stage
       prior to a first meeting of the forum upon which I would welcome your comments:-

       (a)    Frequency of meetings - it might be appropriate for the forum to meet about
              once every three or four months.

       (b)    Location of meetings - Room ^meetings could be provided at the Town Hall
              or perhaps at other venues in the City (perhaps at club premises).

       (c)    Issues to be discussed by the forum - the wording of the interim
              recommendation indicates that matters concerned with crowd safety should be
              discussed.

       (d)     Visits to football matches - it might be appropriate for each member of the
               forum to arrange to attend football matches at least two to three times per
               year.

       (e)    Procedure of the forum - it would perhaps be appropriate to have a first
              meeting so as to establish the method of operation of the forum so that all
              the members of it will fully understand its procedures etc.. I anticipate
              that It will probably be serviced by the Council.

          In addition to your comments on the above points I would welcome details of any
          recognised supporters’ club as referred to in recommendation 17 sothat I can
          get in touch with them and ask them for their views-

          From a legal standpoint the    forum itself will have no       authority   assuch but
          obviously the Council would    take note of any comments it chose to make.

          I would welcome your views on the points I have raised and when I have received
          them from yourself and Sheffield United and Owlerton I will then take steps to
          set up the forum as quickly as possible. I look forward to hearing from you
          fairly shortly*

               Matters for Consideration

                A number of matters now require members' consideration; these include

                (i)           The staffing requirements necessary for the effective and efficient
                              running of the licensing service.

                (ii)          The level of fees which should be charged for the issuing of
                              certificates and the length of such certificates.

                (iii)         The future administrative arrangements and decision-making procedures
                              required to operate the service.

                This report addresses these three issues in turn.

                (i)           Staffing

                           It has to be said that the existing staffing arrangements in the
                          ■Licensing Section of my Department are totally incapable of handling
                           the additional volume of work likely to arise from the implementation
                           of the recommendations of the Taylcr Report as well as the existing
                           licensing obligations. Members will see that the report to MEGS
                           Programme Committee recognises this and proposes a new structure
                           and additional staffing to handle the increased workload. It has
                           to be said that the additional expenditure of £26,400 needed to
                         • implement this additional staffing requirement cannot be found
                           from within the provisional cash limit notified to the Department
                           for 1990/91. It may be possible to meet some limited expenditure
                           in the remainder of the current financial year but not in a full
                           year.

                (ii)          Fees

                              At the present time fees are not charged by the Council for the
                              issuing or amendment of any safety certificate. Regulation 14
                              of the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 enables a local
                              authority to "determine the fees to be chargged in respect of
                              applications for the issue or amendment of safety’certificates
                              but such fees must not in a particular case exceed an amount
                              commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done."

                              The guidance quoted in the Taylor Report is that every safety
                              certificate should be reviewed annually and renewed annually;
                              therefore it can only be assumed that the expenditure will increase.

                                                                           r ^ o ^ endatiaHs 'of^the Taylor '. .<
                                  Report state that a local authority should review its administrative
                                  arrangements and set up an effective Advisory Group with a Chairman
                                  from the local authority and an effective procedure which should
                                  produce regular written reports for consideration by the local
                                  authority.

                                  The revised administrative structure that is summarised in the
                                  report to MSGS Programme Committee would in my view provide an
                                  administrative structure within my Department which would enable
                                  the Council to deal adequately with the administration of the
                                  certificate, but clearly the Council must consider whether its
                                  procedures would need to be amended in the light of the recommendations.

                                  So far as the Advisory Group recommendation is concerned, such
                                  a Group already exists, although it does not have representatives
                                  from the Clubs and Supporters' Club and is at present charied by
                                  one of my Principal Solicitors. Members may wish to consider whether
                                  these arrangements are considered satisfactory or whether it would
                                  be appropriate for the local authority Chairman to be a member
                                  rather than an officer. In any event, members should consider
                                  whether it is desirable that an Advisory Group reporting directly
                                  to the Council on matters related to safety of the public should
                                  include representatives of the Clubs and Supporters1 Clubs or

                                  whether an additional body including representatives of Clubs and
                                  Supporters' Clubs should be created to advise the Advisory Group
                                  as and when appropriate.

                                  I am of the opinion that the Council should be advised in the exercise
                                  of its functions under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act by an
                                  independent and impartial Advisory Group, chaired by one of my
                                  senior officers as at present and consisting of the professional
                                  officers who have an input into the recommendations that the Council
                                  need to consider. To include representatives of the clubs, stadia
                                  and supporters' clubs on such a Group would cloud the matter and
                                  leave the public, and indeed the Council, unclear on the role of
                                  the Group, since inevitably the views of the clubs and supporters
                                  will be based on different attitudes from those of professional
                                  officers with a responsibility to advise the Council on the exercise
                                  of its functions.

                                  X feel that the views of the Taylor Report on the importance of
                                  consulting clubs, stadia and supporters should be recognised by
                                  the creation of a different group, which would contain representatives
                                  of the formal Advisory Group and of the clubs and supporters and
                                  whose function would be to Taake representations to the Advisory
                                  Group and through it the Council on matters of particular concern

                              It would seem to be consistent with that decision that the licensing
                              functions of the Council should in due course be transferred to
                              Health and Consumer Services Programme Committee, presumably at
                              the same time as this Committee considers the date of transfer
                              of the other licensing functions. Such a decision should, however,
                              take into account the need to consider what level the delegation
                              to the Programme Committee and any Panels or offices would need
                              to be established.


                 Recommendations

                 Members are asked to note this report and to

                 (i)          agree with the proposed new staffing structure and to indicate
                              how this should be funded;

                 (ii)         agree with the basis of charging fees;

                 (iii)        agree with the recommendations concerning the future of the Advisory
                               Group, its constitution and chairmanship and also with the creation
                               of a separate group including representatives of the stadia and
                               chaired by a member of the Council; and

                 :iv)         consider what Committee/Panel arrangements should be brought into
                               force to deal with the statutory responsibilities of the Council
                               under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, in the light of the

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group

I refer to your letter of 17th October and to your previous conversation with
Mrs. Woodhead of my Department.

Firstly I enclose a copy of the report which I have    recently submitted to the
Policy Committee of the City Council with regard to this issue.   I believe the
report is self-explanatory and my purpose in writing to you is to obtain your
views on various matters in relation to the proposed Advisory Group which was
described by Lord Justice Taylor in his interim report. The Council propose to
set up a group along the lines described by Lord Justice Taylor but for ease of
reference and to avoid confusion with the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory
Group (which will continue in its present form) I propose that it be called the
Safety of Sports Grounds Forum.  Obviously this title is subject to review and
could be changed at any time.

I have thought of a number of points which need to be considered at this stage
prior to a first meeting of the forum upon which I would welcome your comments

(a)     Frequency of meetings - it might be appropriate for the forum to meet about
        once every three or four months.

(b)     Location of meetings - Roomformeetings could be provided at the Town Hall
        or perhaps at other venues in the City (perhaps at club premises).

(c)     Issues to be discussed by the forum - the wording of the interim
        recommendation indicates that matters concerned with crowd safety should be
        discussed.

(d)     Visits to football matches - it might be appropriate for each member of the
        forum to arrange to attend football matches at least two to three times per
        year.

(e)     Procedure of the forum - it would perhaps be appropriate to have a first
        meeting so as to establish the method of operation of the forum so that all
        the members of it will fully understand its procedures etc.. I anticipate
        that it will probably be serviced by the Council.

                           For telephone enquiries on this matter please ring........................................ (STD Code 0742)   R4602

                                                         Telex 54243 (Administration & Legal)
In addition to your comments on the above points I would welcome details of any
recognised supporters' club as referred to in    recommendation 17so that I can
get in touch with them and ask them for their views.

From a legal standpoint the   forum itself will have no authority  as such but
obviously the Council would   take note of any comments it chose to make.

I would welcome your views on the points I have raised and when I have received
them from yourself and Sheffield United and Owlerton I will then take steps to
set up the forum as quickly as possible.  I look forward to hearing from you
fairly shortly.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

Purpose of Report
 ■■■“ ■■ ^ --■■ ^ ■■ ■ '
The purpose of this report is to provide a summary of action taken by.the
City Council since the Hillsborough disaster and-also to address the general
recommendations of the Taylor Report regarding the issuing of safety
certificates by the City Council as the enforcing authority.

Copies of the following reports are attached:-

(a)        Report of the Director of Social Services to Family and Community
           Services Programme Committee on 10th May on the involvement of
           the staff of his Department and recommending the setting up of
           a task team. The recommendations were approved.

(b)       Report of the Director of Libraries and Information Services to
          this Committee on 23rd May.

(c)       Report of the Director of Health and Consumer Services to Health
          and Consumer Services Programme Committee on 20th June concerning
          the involvement of his Department's staff.

(d)       Report of the Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department
          to General Purposes Panel on 17th August, 1989 advising members
          of interim action taken.

(e)      Report of the Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department
          to MEGS Programme Committee on 18th September together with supporting
          documents which informed members of action already taken and made
          a number of recommendations for future action.  The recommendations
          of the Committee will be reported verbally.

(f)      A copy of the Prohibition Notice served on Owlerton Sports Stadium.

(g)      Copies of letters from South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service,
         - the Building Surveyor, Department of Land and Planning and the
          Director of Health and Consumer Services on the review of the
          administration and inspection system.


Summary of Action Taken

The report to MEGS Programme Committee summarises the action which has
already been taken by the Council in its capacity as licensing authority
and no need is seen to repeat it here; however, members should be aware
that the General Purposes Panel, acting under delegated powers, considered
a report of the Advisory Group at its meeting on 15th September concerning
Owlerton Stadium and resolved to serve a Prohibition Notice with immediate
effect.

Members should also be aware that the Advisory Group is at present being
chaired by one of the Department's Principal Solicitors as an interim
measure pending a decision by the Council on its future and to respond :
to the views of the Taylor Report that the Group should be chaired by a
senior officer.

Finally, the views of other interested bodies and Departments have been
requested on how. the responsibilities-of "the Council should be carried.'."
out in future; as already indicated, copies of these observations are attached.


Matters for Consideration

A number of matters now require members' consideration; these include

(i)      The staffing requirements necessary for the effective and efficient
         running of the licensing service.

(ii)     The level of fees which should be charged for the issuing of
          certificates and the length of such certificates.

(iii)    The future administrative arrangements and decision-making procedures
         required to operate the service.

This report addresses these three issues in turn.

(i )     Staffing

          It has to be said that the existing staffing arrangements in the
         'Licensing Section of my Department are totally incapable of handling
          the additional volume of work likely to arise from the implementation
          of the recommendations of the Taylor Report as well as the existing
          licensing obligations.  Members will see that the report to MEGS
          Programme Committee recognises this and proposes a new structure
          and additional staffing to handle the increased workload.   It has
          to be said that the additional expenditure of £26,400 needed to
        • implement this additional staffing requirement cannot be found
          from within the provisional cash limit notified to the Department
          for 1990/91.  It may be possible to meet some limited expenditure
          in the remainder of the current financial year but not in a full
          year.

(ii)     Fees

         At the present time fees are not charged by the Council for the
         issuing or amendment of any safety certificate. Regulation 14
         of the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 enables a local
         authority to "determine the fees to be chargged in respect of
         applications for the issue or amendment of safety certificates
         but such fees must not in a particular case exceed an amount
         commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done."

         The guidance quoted in the Taylor Report is that every safety
         certificate should be reviewed annually and renewed annually;
         therefore it can only be assumed that the expenditure will increase.

         According:y it is recommended that with immediate effect fees bv
         cnarged to aj..: appxicants for safety certificates at whatever iev^l
         is considered to be appropriate for the work cone - clearly, fees
              may be different in different cases. Any increased income would
>
            . of coarse be used to offset the increased expenditure referred
              to above.                             .....

    (iii)    Future Administrative Arrangements

             Paragraphs 16 and 17 of the. interim recommendations of. the Taylor
             Report state that a local authority should review its administrative
             arrangements and set up an effective Advisory Group with a Chairman
             from the local authority and an effective procedure which should
             produce regular written reports for consideration by the local
             authority.

             The revised administrative structure that is summarised in the
             report to MEGS Programme Committee would in my view provide an
             administrative structure within my Department which would enable
             the Council to deal adequately with the administration of the
             certificate, but clearly the Council must consider whether its
             procedures would need to be amended in the light of the recommendations.

             So far as the Advisory Group recommendation is concerned, such
             a Group already exists, although it does not have representatives
             from the Clubs and Supporters' Club and is at present charied by
             one of my Principal Solicitors.  Members may wish to consider whether
             these arrangements are considered satisfactory or whether it would
             be appropriate for the local authority Chairman to be a member
             rather than an officer.  In any event, members should consider
             whether it is desirable that an Advisory Group reporting directly
             to the Council on matters related to safety of the public should
             include representatives of the Clubs and Supporters' Clubs or

             whether an additional body including representatives of Clubs and
             Supporters' Clubs should be created to advise the Advisory Group
             as and when appropriate.

            I am of the opinion that the Council should be advised in the exercise
            of its functions under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act by an
            independent and impartial Advisory Group, chaired by one of my
            senior officers as at present and consisting of the professional
            officers who have an input into the recommendations that the Council
            need to consider. To include representatives of the clubs, stadia
            and supporters' clubs on such a Group would cloud the matter and
            leave the public, and indeed the Council, unclear on the role of
            the Group, since inevitably the views of the clubs and supporters
            will be based on different attitudes from those of professional
            officers with a responsibility to advise the Council on the exercise
            of its functions.

            I feel that the views of the Taylor Report on the importance of
            consulting clubs, stadia and supporters should be recognised by
            the creation of a different group, which would contain representatives
            of the formal\Advisory Group and of the clubs and supporters and
            whose function would be to make representations to the Advisory
            Group and through it the Council on matters of particular concern
        to the members, whether on the functions of the Council under the
        Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 or otherwise- Such a group could     ,
        appropriately be chaired by a member of the Council tb emphasise
        the link recommended by the Taylor Report.-j^' -• s        •Vi • •

(iv)    Future Decision'— Making Arrangements T ; -r'   n : % v " ’

        Finally, any consideration of the Council's procedures must clearly
        include the formal decision-making process of the Council. At
        present the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of
        Sports Grounds Act 1975 are delegated to the General Purposes Panel
        of MEGS Programme Committee, with urgent matters delegated further
        to me. Members need to consider whether this arrangement is
        satisfactory, and if not, whether another Committee or Sub-Committee
        of the Council should be responsible for such matters. Members
        need to be aware that Annual Council resolved at its meeting on
        17th May that ".... the powers and duties exercised by MEGS Programme
        Committee in relation to licensing matters be referred to the Health
        and Consumer Services Programme Committee

        It would seem to be consistent with that decision that the licensing
        functions of the Council should in due course be transferred to
        Health and Consumer Services Programme Committee, presumably at
        the sane time as this Committee considers the date of transfer
        of the other licensing functions. Such a decision should, however,
        take into account the need to consider what level the delegation
        to the Programme Committee and any Panels or offices would need
        to be established.


Recommendations

Members are asked to note this report and to

vi)     agree with the proposed new staffing structure and to indicate
        how this should be funded;

(ii)    agree with the basis of charging fees;

(iii)   agree with the recommendations concerning the future of the Advisory
         Group, its constitution and chairmanship and also with the creation
        of a separate group including representatives of the stadia and
        chaired by a member of the Council; and

.iv)    consider what Committee/Panel arrangements should be brought into
        force to deal with the statutory responsibilities of the Council
        under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, in the light of the
        decision of teh Council on 17th May.

To: All Football League Clubs


Dear Sirs

Following the extensive investigation into crowd control and safety at the Public Inquiry
into the Hillsborough Disaster, The Football Association consider that the Memorandum on
Crowd Management dated 18th November 1985 has been superseded by the Interim Report produced
by Lord Justice Taylor. In addition, the Crowd Safety Memorandum and Certificate printed on
pages 342-345 of the current Association Handbook should be disregarded (our letter of 1st
September 1989 refers).

The Football Association have therefore compiled a new document entitled "Crowd Safety
Information" in which we have extracted the recommendations from the Taylor Report which, we
believe, will be a helpful guide to all Football League clubs. Also contained are extracts
from the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 Edition) (the Green Guide). The
recommendations take the form of guidelines but represent, in the words of Lord Justice
Taylor himself, "the minimum necessary to ensure that existing football grounds can for the
present be safely used." In addition these are meant to complement the recommendations that
Mr Justice Popplewell set out after his Inquiry at Bradford.

We are aware that many clubs will already have implemented the recommendations.
Nevertheless, there have been suggestions in the press that even some of those asterisked (to
be carried out before the 1989/90 season starts) have not been implemented. These
allegations must be a matter of concern to all those involved in football and it is hoped the
enclosed document will give you a convenient reference point from which to ensure that safety
issues get the priority they deserve. It is issued with the support of The Football League
and recent communications from FIFA endorse many of the recommendations. It may be that
further recommendations are made when the final report is published at the end of the year.
                                                             ie
One of the issues Lord Justice Taylor has still'to deal with is the problem of ticket touts.
The Football Association have been advocating the undesirability of touts for many years and
see the main problems as:

(i)             bona fide supporters without a ticket can only obtain one at an inflated rate;

(ii)            a build up of non-ticket holders outside the grounds; and

(iii)              rival supporters may end up in the same area thus reducing the effect of segregation.


Whilst appreciating all the difficulties associated with the removal of ticket touts, we urge
clubs to do their utmost to minimise the number outside grounds.

    Justice Taylor and would, therefore, be interested to receive, within the next fourteen days,
    any comments on the recommendations with special reference to any difficulties encountered by
    your particular club.

    I also take this opportunity of informing you that              }f this Office is now
    undertaking the role of Crowd Management Co-ordinator and will be pleased to discuss these
    and related matters.

CROWD SAFETY INFORMATION




               SEPTEMBER 1989
                         TAYLOR REPORT - CHAPTER 24
                           INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONS


315. The recommendations which follow are the minimum necessary to
ensure that existing football grounds can for the present be safely
used, based upon the evidence which I have heard at Sheffield and
other information I have received. They complement the
recommendations which Mr Justice PoppleweU set out after his inquiry
at Bradford.

316. Those which are asterisked should be carried out before the
1989/90 season starts. The rest should be started forthwith and
completed as soon as possible.


Maximum Capacities for Terraces

* 1. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which
   are self contained, the Safety Certificate should specify the
   maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or
   area.

    A pen or area is to be deemed "self-contained" notwithstanding that
    it has a gate or gates affording access to another pen or area and
    whether such gate or gates be open dr shut.

* 2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in
   accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide ("the Green Guide
   figure") subject to the following qualifications:-

    (a) in arriving at "the Green Guide figure", proper and realistic
           allowance must be made for all factors which should reduce the
           permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum
           figures specified in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green
           Guide;
    (b) after assessing "the Green Guide figure", a deduction of 15%
           should be made to improve the safety margin.

* 3. Arrangements should be made:-

    (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained
            pen or area to the maximum capacity figure assessed in
            accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically,
            mechanically, by a ticketing arrangement, by counting or
            otherwise, and
    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its
           maximum capacity is about to be reached.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces

* 4. There should be a written agreement between the club and
   police setting out their respective responsibilities for crowd
   safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-
   contained pen or other terraced area and the monitoring of
   spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
   variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match
   should be agreed in writing in advance.
* 5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter.track, for each
   self-contained pen or other terraced area, a steward (if the club
   is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are
   monitoring it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that
   area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the period
   the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should
   be in addition to any other steward, or police presence. He should
   have ready access to the police officer authorised under
   Recommendation 9 below, and by radio to the control room.


Fences and Gates

      6. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to
    the terraced areas and especially those with duties under
    Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with
    regard to the recognition of crowd densities, to the recognition
    of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should
    include demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed
    to enable stewards and officers to recognise different crowd
    densities.

* 7. All .gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-
   contained areas should be painted in a different colour from the
   rest of the fence and marked "Emergency Exit".

* 8. Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch
   should be kept fully open during the period when spectators are
   on the terrace.

* 9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence
   (or group of gates if they are close together) a police officer
   authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a
   gate to relieve overcrowding. The officer so authorised in respect
   of .each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so
   by all stewards and police officers in that vicinity. He should be
   able to make radio contact with the control room either himself or
   via an officer close at hand.

* 10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided
   by the club at each ground where there are perimeter fences to
   permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers
   of spectators if necessary. Agreement should be reached as to
   whether the equipmentshould be used by police, the fire brigade,
   or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so.
   Whether to use it should be a decision of a nominated senior police
   officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers

* 11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately
   for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found to be affected by a
   significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

* 12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be
   reviewed immediately to ensure that it complies with the criteria
   contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the
   assessment of the maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced
   area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should reflect the
   fact.
Safety Certificates

      13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate
    by the responsible local authority, which should consult the club
    in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire
    service, the ambulance service and the building authority. Such a
    review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its object
    should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the
    Certificate are complied with and to add or substitute any
    condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following
    the findings and recommendations in this report.
      14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports
    stadium designated under the 1975 Act for which no Safety
    Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to
    remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local
    authority at least once annually and each Certificate should
    require to be renewed annually.

      16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for
    issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing, amending and renewing
    Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists
    or is provided an aecountable administrative structure whereby the
    functions of the local authority are regularly and effectively
    supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions
    are properly taken in accordance with the local authority’s rules.

   . 17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it
     should set up an Advisory Group consisting of appropriate members
     of its own staff, representatives of tjie police, of the fire and
     ambulance services, of the building authority, of the club and of a
     recognised supporters’ club. The Advisory Group’s terms of
     reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety
     and should require regular visits to the ground and attendance at
     matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local
   ’ authority, and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be
     recorded and it should be required to produce regular written
     reports for consideration by the local authority.


Duties of each Football Club

* 18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of
   flow measured. Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to
   ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators
   at the rate anticipated.
* 19. T he correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and
   the turnstiles serving it should be such as to ensure that all the
   spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass
   through the turnstiles “within one hour. If that cannot be done,
   the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced accordingly.

* 20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of
   the area served by them is about to be reached and arrangements
   should be made to ensure quick and effective communications with
   turnstile operators for this purpose.
      21. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable
    crowd densities outside the ground, within concourse areas and in
    pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and
    throughout a match.

* 22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the
   ground should be comprehensively reviewed. It should, in relation
   to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching,
   simple and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid
   movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing area.

* 23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear
   and should correlate absolutely with the information provided in
   respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained
   ticket stubs should contain information necessary to guide
   spectators once inside the ground.

* 24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position
   by a particular time should be reviewed by clubs in conjunction
   with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned
   arrangements for admitting spectators to the ground.

      25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as
    to the provision of pre-match entertainment aimed at attracting
    spectators to the ground in good time.


Police Planning

* 26. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there
   is one designated stadium or more should nominate a chief officer
   to liaise with the management of each football club and local
   authority concerned in respect of the safety and control of
   crowds.

* 27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium
   and the pre-match briefing of all officers on duty there should
   alert such officers to the importance of preventing any
   overcrowding and, if any is detected, of taking appropriate steps
   to remedy it.

* 28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium
   should enable the police to cope with any foreseeable pattern in
   the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It
   should provide for sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment
   of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

* 29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion
   of the officer in -command at the ground. Crowd safety should be
   the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

     30. There should be available in the police control room the
   results of all closed circuit television monitoring outside and
   inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical
   counting of numbers at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any
   area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
   in the interpretation and use of these data.
Communications

      31. There should be sufficient operators in the police control
    room to enable all radio transmissions to be received, evaluated
    and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators
    in the control room priority over, and the capacity to override,
    others using the same channel. Additional channels should be used,
    where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves.
    Consideration should be given to sound-proofing the control room
    against excessive crowd noise.

     32. To complement radio communications, there should be a
    completely separate system of land lines with telephone links
    between the control room and key points at the ground.

      33. Within the control room, there should be a public address
    system to communicate with individual areas outside and inside
    the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground.
    Important announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to
    catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of noise in
    the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on
    every programme sold for every match.

      34. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising
    boards to address the crowd. Consideration should also be given
    to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to
    indicate to the control room the existence of certain emergencies
    or requirements.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services

* 35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain
   through senior nominated officers regular liaison concerning crowd
   safety at each stadium.

* 36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should
   ensure that the fire service and ambulance service are given full
   details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the
   number of spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and
   exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties concerning
   the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be
   readily available in the control rooms of each of the emergency
   services.
* 37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium
   of emergency vehicles from all three services should be reviewed.
   They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and
   accessibility within the ground itself.

* 38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should
   be briefed as to the contingency plans for the arrival of emergency
   services and should be informed when such services are called as to
   where and why they are required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances

* 39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one
   trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The club should have the
   responsibility for securing such attendance.
         40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms.
       The number of such rooms and the equipment to be maintained within
       them should be specified by the local authority after taking
       professional medical advice and should be made a requirement of any
       Safety Certificate.

   * 41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at
      each match and available to deal with any medical exigency at the
      ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid.
      He should be present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off
      and should remain until half an hour after the end of the match.
      His whereabouts should be known to those in the police control
      room and he should be immediately contactable.

   * 42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate
      ambulance authority should be in attendance at all matches with an
      expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

        43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where
      larger crowds are expected should be specified by the local
      authority afteT consultation with the ambulance service and should
      be made a requirement of the Safety Certificate.


                        GUIDE TO SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS
                                 (1986 EDITION)



        9. Crush Barriers and Handrails



     112. The maximum spacing of crush barriers will be dependant on
     the gradient of the terrace or viewing slope. Paragraphs 113-119
     below give recommendations for the spacing and strength of crush
     barriers.

     113. Ideally, crush barriers should be provided along the full
     width of a terrace, with gaps only at the radial gangways.

     114. Where barriers are not continuous between radial gangways,
     the alignment of gaps in successive rows of barriers on a terrace
     should form an angle of less than 60“ to the barriers. There should
     be no more than 2 consecutive gaps in any line of gaps. (See Figure
     3 below).

                                                                      T
                                                                      /

Figure 3 Arrangement of gaps between crush barriers
  115. Where there are gaps in the line of crudi barkers these
  should be at least 1.1 metres and not more than 1.4 metres in
  width.
  116. Column A in Table 1 below provides the maximum distances
  between barriers conforming to the greater strength requirements
  of crush barriers as described above; column B provides the maximum
  distances between barriers conforming to the lesser strength
  requirements. Interpolation may be made between these figures.

  117. A distinction is made between barrier intervals required in
  "peak" viewing areas. The term "peak" viewing areas describes the
  most popular parts of the terraces where there is a tendency for
  spectators to crowd together and become so emotionally involved in
  the occasion that their reactions can cause additional pressures to
  be set up in those sections of the ground. The peak viewing areas
  are particularly associated with football grounds and are typically
  behind the goal areas, although other parts of the terraces known
  locally may come within this category.

Terraces and viewing slopes

    221. Where crush barriers meet the strength and spacing guidelines
    of Chapter 9 the capacity of a terrace or viewing slope should be
    assessed from the area available for standing by allowing a packing
    density of between 54 and 27 persons per 10 square metres depending
    upon the condition of the terrace or slope. Only those parts of
    the terrace or viewing slope from which the whole of the playing
    area can be seen, excluding gangways, should be included in this
    calculation.

    222. The extreme allowances for packing density are as follows:

     (a) 54 persons per 10 square metres when the terrace or viewing
           slope is in good condition (as set out in Chapter 8); and

     (b) 27 persons per 10 square metres when it materially deviates
           from the recommended guidelines, so as to constitute a
           possible hazard to individuals closely packed.

 Mr. G. H. Mackrell,

 Dear Sirs,

 Amendment to Safety Certificate

 As you are aware, the General Purposes Panel of the City Council met on
 Thursday, 17th August, 1989 to consider amendment of the Certificate for the
 Sports Ground.

 At that meeting, the General Purposes Panel confirmed the action of the
 Chief Executive in amending the Safety Certificate for Sheffield Wednesday
 Football Club on the 11th August, 1989. The General Purposes Panel also
 authorised the issue of a further Notice of Amendment. This further Notice
 is enclosed for your attention. You will note that there is a further
 amendment to Schedule 3 which has the effect of stating that the maximum
 capacity for the upper area of the North West Terrace shall be 2,300. Thus,
 the maximum total capacity for the Sports Ground is reduced to 43,724. For
 the sake of clarity, additional Condition 10 of the amended Certificate is
 amended to reflect that only the upper part of the terracing of the North
 West Terrace shall be used and only upon a contingency basis should the
 Police find it necessary.

 Pursuant to Dr. Eastwood's comments in relation to the North Stand (i.e.
 that the capacity figure did not take account of the disabled facilities)
 the Panel reduced the capacity of the North Stand to 9,700 as an interim
 measure.

 The General Purposes Panel also considered an emergency item pursuant to
 your letter dated the 16th August, 1989. Upon hearing representations from
 the Police and yourself upon this issue, the Panel decided that on condition
 that the number of turnstiles available for the use of spectators using the
 North Stand was increased from 12 to 14, the Panel was satisfied that it was
 appropriate to make use of the North Stand and that since additional
 turnstiles would be available, the existing capacity figure would remain
 unchanged.




                                                                                        734004
                           For telephone enquiries on this matter please r i n g . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. ...( S T D Code 0742)   •R 4 & )2

                                                           Telex 54243 (Administration & Legal}
It should be emphasised that this is seen as an interim measure only in view
of the difficulties there were in segregating fans at the Leppings Lane end
of the Ground.   It is understood that the matter is the subject of
discussion with the Police.   The Panel have insisted that they are made
aware of all discussions which take place and in any event wish to review
the matter further in September.   I, therefore, look forward to hearing from
you further in this respect and in any event no later than the 22nd
September, 1989.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

Re:       Safety Certificate - Hillsborough

I am in receipt of your letter dated 11th August 1989.

With regard to the items in Appendix 2 where a response has     been requested:

Ho. 3)       A copy of a report from Mayor Turnstiles is enclosed. A replacement
             for lUrnstile 50 which is situated at Penistone Road is on order.

No. 4)       A copy of theAgreement is enclosed.

NO. 7)       A copy of thenecessary letter from Dr. Eastwood is enclosed.

No. 8)      Amendments to the signposting of the ground and     the   printing ofthe
            tickets have been undertaken to the satisfaction of the South
            Yorkshire Police and Fire Service.

I would point out the amended ground capacity figures are, in fact, incorrect.
The area of the Lower North West Terrace is in fact Pen 6, part of the West
Terrace which is excluded from use (Appendix 2 No. 10) Hie capacity for the
North West Terrace should therefore be 2,300.

Finally, I would refer to the penultimate paragraph of myletter dated 28th July
1989 to your Administration and Legal Department. Last week the Working party
approved the Police request that access to the North Stand should be via
Penistone Road using turnstiles 77-88. Our concern over this policy was
confirmed in the findings of the Interim Report (Para 290). I would therefore
confirm ny request for a written ruling on this matter prior to Saturday's match.

Yours faithfully,



G.R. Kackrell

       AGREEMENT BETWEEN

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

            AND THE

      SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE
This document is a written agreement between South Yorkshire Police (hereafter

referred to as 'The Police') and Sheffield Wednesday Football    Club (hereafter

referred to as 'The Club').




This agreement signed on behalf of both parties is created in pursuance of

recommendation four of the Interim Report of the Inquiry held by The Rt Hon

Lord Justice Taylor   into the Hillsborough   Stadium Disaster of 15 April 1989.




The agreement between The Police and The Club is as follows:-




Maximum Capacities for Terraces

The Club will be responsible for limiting the number of spectators entering

each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity figure assessed in

accordance with recommendation two of the Interim Report.




The Club will do this by means of the computerised system which records the

number of persons passing through each turnstile.




The Club will inform the police control room when a particular pen or area is

approaching capacity.   The Club will be responsible for closing off further

access to a pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.      The

Police accept The Club may on occasions have difficulties in this regard,

therefore, The Police will provide assistance if necessary.




The Police accept that denial of access to any part of the ground may create

public order problems in respect of spectators so excluded and The Police will

prepare contingency plans to deal with such situations.




Filling and Monitoring Terraces

The Club will provide on the perimeter track a steward for each pen or

terraced area during such times that there are spectators in that pen or
■>

     terraced area.     The sole duty of these stewards, who will be in addition to

     any other stewards employed by The Club, will be to check crowd conditions in

     the pen or terraced area to which they are assigned for possible overcrowding

     or distress.     The Club will provide The Police with a plan of the ground

     showing where the stewards with this responsibility will be situated.




     The Police will provide in respect of each gate in the perimeter fence (or

     group of gates if they are close together) police officers authorised to

     decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve

     overcrowding.




     All police officers deployed at perimeter gates which will be kept fully open

     at all times when spectators are on the terraces, will be authorised as above.

     Each will be in possession of a police radio in direct contact with police

     ground control and will be identifiable by a distinctive coloured tabard.




 The stewards checking the crowd for overcrowding or distress will not be

 issued with police radios but the police officers on the gates and perimeter

     track will communicate to police ground control any relevant matter brought to

     their attention by these stewards.




 Cutting Equipment
                                  Ve
 The Club will provide and make readily available suitable and sufficient

 cutting equipment to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release

 numbers of spectators if necessary.        This cutting equipment will be operated

 by employees of The Club who will be trained in its use.        The use of such

 equipment will be at the discretion of the nominated senior police officer who

 will be the officer in charge of policing the event.
Liaison

Before each match both parties to this agreement will liaise in respect of the

following matters:-

     i)   the anticipated number of spectators expected having regard

          to the separate supporter groups;




    ii)   the method of crowd segregation (if any) intended to be used;




   iii)   any information in relation to crowd problems;




    iv)   the number and location of turnstiles to be made available

          to each group;




     v)   an estimation of the time it will take each group to pass

          through the turnstiles;




    vi)   where tickets are used, that the information on those tickets

          corresponds with the planned arrangements for admitting

          spectators to the ground.




Postponement of kick-off is at the discretion of the police officer in command

at the ground.   It is therefore essential The Club provide a telephone link

between the referee's room and the police control room.




The Police have prepared contingency plans for the event of emergency services

being called to the ground.   These include routes of access, rendezvous

points, accessibility within the ground and routes of egress.   The Police will

liaise with The Club concerning these arrangements whenever these plans are

amended or as otherwise appropriate.
The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police has nominated his Deputy,

Hr Peter Hayes QPM LLB HA, as the Chief Officer with responsibility for

liaison with the management of each football club and local authority

concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.




Any variation of this agreement in respect of a particular match will be

agreed by the parties in advance in writing.

    Dear Mr. Mackre.ll,
                                                                              Hillsborough Stadium
                                       Amendment of General Safety Certificate
                        I understand that under Appendix 2, item 7, which contains
    additional conditions to the Safety Certificate,                                                                                     there are
    requirements under sub-paragraphs                                                             (a) and                 (b) regarding
    inspection of crush barriers and a review of the layout.
    I am pleased to report to you as follows s-


    C ondltion 7 (a)
                    Following Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations, Mr. John
    Strange immediately carried out a visual inspection of all crush
    barriers for signs of corrosion.                                                              Indeed,               the inspection was
    much more thorough than required by Lord Justice Taylor's
    leport because it included scraping with a sharp instrument
    immediately inside the ends of tubes so as to better reveal the
    true extent of corrosion. As a result of Mr. Strange's inspection
    I am able to report that none of the barriers was found to be
    sufficiently affected by corrosion for it to be necessary for
    it to be repaired or replaced by 16 August,                                                                                1989.

  Condition 7 (b)
       The layout of all barriers in the ground has been
  reviewed.   As you will know, variations from the Green
  Guide were reported and were accepted at the time when the
  original Safety Certificate was issued in 1979.   Since then,
  various other modifications have been requested by South
  Yorkshire County Council or Sheffield City Council.       There arc
  further departures from the criteria contained in chapter 9
  of the Green Guide.   We are currently preparing scheme
  drawings.for re-arrangement of the various barriers so as
  to satisfy the guidelines.   When tenders are invited for the
  necessary works, we will also include such alterations or
  strengthening as may be necessary to cure incipient corrosion
  or other defects.
       As soon as the scheme drawings and specification are
  complete, we shall, of course, be submitting them on your
 behalf to the Sheffield City Council as licensing authority
  for their approval.


                                 Yours sincerely,

        Dear Sirs,

        Re: Safety of Sports Grounds - Hillsborough

        I enclose, for your attention, Notice of Amendment of the Safety
        Certificate. The amendments are as enumerated in Appendix 1 and additional
        conditions are as enumerated in Appendix 2. The amendments and additions
        reflect the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor which he required to be
        implemented before the commencement of the new Football Season.

        You will, therefore, appreciate that the issue of this Notice should be
        regarded merely as an interim temporary measure.  It is likely that further
        amendments will be required shortly.  In any event, the Council is in the
        process of drafting a completely new set of Conditions.  It is hoped that
        these will be in force in the near future.

        Please acknowledge receipt of this Notice.

        Yours faithfully,




        Chief- Executive

Dear Mr. Webster,

Re:   Safety of Sports Grounds - Hillsborough

I am in receipt of your letter dated 26th JUly 1989.

In respect of points you have raised, many have been covered by my letter dated
14th July 1989 and meeting of the Officer Working Party held here at
Hillsborough earlier today.

West Stand and Terrace

It has been agreed that the West Stand only will be used for the first matches
with Norwich and Everton. Turnstile arrangements and other associated matters
were agreed at today's meeting.

Stewarding and Crowd Control

This has been the subject of a meeting and correspondence between the Club and
the Police. Final points will be clarified at a further meeting to be held
early next week.

Management Responsibilities

These are noted and confirmed. I believe that you are in possession of all the
necessary information and the relevant officers have inspected the ground.
                                                      if
Football Association's interim Recommendations

I am of the opinion that recommendation (ii) pre-empts possible areas of comment
that may be made with the publishing of Lord Justice Taylor's Report, ftiis
matter should be looked at once the findings of the interim report have become
known.


                                       continued
Further Action

I believe that the Club and its advisors have addressed all short-term measures
in conjunction with the Police and St. Johns Ambulance Brigade. I have a
meeting with S.Y.M.A.S. next Tuesday and will keep you advised. Once the
interim report has been published we will obviously have to discuss how its
findings should be implemented. I will, of course, be pleased to clarify any
specific points you wish to raise.

Dr. Eastwood

I note your intentions.

An area of concern to me in the short-term is the Police intention to   access
supporters to the North Stand via the Penistone Road turnstiles only.    We have
several objections to these proposals, ranging from the inconvenience   caused to
our paying customers, through to the criticism made at the inquiry of   the
similar policy which was adopted on 15th April.

It was agreed to leave the matter in abeyance until the publication of the
interim report next week. If agreement cannot be reached then the Local
Authority will be called upon to make a written ruling on the matter. Mr.
Bownes of your Department can report further to you on this subject.

It is obvious to all parties that the existing Safety Certificate is patently
flawed and therefore once Lord justice Taylor has published his report I believe
the preparation of a new and effective Safety Certificate should be a matter of
some priority. In order to give the subject matter as much time as possible for
consideration I would welcome a sight the draft Safety Certificate which has
been circulated as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely,




G.H. Mackrell
Secretary

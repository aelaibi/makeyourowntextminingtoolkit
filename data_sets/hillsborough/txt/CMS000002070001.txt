HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY



I am sorry you have not received a reply before now to your notes
of 27 July and 23 August to Mr Sandiford about funding the
Hillsborough   Inquiry   and   the   possibility  of   talcing  a
supplementary estimate.

2. It is not proposed to take a supplementary estimate to cover
the difference between the £900,000 provision put into the
Revised Estimate for the Inquiry and the forecast spend of
£1,150,000 (notified in the 1st quarter FIS exercise).      The
difference is too small for that.

3.   As you know, we are currently forecasting a substantial
overspend on Vote 3, and it has not been possible so far to
identify spare provision to transfer to the Hillsborough subhead.
Nevertheless, there are no plans to restrict expenditure on the
Inquiry to estimate provision, and it is accepted that there will
be an overspend for which offsetting savings will have to be
found.

4. With the agreement of the Home Secretary, we have asked the
Treasury to agree (among other things) that the Home Office
running costs limit should be raised to take account of the
Inquiry's £260,000 running cost requirement.  I shall let you
know the outcome.

5.  If there is any danger that the Inquiry's cost will exceed
£1.125 million, please let me know immediately.

 Airfield fury
 at Georges
 beast’ slur
 LIVERPOOL reacted angrily last night to accusations by UEFA president
 Jacques Georges that hooliganism had caused the tragedy at Hillsborough.
  Georges, pinning the blame for the disaster on Liverpool supporters, claimed that
 Merseysiders have “a particularly aggressive mentality”.
   He said: “One had the impression they were beasts who wanted to charge into an arena. It wasn’t
 far from hooliganism,” he said.

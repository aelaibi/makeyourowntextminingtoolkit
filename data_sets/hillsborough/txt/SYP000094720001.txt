above        officer.                 These          fans       being            Nottingham              Forest       supporters.

Enroute        to       the       ground             via    Penistone                  Road,        it    was       noticeable             that    all

 the    public          houses             were       crowded,               with        personage             spilling          out       onto    the

 road    consuming                drink,             as    there            appeared           to    be    no       room       inside.

On     arrival          at    the          ground          the         fans       were        not    received             by    other       officers

 but    left       to    disperse                on       their         own.           This     was       so    even       though          I asked       a

 senior       officer             on       Penistone               R d,      as     to    whether          the       fans       should       be

 received          and       ushered             into        the        ground.

Once     the       fans       had          left       the       bus,         I    returned           to    the       Railway          Station          with

PC     BROOKES.              On       our       arrival            there          we     later       performed             a    second       P3V

,A t   about       3.04       pm       (1504) / t hat                  day       all     officers          in        the g y m        were

 requested          to       make          o u r /way        to        the       p e r 1 m e t e r t r a c.k ,        m y serial            did    so, I

 myself       being          accompanied                   by      PC       BROOKES.            On       arrival          there,          there

 appeared          to    be       a    pitch          invasion,                  however        seconds             later       it    was    apparent

 persons       had       been          injured             in      a    crush          behind        the       Liverpool             goal,    at       the

 Leppings          Lane       end          of    the       ground.

 Moments       later          the          game       was       stopped             and       I attended             at    the       fence.        I saw

 that    all       the       exit          gates          were         blocked           by    the       sheer       volume          of    people

 attempting             to    escape             the       crush            through           the    small          exit       way.

 This, w a s       so    to       such          an    extent            that        it    was       necessary             for    4    or    more

 police       officers                to    physically                  drag        persons          out       of    the       gates,       however

 this    was       an    extremely                   slow       process             and       it w a s     obvious             that       persons       were

 being       crushed          to       death          behind            the       security           fence.                I continued            to

assist        in    removal                of    persons               from       gates        exits       and        by a s s i s t i n g p e r s o n s

 to    climb       over       the          fence,          with         other          officers.

 It    was    obvious             persons             were         being          injured           by    physically             dragging          them

 out    of    the       crush          forcibly,                but         this       was     necessary             to    save       their       lives.

 I saw       people          fall          behind          the         fence        and       collapse,             being       trampled          and

crushed,           however             there         was       no     way    of    assisting                 them       due     to      the      high

fence        with       the       rearward               fencing          topping         spikes             being        in    place.             It

appeared           people          were         still          coming        into        the    ground             and      were        pushing

forward           ignoring             requests            to       move     back        or    hold          their        position.                At    this

point        I saw       a    number            of       objects          thrown         by    persons             at     the       officers            which

included           myself          on       the      fence.            Some       of     these          persons           appeared              worse       for

drink,        and       appeared              unaware            of    the      situation               at    the       front         of    the       fence

which        was       desperate,              as        people        werjrf' p a n i c i n g          as    they        were        being

crushed           and    some          even       fought            to/get        out     of    the          terrace.               It w a s       obvious

to     me    that       numerous              p e r s o n s y/ere           being        killed          or       injured.             During           this

time        I was       aware          of    PC      1          CLEHENTS           stating              he    was       requesting               ’C u 1 1 ing

^At    this       point       police            o fvf \ c e r s a n d        footyfe^all        fans,             including            myself

managed           to    kick       the        fence        and        tear^fhe          wire        mesh          from      tne       raiis        with

o ur    hands.           Persons              were        then        brought          through           the       sides        of      the      fence.

As     this       was    done          it     was        noticeable             that      some          youths          were        worse        for     the

effects           of    drink,          many         were        those       who       had     pushed             in    from        the     back        but

had     worked          their          way      to       the     front.           This        was       done       without            care       or

regard        for       other          persons.

The     situation             eased           considerable                  when       a. n u m b e r        of    police           officers

pulled        persons             away        from        the       fence,,from               the       rear.           These         officers

having        got       onto       the        rear        of     the      Lre pp in gs        Lane       terrace,

I then        entered             the       terrace            w ij/ti o t h e r       officers              and       n o t i cs d     1a r q &

                 During       the      incident          I witnessed         a   t/ftal   break    down      of    radio

                 communications                  and    ordinary      pmlj/ze      officers     had    to    use    their      own

                 After     the      incident            I eventually         made    my   way   back    to    West      Bar    Police

            On Saturday 15th April               19S9 (150489),     I was on duty in uniform,              my

            tour of duty was from Sam (0800) until 8pm                           (2000),    Following brj.efin

            I was assigned to attend the Midla nd Railway Station in order ti

            first     loads of fans          I alighted from the PSV and asked a Senior office

            if we were to escort them straight                  into the ground,            I was told that

            the fans should be left to their own devices until the match began, we

            emptied the bus, and returned to the Midland Railway/5fct§tion.                               I

                  became closer       I realised that there was something seriously wrong the

     n. y T           people who were on the pitch were gasping for air, as I looked at the

                   fencing     I could see peoples faces crushed up against the fence, which

                  through the force of the bodies had bowed as I looked at the faces of

                  men,      women and children through the fence        I could see many with blue

                   lips, and glased eyes.        I could hear people screaming and shouting for

                  help I climbed up onto the fence and began to help to pull people out

                   there were arms stretched out for help,            there were many I co ul dn’t

                   reach I remember a man near to the front of the fencing he was pushing

                  a young boy towards me I grabbed hold of him and with the assistance

                   of others, managed to pull him over,            he was crying but unharmed.             I

                   took him over      to the goal and told him        to stay there until I came back

                      I went back to the fence to see if I could see t>he man who I presumed

                  was his father,        I could not see him.      A young man grabbed hold of me

covered in vomit-     He was dead.     I covered his head with his jumper.

I got up and made my way to the fence which was by now full of

officers and fans pulling people out.            I helped several   people who

were   passed across onto the pitch and made sure they were alright.

Some one had dragged a man out who was not breathing             I went up to them

and began heart massage as I did this I was joined by another officer

who had a bald head.     I d o n ’t know his name, who began mouth to mouth

resuscitation we seemed to be trying for ages,           but nothing happened a

man came up and said "its no good love he's dead" but I kept trying

the other officer    closed his eyes, and I covered his face          I then went
to try and help someone else.        Eve rywhe re around us the re were people

walking around obviously    in shock many were screaming and shouting the

names of friends or relatives.        I remember trying to revive several

people,    but I can only remember one who started breathing again.              At

some time prior to the arrival of the ambulance.

I remember trying to take down the goal net with other officers to

enable the ambulance to come closer.         I began to help people put

bodies on to boards to be taken to the gym by other officers q/r fans.

Once all the bodies were removed I was told by Inspector H/ffNjrER to

find the other members of ’B ’ group from West Bar and to go outside

the ground and escort fans away from the ground.              I alighted a bus

the Midland Station stopping at Hi 1Isborough^park on route to

assist with people fighting.     No one was detained and we continued our

journey.    Once back at the Midland Station we assisted with the fans,

at 8pm (2000)    I was directed back to West Bar Police Station and

stood down from duty.

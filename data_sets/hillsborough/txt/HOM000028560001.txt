Hie nuni**rlng sequence in *ac±i area will be as
follows:

Standing at the rear of the terracirg and facing the
pitch the barrier at the bottaa left hand aide will be
identified as barrier 1. Sequential numbering will than
take place along this row, then returning to b^iird
barrier 1 for the start of the next row.

NOta - SnaXe type numbering sequence is not allowed.
Each of the areas should be numbered by this sequence

Where dividing fenoee, handrails, perimeter fences and
walls eJtist these will be clearly identified in relation
to specified area?.



100% visual examination will be carried out on barriers,
handrails, dividing fence* and associated equipment,
dimensions noted and a record Joipt of the results
together with any relevant caranants, or xeconinartiations.

visual examination must be carried out under {food
lighting conditions and with the add of a magnifying
glass (If required). Ihe use of tools, such as a heamer
and chisel, is encouraged as this will aid the detection
of cantosion etc.

Any bartiw which does not meet the visual requirement
shall be deemed to have failed and shall not be subjected
to machhniaal tasting until remedial work has be*i
carried out.

Mr    M Whalley
SeJ^fctary to Lord Justice Taylor




You will recall that a request had been made last week for details of those
persons who were injured at Hillsborough and where they were when they
received their injuries. If it is not possible to identify where they were
injured, then where they started in the pen and where they finished up.

The nominal records of all registered injured persons have been researched,
together with other relevant questionnaires. The grid positions of these
persons have been recorded and plotted on three master grids:-

 Plan 1 indicates a single position where the person is able to identify
 where he received the injuries.

 Plan 2 is the first position where the person was on entering the pens
 through the tunnel.

 Plan 3 shows their final positions.

 I leave you to draw your own conclusions from these plans.

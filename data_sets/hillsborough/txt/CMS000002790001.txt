LETTER FROM ROBERT HUGHES MP

I attach a copy of a letter to Mr Brandon-Bravo from
Robert Hughes MP covering one from Mr Trevor Hicks. I also
attach a copy of my proposed response.

Can I ask you to confirm that you are content with the proposed
line? The South Yorkshire Police, or some members of that force,
will undoubtedly continue to hold views which do not accord with
Lord Justice Taylor's conclusions and I do not think that we can
do anything about it. I doubt whether we would want to respond
for example to the suggestion that the Coroner will be influenced
by Mr Wright's hints.

I shall be glad if you will let me know as soon as possible
whether you are content with the proposed reply.




                                         P E BOLTON
                                         G2 Division



21 February 1990

          Dear

          HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY - INTERIM REPORT - CUTTING EQUIPMENT

          Further to       your FINDS enquiry of            23 October 1 9 8 9 , this Authority has
          considered       the above report in              relation to the     provision of cutting
          equipment.

          As I presume is the case with all brigades, Oxfordshire is in the process
          of a virtually continuous upgrade of its rescue and forced access capability,
          which has been accelerated of late with the construction of the M40 linking
          the Midlands connurbation with London.

          When the policy of upgrade is completed all pumping appliances in the brigade
          will carry Hurst equipment (which is of course capable        of a "cutting"
          operation) which will replace the equipment formerly carried and compliment
          the normal range of hand tools (eg bolt croppers, power hacksaws, pedal
          cutters, etc.) already carried on each appliance.

          Finally the Brigade has evaluated and will be equipping over a period of
          time all appliances with a back-pack thermic arc set, our field experience
          of that equipment having been very good, and it is about the only portable
          tool that can really remove large pieces of metal structures etc.    While
          the spark shower is inevitably quite considerable, the sideways conducted
          heat layer is very limited, bearing in mind the speed of cut and the fact
          that thermic arc equipment does not have to heat the        work prior to
          commencement of material separation.

          It would appear to me that - bearing in mind all the other equipment, which
          though not of a cutting nature, which has a rescue and removal emphasis (eg
          Blackhawk, tirfor etc.), would mean that the Brigade is adequately provided
          to meet the spirit and 4iitention of the interim report.

          I hope this information is of use to you.

          Yours ^spncerely

As all the perimeter fencing was
removed by Norwich City Football
Club immediately following the
tragedy at Hi 1lsborough, the Fire
Authority have not required the
provision of cutting gear at the
ground.ft clause has been added to
the safety certificate stating that
if the fencing is ever replaced some
form of cutting gear will be
required.Although not purchased at
present the football club are still
looking at purchasing some small
hydraul ic pincers even though it is
not required.

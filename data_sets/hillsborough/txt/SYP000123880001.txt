 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A GRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 MO   u




 033

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 AFTER THE HATCH WAS STOPPED?

 PEOPLE WERE BEING PUSHED BACK       INTO THE PENS BY POLICE WHO DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW

 THE SEVERITY OF THE INCIDENT,           THE POLICE LINE ACROSS THE PITCH,   LACK OF

 EMERGENCY SERVICES ARRIVING QUICKLY AT THE S C E N E .      THERE W A S N ’T ENOUGH POLICE

 HELPING THE DEAD AND INJURED, THEY JUST STOOD ABOUT FAR TOO INTERESTED IN

 CROWD C O N T R O L .


 m
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 BETTER ORGANISATION INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND,          TAKE AWAY THE SIDE FENCING

 INSIDE THE TERRACING TO GIVE THE FANS MORE MANOEUVRABILITY, MORE EMERGENCY

 EQUIPMENT AT GROUNDS,      BETTER FIRST AID FACILITIES,     BETTER DIRECTIONS TO

 FANS INSIDE THE GROUND.

 DROPPED.    I CAN REMEMBER THE POLICE COMING THROUGH THE TUNNEL AND PICKING

 PEOPLE UP AND TAKING THEM OUT THAT WAY.       THE POLICE WERE LEANING OVER THE

 FENCING TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE TERRACES BUT THERE WAS NO

 LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENTS.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?


Q #

 I THINK THE LACK OF ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND.       I KNOW THAT TWO POLICE

 HORSES CONTROL SIX QUEUES AT ANFIELD.      HAD THIS BEEN DONE THERE WOULD HAVE

 BEEN NO MASS OF CROWD.     BARRIERS TO ORGANISE QUEUES TO GO INTO TURNSTILES

 SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.     HAD THERE BEEN MORE AMBULANCES AVAILABLE TO TAKE PEOPLE

 TO HOSPITAL, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF NATIONAL HEALTH AMBULANCES MADE READILY

 AVAILABLE RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE VERY GOOD VOLUNTARY SERVICES.

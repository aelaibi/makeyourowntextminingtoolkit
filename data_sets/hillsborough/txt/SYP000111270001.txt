             SERIAL       13,   WEST ST A N D , GANG W A Y U



              I commenced duty at 0830 on S a t u r d a y                15 April      1989 at E"l,

             Hackenthorpe,          where    I joined    colleagues         to form Serial '13, under                     the

              direct      command of Police          Sergeant 2001 Burman.                    We a r r i v e d as a

              serial      at H il l s b o r o u g h Football    Ground at 0930 and a t t e n d e d              the

              general      briefing at       1000 hours        given by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

             Duckenf ield.          Meal    times    for out serial         was      set at       1500 hours and we

             were    provided with a snack meal                 i mmediately following                briefing.



             We made our way to the West S tand to take                         up our d e s i g n a t e d      positions

              at   1115    in plenty of time          before      the    opening      of the ground to the

              public at         1200 noon.



              Togeth er      with Police C o nstable           10 Mercer,        I went        to G a n g w a y U in' the

              West S tand at the Leppings Lane                  end.      Our    position was           to the      left of
                                                                                                              F A Cat.
                                                                                                              R53

the    goal when            looking at the        pitch,      almost       directly above          gate 5 in

the      perimeter          fence.



Our    duties were            to : —



1)               Stop fans             climbing   over   the       fence    separating       the    north end

of the stand from the                    raised section of terracing                   (overlooking           gates

6 and 7 in the               perimeter       fence)



2.               Prevent        fans       from throwing      items    from the stand onto                    the

p i t c h , or onto          fans      below.



3.               S up er v i s e     the    use of the eme r g e n c y gate            situa t e d at the

front      corner          of the N ort h end of the West Stand,                       (above    gate 6 in

the      peimeter          fence).       Two stewards were also                 near   to the gate        Cone       in

t r a i n i n g ).



At    this time            (and up to       phase two)     there were            only eleven officers

(Serial         13 consisted of             12 officers,       plus Sergeant,            but was        depleted

fay one due           to    illness)       in the West Stand,          w hich has a capacity of

about      three       thousand five hundred.                 At    phase two,         we were     to    be

relieved         by Serial          16 to go for meal           (three      o'clock).



The    times         listed hereaft er are as accur a t e                  as    I can make      them,        but    I

a m aware        that       there are deviations           from accounts made               by others,            non

the      less    it gives a time             scale    to my     perception.

up position at                1115.         Comment           passed by me to him about                     the

low numbers                in the stand up until                    that      time,   and the      large

numbers             now entering            the stand.            Central       terracing        (rear

Look i n g          down onto the terracing,                      it was       obvious     that    the

centre          sections were               overcrowded.             Persons were          climbing

row of fencing which separates                     these    two    pens    form a

gangway      from the entrance               tunnel    to a gate     in the

    incapable          of making       decisions     themselves.       Advised     them

SERIAL 13 WEST STAND GANGWAY U.

I commenced duty at 0830 on Saturday 15 April 1989 at El, Hackenthorpe
where I joined colleagues to form serial 13, under the direct command of
Sgt 2001 Burman. We arrived as a serial at Hillsborough football ground
at 0930, and attended the general briefing at 10.00 given by Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield. Meal time for our serial was set at 1500 hrs
and we were provided with a snack meal immediately following briefing.

We made our way to the West Stand to take up our designated positions at
11.15 in plenty of time before the opening of the ground to the public
at 12.00 noon.

Together with PC 10 Mercer I went to gangway U in the West Stand at the
Leppings Lane end. Our position was to the left of the goal when looking
at the pitch, almost directly above gate 5 in the perimeter fence.


Our duties were to;
                    1. Stop fans climbing over the fence seperating the
north end of the stand from the raised section of terracing (overlooking
gates 6 and 7 in the perimeter fence).
                    2. Prevent fans from throwing items from the stand
onto the pitch, or onto fans below.
                    3. Supervise the use of the emergency gate situated
at the front corner of the North end of the West Stand. < above gate 6
in the perimeter fence). Two stewards were also near to the gate (one in
training).


At this time, ( and up to phase two ), there were only eleven officers
< Serial 13 consisted of 12 officers plus Sergeant, but was depleted by
one due to illness), in the West Stand, which has a capacity of about
three thousand five hundred. At phase two, we were to be relieved by
serial 16 to go for meal (three o clock).

The times listed hereafter are as accurate as I can make them, but I am
aware that there are deviations from accounts made by others, non the
less it gives a time scale to my perception.

1200   Ground opened to the public.

1345   Large numbers of Nottingham Forrest supporters ifc their allocated
       enclosures, but only low numbers of Liverpool supporters, notably
       women and families.

1430   Still relatively low numbers of Liverpool supporters in ground.

1440   Visited by Sgt Burman, who I had not seen since taking up position
cont...,
      at 1115. Comment passed by me to him about the low numbers in the
      stand up until that time, and the large numbers now entering the
      stand. Central terracing   (rear of goal) and stand now
      substantially filled with supporters. North and South ends of the
      terracing relatively empty. Raised area of terracing to the North
      of the Vest Stand nearly full, Large numbers of youths
      congregating near to the dividing fence, apparantly with the
      intention of climbing over. Several aborted attempts made.
      Complaints made by female members of the crowd in that section of
      youths urinating in the enclosure. Several youths seen at the rear
      of the raised terracing climbing onto the fencing above the rear
      entrance tunnel, and removing the barbed wire. Moving through the
      crowds at this time, in an effort to stop those wishing to climb
      over the fence, it was obvious that large numbers had been
      drinking, some heavily.

        Looking down onto the terracing, it was obvious that the centre
        sections were overcrowded. Persons were climbing over the fencing
        seperating the pen at the rear of the right hand side of the goal
        looking from the stand, to the pen on the left hand side of the
        goal. This appears to be shown incorrectly on the plan provided.
        The double row of fencing which seperates these two pens form a
        gangway from the entrance tunnel to a gate in the perimeter fence

        Officers were standing on the perimeter track supervising those
        fans climbing, and preventing them from climbing over onto the
        track.

1501    Fans bagan climbing over onto the perimeter track and then the
        gate in the pen behind the goal was opened, and fans were allowed
        to walk along the perimeter track and re-enter the terracing via
        gate 6 as shown on plan, which is directlu below gangway U.

1502    Crowd in West Stand stood up.

Ref Y

1503    I went to barrier with PC Mercer and looked down on the terracing.
        I could see fans surging forward in the two pens behind the goal.
        Fans were now climbing over the perimeter fence onto the track,
        and over the fence seperating the two pens (single fence). Large
        numbers of fans seemed to be crushed into the corners of those
        pens as below at x.


                                        1
                                   x    1   X
                                        1
                                        1

1504    Obvious that person were being crushed at this time, and fans were
        being assisted obver the fence by Police officers.
1505    Heavy surge of spectators towards the front of the terrace, but
        instead of the gap left in the crowd when fans sway forward, the
        space was immediatelt filled by other fans. It was now obvious
        that there were serious problems in the pens, and more and more
        fans were spilling over the fences and onto the pitch. Looking at
        them it was obvious that some were injured. More Police began to
        help at the fences, and supporters in the stand were now helping
        those below up into the stand over the front of the balcony.

1506    Bolt croppers were requested, and request aknowledged. Ambulance
        requested and acknowledged. Large numbers of spectators walking
        and being carried onto the pitch, some lying still, Numberous
        officers now giving first aid.

1510    Further request for bolt croppers. Non forthcoming and fence torn
        down by hand by Police and spectators.

1511    Onto food bar area at rear of stand (upper level). Assist with
        injured passed up^ from terracing. Three placed in recovery
        position, breathing but unconcious. Ambulance requested by me.

        Assistance obtained from medically trained persons in crowd to
        stay with injured until arrival of ambulance. Approached by Doctor
        and together with PC 10 guided him down behind the Police box and
        made a path through the crowd and onto the pitch. Returned to food
        bar area.

Ref Z

1519    Approached by Inspector Grace and told to join him in the stand to
        prevent fans causing damage. On arrival saw that fans were tearing
        hordings down to use as stretchers, no action taken.

1522    Return to food bar area. Injured now removed to ambulance. Joined
        by PC 928 Parkin. Took up position at Isle Z. Approached } one by
        one, by literally hundreds of fans very distressed and needing to
        know what to do. All they wanted was to be told what to djJbj as
        they were incapable of making decisions themselves. Advised them
        to leave ground quielty and make their way home.

        On looking arround the bar area I noticed a heap of discarded
        tabards which the stewards had been wearing. On purposefully
        looking arroung the stand I realised that ther<afe were no stewards
        in sight. (SUBJECT OF FULL REPORT SUBMITTED THROUGH SUPT. GOUGH ON
        SUNDAY 16th APRIL).

????    Official announcment of match abandoned. Maintained station
        supervising fans leaving groung. Large numbers in a truculent and
        abusive mood, seemingly caused by frustration. Mental note that it
        wouldn't take much to provoke a major public order incident.

????    West stand cleared and serial reformed. Stand searched for items
        left behind. Negative result. During this time I noticed two
        stewards taking tabards from under coats and putting them on
       again. I spoke to the chief steward________________|and told him
       what I had seen. He replied, ' What do you expect them to do if
       they’re going to get thumped.1 Heard radio message regarding
       number of places available in Mortuaries and realised full scale
       of catastophe. Obtained details of remaining fans for purposes
       of taking statements.

????   Return to gymnasium for re-deployment, and placed on standby in
       Horth stand.

       During the time span of the disaster unfolding, shown here as Ref
       Y to Ref Z I closely monitored radio traffic. I at no time heard
       any directions being given in terms of leadership. The only
       messages I heard were those requesting assistance of one sort or
       another , and. where appropriate, their acknowledgements.

1930   Off duty at El.

                DUTIES RELATING TO SATURDAY 15th APRIL 1989 LIVERPOOL v NOTTS FOREST.

                ALL DUTIES IN UNIFORM.

     8.00am     On duty Woodseats - conveyed with other officers to Brightside lane,Driving
                School where at 9.30am briefed by Superintendent BROUGHAM.
                (On the original order I was detailied to work on serial number 5 with Ps Hodgett
                 but was deviated to work traffic point prior and after the match.)
      10.45am   Neepsend Lane, junction with Penistone Road traffic control duties,
to    2.50pm     (XI Between these times I noticed a large number of Nottingham Forest fans
                      drinking outside the OWL Public House on Neepsend Lane they numbered approx
                      70-100 at 11.00am and steadily increased as the kick-off time approached)
                      A number of Nottingham Forest supporters were leaving this pub in a drunk state
                      and they were carrying bottles of beer which had been supplied at the pub,

        2.50pm - walked to the ground intending to meet with serial 5 at the leppings Lane
                 end of the ground for duties during the match.
                 I entered the ground at approx 3»05p® and I walked to the perimeter track
                 between the North Stand and the Spoin Kop via gate 0. At that time the players
                 were just leaving the field and I saw a large number of Police Officers making
                 thier way towards the Leppings Lane end of the ground. I could see at that time
                 people coming onto the pitch from the leppings Lane terraces. I remained in
                 ay position between the Kop and North Stand and at about 3.10pm my attention
                 was drawn to a Liverpool supporter who had left his seat and was stood in the
                 front gangway nearest the Kop end and he was shouting and waving his arms
                 towards the Notts Forest supporters. The Forest supporters near the front
                 corner could see this youth and they moved towards the front perimeter fence
                 shouting and making vioent gestures in return. I arrested the Liverpool
                 supporter and took him to the Police room at the rear of the North Stand.
                 (I                                                                   Liverpool
                      offence (sec b Public Order Act 86) result verbal caution)
                 I then went into the Gymnasium to complete paper work. At approx 3«25p» when
                 I was in the gym I saw dead bodies being bought into the gym and I assisted
                 with laying the bodies in an orderly £ line in the gym and dealing with
                 friends and relatives of the dead.
                 I remember on two occasions during the following 20 mintues having to
                 forcibly remove men from the gym who were intent on venting angry feelings
                 against the Police.
                 I then assisted in carrying bodies from behind the North Stand in the Gym
                 (I am unable to remember any descriptions o£ the bodies moved but they didnt
                      involve any women or young children.)

and I then assisted ambulance Personel to take a man from the pitch to an ambulance.
He was situated near the Kop end of the ground on the pitch.

I then assisted in public order on the pitch at about 3«50pa. until the crowd
vacated the ground.
The mood of the Liverpool fan* who i came into contact with on the pitch was of
anger against the Police for "Allocating them the Leppings Lane end of the ground"
when thier level of support was twice the size of the Notts Forest following.

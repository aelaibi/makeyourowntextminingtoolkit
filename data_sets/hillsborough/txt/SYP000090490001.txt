              I am a single         girl and X live at th<jf above address with my parents.                                     I
                                      o-VT
              have      sup po rt ed Liverpool Football flflub all of my life but have only

              been going           to the matc he s    for    the    past    five years.             I am a season

              ticket      holder a nd have         been for     three years.             I go to every home m atch

              and as m any awa y matches as                possible.



              On S a t u r d a y    15th April     1989    (150489),        together with

                                                                                                                     --KiA:

                                   : t ravelled to S h e f f i e l d to see Liverpool                FC   playing

              N o t t i n g h a m Forest    in the Semi       Final.        I t ravelled        in             car



              The      three    of us     left Liverpool       at a p p r o x i m a t e l y   10.30 am     <1030).       I am

              not sure         of the     route we took.        We    d i d n ’t stop anywhere            on our journey
                                                                                                          PAGE          2
                                                                                                          S3475
    to S h e f f ie ld and we d i d n ’t encounter any traffic                      problems      until we

    reached S h e f f i e l d and then           it was    only delays       caused by the volume                  of

    t raf f i c .



    We a r r i v e d   in S h e f f i e l d at aro un d    1 . 2 0 pm (1320 hours)        and     parked the

    car      in a residential          road a p p r o x i m a t e l y five minutes walking              distance

    from the ground.



                and    I had tickets         for the Leppi ng s Lane          terraces.           I paid

    £ 6 . 0 0 for my ticket         from Anfield,                         ticket was      for the Nor

    Stand.       The    three     of us walked to the          ground t o g e t h e r .      We d i d n ’t stop

    a ny where       on route.      We    left            when we     reached our turnstile.



    I saw a number          of Police        standing along         the    route to the ground.               We

    d i d n ’t seek any direction from them                  regarding       the     location of the

    ground because          both                 and          had been to the ground on

    previous         occasions.           had never       been to the ground before,



    As we w al ke d to the          ground       I saw several       other    supporters          but    I d i d n ’t

    see any         trouble.      I d o n ’t remember       seeing anyone           drinking      in fact      I

    thought all         the pubs were         closed.       I d i d n ’t have an al co ho li c           drink at

    all      thro ug hout   the    day.



    W he n    I reached the        t u r n s t i 1e^/there w e r e n ’t any queues.              We walked

    straight         through    I handed my ticket           into    the steward and he ga«^ me

    the      stub back.        I was     searched by a P o l i c e w o m a n as       1 passed/ th ro ug h

                and    I went and        bought a programme and then made                   our way down

    the tunnel         into the Pen         (3).   I d o n ’t recall       seeing any Police             or

           stewards       giving        directions.          I d o n ’t recall seeing any signs slither

           indicating w hich way you were meant                          to go but saying             that       I always

           stand behind           the goal          so I would have          gone    down the        tunnel       anyway.

           we got there and              plenty of       room,                   and    I stood a p p r o x i m a t e l y

           I have m ar ked our               position on the ske/ch              plan.         We were standing            in

towards       the front was          because   there was a lad aged about                   twenty years

who    kept    jumping        off a barrier      into     the    crowd.      A jTouple of times            he

landed on me.          so we moved forward.



All    the    time    it was     getting mors and more             crowded.       ________ was

standing       on my right          I remember     the   teams     coming out.         There was a

w hite man age d about              t we nt y/ tw en ty two years        standing     on my       left and

a big fella wearing a brown                  padded      leather    jacket       standing        directly

in front       of me.          I also    remember     that there was a man with                   abroken

a rm standing         to      my right.     He had his left arm              in plaster.          I c a n ’t

describe       the    people ar ou nd me any better.



The man on my          left     had his hand stuck against my face                   pushing        my    chin

up.     I told him            to move back but he said he                c o u l d n ’t move.     I was

talking all          the time       trying to get him to move back but he c o u l d n ’t.

1' was being         pushed     forward    into the      big fella        in front     of me.        My face

was    being    pushed        into his jacket       I was       having    d i ff ic ul ty   in

breathing.           I shouted to him to move              forward but he d i d n ’t move.                 It

was    really bad,          I was    frightened.         I was    screaming       out to people           to

move    but they c o u l d n ’t.         The men around                    and    I tried tyo calm

us down but          1' was   hysterical.        We both were.            I m u st have f l a c k e d out

because       the    next thing       I knew   I was     on the     floor and        p e o (^1 e were

t rampling      over me.



There was a man             lying across my        chest and one on my feet.                     I tried to

push the man off my              chest.      I remember         biting a m a n ’s leg on my              left

so that       he w ould know that          I was    there.        He shouted out t h e r e ’s a girl

on the floor.              Someone    grabbed hold of my           pony tail and            pulled me

back.        The ma n must       have moved off my          chest    by now.         I d o n ’t remember

him moving,          someone     else    grabbed hold of my right arm and                     pulled me up
         and forward.             I was      passed across          the    top of         people   to the yP'ront of

         the    pen.         There were       policemen all along                the fence.           They shouted at

         me to climb over              but    I    couldn't.        I h a d n ’t got enough energy.                   I said

         I c o u l d n ’t get over.



         I don't know how taut I mana ge d to get                          into the          corner   between     pens 3

o rf     and 4.        Someone,        a supporter who was                sitting         on the A i v i di ng fence,

         g ra bb ed a hold of me and threw me over                          the front          franca.    My coat got

         caught on the spikes.                    A P o l i c e w o m a n was trying          to help me and

         e v e nt u al l y    I got free and she             lay me on the            pitch.

         I remember a St Johns a m b u l a n c e m a n                  coming    over and asking          me    if I was

         alright.            I a s ke d him       if he    could get me an            inhaler for my asthma.                    He

         went off but           I did not see him again.                    I lay down for about                ten

         mi nu te s and then decided to look for                                      .      1 c o u l d n ’t see her. I

         w a n d e r e d around,       not    really knowing what                I was doing.            I remember         I

         d i d n ’t help anyone,             I was    too shocked myself.                    I went   back to Pen 3 by

         w hi ch time         it was    empty of          people    except       for some Police Officers

                In the statement             it says      that when      I was    on the    floor a man was            lying

                on my        chest when      in fact      he was standing         on me,    trampling ms.        Also     I

                remember        seeing a man with a young                boy aged about       three   standing          to my

                left    in front         of the fella who had his hand in my face.                      The boy was

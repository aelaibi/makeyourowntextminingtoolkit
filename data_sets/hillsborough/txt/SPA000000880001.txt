    Dear Member

    HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

    It is quite possible that members may receive approaches from the press and media in
    connection with the Hillsborough disaster and the Hillsborough Families Support Group. In
    that case I would recommend that enquires are referred to the Chairman or to officers.
    Either the Chairman or Mike Sanderson will be able to comment on behalf of the Authority.

    Yours faithfully

Dear Sir.
         A lot has teen said about the late arrival of Liverpool Supporters.
I would like to submit some further information which may help some people
understand what we go through every week to support our team.
          I have travelled to every away game this season, by coach, following
Liverpool F.C. Except for a few grounds, we have arrived I hour before K.O, At
most games we are stopped by the Police between the city limits and the ground
the coach is sometimes searched .then inevitably delayed until about one hour
before the K.O,
          I believe I am right in saying that there is a directive for the
Police to follow regarding this late arrival of away supporters. At Middlesboro'
a Liverpool Supporters coach was held up outside the ground,by the Police,fans
where told to stay on the coach and the driver was reprimanded. Sheir crime
was arriving too early. After 2p.m. they where allowed into the ground.
         At Sheffield on Saturday we arrived after 2p.m. The coaches where
parked on the dual carriageway facing the way out of Sheffield,The first arrivals
being furthest away from the ground. As you walked to the ground other coaches
parked in line\along the road so as you got nearer the ground the crowds built
up. The walk to the ground took about half an hour. All pubs on route where
closed(as last year). After spending about ten minutes in the ‘chippy’ on
Leppings Lane the crowd moving to the ground became more dense-So we moved to
the ground.
        The events after 2:45p*e. have been graphically covered by other people.
The only other observation I have , regard; the league game versus Sheff. Wed.
Liverpool occupied all the seats behind the same goal and a large section of
the same terrace. The West Stand appeared to be well populated by Sheff. Wed.
fans. The same access was used to gain entry as was used on Saturday. There
was one major difference on the 14th. January this year. Every coech was escorted
to th® Leppings Lane Turnstiles. The coaches one by one dropped their passengers
off.They where guided directly into the ground by lines of Police who had been
possitioned at either end of the coach. If the coaches had been allowed to arrive
earlier(due to the larger amount of people attending)and this system used I
believe a lot of this tragedy,if not all»would have been avoided.
But who am I to comment I am ONLY A FOOTBALL SUPPORTER ?

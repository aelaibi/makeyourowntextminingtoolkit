I,    DOUGLAS          JOHN LOCK, of-;
                                 JILL STATE


My    date of birth is                                         I        presently Chief of
Security          with       Sheffield       Wednesday Football               Club       at     their
ground       at        Hillsborough.           My    employment         in     that          post    is
part-time          and my main duties are on match days, but I ..work on
a     part-time basis through the whole year - not just                                      confined
to the football season.


My main career was in the Police Force for .some 30 years until
I     retired          on    28th     February,        1985.       At     the       time       of    my
                t had the rank of Superintendent, in the South
i c UX* Ciuo**w
Yorkshire Police Force and I was promoted to Superintendent in
about         1979/80            after      spending     one       year       as        an     Acting
Superintendent.


 X    was     based at Hammerton Road Police Station, working in                                     Fl
 Sub-Division               which    covers        the northern area               of    Sheffield,
 including          HillBborough.            From Football Season 1982/3 until                          I
 retired           I     was,-      under    the     direct    command             of    the    Chief
 Superintendent, in charge of policing the Hillsborough Ground.
 For       the 3 seasons that I was the Superintendent in charge                                     of
    policing       the       Hillsborough Ground the Club had 1 year in                             the
    Second     Division,            1 year when they were promoted from                         Second
    Division to First Division, and then in 1984/5 a season in the
    First     Division.             During this period there were matches                           with
    some very big crowds, for even in the first of those years the
    Club     was       contending        for    promotion to            the     First         Division
    although ultimately it did not succeed in that year.
During    that         spell       Inspector Clive Calvert        was       my     Liaison
Officer        and     he       and I had a good deal of         contact         with     the
Sheffield        Wednesday          Club.   Such liaison w s b mainly with                the
Secretary        of the Club - in the early stages Eric England                           and
latterly        Dick        Chester - and each game that the            Club           played
throughout           the     season was categorised according to the                     Gate
which     we     would          expect, not least dependent on the                kind     of
following        that the visiting team would have.                 As I recall the
games     were categorised as A, B or C.                  A category C game would
involve        crowds        of up to say 20,000 people; category B up                     to
30,000 people; and category A where yet larger crowds would be
expected.            There would be meetings with the Club prior-to the
start     of the football season proper, when the fixtures                              would
be     known,        and the categories for each game would be                     agreed.
Each     category involved a consequent minimum level of policing
and     since the Club have to contribute to the cost of policing
they     have        a financial interest in the matter.                I    would        say
however        that        in     my dealings with Sheffield        Wednesday            they
have     always        been        prepared to accept the level             of    policing
which     we thought proper and not tried to influence us to keep
the     numbers        of        Police Officers down for        cost       reasons.         I
should         also        add     that   even   though    the    games          would      be
categorised           at        the start of the season if, for             any     reason,
during      the       season things changed - e.g. if one of the                         Clubs
 involved       had a successful run so that a larger crowd might be
 expected - we could and did re-categorise matches.


 Other     factors          were also involved of course in the                   level     of
 policing we might require.                 We would typically liaise with the
 Police        Force        for    the visiting Clubs'- home       town          for     added
 intelligence from them as to the fans that might be expected.


 About 2 weeks prior to each game Inspector Calvert and I would
 have     meetings           with the Chief Superintendent and               the        Deputy
 Chief     Superintendent             to discuss the policing for the                   forth­
 coming        match,        and then having established the contingent                     of
 Officers        required we would go to the Football Liaison                           Office
at South Yorkshire Police Headquarters at Snig Hill, Sheffield
to     arrange        extra manpower from other Divisions -               e.g.       from
Road     Traffic Division, Mounted Police, and (where                     necessary)
Dog     Handlers.            Within a week of the match we would              normally
have     confirmation of the extra manpower available to us,                          and
then     Clive        Calvert and I would discuss the whole matter                     and
draw     up     an operational plan to be put into operation on                        the
day     of     the match.          This operational plan would         include,         in
particular,           deployment of Police Officers within and                 outside

the Ground.


Our     policy was to use Officers from F Division in those areas
where        there was likely to be pressure or problems because                        of
their        familiarity with the Hillsborough area.                  Thus we always
tended        to     use the same group of Officers for duties                 on      the
pitch,        not least because if trouble were to arise their faces
would        be well recognised by regular fans who would perhaps be
more     readv        to     approach them and report          matters.       Officers
would        also be deployed on duty for off-loading coach loads of
visiting           fans       and     escorting   them    to    the    Ground         from
particular           areas, and likewise in relation to special trains.
When     large        crowds        of visiting fans were expected            we     would
control        their       arrival      by   close liaison      with    the        Traffic
 Division,         who would direct traffic along a particular                      route;
 coaches       coming        off     the Ml would, for example, be            asked      to
 exit     at a Junction at Tankersley where there is a very                          large
 lay-by        and    they would be stopped in that lay-by and fans                      on
 board        would     have       tickets checked.      Care would be        taken      to
 co-ordinate           the     arrival of coaches and trains so            that,        for
 example,          if a train-load of fans was expected the arrival                       of
 a     group of coaches might be delayed until those fans arriving
 on     the     train had been escorted to the              Ground.       Furthermore
 coaches        were always directed to offload in a particular area,
 then        to follow a particular route around the Ground and                       park
 in      Cole        Road. After the match all visiting fans would                    then
 be     escorted from the Ground back via Cole Road to the coaches
 or trains, as the case may be.
                                                                                      • •/ • *

When       the      operational plans were drawn up copies would go                                      to
each       particular            group o£ Officers - i.e.                Traffic            Division
Mounted Police, etc. and they would detail the duties for each
particular section of men.                   A copy of the operational plan was
always        given to the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football

Club in advance of the match.


On        Match Day, before kick-off, X would brief all the Officers
on        duty         '■'hose    briefings normally took                place          within           the
Ground,          'either         in the vicinity of the Police Room or in                                the
gymnasium depending on how many Officers were involved.                                             After
 a       general briefing to all, the Inspectors and Sergeants would
 then       be separately briefed in more detail, but all                                    briefings
 essentially broke down the operation into 3 phases:-


 1          ^he p e r i o d up to kick-off/
 2.         The period from kick-off until 10 minutes before the                                         end

           of the match;
 3   .     From 10 minutes before the end to dispersal of crowds.


 During           mv    3   seasons     in    charge we never                 had       a        F.A.    Cup
 semi-final             played at Hillsborough and to my recollection                                    the
     largest       crowd       we. had was one of about 48,000 people                              for     an
     evening       match with a 7.30 p.m. kick-off.                       On that occasion                     I
     recall that the crowd of fans arriving was such that it became
     obvious that we could not get everyone into the Ground in tune
     for    kick-off.          When that was reported to me by my Officers, we
     approached          the      Club Secretary - I believe it was                          then        Dick
     Chester    - and asked him whether the start of the match could
         SLCI   - ****— ---                                 f
     De    delayed so that all the fans could be brought into
     ground            We   received prompt agreement to that                          request,           the
     start        was put back for 15 minutes and we announced this                                      over
     the     P A       system to the crowd.               That relieved the pressure and
     in fact by 7.35 p.m. or thereabouts all the fans were in.

T                  following           my     retirement from the Force          I     wrote          a

    appointment.

    ln      my       post as Chief of Security I was involved with                         general
    matters            of crowd safety and I was of course familiar wi
    Gree„         Code,          the safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975,                 and           the
     r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s    of    the Popplevell Inquiry.           I therefore             had
                         tfprs       verv     much in mind in performing          my       task
     Securityao f f i « r . . One of the early things that I did after my
     appointment               was to check all the gates around the stadium and
     to      Change the padlocks on those gates to a « o n                                                    °
     that every gate could be opened with the same key.                                The
      were        supplied with 2 of those keys - I gave them to Inspec or
      Calvert            - so that they could copy as many as they wished.                                        X
      also        provided keys             t o   each of the stewards within the             Groun

      who were manning gates.

       present,               and during matches certain gates may be locked whic

Brigade      apparently                had not realised.             I arranged             for     those

matters to be put right.

All     matters          relating           to the erection of                 perimeter          fences,
gates     in     the       fence., the siting of crash                          barriers          in     the
standing       areas etc.                 were, I believe, dealt with between                            the
Club     and     the       Committee              set    up    by     the       Local       Authority,
pursuant        te-      the       Safety of Sports Grounds Act.                        I    know        for
example        that       up       to 1985 the central pen at the                       west           stand
 (Leppings       Lane)            end was not divided by the fence                          which-       now
runs     from       the        centre of the mouth of the tunnel                            under        the
stand,       down        to       the      perimeter fence.               There       was     a        crush
barrier        about          12' in from the mouth of the tunnel                             entrance,
 and    my     recollection                is that the positioning of                       that        crush
 barker        relatively close to the entrance from the tunnel                                           was
 capable       of     causing              a build-up of fans at the mouth                         of     the
 tunn-1        and       it       was       often       necessary         to    deploy        a     Police
 Constable          on     either           side of the tunnel                 to    ensure        orderly
 dispersal          of    the      crowd within the pen.                  Subsequently             however
 that        crush        barrier           was     removed         and    the       fence        erected,
 presumably at the request of the Safety Committee.


 The     gates in the perimeter fence are                             closed, but not locked,
 during        matches            so      far     as I am aware.               The    gates        are     so
 designed        that          the latch cannot be easily opened from                                  inside
  the     pen, and the position is that the gates would normally be
  manned       outside            by stewards and Police Officers.                           The        gates
  opened       outwards on to the pitch area,' and to open them it was
  merely       necessary to press down on the spring-loaded latch                                           to
  release       it.           I      do     recall      that    after          my    appointment               as
  Security          Officer            X was a little concerned that some                           of     the
  advertising            boards            on     the perimeter of the               pitch         extended
  oartly       across             the mouth of those gates and could                          create           an
  obstruction             and I arranged for the boards to be moved or,                                        if
  necessary           reduced in length, to prevent any possibility of
  obstruction arising.
I     also took steps to upgrade the Public Address System at the
Ground        and       indeed last year the P.A. System               was      completely
replaced          with           a     new, more powerful, system.        Part        of    the
reason        for       this           was that I was conscious of        the     fact      the
P.A. System             was an essential part of the emergency evacuation
procedures              at the Club.            Standing rules provided for a              coded
message           to        be announced over the P.A. and this               announcement
would        be        an indication to Police Officers and Stewards                        that
emergency              evacuation procedures were in force.                The        Stewards
were       then         required to take up positions at their                   exits          and
gates,        and           to       open    those gates.   I   made   sure      that       this
evacuation              procedure was tested on match days to be satisfied
that        it would work efficiently in the event of an evacuation,
indeed        in the 1988/89 season which is just drawing to a close
we        have had 2 emergency evacuation tests in which the                            Police
were also involved.                         Their part w a B co-ordinated via Inspector
Sewell         and          on the occasion of these tests the coded                   message
would         be broadcast and then we would check quickly round                                the
    Ground     to see that all the gates had in fact been thrown open
    and were manned by Stewards.


    Following the Popplewell report the proper training of fit and
    able     Stewards                was    a recommendation.   In fact      many      of       the
    Stewards           at     Football Grounds are older men who                may    perhaps
    have     retired or be approaching retirement from their                           regular
    work     so        that it is not always possible to have Stewards                          who
    are     fully           fit from the point of view of youth               and      fitness.
    Where     possible, however, younger candidates were recruited as
    Stewards           and       I        did take steps to ensure that       training           was
    available           to them.             Thus, at the beginning of the season, for
    the      last 3 seasons, I have had 2 training evenings                           organised
    at     the Club.             The first evening is for gatemen, catering                         and
    ground        staff , and the second evening concentrates on training
     of    Stewards.                 On    both evenings there are demonstrations                   and
     instructions                given       on first aid; there is a talk by           Station
     Officer        Miles             of the local Fire Brigade re fire          precautions

    F Division           he had been in charge of 2 F.A. Cup semi-finals at
    Hillsborough               -           Coventry City v. Leeds United and in                      1987/88
    Season,        Liverpool v. Notts. Forest.                             Inspector Clive           Calvert
    had     worked         as              his Liaison Officer up to and                    including      the
    1987/88        F.A.            Cup semi-final but he was then transferred                              and
    his replacement was Inspector Sewell.


    When     Brian         Mole                 was   transferred from            F^Division         he    was
    replaced        by Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and Super­
    intendent           Duckenfield's                   first match at Hillsborough-was                             on
    Saturday,             1st              April,      1989        when    the    visiting      team       were
    Millwall            F.C.           and        the crowd was relatively small                 and       well

    behaved.


    The     Club         was involved in an evening match on Wednesday,                                         5th
    April,       against                   Wimbledon F.C. and again on that                    occasion                 I
    met       Chief            Superintendent                 Duckenfield         and   also        Inspector
     Sewell.       After                   that match had started, at about 7.45 p.m.                               we
     pulled        in      all the Chief Stewards into a meeting                               to     discuss
     with     them         the                 arrangements for the          forthcoming         semi-final
     between        Liverpool                     and Notts. Forest.             In addition to         the             4

               We discussed with them what extra Stewards we                                               would
     require            for        t   h   e    semi-final, for their differing sections                                of
     the     Ground, and we needed to have details of numbers etc.                                                      so
     that      special                 passes could be organised for those                       additional
     Stewards.            Because each Chief Steward knows his own area                                         well
     and      we knew we would have a capacity crowd for the semi-final
      their      views were very much listened to and heeded in terms of
     what extra stewarding was required.


      On     the        day of the Cup semi-final I arrived at the Ground                                               at_

 performs a flexible role at my direction! 1 for the Turnstile
 Room staff; and the 12th one I retained myself.


 I     told       the        Stewards that there would be a briefing                                                        by        the
 Police           inspe c t o r s at 11.15 a.m., having already been informed

 of that by Inspector Sewell.


 I     recall           that       about 11.30 a.m. I went back                                                to     the           Police
 control box when there were a number of other Officers present
 besides              F.C.     Ryan.                 One I recall was Sergeant                                      Goddard            but
 there           were others whom I cannot now recall.                                                    I had a               general
 chat           with     them,      t   h   e   y    had no special requests, and                                       I           walked
  back          from there to the offices in the south stand.                                                           I           recall
  that when walking back briefings were then in progress in each

  of the four areas of the Ground.


     The        turnstiles were opened to admit ticket holders from about
     11.30 a.m.          Each set of turnstiles is covered by a CCTV camera
     and        there        is a facility for recording the pictures taken                                                                by
     each        of     those cameras.                          Each video tape however                                lasts           only
     3 hours and we discussed the position and agreed that we would
     only switch on the cassettes from 12.30 p.m.


                                                                                                               ,                      • •/ » •

I       recall        that        at about 12 noon I checked                    on        the        computer
print-out              and at that stage there were 600 ticket holders                                        in
the        Ground.            I walked around the outside of the                               stadium        to
check           on the position, and there were at that stage a                                        number
of         fans        in     the        area    but        many      more    Nottingham               Forest
supporters              than Liverpool supporters.                          In walking around                the
Ground           I     checked           with     all       the       Car    Park     attendants             and
reminded             them         of the arrangements for that day                         where        there
were        2 different types of car park ticket - one for those who
were           entitled to park and leave their cars, and one a                                        permit
merely           allowing              people to drop off passengers.                          I     reminded
them           also     that any vehicle not in the car park by 2.30                                        p.m.
    should       be excluded until 5 minutes after kiok-off - this is a
    standard          procedure           on busy match days, to avoid any                            traffic
    hazard       with        the        large number of fans who would                          be    in      the

    vicinity.

    I     was     back        in the offices by about 12.30                         p.m.        and     having
    checked          with
                   the office staff I re-entered the control room
                               was present for the Police, together
    where ____________________
    with Roger Houldsworth and a representative from the Company
    who had installed the CCTV system.


    At     about 1 p.m. I left the control room, which is immediately
     adjacent          to     the        players'           entrance, and went             out        to     that
     entrance          where           I.met with Superintendent Glynn Marsh                               and      a
     Police          Sergeant. , Superintendent Marsh explained that he                                          had
     come        out     to       see     the     Police          operation         generally,             having
        recently        taken over an operations' group in the Force, and                                           I
        cave - him          and        the Sergeant a tour of the                   control           room.         I
        recall       that         at     about        that time I also              had    a       visit      from
        Inspector           Calvert        who had been called in to assist                            at     this
        special        match,           and     was     in charge of the Kop                   area     of       the
        Ground.         I knew him well of course, Inspector Calvert                                        having
        been     my     Liaison Officer in the days when I was                                  involved           ifi

        policing the Ground.
Sometime       between 1.35 and 1.45 p.m. the Liverpool team                              coach
arrived, followed shortly afterwards by the Notts. Forest team
coach.       I recall that outside the players' entrance there were
a     number       of fans awaiting the arrival, again                  mainly        Notts.
Forest       fans        but some Liverpool fans also.               A number        of        the
fans       were pressing forward at the arrival of the players, and
a Mounted Police Officer eased his horse through the crowd and
pushed       them back.           I clearly recall that the Mounted                  Officer
was       wearing a white shirt which would indicate to me that                                 he
was       brought        in to assist from an outside Police Force -                           The
South        Yorks.        Police wear regulation blue shirts.                    I'-recall
this        instance          particularly for 2 reasons - in the course                        of
the       manoeuvre the horse seemed to be a little excitable, and
a        middle-aged man with a Liverpool accent complained that the
horse        had     stepped          on his foot and indeed his            footwear           was
visibly        dented.          I recall that Kenny Dalglish, the                 Liverpool
Manager,           went       to speak to the fan, and Superintendent                     Roger
Greenwood           was present and I suggested to him that the                       Police
horse        was     unnecessary for the type of duty at                    the     players'
entrance.                He     agreed    that     South    Yorks.     Police       did        not
normally           use        Mounted    Officers in that situation,                and     said
that        he would deal with the matter at the later                        de-briefing.
 Superintendent                 Greenwood        was   in   charge     of     the         Police
    contingent        on       duty     on the pitch.       I walked        down from          the
    players'         entrance through the players' tunnel on to                           the pitch
 with       him     and after chatting for a little while                     returned            to
    the Control Room at about 1.55 p.m.


    At    about 2 p.m. one of the employees from the Turnstile                                 Room
    popped     into        the Control Room to see what the                 crowd     already
    entering the         Ground was like.          My recollection is             that          the
    computer             print-out       showed    that some 24,000 fans were                   in,
    mostly     in     the       south stand and the Kop area            (Notts.           Forest
    supporters)           and    a lesser number in the west and north                     stand
    areas.     At regular intervals thereafter the Police Control Box
    staff     would radio in (on one occasion they used the                          internal
    land     line     telephone) to check with us what the size                       of         the

                                                                                           •    • /   •   •
                                                                      -    13    -




crowd                       was     as       demonstrated on the                     computer        print-out,          and
generally                          either           P . C . ^ ^ o r         I would answer them and                     give
them                    the        figure.           It was noticeable that the                       Notts.       Forest
areas                        of        the    Ground          were        filling       up     first.         This       was
demonstrated                             both           on    the     T.v. monitors            and     also        on    the
computer                          print-out.                 We have a separate monitor^ within                          the
control                          Room        for        each of the CCTV cameras                 trained           on    the
v   a   r   i   o   u   s        turnstiles              and the players' entrance.                      In    addition
there                       is     an        extra monitor which                     is linked        to the         Police
cameras                          and where we do not have a recording facility but                                        we
can                     switch,           at the press of a button, from one                             Police__T.V.
camera to another to see what pictures they are displaying.


    Between                        2.30       and        2.40       p.m.        it    was     noticeable        that       a
    Significant                          number of fans were arriving at the Lappings Lane
    end                     Of     theGround.                This          was noticeablein           particular
    through                       the Police monitor from the Police camera situated on
    top                 of        the        south west corner of the west stand.                              I     recal
    that                    at     about 2.40 p.m. there was an announcement                                   over       the
                                              IV    C    I    ^ h a d one in the Control Room)   that

                                                         I                                     ...
    Leopings Lane                             was        closed totraffic because or the build-up
    in              that           area. I looked on the monitor at the                                Leppmgs           Lane
    picture                        and          I       recall      the         impression       I    had     was        that
        immediately                       outside            the turnstiles in the area of the                          metal
        aate                 there        was       a very tight crush of people.                           Just        behm
        them                 was       an area which did not seem so densely                                packed,       and
        then                 further behind again in Leppings Lane there seemed to be
        a           solid           crush of people coming along.                             I cannot say           however
        that                 I     noticed any evidence of misbehaviour among                                   the       fans
        near                 the        turnstile             area.       However there was             a     substantial
        number                    of     fans waiting to get into the ground with                                  kick-o

        time approaching.

        BV                  2 50 p.m. the computer showed that there were about 45,000
            fins              in the Ground.                  I cannot recall any report of                        problems,
        but                  on    the        police          monitor it was                noticeable        that      crowds „
            outside                the L e p p i n g s Lane gates had increased, and they                                 were
                                            -    14   -




pushing       forward        and there w .       quite a crush.      The   computer
orint-out          indicated that there were about 2,000 spaces^ .till
to       be filled in the north stand area, and about 2,500 in                       the
W e8t       .tand area as I recall.             On the monitor I saw a       Mounted
Police       Officer        in the crowd at the Lappings Lane end and                 he
seemed        to be the same Officer as had earlier been involved at
the players' entrance.                From the T.V. picture his horse seemed
to       shy and slip into something of a splayed leg position, and
then recovered and this was an indication to me that the crush
out        there was increasing.           Then suddenly Gate C opened and              a
crowd ox

something like "The gate's gone".   I immediately left the room
 in      something         of a hurry, as I was concerned that this              could
 cause       problems        and    that   further help might        be    needed      in
 manning        that gate or indeed other gates around the Ground                      to

 steward in the south stand area, to join me at the Directors'
  entrance          and     I asked him to provide 2 burly Stewards at                 the
     entrance       to     reinforce the staff there, explaining             what      had

     From     then 1 wanted to make my way over to                the C Gate and      went

            said "Leave it to me"               and turned and went back        in     that
     direction.           I recall looking and eeeing that each of the north

                 F A      official, and told them that the Police                                     had    opened
    the           gates        at      the Leppings Lane end of the                            Ground.       Graham

    down           towards the west stand and then saw people climbing over
    the           perimeter fences at that end of the pitch                                       At that point
        a    police Officer went onto the pitch and asked the Referee to

        Stop the game.

        There           was a mass of people around the perimeter fence                                          behind
                         1    area and I am not able to say whether the gates                                           in

        see        that        some people were being lifted over the top                                    of     the
        fence,           people appeared to be lying on the ground injured, and
        many were            w a n d e r i n g '   around in a dazed condition and in obvious
        disless.                  I     helped        a   n   u   ^   e   r   o f   people in that     state       back

At       one     point I recall that Brian Clough stopped me and                                said
"Sir,          I want you to find the Directors and the F.A. Officials
and 'tell them I am putting my players in the bath and                                      taking
them           home."    Mr. Clough knew that I worked with the Club                              for
J        had     been introduced to him earlier that day.                          I was        aware
of        the     fact     that      there      was a            meeting   going    on     in     the
Directors’              room    to      discuss the situation, which                 was        still
unclear           and I went into that room to tell the Directors                                what
Mr.        Clough had said.              The   m e s s a g e ,    in effect, was that           there
could           be no thought given to re-commencing the game when                                the
problem           had     been dealt with - of course, at that                       time,        the
full nature of the tragedy was not known.


 It       was at about that point I realised that there had been                                   no
 announcement over the Public Address System in accordance with
 the           emergency arrangements            and procedures laid               down.          The
    South        Yorkshire        Police are in charge o£ the                    Public     Address
    System        in the sense that they have an override system and the
    emergency procedures stipulated that the Police would make the
    necessary           broadcast.        I therefore used my personal radio                       and
    instructed all Stewards to unlock the gates around the ground.
    I     got replies from some of them only, and I recall I spoke to
 -------------- 1 and asked him to get round and ensure that                                       the
     gates were opened all the way around.


     I    recollect        that      I was also             approached      by     Superintendent
     Roger        Greenwood who said he wanted to take Kenny Dalglish and
     Brian        Clough       to the Police Control Box to broadcast                       to     the
     crowd        in the Ground and explain the position and I took                               them
     there by a relatively unobstructed route.


     !     subsequently           had     a request over the radio from                    the     Head
     Stewards             to allow       the men to stand down pending                     the crowd
        eventually leaving the Ground through the gates which had been
        opened,          but    I refused that request on the basis that                          their
        attendance was still required whilst the crowd remained.

Since        the tragic        events on 15th April I have    been     able    to
watch        the video       recording of the position at     the     gates    at
Leppings Lane, through the Club's own static camera trained on
those        gates.      I     now realise that the initial event      when     a
crowd        of   spectators          burst into the Ground through   Gate     C,
which        caused me to first leave the Control Room, was in              fact
subsequently           controlled        after a number of fans had gone      in.
They         apparently        got     in when the Police were attempting      to
eject        some of the spectators inside, through Gate C.' It               was
after        that, it seems, that the order was given by the"'Police
for Gate C to be opened to allow spectators in.


I   have read this Statement and it is true and correct to                    the
best of my knowledge and belief.

 operational           plan to be         put    into      o pe r at i on on the day of the             match.

 This     operational          plan w o u ld      include,          in particular,          deployment      of

 Pol ic e O ff ic e rs w i th i n and outside                    the Ground.

 Our      policy was        to use O ff icers           from F D iv is i on         in those areas where

 there was         likely to be           pressure or             problems    because of their

 f a m i li a ri ty a nd the H i l l s b o r o u g h area.                Thus we always          tend to use t

 same      group of Officers, for                duties          on the    pitch,    not    least because            if

 trouble were            to arise        their     faces w ou ld be well             recognised by regula

  fans who would             perhaps      be more        ready to approach them and report

 matters.          Officers        w o ul d .a l so    be d ep loyed on duty for off-loading

  coach        loads    of visitin g       fans and escorting                them to the Ground from

  particular areas,               and    likewise        in relation to special                  trains.    When,

 1.     The    period up to K i c k - o f f ;

 2.     the    period         from kick-off               until 10 m i nu t es before the            end of the

matters         to be     put       right.

fences,-        the    siting        of    crash bar. j«rs          in the standing areas          etc,    were.

    I believe,        dealt wit h b e tw e en the C lu b and the Committee                       set up by t!

Local        A uthority,        pursuant         to the S a fe t y of Sports           Grounds Act.        I

    know for      example       that       up to      1985 the       central   pen at the West Stand

    (Lappings L n ) -end was               not   d i vi de d   by the fence w hi ch now runs           from t!

    centre     of the m ou th of the                 tunnel    under    the stand,      down to the

    perimeter         fence.        There was a crush barrier about                    12'    in from the

    m o u t h of the     tunnel        entrance,           and my    recollection      is that the

    positioning         of that        crush barrier           relatively       close to the entrance

    from the tunnel            was     capable        of    causing a build-up of fans at the rnou

    of the tunnel            an d    it was      often nec es sa ry to deploy a Police Constable

    on either         side    of the       tunnel       to ensure      orderly dispersal         of the       crow

    w i t h i n the    pen.         Subsequently           however    that   crush barrier was        removed

    and the fence            erected,        presu ma bl y at the        request of the Safety

    Committee,                                   •

m atches      so far as          I am aware.              The    gates are        so d es igned that          the ^

to    release       it.       1 do     recall      that after my appoin tm en t                 as S e c u r i t y

Offi c e r    I was a little               con ce rn ed t h a t     some of the a d ve rt is in g            boards

on the       oerimeter          of the      pitch e xt en d ed       partly across the m o u th of

those     gates and           could      create an o b s t r uc t io n and           I a rr anged for          the

boards       to be m oved          or,     if nec es sa ry        reduced     in    length,      to    prevent        an

p o s s i b i l i t y of an o b st r u c t i o n arising.

I also       took     steps       to upgrade        the Public Addr es s System at the G r o u n d

and     indeed      last year          the P .A . S y st e m was          c ompletely       replaced w it h a

new,      more    powerful,          system.        Part        of the    reason for this was               that      I

was      conscious           of the fact         the P. A S ys te m was an essential                   r.-*t of th

 emergency         evacuation          proce d u re s at the C l u b .             Standing       rules     provide

 for/ a      coded mess a g e         to   be a n n o u n c e d over the P.A.             and this

 announcement             would     be an indic a t i on to Police Officers and S te wa rd s

 that     e m e rg e n c y    e va cu a ti o n   procedures        were     in force.           The Stewa rd s            we

 then     required to take                 up    positions       at their        exits and gates,           and to

 open those          gates.          I made      sure that         this    evacu a t i on   procedure was

 tested on m a t c h days to be s a t isfied that                           it would work           e f fi c ie nt ly

 the     event      of a n evacuation.                Indeed       in the     1988/89 season w hi ch                 is

  iust drawing            to a close we have                had 2 e m er ge nc y e vacuation tests                    in

 w hich      the Police were also                  involved.         Their       part was       c o- or dinated vi

  Inspector S E W E L L and on the                  occasion of these               tests the         coded rnessag

 w ou l d be broadcast               and then we w ou ld            check     quickly       round the G ro un d

  see that all            the     gates had        in fact        been thrown open a n d were m a n n e d

  Stewards.

At one       point          I recall       that B r i an C LO U GH stopped me and said                "Sir,     I

 earlier          that day.           I was    aware       of the    fact that       there was a meeting

 going       on    in the D i r e c t o r ’s room to discuss                 the    situation,      which was

 still       unclear         and    I went     into that          room to tell       the Direct ors what M

 CL OU G H had said.                The message,           in effect,      was     that there       could be no

he a solid            crush of        people      coming along.               I cannot say however                that

noti c e d any evidence                 of m i s b e h a v i o u r    among    the fans       near the turnsti

in the Ground.              I cannot          recall any         report       of    problems,       but on the

P o l i c e monitor         it was        noti ce ab le        that    crowds       outside     the L ep pings Ln

gates- had           increased,         an d they were            pushing       forward and there was                q

a crush.             The   computer         pr in t- ou t       indicated that there were                  about 2,

000' spaces           still     to be f il le d          in the N or th S tand area,                and about 2,5

in the West S ta nd area as                      1 recall.            On the monitor           I t-aw a M o un te d

Police         Officer        in the      crowd at the L ep pi ng s                Ln end and he seemed to

the     same         officer    as had earlier                 been    involved at- the            player's

 entrance.              F r o m . the   T.V.      picture his           horse      seemed to shy and slip

 was an         i ndication to me that                   the    crush out there was                increasing.

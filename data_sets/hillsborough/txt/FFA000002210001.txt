     FA CUP SEMI-FINAL - LIVERPOOL -v- NOTTINGHAM FOREST - SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989

     I personally attended the above match. I parked my car in the official car park
     and went into the stand and up until just after 3.00 pm all the arrangements
     seemed to be perfectly in order.

     What I observed was what everyone else observed in the ground. I do not think I
     am in a position to highlight any particular events from the position in which I
     was sitting.

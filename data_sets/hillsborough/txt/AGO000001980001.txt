          i.        N3

Thank you for your letter of 29 January about the Home
Secretary's statement on 29 January following publication of the
Taylor report.

As you know the statement referred to work continuing                                                         on the
scheme to see how the shortcomings identified by Lord                                                        Justice
Taylor could be overcome in case we needed to return                                                          to the
matter again. I accept that any costs stemming from such                                                     further
work should be met from within existing provision.

I am sending copies of this letter to the Prime Minister,
Geoffrey Howe, Douglas Hurd, David Waddington, Malcolm Rifkind,
Patrick Mayhew, the Lord Privy Seal, Timothy Renton and to Sir
Robin Butler.



                                                                             t iw v j   jLsjO s

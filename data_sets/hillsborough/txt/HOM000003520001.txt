         Dear Mr. Alton



         Further to our telephone conversation on Friday 23rd September
         please will you be kind enough to write to the Secretary of
         State for Health pressing her for a substantive reply to the
         points which you raised with her at your meeting sometime ago.
         You will recollect that a detailed memorandum was left with
         the Secretary of State and a full reply to the points raised
         in that memorandum is now required.       Thank you for your
         assistance.

         Yours truly

Dear Mr Johnston

COMPLAINT AGAINST ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE WALTER JACKSON

You are now in possession of my report and supporting evidence in respect
of the complaints made by Mr Trevor HICKS against Mr JACKSON, the Assistant
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police Force.     I have now received a
letter from Dr Stefan L POPPER, H M Coroner for South Yorkshire West
District in which he has made a number of objections which can be
summarised as follows:

 (i)        The Investigating O f f i c e r ’s reports, the statements, the documents
            and video recordings, should not be passed to the South Yorkshire
            Police until after the conclusion of the C o r o n e r ’s Inquests.

 (ii)       Any decision as to disciplinary action against any police officer
            should be deferred until after the conclusion of the C o r o n e r ’s
            Inquests.

 I am in urgent consultation with the Police Complaints Authority but these
consultations are unlikely to be concluded until after 10 September 1990.

It is my considered advice that you may care to delay any further action in
respect of the papers already in your possession until you have heard from
me further.

I hope that this relatively short delay will not cause you too much
inconvenience and that you will agree with me that there is no reason for
the C or o ne r ’s objections to be made public at this stage.

Yours sincere




Chief Constable
Investigating Officer

             At 8-30 am on Saturday,     15th April   1 9 8 9 , I started a tour of duty at a

             parade at Doncaster Police Station,        regarding the F.A. Cup Semi Final

             at Hillsborough, between i/iverpool F.C. and/Nottingham Forest.
               ------------------------/            107X
             I was to work in company with PC 2584 Mussk, attached to Se rial 27,

             under Sgt. Mozley.     PC Musk and myself were \6 man a barrier at the
             junction of Fielding Road and Penistone Ro^i.             We attendecj^n the North

             Stand of the football ground at 9.45 am far the match briefing.               After

             the briefing PC Musk and myself attended at our point at 10.45 am

             where we erected the barrier.      Neither PC Musk or myself were issued

             with a radio,     only Sgt. Mozley was given one.

             While on our point we were visited several times by Sgt. Mozley and an

             Inspector,    whose name I do not know.      from about     11.30 am the volume

             of fans began to increase near our point,            there was a mixture of
                                                                          PAGE         2
                                                                          S 2 491

Liverpool and Nottingham fans all mingled together and walking             in

opposite directions,     there were no public order      incidents due to the

moving of fans within my sight.        It was however apparent from the

outset that many of the Liverpool       fans who passed us from our right to

left, who were aged in their      late teens and twenties were drinking

alcoholic beverages that they had obviously purchased fr^m an off-

licence at the junction of Penistone Road and Vere Ro/d.

Many of the Liverpool     fans were carrying between 4yand 8 cans of beer

or lager,    or large plastic bottles of drink.        Th®y were not however

causing    problems.   Many people did however become very annoyed

especially the nearer to 3.00pm it got, when we would not allow them

access along Fielding Road to take a short           cut to Leppings Lane end of

the ground.

From the ouset of our "point" many Liverpool           fans approached us and

asked where the "ticket touts" were.        They were informed that we had

not seen any and we believed there were very few about.              Many of the

fans were suprised by this, and informed/us that there were many

"touts"    last year and they had no t r o u M e   obtaining tickets.     It was

apparent that all these fans had no t y c k e t s .    All day I heard the call

for "spares",    “spares" from Liverpool accents as they searched for

tickets.     They were even asking Nottingham fans.        Several    cars stopped

on Penistone Road near to us including a black taxi and the occupants,

all Liver pool fans asked for directions       to a Public House      called    'The

Beehive" as they said a lot of Liverpool           people were meeting there as

they knew the Landlord.

From 2.40 pm many fans were running along Penistone Road,             in both

directions,    obviously rushing to the turnstiles.        A lot of Liver pool

fans were irate because we would not allow them access to Fielding

Road.     0 . A.P.'s and middle aged people with toddlers were allowed

along Fielding Road as long as they walked along the centre of the
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           S2 4 9 1

road and kept away from the parked cars.           Only about   15 to 20 were

allowed through.
                                       (O 'KoiiM
At 3.00 pm we were joined by PC 598 Stubbi/hgs who had been manning
                                              0
the     other end of Fielding Road.    He was en route for his meal to

Claywheels Lane.     Myself or PC Musk was going to accompany PC

Stubbins,    but due to the number of fans still       running along Penistone

Road,    we delayed going for our meal,    until    it became less busy.      Still

many of the Liverpool    fans wanted access along Fielding Road,         but PC

Stubbins    informed them they had time to walk round as there were about

2,000 fans still queuing to get in.

At about 3.20 pm we were       informed by a lady who lives in Fielding Road

that she had heard on the radio or TV that something had collapsed in

the ground and some fans had been crushed to death.

Shortly afterwards,    fans,   some still drunk      and many of then visibly

shocked and crying, walked along Penistone           Road and told us that

people were dying inside and there had been a pitch invasion,             some of

the fans were also swearing and accusing the police of killing             people.

PC Musk and myself decided not to totally abandon the barrier,             but for

just PC Musk to go to the ground and leave me insitu, as we had not

received any direction from anyone.        Not having radios, we did not

fully appreciate the scale of the situation inside the ground.               I

asked several Senior Officers,      who passed along Penistone Road,

heading towards the ground with       'Serials'    if we were required    inside,

but I didn't get any response or direction.           Some of the Liverpool

fans who passed my point after the match had been abandoned,             were very

aggressive towards Police Officers and due to numbers of these fans it

was   impossible to do anything about     it.     I had occasion to stop three

Liverpool    fans who begun to scuffle with each other after 2 of them

accused the Police of causing the deaths and the third Liverpool                 fan

took offence and defended the Police action.

Dear Sirs,


 INQUEST INTO THE DEATH OF PAUL MURRAY LATE OF
                               STAFFORDSHIRE


As you are aware, we act on behalf of the parents of the above
who died in the Hillsborough Disaster.       At the Inquest on
1st May 1990 our Clients met with an Officer John Killock
who showed them a photograph number PR5/A/3 2 of which our
Clients would like a copy.      The photograph in fact showed
our Clients son being carried across the pitch on an advertising
hoarding.    Our Clients primary interest in the photograph
is to help them trace the supporter who apparently helped
their son during the accident as our Clients would like to
talk to the supporter in question (who has not as yet come
forward) to try and find out more details of how their son
died.   It is believed that the supporter in question actually
tried to revive our Clients son.     Our Clients are hoping to
try and trace him with the photograph through the Supporters
Club.

In view of the above, we wonder if you would be good enough
to inform us whether or not it is possible for you to supply
us with a copy of the photograph.  We look forward to hearing
from you.

Yours faithfully,
KNIGHT & SONS




The Officer in Charge,
Nechells Green Police Station,
Fowler Street,

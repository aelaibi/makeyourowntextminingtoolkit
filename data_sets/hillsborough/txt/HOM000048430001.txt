Mr. C.F. Bone,
The Hillsborough Scrutiny,
Room 528,

London, SW1H 9AT




                                      Hillsborough

Following my return from holiday I was able to speak to Mr. Dorries on 22nd
September regarding his letter to me o f 12th September. In the letter he informs me
that a lady by the name o f Ann Addlington from the Hillsborough Family Support
Group wanted to speak to me in connection with their submission to Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith with a view to confirming my understanding o f one or two particular
points. Unfortunately I do not know the points which she wishes to raise.

Whilst 1 do not wish to be unhelpful I have some difficulty in deciding whether I wish
to get into such a conversation or indeed whether it would be either wise or right to do
so.

Ln any case before I take a definitive view on this I think that I would like to have Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith’s view as to the propriety o f such a contact in the light o f his
scrutiny. Even if he considers it proper I would like to know whether he would prefer
to have the submission from the Hillsborough Family Support Group untrammelled by
conversations with me. If that is not the case please let me have specific confirmation
that he has no objection to a contact with the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

I am sorry to have to trouble you on this and look forward to hearing from you
shortly.


Yours sincerely,

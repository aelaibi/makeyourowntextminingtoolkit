                  Dear Mr Clarice

                  Re:     F.A. COP SEMI-FINAL TIES


                  Further to your recent letter regarding the above.   We
                  would be very happy to host asemi-final at our ground
                  irrespective of whether we are involved in a semi-final
                  ourselves at another ground.

                  He note your comments made regarding Executive Boxes and
                  special areas and they createno problems.     We enclose
                  herewith a plan of our ground giving the likely    numbers
                  of tickets available in both seating and standing.

                  However, these are the maximum capacities we are allowed
                  and do not provide voids between the fans, only a metal
                  or concrete barrier. We would suggest that these numbers
                  are therefore slightly reduced. should we be allocated a
                  semi-final we would try to firm up on numbers with
                  yourselves.


                  Yours sincerely

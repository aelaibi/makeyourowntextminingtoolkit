               HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY:        IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERIM REPORT
               - TWERTON PARK

               I enclose a copy of my letter o f ..........                    to the Chief
               Executive Avon County Council about                 implementation of the
               Hillsborough      Inquiry    Interim    Report        recommendations,         in
               particular compliance with recommendation 2(b) which seeks a
               15% reduction in standing capacities.


               Although     local      authorities         determine     the     terms       and
               conditions   to    be   contained      in    safety    certificates ’pEtm©
               responsibility for            ^safety of spectators               at sports
               grounds lies ^with        the ground management and               those who
               organise events at the ground.          The Home Secretary therefore
               looks to ground occupiers,       including football league clubs,
               to co-operate fully in helping to restore public confidence
               in the safety arrangements at football grounds.                   To do this
               properly     he   believes     that     it     is     essential   that    the
recommendations of the Interim Report of the Hillsborough
Inquiry should be implemented in full.


Our understanding is that recommendation 2 (b) of the Interim
Report,    calling        for     a     15%     reduction       in    the    standing
capacity, has not implemented at Twerton Park.                             If this is
so, even though actual attendances may normally be below the
maximum capacity as now assessed, I must ask you to reduce
this     maximum     level        in        accordance    with       the    Inquiry's
recommendation       at    2(b)        of    the   Interim      Report.       I   look
forward to confirmation from you that this is being carried
out and for your assurance that the re-assessed figure will
not be exceeded.


I have written in similar terms to [The Secretary, Bristol
Rovers    Football    Club]       [The       Secretary,     Bath     City Football
Club].    I have also written (copy enclosed) to the Football
Association and Football                League     to    whom    a   copy    of   this
letter has been sent.

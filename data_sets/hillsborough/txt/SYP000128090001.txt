               terraces via Steward                controlled gate.

Back of North Stand packed, with men urinating against                                  the wall when

shouted at by myself >• carried on reg ard le ss.                              At this time my

attention was drawn to back of turnstiles                            for North Stand where

Po 1 i c:e Constab 1 es f rorn my serial              had come thr ough the tur nstiles,

En t ra n c e gat es    ’A ’ w ere s ha k ing v io 1e n 1 1y ,          F a ns c om i n g t h ro u g h

turnstiles drunk and hostile shouting;                          ‘'They’re getting killed out

there,     t h e r e ’s going to be another H e y s e l s ’ and. screaming for gate                           *

Gate    ’A ’ o p e n e d a n d c:r o w d s u r g e d f o rw a r d t h r o u g h t h e g a t e „   T h e ga t e

was    closed, again only seconds                later.

Sack on turnstile            duty only a few Liverpool                   fans corning through

sudde n 1y a c r a wd appear s at mai n gates t o t u r ns t i1es wh i ch ar e

closed,.      Only people now attempting to get in are very drunk

Liverpool      fans.       Turnstiles         closed scuffling            breaking out between

Liverpool      fans and in one occasion a drunken Liverpool                              fan lashed out

at a Mounted Officer with a broken bottle.                              Suddenly Special

Inspector beckons wildly at me.                       I ran to gates             *B ’ where i saw an

obviously dead boy being                put    in an ambulance,                passed a near naked

dead man at gate           ’B ’ and into the area between gate                       *B* and the
tunnel far the terraces,.        In this area approximate 1y 10 dead people

were strewn     about.

I checked these to ensure they were dead then assisted with the

injured people some of who were also           lying   in this area,   I then,

after seeing the arrival        of ambulance    crews,    ran through the tunnel

to the terraces where        I was met by a wall of Liverpool       fans,    looking

over them I could see the pitch had been invaded,              people around me    in

the tunnel    began moaning,     I assisted to escort these       people out of

the tunnel where      if they were injured,      directed ambulance     crews to

them *

Myself and Police Constable 809 carried the body of a young fair

haired boy in a Liverpool        shirt and light trousers       in the lane

running adjacent to the River don., we then went onto the pitch.

People were being carried away but no bodies were on the pitch.-.

Attention called for Leppings Ln terraces where Liverpool              fans were

attacking another Liverpool        fan who they say was picking up

belongings from the terraces and putting them in his pocket.

Called by another officer to go to Leppings              ln, - On the way assist

to remove bodies from back of terrace tunnel              to lane running adjacent

to the River Don then form cordon helping fans to leave ground,

stream of urine      running down from North Stand like a waterfall.

Fans     leaving ground violent and asking       if the match is off.,

Ambulances     convey bodies away.

Liverpool    fans   leave,   then instructed to go to North Stand for de~

b r ie f .

Throughout     these events    I felt nothing,    I just helped where       I could.

It seemed as though nobody really knew what              to do but help with the

dead and injured.

I have worked at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on numerous

occasions and usually have policed the same turnstiles without any

              I am a Detective Constable of the South Yorkshire Poli ce presently

              working from the Criminal                Investigation Department of Woodseats Police

              S ta t io n .

              I was      rostered to work a football            duty in uniform at the Liverpool/

              Notts., Forest match on 15 April               1989      (150489).,

              I commenced duty at 8,30 am (0830)                   on that date at Woodseats Police

              Station where              I joined numerous other officers who were subsequently

              conveyed in a PSV to Hillsborough Football Ground.

              Shortly after arrival all                the officers      on my serial   (Serial   11) joined

              me on the North stand for                the pre match briefing by senior officers,

              at this     briefing          I recall   a briefing officer state that the          kick off

              time would be 3 pm (1500)                no later.

              Together with the following officers                     I went to the Lappings Ln area
                                                                                PAGE     2


behind the West stand and positioned myself behind turnstiles                 1 and 2

on the   inside of the ground at approximately 11,20 am (1120),               P32279

E d w a r d s , DC 1329 Friend,   DC2857 Turner,   DC 2571 Titterton,     PC 1074

Thicket and PC2409 Larkin,

The only officer       in possession of a personal       radio was PS2279 Edwards,,

Our duties at this        location was as outlined       in the duty order for

serial    11, at this time we had commenced Phase 1 of the              serials duties

that   is covering turnstiles         1 to S and at approximately       12 noon (1200)

the turnstiles opened to allow fans to enter.               At this time    1 could

see two male uniformed officers           carrying out searches of fans entering

through turnstiles        1 and 2 in front of vvse      Shortly before

the turnstiles      opened several      stewards   in reflective jackets were

joined by someone who appeared to be an official with a UHF type radio

and together they unlocked an internal             perimeter fence which divided

the access from the North stand and the West stand.               I questioned the

man with the radio as I was           concerned that fans entering       later when

it would be busy would have access to either side.               I was told that

they had wrongly positioned two markers outside turnstiles 9 to 12 and

fans entering for the North stand would be entering the ground on

the West stand end,          I was also told that     it was too late to take

them down as they had been screwed           in position.     A small    portable

type aluminium barrier had been positioned to the left of turnstiles 9

to 12 and manned by further stewards who have been requested by the

man with the radio.

By this time      I was aware that the Serial Sergeant,         Sgt Edwards was not

in the vicinity,         I returned to my position and at       that time the

turnstiles     opened and fans began to enter.

At around 2 pm (1400)         I was aware that two fans had been brought            in

through the gate       leading to the North stand immediately to my right.

They were    in possession of several hundred pounds           in cash and a number
                                                                                                          ’AGE


of tickets        for the match that were suspected to faa forgeries.                                     They

w e r e c o n v ey e d t o t h e P o 1 i c e r o om .

A short      time after this as                 I was searching a fan entering the

turnstile at I.              I heard one of the ticket collectors shout, from the

direction of turnstile 4 or 5 " H e ’s got no ticket,"                                    1 turned and         saw

a young      lad in a blue tracksuit running from that direction and on

seeing me attempting to run away from me,

I detained the youth who was in possession of a ticket stub which he

agreed was not his and after obtaining his details he was ejected via

the North stand gate which was by this time beginning to be blocked by

ia r g e \ ■ n m b e r s o f i*a.n s

The youth was ejected as opposed to being arrested or taken to the

Pol ice room as it was becoming much busier and I was aware that

numerous other fans were                    causing problems               in the area of the

turnstiles         by jumping over them or attempting to enter two at a time.

Had 1 taken any other action it would have                                  left   .less of a Police

presence at ths turnstiles*                        Youth ejected"

fan was attempt i ng to enter through the turnstii. es together.;                                        One fat

fan,    30 years,        pushed out of turnstile                          no ticket,.    He had tried to

get    in with three others who had tickets and had entered.                                          He was

extremely drunk and his three friends were also intoxicated.

Incidents        involved fans attempting to pull tickets and stubs from the

turnstile attendants.

At around 2.30 pm (1430)                    1 detained a further               person who had jumped

over the barrier without a ticket,                                             , 29 years,

                      Liverpool        (CRO                      Due to the ever growing

numbers outside the turnstiles between 1 and 12                          I took this fan around

through the West stand              (then I remained at          this    point) area behind               the

turnstiles to the large Gate C immediately alongside                            the South stand

road entrance beside turnstile G where                      he was ejected along with about

three other fans who had been escorted                       to this      point by other

officers,      1847 Bungy,        1506 Marsh - E 2 ,        by this       time    it was

As 1 had approached the area behind turnstiles A to G at the rear of

the West stand 1 observed about                    10 persons   climbing along the top of

the gate between turnstile                 16 and turnstile A,

These fans were         progressively making their               way towards        the roof of

officers working at these turnstiles,                     a large number of fans who were

in an aggressive and noisey mood were                     congregating around turnstiles A

to G and the fans who had been on top of the gate earlier were by

this time on the roof of turnstiles A to G and were                           increasing        in

numbers.

The fans on the          roof were waving what appeared to be complete tickets

with attached stubs,            they began to jump from the turnstile                    roofs       in

increasing numbers-              I was by this time on my own.,               I decided to

remain at this         point as       it was appearing       to be having greater             control

problems that at turnstiles                  1 to 12 where      1 had been earlier..            I was

being approached by larger groups of fans some of whom had climbed the

outer gate and gained access from the turnstile                          roof at turnstiles A

■sa f e t y „

Several         stated, that   it was going to be another Hey sal Stadium

outside the turnstiles and pleaded that the main gates should be

opened to save         lives,     I genuinely believed at this time that, people

outside on Leppings Ln ware               in danger of dying.       I tried to position

myself nearer the gate and turnstiles,                  A large number of fans

continually hurled abuse and threats towards me,.                   I observed through

one of the turnstiles,            I believe turnstile 8 on the West         stand

entrance,         an unconscious young        lad approximately 11 years of age.           He

was dressed in red and was being passed over the heads of fans outside

the turnstiles towards the South stand road entrance.                     I was by this

time being pushed physically back away from the gates and other fans

were; approaching         pleading that the gates should be? opened.            Mature,

sober men were         in tears    pleading that     children and women were being

crushed to death outside.                Some fans who were more sympathetic: stated

that they had heard other fans state outside that                   if they pushed

before kick off and caused a crush the Police would have to let them



fans were by this time entering through turnstiles A to G in a

uis t res s©d state,

1 saw one man,         male,    white,    approximately 3U years,     5 ' S “ , slim build,

dark hair,         black moustache,       thin facial   features,   he entered through

turnstile E and was in a collapsed state and appeared to be suffering

from chest         crush injuries.       As   I attempted to assist him I saw an old

man enter through these same turnstiles and lean on the wall gasping

Although it seemed like a long time the gates were only opened about                                                                                                   i

Stadium outs i d s **

Again more sympathetic fans were arguing on my behalf that they

shouldn't blame me*              I was asked for the name of the officer                           in charge

distressed and from what                I could see I feared that someone would

surely die outside,              I could see fans continuing to climb the gates

and falling through the turnstiles at A to G, some in injured states..

Mention was made fay one of these f a n s , of a public house where fans

had beers drinking shortly before the game called The See Hive,                                          This

public house was not known to me prior to being mentioned by this fan,.

To date     1 do not know its            location although I presume                  it must       be

reasonably near the stadium at Hillsborough.

I was busy dealing with these fans and trying to console and appease

them,    when again about 3 or 4 minutes                    later,      the same gate opened

again,     and although further fans entered                     it was not        in as many

numbers.       At this point I recall a uniformed PC calling to me from the

gate and asking me to help push the gate closed,                              which I did.,          I have

considered this matter and am unsure whether                            1 assisted this PC to

close the gate on the first or second occasion.,

During this time I was aware of two stewards to my left wearing the

flourescent waistcoats,               one of them mentioned to me that he did not

know where all the fans would go as the West stand must be full.                                           Also

whilst the crowd entered on the first occasion I believe that                                      1 saw

the juvenile                  whom I had ejected from the Worth stand gate at

around 2 pm C1400 ), he was                in the centre of the crowd with other

youths who were          running hard,.          I formed the         impression that this group

did not have tickets.,              A large number obviously did and on entering

several attempted to give me their tickets to remove the stub.                                           Due to

the circumstances           several      injured persons staggering around and

few officers        I did not attempt to take tickets from them.                              Had I done

iso I would moat            certainly have been pushed out of the way by the bulk

of the      crowd and would have           impaired their entry which would

have defeated the object of the exercise                    that    is relieving the

GROUND INCIDENT

Af t er the ga t e s had clo se d on t h e s econd occ asi on it s ee m eds t ra n g e 1y

quiet     in the vicinity of the turnstiles.                    I was     relieved to find that

most of the more aggressive                fans had gone and I looked around to see

if I could see any of my colleagues                 or other officers,           There were few

officers; around.                After about 5 minutes     I saw approximately 10 to 15

uniformed constables                run past me from the direction of the North

stand.       Amongst them I saw DC Turner, DC Friend,                     DC Titterton and

other officers            from my serial     (Serial     11),     They were running in the

direction of the Police                control   room at the side of the West stand.

At this time I was unaware of what                 the    incident was and on joining

these officers            running towards the Police            control    room I was   informed

that    it was a pitch invasion.

I was not aware of the time and I did not realise that the game was                               in

fact underway.              On arrival at the side of the West              stand an internal

dividing gate at the                rear of the Police     room was opened and we all had

access      to the sides of the South stand.                On entering the first aisle

leading onto the pitch,                I was aware that no players were on the pitch.

I could hear fans state that the teams had just                           left the pitch,

On looking across towards the front of the West                           stand to my left I

could see Police officers                in front of the security fencing           in the area

behind the goal             post,    numerous fans were scaling the perimeter fence

and dropping over onto the pitch.                  It became obvious that          it was not a

pitch invasion,             people were staggering from the perimeter fence being

assisted by Police officers and other fans.                        They were falling onto

the grassed          playing area in the vicinity of the goals.                  Women,   old

Together with my colleagues,                 I went directly to the area at the rear

of the goal       posts.      To my left a perimeter fence gate some 4" wide was

open,    between this area and the area to the right of the goal                                posts      I

couId s ee a numbe r of obv ious 1y dea.d bodies , you.ng women and ma.i n 1y

teenage male fans.             They were      pressed firmly against the                 perimeter

fence    in a standing         position,        I estimated initially about 20

obviously dead persons.               At this time officers were                 climbing the

peri meter fence and assisting                 in pulling bodies and injured out,.                     1

immediately went to the open gate to my left and joined a Police

Sergeant      <ID ????)„        He was attempting            to pull a large unconscious

male    person out of the gate.               This    person was trapped by his legs.                      He

was wearing a white/light t shirt,                    heavy build,         blue jeans and short

fair hair,       despite attempts he was jammed tight.                       Alongside him was a

conscious young woman with long brown hair,                         slim build,        approximately

20 to 30 years,           She was screaming           in pain and trapped by her waist

like the unconscious man by her side.                       She could not be pulled free at

this time,        I then became aware that at least another 8 or IQ bodies

ware enmeshed and piled up behind them directly behind the gate most

were blue and appeared dead.                 The crowd were still surging forward and

despite shouting at them to move back,                      they obviously could not hear

from the noise being made mostly from the rear by angry and aggressive

fans.      I could see DC 1177 Davis,                he was     inside this area behind the

bodies.      He had lost his helmet.                 His tunic was opened,

I could see what appeared to be a Police officer directly behind DC

Davis,      He had been lifted physically and dropped head first over the

through this gate to attempt a rescue were forced to stand a n                                         bodies,

I could not bring myself to stand on the bodies and remained on the

first- 10 minutes or so the fans were behaving hysterically,                                      some

were throwing objects,               one of which was a coin which I. saw strike the

fencing          near to the gate-          This behaviour seemed to cease relatively

quickly and officers formed a line inside and outside the gate

entrance and began to pass bodies through.

A large number of injured and distressed persons outside the West

stand area on the pitch were                     being received and assisted by Police

officers and St John Ambulance                    brigade,

I was passed the body of an unconscious female with 1ong brown hair.

She was not the one trapped at the gate,                            1 with others

(unknown)           carried her to a stretcher nearby,.                    I believe that she was

still alive,             I returned and was           passed an anconsicous male,                  he was

situation and at that time                  I was aware of being struck by someone's

foot    into rny right hip whilst                 I was     resuscitating the above fan,                    I

continued what           I was doing but was aware of a fan walking away from me

wearing blue jeans and white trainers,                             I could not tell whether                I was

kicked intentionally but it occurred whilst the abusive                                       remarks were

being made,

Through exhaustion I was unable to continue the resuscitation and I

was    relieved by someone else who took over.

During this time            I was observing a young Policewoman                          (shoulder      length

black hair busy at bottom).                     She had been resuscitating a young man,

male,     white,     2 0 ’s green t shirt             (tennis style),           blue jeans,          6 ’ tall,

slim build.          At one point he seemed to have                       recovered and started

breathing,          I recall       thinking that she was doing a great job bringing

him around.          She had placed him on his side                       in the recovery position.

As a result of my attempted                    resuscitation          I had been left di zzy and

after a few moments              I turned to see that the above described fan had

stopped breathing again,,                   I then went over to her and with her

assistance        I again turned him onto his back,                        cleared his airway and

together we administered cardiac and artificial                                 resuscitation,.          After

a few minutes we were joined by a Doctor and a nurse who took over

with the aid of an ambulance                     resuscitation mask and oxygen tank.                        By

this time the first fan that                    I had attended to on the pitch,                       the fan

with the moustache,              he had been removed by someone and presumably

takers to the Sports Hall where ambulances had by then arrived,

I was also aware whilst                 resuscitating the first fan that a reporter

(TV) with a cameraman were walking onto the pitch from the direction

of the South stand.                The behaviour of the reporter                     in particular

(male,     white,      black hair,         ? blue suit,          dark eyebrows,           25 ~ 30 years)

was    instantly offensive,.               He was      casually walking             past myself and

o t h e r o f f i c e r s a n d f a n s w h o w e r e s t r u g g 1 i n g t o r e s u s c i ta t e

casualties.          He was adjusting his tie as if to prepare to be filmed
                                                                                            PAGE     12


■and appeared to be looking for any or a certain senior                             police officer.

As a result        roars of anger          could be heard from fans who were              likewise

angered and disgusted by his behaviour.                           I was aware that several

p o 1 i ce o f f i c e r s r e rno v e d t h e m f ro m t h e p it ch «

After this time I looked around to see if I could assist anyone else

but by this time everything was under                        control.

I made my way towards where the bodies had been recovered,                              at this

time a number of Liverpool                 fans were standing around mainly at the

rear of all        the bodies had been removed and Police officers were

beginning to collect              clothing and personal              items dropped by the

injured and deceased.               As they were doing so I saw a young Liverpool

fan approximately            16 years walk through the area where a barrier had

collapsed behind and to the left of the goal                              post he looked around and

then quickly snatched up a programme which had obviously been dropped

by one of the         injured or dead.             He quickly put           it in his back packet

and ran back up to the               left hand side of the West stand to join other

young Liverpool          fans.       I went after him and asked him if he wanted to

steal anything else from the dead,.                       He took the programme from his

pocket and put          it back down at my request,                  left the stand area.

As instructed together with other officers                           I attended at a de-brief       in

the North stand a short time                  later before returning to Woodseats

Police Station via a PSv from Cl ay wheels Ln,.

The bodies had ail            been removed and I walked with another officer to

the Sports Hall where              I was approached by the elderly parents of a

Doctor who had been assisting with the injured.                              They asked if I could

locate him,.         I enquired at the Sports Hal I/Pol ice room/first aid room

and was told he was believed to have gone to the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital. - I told them how to get there.

In my opinion there appeared to be a lack of first aid equipment/

airways,      oxygen etc.          The atmosphere          on the pitch could only be

described as totally uncontrolable                    chaos due to the incredible numbers

of dead and injured;                the situation was not helped by the

continual             interference of press      photographers and camera crew and the

rrso r e a g g r s s s iv e f a n s .

In respect of the perimeter                fencing,      I had great difficulty in

assisting the evacuation of persons                    from the West         stand due to a wall

some 3 5 high before you reach the bottom of the gate.                               It had a ditch

like effect             in which people    collapsed and could not be seen through

t he fe n c e .

NOTE?        one male Liverpool         supporter     on my arrival at the perimeter gate

who was screaming to be pulled out,                    claimed to be a Liverpool                police

officer,             he did not, appear   injured and came from the vicinity of the

west stand to the left of the perimeter gate*                           Description;        male

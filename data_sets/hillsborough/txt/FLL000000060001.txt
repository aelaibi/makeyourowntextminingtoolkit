 Dear Mr Dent

 We were all deeply saddened to hear of the tragedy at
 Hillsborough on Saturday afternoon, and may X express our
 greatest sympathy with all those who have lost friends or
 â– relations in the disaster.

 B a r c l a y s h a r e 's sponsorship of two of the League's awards has
 drawn us close to the energy and enthusiasm which typifies he
 game, and we were shattered to think that such an appallinq
 tragedy could strike its supporters in this way.

 Yours sincerely




 G D R OLDHAM

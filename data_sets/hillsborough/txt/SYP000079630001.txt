           holder at Anfield



           On Saturday 15 April                 1989 <150489) Liverpool and Notts Forest met each

           other     in the semi-final of the FA cup at Hillsborough the home of

           Sheffield Wednesday.



                                                                                                   and

           had to                                                                        My ticket was




           We left Leeds in my car at about midday <1200 hrs) and travelled along
                                                                                         PAGE      2
                                                                                         S2389

               the Ml to Junction 36,   from there I made my way towards the ground.

               There was no real congestion or delays in getting to the area of the

               ground.



               It was like a normal busy week end.



               I parked my car about half a mile from the ground and walked down a

               hill   towards the ground.   I parked the car at about    1 pm - 1.15 pm

               <1300 - 1315 h r s ) outside a parade of shops.



               We were given no directions of how to get to the ground,          but I ’d been

               there before and knew the way.



               On the way to the ground I saw                        fighting

               fans drinking from cans of beer along t      route               round.



                                                                                           there

               and I think it may be called The Gate.     Thar front windows of the pub

               men on the door who said that only Liv/rpool fans were allowed in.



               There were about   100 Liverpool -Ran/ in there,    probably more.
           -



               There were groups of fans sitting together,       singing football songs and

               chatting amongst themselves.     There was no fighting or disorder         in the

               pub.



               There were three of us in there,                     had gone to get his

               ticket.
                                                                                     PAGE     3
                                                                                     S2389

            We stayed in there until about 2 pm - 2.15 pm (1400           1415 h r s ),

            during that time I had 2 pints of lager.



            As we left the pub we met           trying to get    in, who by now had got

            his ticket.



            We walked around to the Leppings Ln entrance and          t there about 2.20
5.0. e.
            pm (1420 hrs).    When we got there,   there were           2 - 3,000 people
 U u -
            outside the turnstiles trying to get i               iias very congested with a

            lot of people crushing forward to get to         iturnst i les.



            There were two mounted Police Officers f r y i n g   to get people to form

  A T       some sort of a queue to the turnstile/.       It was getting quite serious

    *—    * at this stage,   the Police were not j^aving much success due to the

            volume of people.
                                     '




            We were   in a great   crowd of poeple all pushing and shoving because

            they were desperate to get to the front.      Even though we had no

            intention of rushing forward we were forced forward by the pressure of

            people pushing from behind.



            When I got to the turnstile,     I handed my ticket    in and entered the

            ground where all four of us met up inside the turnstiles.



            We walked around to the right hand side of t^e stand and stood in pens

            1 or 2 with our backs against the wall of       ie stand.     That would be

            about 2.30 pm - 2.35 pm (1430 - 1435 hrs/.



            There was plenty of room around us in our pen, while the centre pens

            seemed crammed full, actually there was no actual         crush at that time.
                                                                           PAGE      4
                                                                           S2389

          as far as I could see,



          We all stayed there and I looked at the pitch,   rather than the centre

          pens.



          The teams came onto the pitch and had a kick around before they kicked

          off at 3 pm (1500 hrs).



          After about 5 minutes of play        pointed out tbet people were going
ca t      onto the pitch from the direction of the two centre pens.    Most people

          started climbing over the fences a t the frox^C and onto the running
cH   BL
          track and pitch.



          A Policeman ran onto the pitch and spoke to the referee, who then took

          the players off the pitch.



          I couldn't really see what was going on in the centre pens because of

          the crowds in front and the fact that we were right at the back.



          I saw more people climbing over onto the pitch and could see that some

          were injured and gasping for air.   Police and supporters were helping

          the people over the fence and administering first aid to the injured.



          About 3.15 - 3.20 pm (1515 - 1520 hrs)   I saw firemen in the ground

          cutting away at the perimeter fencing of the centre pens to allow fans

          to get onto the pitch.



          There were a lot of people on the pitch,   some were laid out on the

          ground and appeared to be dead, while others were critically injured.

        I anticipated that there may possibly be crush problems in our pen.

                 and        wen/ off to find a safer place to stand.      People    in

        the seats above u y were reaching forward and pulling people up to the

        seats.     This mar/helped me reach up to one of the people in the seats.
c a t
        Who pulled m         into the stand,        came up into the stand the same

STnwo   way



        We stood right at the front and stood looking down into the two centre

        pens.     I could see the Police,    firemen,   other supporters helping the

        fans out of the pens and onto the pitch.



        I could see that there was an extremely bad crush in the pens.             I have

        never seen anything like it.        People were jammed up really close

        together.      There was no space in that pen at all.



        We asked a Policeman if we could go home and if        game had been
                                                             C/fT      I      o y
        abandoned, he didn't know, and then there w a / a n announcement over the
                                             A
        tannoy from the Liverpool Manager, Kenny p&lglish.     He said that the

        game had been abandoned and asked ujs to/co-operate with the Police and

        to sit tight.



        At about 4.30 - 4.35 prn (1630 - 1635 hrs) we left the crowd and made

        our way to the car and home.



        When the fans first came onto the pitch J. thought that it was just a

        general overspill.

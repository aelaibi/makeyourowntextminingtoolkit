               Division o f t h e         p^partment of Land and Planning.             Since    commencing

               employment wi#h the City Council                   in November    1985 <001185),       I have held

               the positijzm of Principal District S u r v e y o r.

               I am t h y service manager of the di vi s io n’s Site Supervision U n i t ,

               currently consisting of 24 staff, whose main functions are to carry out

               inspections of building works in progress within the City boundaries,

               enforce Building Regulation requirements,                      and to carry out inspections

               of licensed premises and to advise on their                      constructional and

               structural         suitability.

               The Division also incorporates a General Assessment Unit for the

               examination of deposited Building Regulation applications,                           a Structural

Unit.     Each Unit   is headed by a Principal Surveyor or Principal

Engineer, and all are directly responsible to The Building Surveyor.

I am a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Building, a fellow of the

Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors,            and a member of

the Institute of Building Control.

My first    involvement with Safety of Sports Grounds was in mid March

1986 (000386),    when I attended a meeting to discuss the transfer of

duties    (on the first of April    1986 (010486)    from the South Yorkshire

County Council to the City Council.        Specific    involvement with

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club began in early July 1986 (000786),

when I attended a meeting of the Officer Working Party,             where the

predominent discussion was of the new construction to cover over and

extend the Spion Hop,       the construction of which had already commenced.

On both these occasions,       the Principle Engineer                      from the

division's Structural Assessment Unit also attended.              This officer had

been involved with the subject of Safety of Sports Grounds since 1976

(000076).     He had acted as the D i v i s i o n ’s liaison officer with the

County Council,       on behalf of the Building Surveyor,       who was nominated

by the City Council       to be the officer representing the Building

Authority, and hence a member of the Officer Working Party.

The Principle Engineer had attended most of the meetings of the officer

working    pa rty , with either one of my two predecessors        (Mr        and Mr

           both of whom have now retired)     or relevant members of my staff

who dealt with the geographical area of the City appropriate to the

sports ground under discussion.        During this    period,    it was seen to be

appropriate that site inspections and meetings were attended by members

of both the Structural Assessment Unit and the Site Supervision Unit,

since    in addition to the professional advice       (where the guide to safety

of sports grounds was taken into account,        where appropriate)       given

to the Working Party,      and subsequently the Advisory Group,         many of the
                                                                             PAGE       3
                                                                             S30

works    required to be carried out for Safety of Sports Grounds            purposes

also    required Building Regulation approval and supervision.             The role

of the district surveying staff was to ensure that proposals could

comply with Building Regulations, and that they were constructed so as

to comply with that       legislation and any additional       requirements made by

the Off i ce r Working Party.     Many issues we re discussed by that group

concerning works       required and proposals   relating to the football stadia

in the City.         Discussion and agreement by the group was reached before

works were undertaken and proposals implemented.              During that time

there was never a case where consensus was not reached by the Working

Party.     The minutes of the meeting of the Officer Working Party dated

12th February 1979 <120279)       (Ref A B 1 ) (Exh       ) discussed four items

of relevance to the West end of the Hillsborough ground -

1.     The reasonableness of applying the “guide."

2.     The unknown reasoning for the 1.1 metre width of gangways?

3.     The requirement for an additional      stairway to be provided to the

       West Stand;

4.     Regarding the West T e rr ac e , the minutes   read,   "In view of the lack

       of depth of this terrace,    the C l u b ’s offer to reduce the spectator

       limit to 7,200,    and the discharge time to 6.6 minutes,         the Working

       Party AGREED that    it would be unreasonable to insist that gangways

       or additional exits would be provided.         However,    even if the

       existing   crush barriers were to pass the tests,         the Working Party

       AGREED that the barriers would require special attention in view of

       the apparent sharp edges,    corrosion etc."

At a further meeting on 30th March 1979 (300379),             (Ref A B 2 ) (Exh     )

the discussions on the above four points were de ve lo pe d«           Regarding the

reasonableness of applying the guide,         "the Home Office had said that

the maximum flexibility had to be maintained in the case of existing

structures and differences       in such matters as age,       size and mode of
                                                                                               PAGE   4
                                                                                               S30

            construction had to be taken into account."

            It is noted that the Home Office had not provided any guidance for the

^           reasoning of the widths of gangways.                In relation to the fourth point

            the following        is minuted,    "As well as the condition of the crush
Lk/$l
            barriers,    the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition

            in places of the terracing           in small areas near to the stand.         The

            cross-fall on the steps on the North West corner exit would also

            require attention as           it tended to throw people forward.         The height of

            the crush barriers mentioned in regard to the Spion Hop                  <ie below the

            recommendations of the           "Guide") also applied.         It was AGREED that all

            these points must be drawn to the Club's attention.                   In accordance with

            the Home Office        recommendations,      flexibility in the use of the "Guide"

            was used in the subsequent detailed discussions held between the C l u b ’s

            engineers and staff of this^Division since the height of the crush

            barriers remained unaljfe'ered.           The General Safety Certificate for the

            ground was issued ^fn^glst December              1979 <211279) by the South Yorkshire

            County C o un ci l/ ^ T h e    rrgnutes of the Officer Working Party dated 8 th

            June 1981     <080681).       <Ref AB3)   <Exh      ) states-

            "Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match,                  the Club were

            considering     revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the

            (West) S t a n d .   An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party

            would be consulted when these had substance."                   This is the only

            r e f er en ce in the D i v i s i o n ’s files to an incident on the terraces in

aKl         &       7
                   (jfluOOSI), and this matter was not brought to my attention by any

                ihe/ source.

            'h^ design work for the installation of radial fences to the West

            terrace was carried out by the C l u b ’s engineers,             and was submitted to

        ^          <020981),     <Ref AB4)     <Exh          ) and was discussed at a meeting <?n

            {11th September      1981     <110981).   The minutes of that meeting       (Ref A85)
                                                                                PAGE    5
                                                                                S30

(Exh       ) states-      "Whilst there are drawbacks to the division of the

terrace     into approximately three equal areas,         each served by it's own

entrance,    the Working Party felt that increased control on the terrace

should result from the proposals.              For instance there could well be

problems with opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or

the final exit gates,        but the police considered that they could cope

with any problems of this nature.              The adequacy and positioning of the

gates to be installed at the rear of the radial barriers was also

discussed,    as well as the use of the existing gates in the pitch

perimeter security fence at the front of the terrace.”

One of the conditions of accept^ffce of the proposals by the Working

Party was that the new gatejir at the rear of the Terrace be under police                   j
contro1 ■     The representative of the Building S u r ve yo r’s Department on              1

this occasion was Mr SHERIFF.

In 1985 (000085),      the Club submitted further        proposals to subdivide the

West Terrace,     by the installation of additional         radial fe nc e s.    The

minutes of the meet ing       (attended in this instance by Mr                    on

behalf of the Building S u r v e y o r ’s Division),     held on 18th April      1985

(180485),     (Ref AB6)    (Exh       ) states-

"The Police representatives           pointed out that the proposals had been

prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club."                 The main

purpose of the proposals was to segregate home and visiting

supporters at the West end of the ground.              At that meeting the

proposals appear to have been discussed in detail, and it is minuted

that s~

"The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to

the Police     representatives, subject to;-         (a) additional   gates being

provided between turnstile no.           16 and the wall of the inner access

road;     (b) the central area of the terrace         (indicated as a neutral area

or visiting supporters*           terrace)   being divided in half by a new central
                                                                              PAGE       6
                                                                              S30

radial fence    running from the tunnel entrance to the pitchside security

fence with gates erected so as to permit entry to be diverted to either

half as appropriate       (the proposed new secondary radial fence adjacent

to the exiting fence       indicated on the plan to be abandoned);       <c) the

right hand area of the terrace       (indicated as home supporters'       terrace)

also to be divided in half by a new central          radial fence running from

back to front with two gates       (the existing    radial fence dividing the

present two terrace areas - neutral area and home supporters ~ to have

a second gate installed;       (d) the existing    pitch perimeter fence to

have additional       exit gates installed - one in the neutral area and one

in the home supporters area.        The County Fire Service saw no objection

to the proposals,       subject to more detailed investigation of the means

of escape aspects,      and the Building Authority similarly saw no

objection,    subject to submission of detailed plans and calculations

under both the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and Bui 1ding Reg ul at io ns ."

It is apparent that discussions on the proposals took place outside the

formal meetings of the Working Party subsequent to that date,                 since the

proposals had been modified       (to those actually installed),       by the time

they were next discussed at the meeting on 29th July 1985 (290785),

(minutes    included as Ref AB7)    (Exh        ) where the scheme was accepted

subject to the installation of a further          pitch perimeter g a t e .

Throughout the period of consideration of radial           barrier   installations

on the West Terrace,       the County Council   document   (Ref A S S ) (Exh         )

was   in vogue which indicated primary and consultation Authorities for

various    purposes    in the implernentation of the sports grounds

legislation.     It is clear from the list of subjects that the Building

Authority was    primarily responsible for all the structural aspects of

the grounds,    including the spacing of crush barriers, and that the Fire

Authority was    primarily responsible for all       calculations for means of
                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                              S30

In retrospect,      it is known that the drawings of the West Terrace used

by members of the Working Party were dimensionally incorrect,                                showing

that the terrace was deeper than it ’s actual dimension.                             It is also

known from minutes of meetings that the original                         capacity of 7,200

was an agreed reduction from the computed capacity, and that the

works carried out in 1981            (000081) and 1985 (000085) were done to

increase safety,       to reduce the danger of lateral surges, and to

facilitate more efficient police control of insurgents.                            Signs appear

to have been considered by the Working Party in respect of indicating

exit routes,     particulary for means of escape.                    Signing for ingress

purposes was not,       to my knowledge,           discussed at any meeting of the

Officer Working Party/ Advisory Group which I attended.                              Whilst

signing a means of escape was clearly within the remit of the Fire

Authority,    the Bui I d i j n g ^ u r v e ^ o r e j ^ r e s e n ^ a t ^ i v - ° n-w r^ c° rd_i

clear example of the professional                 interaction of members of the

Working Party.         Coincidental to the transfer of duties under the

sports grounds legislation from               the County Council            to the City Council

a number of factors were appreciated within the Building Surveyor's

Division which        had an effect on the future representation at meetings.

The recent ill        health of the Principal Engineer, and a knowledge that

further hospitalisation was imminent played a major part,                              however     it

was also a time when an internal                restructuring         process was being

considered in anticipation of a major                   increase in workload due to the

regeneration of the Sheffield economy and the anticipation of staging

the World Student Games.             A third sports ground in Sheffield was also

expected to be designated for the purposes of the Act, and it was

appreciated that a considerable               input would be required in this

respect.     In order to achieve           continuity and apply similar standards
                                                                                     PAGE     8
                                                                                     S30

to all the grounds, my role in the representation of the Division

changed over a period of months as I became increasingly involved with

the reconstituted Working Party.            During this       initial    period of

involvement,    I had reviewed consultative documentation from the Home

Office on the Fire Safety and Safety at Sports Venues,                   and had read

the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds for that purpose, and for the

resolution of issues in connection with the ongoing construction of

the extension and roofing over of the Spion Hop at the Hillsborough

ground. Regarding the jfremoval of parjfs^of barrier              144,    this matter was

raised by the Police representaj^fve whi 1st carrying out the bi-annual

inspection of the ground on X ne 7th August             1986 (070886).        This

inspection was attended Jsry representatives from the Police, Fire

Authority, Administration & Legal Department of the Council,                    Building

Surveyors Division of the Department of Land and Planning of the

Council, and the C l u b ’s engineering        consultants.       Whilst    considering

the effectiveness of the recently installed radial fences on the

terracing,    it was    reported to the Working Party that fans were                 coming

out of the tunnel and stopping behind barrier                 144 rather than

travelling further       into the terrace area.         This was causing a crowd

movement problem to the Police,           particulary in pen 3, although similar

problems were occurring        in pen 4 to a slightly lesser degree.                 The

Police representative therefore suggested the removal of parts of

barrier 144.     Corroboration of the problem is contained in paragraph

46 of Dr E A S T W O O D ’S statement   (Ref A B 1 0 ) (Exh       ) to the TAYLOR

Inqui r y , which states,    "Spectators tend to congregate at the top of

the West Terrace       rather than at the bottom by the perimeter fence

because their view will not be obscured by the small mesh of the

perimeter    (fence). The request for my comments              provoked considerable

thought,    since I was aware of the normal desirability to have a

barrier in this position, yet officers who regularly manned that area
were informing the group that i t ’s presence was causing   concern for

the safety of spectators. My comments to the group were favourable to

the removal of the parts of the barrier,    since 1 considered that    it

would alleviate the problem of spectators backing up within the tunnel,

that any incoming crush would be seen on the terracing      rather than be

hidden inside the tunnel,    that any problems on the terrace    could also

be easily seen from the police control box which was relatively near,

that the means of escape from the area was excellent from both pens,

at that point,    due to the existance of the tunnel, and that it was

understood that the area of the tunnel mouth would be kept clear

throughout the duration of the game by the Police, who      in that

position could easily monitor and resolve any incidents of

overcrowding and localised crushing.     I believe that I expressed a

reservation that the removal of the barrier    could cause the next

barrier directly in front of the tunnel mouth to receive a greater

loading, and it was therefore necessary for the spectators to be

encouraged to spread into the other areas of the pens.       I am also of

the belief that    I suggested marking out the area to be kept    clear in

front of the tunnel mouth with painted hatching. The effect of the

removal   of the barrier was to be the subject of future monitoring by

the Police,   since installation of new barriers and the alteration of

others may have been required if they had thought    it necessary.     No

adverse comments were made by the Police, Fire Authority or the C l u b ’s

engineers represenative at the time    (or subsequently)   and I advised

that it was appropriate for action to be taken to remove the relevant

parts of the barrier.    It must be appreciated that it was assumed that

spectators would be entering the areas at turnstile speed only.        it

was never envisaged that an external gate would be opened to allow a

mass entry of spectators.     The recent disaster at the Bradford City

Football Club ground had the effect of considering the effects of mass
                                                                          PAGE     10
                                                                          S30

evacuation,    not mass admission of spectators.       These notes of that

inspection are produced from memory only since it was assumed that the

items raised at that       inspection were being noted and minuted by the

representative from the Administration & Legal Department of the

Council.     No personal   notes were taken at the time.

As far as I am aware,      no further discussion took place on this matter,

involving any officer from the City Counci 1.         I am also unaware of any

subsequent    correspondence seeking or granting      consent for the works

which were carried out.

At the time of the inspection,       it was not considered necessary to make

any adjustment to crowd capacity in consequence to the removal of parts

of barrier    144.    This barrier was positioned across the line of the

tunnel mouth, and as such,       the space between the barrier and the rear

of the terrace acted as a continuity of the entrance/exit           route,   for

which there should not have been an initial         capacity calculated.

Indeed the reason for the discussion on that day was the requirement of

the Police to keep that area clear of spectators.           Other barriers

appeared to have been reasonably spaced for the purposes of the “Guide"

and in retrospect the actual       barrier spacing was proven to be less than

the demensions       permitted by the "Green Guide" for that gradient of

terracing.     The height and type of the remaining barriers were not

reconsidered at this time,       since   it was assumed that such a

consideration had been part of the process of acceptance of the scheme

to carry out the recent works on the terrace.          The possibility of crowd

movement effecting barrier       124A, as a result of removing parts of

barrier    144 was never envisaged.

The implementation of the barrier        removal was arranged by the C l u b ’s

engineers.     A contractor was subsequently instructed by the engineers

to carry out the work.        I am sure that   if the Club's engineers thought

this or any other proposal       to have had a detrimental    effect on
                                                                               PAGE     11

spectator safety,   they would have made suitable               representation before

giving instructions,      on behalf of their         clients,   to any contractor.

During September    1986 <000986),        discussions took place within the

Division to review the procedure for implementing Safety of Sports

Grounds matters.    A Divisional Memorandum was produced and issued in

October   1986 (001086)    (Ref A B 11)    (Exh        ) indicating which of the

Units of the Division would take the primary co-ordinating                 role.

Where a Bui 1ding Regulation consent was necessary for the w o r k , it was

determined that the General Assessment Unit would adopt the primary

co-ordinating   role and agree     in consultation with the Site Supervision                 j

Unit and the Structural Assessment Unit              (at Principal or Assistant

Principal    level) matters of compliance with the Green Guide.               Where the

proposal would not require Building Regulation consideration,                 the Site

Supervision Unit would adopt the primary co-ordinating                 role, would

conduct any necessary liaison with external Departments and bodies, and

would agree    in consultation with the Structural Assessment Unit and the

General Assessment Unit      (At Principal         or Assistant Principal    level)

matters of compliance with the Green G u i d e .          In November    1986 (001186),

the Home Office    issued the revised version of the “Green Gu i d e . ”             This

document was distributed to the three              relevant Units of the Division.

The two versions were      compared and the apparent differences were

discussed.

There was a review of the administration system undertaken by the

Administration and Legal Department,              which in September    1987 (000987)

established a Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group to replace the
                                                                                             i

Officer Working Party.       This change was also         coincidental    to the

formalisation of an advisory input from the Department of Health and

Consumer Services of the Council,           and the simplification of the areas

of responsibility of each of the constituent Authorities of that Group,                      j

                                                                              S30

matters   relating to the struture of stadia,          including   crush barri e r s ,

w a11s etc.

The South Yorkshire Fire Authority were given the responsi bi 1i ty of

Fire   precautions,   fire alarms, means of escape,        emergency lighting,

stadium capacity.

As it's name   implied,    it has been an advisory group with the

constituent members     providing professional adv i ce for di scussion by the

group.    An example of a document giving such professional advice from

the Building Surveyors Division to the Advisory Group was               "the Report

of the Works required to be carried out to satisfy The Safety of Sports

Ground Act 1975 <000075)*,      in relation to the Sheffield Sports Stadium,

Owlerton, Sheffield,      Ref AB12    (Exh      >.   One of the effects of this

change, was that each of the Authorities were             requested to carry out

site   inspections and prepare their         individual   reports on a submitted

proposal or a required inspection.           The group have therefore       rarely met

at the stadia for the purpose of a joint             inspection since that time. At

site meetings,   various members of the Working Party/Advisory Group have

discussed matters together as they have inspected the various stadia,

and some of these matters have been discussed and resolved, although

not agenda items or minuted.         At more formal meetings agenda items have

been followed,   and therefore unlisted items of interest to the group

appear to have been missed.          In this conl^xt, I refer to crushing

incidents in 1987 <000087? and 198gK'U300Q88) which do not appear to

have been brought to the attention of the Group.

Throughout this period I W v e       been conscious of the fact that I should

act as a professional ajovisor to the Working Party/Advisory Group and

not be a decision maker.       Being employed by the same body as the

Certificating Authority,      I have been aware that any personal          decision

which was contrary to the thoughts of other members of the Group/

Working Party could have caused embarassment for the Authority and
                                                                            PAGE    13
                                                                            S30

confusion to the recipient of such a decision.           To this end,    I have

usually made informal       communication with the other external       constituent

members of the Group/Working Party and the clubs through the Licensing

Section or have advised them informally          (personal discussion or

telephone call)    of such a liaison.

It must however be appreciated that       in respect of many of the schemes I

have had two roles;       the enforcement of Building Regulation requirements

as a statutory duty; and the provision of advice to the Advisory

Group/Working Party.        In many instances the    club’s engineers have

designed the building       proposals and have acted as agent for their

clients in the implementation of the s ch em es .        In this res pe ct contact

with the engineering       consultants has professionally been unavoidable

and care has been exercised to separate those two roles as much as

possible.

The Internal Divisional Memorandum was revised in October            1988

(001088),    (Ref AB13)    (Exh      ) to take account of the Building

Surveyors    role in the Advisory Group.     The document statess-       "The role

of the Building Surveyors Division is that of "Building Authority", as

defined in the Act, and will normally be represented at the advisory

group meetings by the Principal District Surveyor or the Principal

Engineer as seems appropriate for the       case in question,     or by both.”

The latter statement was modified by an internal memorandum from the

Building Surveyor to the Administration and Legal Department,               dated

29th September,    1989 (290989)    (Ref AB14)    (Exh      ) where the last

paragraph includes:- "Except where       I attend Advisory Group in person,          I

am content that Mr BUTLER represents the Division.            Where it is

necessary,    however,    he may be substituted by another appropriate

officer,    or be accompanied by another officer,        for example, Mr

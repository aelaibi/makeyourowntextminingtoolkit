           I am a single man and I live at the above address with my parents.

           On Saturday 15th April this year            <150489),        I went to Hillsborough,
              ^    ....    _.    .
           Sheffield,  to watch Liverpool play Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup
                                        c^rT~ /
           Semi-Final.   I have been a Liverpool fan as long a s^I_^ can^r e m e m b e r .

           I travelled to            match that day with my friend                         , we went
             C A T T «2A i
           by train from             St, Liverpool     to Sheffield Central, arriving in

           Sheffield between 1.45 (1345) & 2.00pm (1400).                   At the station there

           was a line of police and they kept us at the station                       would not let
           *------------- ---------                   c a ~>
           us out, they then put us onto double decker buses:                        rried us to

           the ground,       charging us £1 return for the trip.              When we were dropped

           off at Hillsborough it was about 2.25pm (1425) and you could do what

           you wanted to, so me and                          went to the chippy.       There was a

           big queue outside the chippy but it d i d n ’t take us long to get served.
                                                                              PAGE        2
                                                                              COKCp
                                                                              Wwmm/•*/

     We sat on a wall and ate our chips and got a drink as well.            I drank

     mine sitting on the wall,     but                took his drink to the

     ground.     It was a plastic bottle of chocolate milk.      We both had

     tickets for the Leppings Ln Standing which we had bought for £6.00



ji
     from Anfield.

     We arrived at the entrance to the ground at about 2.40pm           <1440) and it

     was just a mass of people outside and we just joined them to try and

     get in. When we were    in this crowd everybody was singing and chanting

     and we joined in with them.         It was very tightly packed outside the

     ground & we were just slowly moving forward.         I saw one lad with a can

     of beer & the police told him to leave it outside so he passed the can

     back and a few others had a drink from it.

     I eventually got to the turnstile and there was. a_ policeman standing

     by the wall between the turnstiles.         It was that policeman who told

     the lad to leave his beer outside.        He took            chocolate milk

     off him without saying anything to him and threw it in the bin.             I

     went through the turnstile after _____________ and handed my ticket             in

     It was a relief to get inside out of the packed crowd on the outside.

     I d i d n ’t see any police or stewards once I had got in the ground. We
                                                         O r T TursfJ
     both went to the toilet and when we came out we walked^ dovy'f the tunnel
     wia^-r
     as that appeared to be the only way in.         I couldn’t see any other way

     in & there was nobody there to direct us or for us to ask.            I had no

     problem walking down the tunnel,        it was just when I got to the end the

     crowd was packed right up to the tunnel exit.               (_j,

     I managed to work my way through the crowd to the left and down to

     round about the centre.      I could see there was plenty of space over to

     the side,   but I d i d n ’t realise there was a fence stopping people

     moving over.     I thought   it was like the Hop at Anfield,   not as all

     one terrace.

     Once I had reached my position on the terrace I had to stay there
                                                                             PAGE       3,
                                                                             S2552

       because I couldn’t move any further.     At this time the players w e r e n ’t

       on the pitch.

       When the players came out onto the pitch,    I said to             lets make

       our way back to the wall at the back under the stand so we wouldn't

       have anybody behind us.     I saw people getting pulled up into the stand

       and I got to a position wherel was looking up to where the stand

       overhang^ by a few feet over the terraces.                   got pulled up

       into the stand, and I got pushed back down to the middle near enough

U r    Vy^1
        o/!here I had been,    so I had to make my way back up again.      I asked

M£&r   some lads to give me a lift up and I grabbed                    s hands to

       pull me up but with the sweat on my hands I lost my grip and fell back

       down, and then I got picked up again and was pulled up into the

       stand.     I then stood there right at the front of the stand and watched

       what was going on down below.     The game was still   in progress at this

       time,    but it was only a matter of seconds when I saw a policeman run

       onto the pitch and grab the referee.     At this time I saw a man being

       lifted up above the heads down below,    he must have been about where I

       had been standing in the middle.     He was about 24 to 25 years old, he
Bq
       had short fair hair and was wearing jeans and a light coloured top,

       h/s jeans had come undone and his shirt was almost off.         I could see

       his underpants,    they were like a blue check Y front type.      He only had

       one training shoe on, his face was blue and his belly had popped out

       and I assumed he was dead.     They co uldn’t get him over the fence.

       Eventually the perimeter fence was somehow pulled up and this man was

       pulled out through the hole that was made in the fence and then laid

       ori the pitch and given mouth— to—mouth by one of the fans.       Just a bit

       away from him I saw a girl lying on the pitch by the stand,        she was

       wearing a black top and black pants.     I saw a policeman walk past and

       he pulled her top up over her head,    e x posing everything.    All the fans

       shouted pull her top down,    but he took his coat off and threw it over
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              S 2S 52

          her.

          I stayed there watching everything,    it was just chaos,   everywhere   I

          looked I could see people pushing on people's chests and fans      running

          up & down with the boards.    I stayed there till the announcement over

          the loud speaker saying the game had been abandoned and then I left

          with             to go & phone home.

                                                                             SIGNED

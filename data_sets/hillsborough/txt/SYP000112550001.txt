As we     pat r o l l e d we        could see that               there were a con s i d e r a b l e                 numj>fr of-

C o m m u n i c a t i o n s U nit was        situated.

As the m o r n i n g wor e           on    I saw that a number                    of fans were         beginning               to

congregate           around        local     pubs     in part i c u l a r The Royal               Hotel        at

course       the a f o r e m e n t i o n e d The Owl             pub.       I liaised with            sergeant            in

charge       of     communications             unit..       In view of the               position of his unit

near    to the         pub an d the          number       of     persons         c o n g r egating    there          I

promised that               regular       checks w o u l d        be made         in this       vicinity            by PC

Pic k e r i n g    and myself.             By this        time The Owl was                   open and a number                 of

fans w e r e m i .11 i n g outside,               m o s t o f t h e rn h a d d r i n k s .        They were              in

good humour            at    this    time     giving        no    cause         for    concern other               than the

fact    that       the      pub was       open    in the         first      place.           I discussed            this with

the    communications               sergeant        who     told me         that       the    pub had been

designated           by the Notts,             fans as a m e e t i n g            place as they had                  parked

in the same a r e a               last year w hen the                pub had been open.                I recalled
                                                                                                          ■<*s i

that    I had been            on the       same     patrol        area      the       previous year when

c o n s iderable         numbers       had been d r i nking                at the       pub and      I noted with

dismay       that      the    numbers were            far      greater          than the       previous year.                  On

continuing my               patrol     I noticed that                the    fans      outside     the Royal              Hotel

were    b e g inning         to    increase.          In view of what                  I had seen      I contacted

match     control           and    spoke    to the        duty       sergeant.           He    i n f ormed me that

all    the    pubs       in the area          had been visi t e d and a s k e d to                    close.             Seeing

the    pubs that were               open and the number                    of    people       drinking     I realised

we were       in a no w in situation.

On    continuing my           patrol T           saw that       the    numbers      of fans        outside       the

Royal    Hotel       had     increased.               M any were      in a b o isterous mOo d a n d some

of them o b v i ou s l y had had                 plenty" to drink            by this     time.          By    this time

I' saw that’.^htfre were Police                        officers       present      on the     road opposite

the    pub.      As time' went             on    I saw     there was a steady             flow of fans along

P e n i s t o n e R o a d an d f rom N e e p s e n d Lane m a n y             of them had ob v i o u s l y been

drinking.           I noted a build up of fans                        outside The V i c t o r i a Hotel

which,was        s i t u a t e d along          the      road from The Owl:             public      house. To the

best of my          r e c o l l e c t i o n most        of the     people in the area were                    connected

w i t h the Notts.           Fo r e s t    team.

Just    before 2prn that              day we were           called      to    The V i c t o r i a Hotel         and on

arrival       saw special           constables           in attendance.            At this        time       I saw a

number       of Fo r e s t    fans        stood outside          trie pub.         They were        in high

spirits       and were        s h o uting and wav i n g            at the stream          of Forest            fans who

were    passing        by    in cars.             I went    into      the    pub w h i c h was      packed with

football        s u p p o r t e r s who were           in a b o i s t e r o u s mood and o b v i o u s l y many

had had       plenty to drink.                    I spoke     to the        licensee and          informed him to

control       the    people       drinking            outside    otherwise         he w o u l d    be    closed down.

At    this    time PC P i c k e r i n g          was also       in attendance.            It was at this

same    time     that       I was    called awa y from The V i c t o r i a                to give a s s i s t a n c e

at The Royal           Hotel.        On arrival            I saw      other    police     officers            and dog

handlers       in a t t e n d a n c e ,        ie PC 367 S S e d n o u s e ■- PC       1477 Day and their

r espective         partners.             On my arrival         I saw that a           crowd of fans were

these were worse              for    drink.            I noted     that      the frontage          of the       pub was

strewn w i t h       beer     cans and broken bottles                       and glasses.          These        littered

the    pub frontage           over        the    f o o t p a t h onto B r a d f i e l d Road.           The    place

was a d a ngerous mess.                    I     went into      the    pub which had just about

cleared.         I was       informed             that there had been trouble               and     that       they

visit.         I then       left Hr.       Pric e ' s    locat i o n w h i c h     by this        time had

ne a r l y   cleared and          returned to The Victoria.                       On my arrival              I saj*?

that     things       had e a s e d s l i g h t l y s ince my          last visit.            T here wire

people       still     on the      pavement        drinking         and    the    pub ,was still             full.         I

saw that PC Flickering and a number                            of special         constables          were     in

attend a n c e .       I considered             that    there was         no   immediate        cause        for

concern at the              pub so       I c o ntinued my         patrol,         On. my way       past the

communications              vehi c l e    I saw that          there was        still a large            number       of

fans     outside w i t h         drinks.         I could see          that     they were        boist e r o u s      and

man y    had o b v i o u s l y    had     plenty to drink.

I returned           to the N e e p s e n d area s o m etime              after 2 . 3 0 pm.        As    I

t r a v e l l e d along      P e n i s t o n e ' R o a d towards H i l l f o o t Bridge           I saw a          large

number       of fans        s t r e a m i n g along P e n i s t o n e Road towards              the     ground.

They were        in a b o i s t e r o u s       mood    but    there was         no specific          trouble.             It

was     obvious       that m a n y of them had been drinking.                           On my arrival               into

N e e p s e n d Lane     I saw     that      the Owl      pub had just            closed.         I was       informed

that     there       had been some           trouble and          they     stopped serving.                  1 went

into     the    premises         and     found    it nearly         empty.        By this       time as        the

a rea had began             to   clear and        I considered            commencing         security         patrol

of N e e p s e n d    car    parks..       As    kick    off     time a p p r o a c h e d    I could hear            over

my    personal        radio      that     there was a build               up of Liverpool             fans     in the

Leppi rigs Lane a r e a           near     to the turnstiles.                  I could hear           that

officers       there were          experiencing           d if f i c u l t y   controlling         the       crowd.            I

could hear           requests      being made           for more       police      officers.            As    the

m e s sages     i n c reased      I could hear           crowd noises            in the b a c k g r o u n d and

they     sounded hostile.                 I heard S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M a r s h a l a s k        for a gate

to be opened           because         pressure        of..the    crowd was        b e c o m i n g so    intense

that     he feared there was                 going      to be serious            injuries.         I could hear

                     the fans           were                 trying             to    climb over               the walls               to get          in.      I again

dead and       injured        people, . By this              time     I saw that many of the                  people

being     carried       into      the    gym were        dead.        My    intention now was               to return

to the       pitch to ass i s t          in further           recovery of         the     ipjtired.        But at,

While-I        was at *my         point        I received a general                    call    for a s s i s t a n c e

be taking           place.        On my arrival             all     was     quiet.

comment        on    is what          1 heard       over    the      radio.           It was    obvious           that    the

large        number       of fans who            had a r r i v e d at       the       t u rnstiles at Leppi n g s

Lane     had put          the    officers         there     under      extreme          pressure and              listening

to the        frantic       transmission              from S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     Marshall             to open the

killed unless              som e t h i n g     positive was           done.

his     i d e ntity and          can only describe                  him as    being        of m e d i u m        height,

slim build,              short    dark        hair,    wearing        light       coloured        shirt and          dark

Notes For        Mike Hall requests copies of notes of meetings
Minister:
                 and other evidence from James Wardrope, the
                 Accident and Emergency Consultant at Sheffield,
                 to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Hillsborough
                 Scrutiny. Mr Wardrope was not seen in person by
                 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, but he did supply
                 copies of patient notes from the day of the
                 disaster. A copy of a letter from Mr Wardrope was
                 also among the evidence copied to the House
                 Library following the report of the Scrutiny. I
                 suggest that we copy this to Mike Hall, explaining
                 the position.

                 Unfortunately, this case has been delayed by staff
                 vacancies and pressure of other work.

 WERE HAVING TO RUN THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE GROUND WITH THE INJURED PEOPLE ON

 BILL BOARDS.

YES, CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE ON                  • PART OF ANY OFFICER IN CHARGE OF THE POLICE

 PART OF THE OFFICIALS AND ALSO THROUGH LACK OF COMMUNICATION TO THE FANS.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 YES SEVERAL THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO ITEMISE THEM AS FOLLOWS.

 1.    I FELT ON MY ARRIVAL AT THE GROUND THAT THE SEARCHING OF LIVERPOOL FANS

 PRIOR TO THEIR ENTRY           WAS UNNECESSARY.    FULL BODY SEARCHES WERE BEING MADE

 PRIOR TO THE TURNSTILES AND AFTER THIS IN MY OPINION WOULD CAUSE AN

 UNNECESSARY DELAY TO FANS ENTERI^K^.

 2.    ON PASSING THROUGH THE TURNSTILE^N[HERE J^ERE NO SIGNS TO INDICATE THAT

 THERE WAS ANY ACCESS TO THE TERRACE O T H E ^ s ^ N THE TUNNEL,        I ONLY FOUND THE

 O ^ E ^ E N T R Y BY CHANCE.

 3.    ON ENTRY THROUGH         THE TURNSTILE AT   POINTS A TO G THERE IS A GATE ON    THE

 LEFT HAND SIDE WHICH           I HAVE MARKED ON THE MAP.    THIS GATE WAS OPEN.   I FELT

 THAT THIS ALLOWED FANS TO WANDER ABOUT AT WILL IN AREAS OF THE WEST STAND

 AND TERRACE, AGAIN LACK OF DIRECTION.

 4.    AS EARLY AS / OURTY MINUTES PRIOR TO THE StSftRT OF THE GAME I COULS SEE

 THAT THERE WAS BAD OVERCROWDING IN THE AREAS OF FENS THREE AND F O U R .             THIS

 WOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO THE POLICE CONTROL POINT AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 DEALT WITH AT AN EARLY STAGE AND THE TUNNEL CLOSED.

       WHEN IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT A SERIOUS INCIDENT WAS OCCURRING ON THE WEST

 TERRACE AND POLICE, STEWARDS, ST. JOHNS ETC WERE IN ATTENDANCE IT APPEARED

 TO ME THAT THERE WAS A LACK OK^SUPPORT BY OTHER TRAINED PERSONNEL.                I COULD

 SEE THAT THERE WERE MANY OTHER T R A C E D PERSONNEL WHO DID NOT GO TO THE AREA

 TO ASSIST.

 6.    WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED THERE WAS i^KQOt^MUN IC AT ION WITH THE FANS

 WHATSOEVER■     I FEEL THAT IF AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE IT WOULD HAVE EASED THE

 PROBLEMS GREATLY.       I WITNESSED THE INCIDENT BUT DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD TAKEN

 PLACE UNTIL I GOT BACK TO MY VEHICLE AND HEARD ON THE RADIO.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I WAS AT THE BACK OF THE TERRACES.    I SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FRONT

 FENCING.     POLICEMEN WERE TELLING US AT THE BACK TO HOVE BACKWARDS BUT WE

 COULDN’T THERE WAS NOWHERE TO GO.     POLICE THEN APPEARED FROM THE TUNNEL AND

 THEY WERE PULLING PEOPLE BACK OUT THROUGH THE TUNNEL.

 <354

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 PERIMETER FENCING NEEDS TO BE THERE BUT IT NEEDS TO BE RE-DESIGNED SO

 T^pT IT IS SAFER.     THE FENCES WITHIN THE PENS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REMOVED THEN

 PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE TO THE SIDES ONCE THE SURGE OF PEOPLE


<319

 CAME.   THEY NEED MORE VIDEO CAMERAS THEN THE PROBLEM WOULD HAVE BEEN

 REALISED QUICKER.     A LOT OF SUPPORTERS ATTEND BIG MATCHES LIKE HILLSBOROUGH

 WITHOUT HAVING TICKETS TRYING TO GET IN. I FEEL BIG MATCHES SHOULD BE

 TELEVISED LIVE SO THEN SUPPORTERS WITHOUT TICKETS WOULD NOT TRAVEL TO

 THE MATCH.

                         I WENT S^AINT BECAUSE I RECOGNISED A FRIEND NAME

                      PEN 6*!

I WAS STANDING AT THE FR&^jT OF PEN 6 , LOOKING THROUGH THE FENCE ONTO THE

PITCH WHEN I SAW A MAN LYINGvON THE GROUND TO THE LEFT OF THE GOAL .                     I SAW

APPROX 2 FANS TRYING TO BRING RIM RpUND.               ONE WAS GIVING HIM HEART MASSAGE,

THEY TRIED THE KISS OF LIFE AS WEkL,’

I DESCRIBE THIS MAN AS WHITE, MEDIUM              BUILD, APPROX 30 YRS O L D .    WEARING

MOUSEY HAIR.     HE SEEMED TO BE WEARING THE OFFICIAL LIVERPOOL TRACKSUIT TOP,

RED AND GREY WITH BLUE DENIM JEANS.               HE WAS CLEAN SHAVEN AND VERY PALE, HE

D I D N ’T REVIVE AND THEY COVERED HIS HEAD UP BEFORE CARRYING HIM               AWAY.    I

RSUEMBER THIS MAN WAS WEARING A WEDDING RING.

<349

 THERE WAS A LONG DELAY GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THE PEN.     THERE WERE TOO

 MANY PEOPLE IN THE PENS.    THE EMERGENCY SHOULD HAVE REACTED QUICKER.

 THE FENCES TO THE PITCH AND AROUND THE PENS OBSTRUCTED THE FANS ESCAPE.

 Q50

 4.40 PM.


Q 1S

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 YES., I THINK THE EMERGENCY SERVICES COULD HAVE REACTED QUICKER.    ST JOHNS

 WERE G O O D »

       I
       POLICE WERE SLOW TO REACT, THEY DID N ’T OPEN THE GATES ON TIME AND THEY

 D I D N ’T AT FIRST WANT TO RIP THE FENCES DOWN.


Q 19

 Q34

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE FA ALLOCATED THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACE TO

 LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS AND THE SPION KOP TO FOREST SUPPORTERS AS LIVERPOOL’S

 HOME ATTENDANCE IS DOUBLE FOREST’S ATTENDANCE.     THE TICKET ALLOCATION IN

 PROPORTION TO THESE FACTS WAS TOTALLY UNFAIR.
                                                                               PAGE    9
                                                                               GSL2393

 IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME ANY SUPPQR T'ERS HAVE ATTENDED   THE MA1CH AF 1ER

 DRINKING.

 GENERALLY THE POLICING IN AND OUT OF THE GROUND WAS INSUFFICIENT.       THE

 OFFICERS IN MY OPINION WERE NOT CORRECTLY DEPLOYED.

 WHY WAS A CORDON OF POLICE ACROSS THE HALFWAY LINE, AS IT HINDERED THE

 AMBULANCES?

 I ’D LIKE TO PASS COMMENT THAT THE SHEFFIELD PEOPLE WERE KIND AND CO-OPERATIVE

 WITH THEIR HELP.

 BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH OF PEOPLE.     IT TOOK TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GET

 HER TO A TURNSTILE, THEN THE FORCE OF THE CROWD PUSHED ME TO ONE SIDE

 GET MY ARMS IN FRONT O F H E TO PUSH AND FORCE MYSELF AWAY SLIGHTLY,

  ICKETS ON THE APPROACH TO THE GROUND, WHICH ALLOWED A CROWD BUILD UP

THE POLICE SEEMED            I    SQiv|E      ASSISTING, RENDERING FIRST AID.

A LOT THOUGH WERE STObfl AROUND, TALKING.     DOING NOTHING, THEY SHOULD HAVE

BEEN HELPING.

 I THINK THE AMBULANCES SHOULD HAVE COME ON THE PITCH TO THE INJURED,

 INSTEAD OF SUPPORTERS HAVING TO CARRY DEAD AND INJURED ON MAKESHIFT

STRETCHERS, OUTSIDE.

THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE INFORMATION GIVEN OUT OVER THE TANNOY SYSTEM.

NOBODY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

Q53B

CAN YOU COMPARE THE POLICING O^fi^ATION?      ^                  f

LAST YEAR WAS FAR BETTER, YOU MERE CHECKED FOR TICKETS BEFORE GETTING

NEAR THE TURNSTILES.     THERE SEEMED TO BE MORE POLICE THIS YEAR, BUT

ALL AWAY FROM THE GROUND.     ALSO LAST YEAR THERE WERE TURNSTILE QUEUES

AND I HAD NO PROBLEM GETTING IN.        ALTHOUGH I REMEMBER LAST YEAR IT WAS

VERY PACKED ON THE TERRACES.

< •
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THIS KIND OF MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELD AT A GROUND WITH GREATER

 CAPACITY.   THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS TOO SMALL FOR A CLUB LIKE LIVERPOOL.

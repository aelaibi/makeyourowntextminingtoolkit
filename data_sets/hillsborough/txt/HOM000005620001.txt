HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE:   INQUIRY INTO THE POLICING OF FOOTBALL
HOOLIGANISM

I attach a copy of a Press Notice received this morning from
the Home Affairs Committee which advises that the Committee's
report on the policing of football hooliganism will be
published at 12.00 noon on Tuesday 5 February.

2.   We shall be able to obtain a limited number of advance
copies at 12.00 noon on Monday 4 February. On the publication
of Home Affairs Committee reports the Home Office routinely
issues a Press Notice welcoming the report and in the case of
a substantial or high profile report, the Home Secretary
usually writes to the Chairman of the Committee
(Sir John Wheeler) setting out his initial reactions. The
formal Government Reply should follow within two months of the
publication of the Committee's report.

3.   I should be grateful if you would set in hand the
preparation of a draft Press Notice, and if appropriate, a
draft letter for the Home Secretary's signature. These should
reach Mr Pugh by 5.00 pm on Monday 4 February under cover of a
short explanatory submission (copied to me, please).

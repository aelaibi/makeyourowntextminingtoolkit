               T-oTd Justine Tavlor1s Final Report
In your letter of 10th April, 1990, you sought to arrange a
meeting between representatives of the Home Office and Lord
Ferrers with me as a representative of the ACPO, to consider the
progress by the Police Service in the implementation of the
recommendations contained in Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report.

I am pleased to accede to such a request. To assist you in your
preparations, as you suggested, I have had a written account
prepared of the ACPO response to the Final Report, which
accompanies   this  letter.   By   necessity,  the   account  is
comprehensive, reflecting the depth and quality of consideration
given by the Police Service to the Report's content.

The ACPO response to the proposed offences and penalties,
contained in Recommendations 70-73, has been addressed by the
Sub-Committee.   That response has been routed via the ACPO
General Purposes Committee.

The date of the proposed meeting can be arranged with my Staff
Officer, Superintendent Peter Madeley.

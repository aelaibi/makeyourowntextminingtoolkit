Dear

Hillsborough - Further update

Further to my earlier letter, on Monday the Judge dismissed the charge of misconduct in
public office. In essence this was about neglecting to ensure the safety of supporters by
preventing fans entering the tunnel to the terraces.

As the third charge of conspiracy to prevent the course of justice has already been
dropped at the start of the trial, this means that the jury will now be asked to give a verdict
on the single charge of manslaughter.

We are not clear whether the judges ruling will shorten the trial, or what it means for
potential recovery of costs from central funds. I will keep you in touch.

Yours sincerely




Bill Wilkinson
Clerk and Treasurer

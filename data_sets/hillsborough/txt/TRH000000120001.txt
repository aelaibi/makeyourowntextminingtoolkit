HELD ON 15 FEBRUARY 1990

The Authority received and noted the letter dated 14 March 1990
from Sir Michael Carlisle to Mr R B Robinson, Chairman of North
Derbyshire Health Authority (TA(90)80).

The Regional General Manager reported that the Review had been a
good one, but considerable concern had been expressed about the
projected significant financial overspend in North Derbyshire
during 1989/90. The DHA had been urged to take firm and
decisive action to deal with the matter. The following
paragraphs of the Review Letter were drawn to the attention of
members.

Paragraph 8      - Capital Developments (Clay Cross)
Paragraphs 9-11   - Acute Services (Waiting Lists)
Paragraphs 16-17  - White Paper Implementation

During discussion of the Review Letter the question ofWaiting
Lists was raised  and the Authority was informed that the review
meeting with North Derbyshire HA had been carried out using
September 1989 Waiting List information. Since the Review,
information for the December Quarter 1989 had become available,
and a significant drop in the number of patients waiting over
two years for treatment had been reported during the period.
RHA/NOTTINGHAM HEALTH AUTHORITY: ANNUAL REVIEW MEETING HELD ON .
1 FEBRUARY 1990
The Authority received and noted the letter dated 14 March 1990
from Sir Michael Carlisle to Mr D H White, Chairman of the
Nottingham Health Authority (TA(90)81).

The Regional General Manager reported on a number of issues
considered during the Review Meeting. There had been extended
discussion on the DHA's Estate Strategy. The RHA's support for
the broad thrust of the strategy had been confirmed, but the- RHA
had emphasised that the pace of change and priorities would have
to be altered in order to accommodate increased costs on some
elements - many of which were not under the control of the DHA -
 and the need to inject urgent new investment into the City
Hospital so as to replace the existing Maternity Unit.

The key issue of the meeting had been the difference of view
between the RHA and Nottingham of the service priorities
indicated in the key elements of the strategy.  Both had agreed
that the maternity investment must proceed as soon as
practicable and so the choices in terms of timing, lay between
the Renal Radiotherapy scheme which had already started, and the
proposed District Psychiatric Centre. At the end of the
discussion officers had confirmed the Regional Health
Authority's decision that the Renal Radiotherapy Scheme would
proceed as planned, and the timing of the District Psychiatric
Centre would be reviewed. Nottingham DHA representatives had
indicated a disagreement with this decision and it had been
suggested that General Managers should meet at an early date to
work through the practical implications of the decision.

It was also reported that discussion had taken place during the
Review on the replacement of the Maternity Unit at the City
Hospital. A number of possible solutions had been considered
and it had been agreed that DHA officers should establish a
comprehensive service brief. A further report would be brought
to a future meeting of the Authority.

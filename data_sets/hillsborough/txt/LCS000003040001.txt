 Dear Rory,.

   ••          •        ■' Hillsborough Tragedy .                             ^

   ■ ■ Following our brief discussion lost week I am attaching a copy of the final
■ report presented to l^sadersof the nine local Authorities last Saturday. The report,
  m yo*i know, addresses the specific issues suiToundirtg a Regional Unit. The report
  was agreed in principle and officers are tusked to pursue enquiries regarding finance.

      There have been approaches made to Government via M.T.F. and we are trying, in
 spite of Belgian Bank Holidays, to contact the E.E.C,   As well as these traditional
 sources we ere also looking at private enterprise, voluntary effort® mid the. football
 organisations.

     the co-ordinating services end the direct work with victim and their families
is probably the largest preventive mental health prograame ever launched. If services
mm not developed to meet the needs of people affected by Hillsborough the future
demands on both Health and Social Services could be enorraous.

     X m sure you are thinking, within Mersey Region, of the development of
requirements within Health, but could I also ask you to consider the availability
W resources for both the Regional felt and direct service provision with local
authorities.   The first attempt at costing the local direct services reveals
expenditure requirement of over a million per annum.

     There are never enough resources for chit joint and collaborative work, all
of u* seeing the need for services to develop m needs change.          This disaster is
      final to that and has in the short term required us to re-organise our
priorities.      This cannot be sustained without additional resources and as well as
the approach to Central (kwernment I would ask that Mersey Region consider on-going,
financial s u p p o r t for these initiatives - both the Regional Obit and the direct
local eerv-p&s. as it is unlikely that any one source of finance will cover the
total esqpe^ture*                '

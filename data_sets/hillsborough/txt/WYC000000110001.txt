                                        JUDGMENT


                               -2l~
Anthony Bland became 21 on the 21st September of this year but

for the past three and a half years he has been totally unaware

of    the   world around        him.      As   a keen    supporter of   Liverpool

Football Club he was at the Hillsborough football ground on the
                                         ^ f-Sv'V
15th April 1989.         He was then 171A.          He was one of the victims of

the disaster.        He suffered a severe crushed chest injury which

gave    rise   to    hypoxic      brain       damage.    His   condition   rapidly

deteriorated and despite the intensive and heroic efforts of the

doctors      and nurses    he has       remained ever      since    in a state of

complete unawareness.            This is known to the medical profession

as a ’Persistent Vegetative State (PVS).                 Although his brain stem

is intact he suffered irreparable damage to the cortex.                    All the

higher functions of Anthony Bland’s brain have been destroyed.

There is no hope whatsoever of recovery or improvement of any

kind.       That is the unanimous opinion of all the distinguished

doctors who have examined Anthony Bland.



Since the 12th May 1989 he has been under the care of Dr J.G.Howe

FRCP, a Consultant Geriatrician at the Airedale General Hospital.

Dr.Kowe has very considerable experience of patients suffering

from what is described as the Persistent Vegetative State.                    After

his    transfer     to   the    Airedale       General   Hospital   prolonged   and

persistent     attempts        were    made    to   revive Anthony   Bland.     The

skilled hospital staff including senior physiotherapists assisted
by     the    parents      and    sister       of    Anthony      Bland    made    exhaustive

attempts          to   achieve    some    sign       of   revival.        Although      Anthony

Bland’s body breathes and reacts in a reflex manner to painful

stimuli it is quite clear that there is no awareness on his part

of"anything that is taking place around him.                              EEG and CT scans

reveal no evidence of cortical activity.                             Indeed      recent scans

which have been photographed and produced to the Court show that

there        is   more    space   than     substance         in   the     relevant     part    of

Anthony Bland’s brain.             There is simply no possibility whatsoever

that he has any appreciation of anything that takes place around

him.     He is fed artificially and mechanically by a naso gastric

tube which has been inserted through his nose and down into his

stomach.          All the natural bodily functions have to be operated

with nursing intervention.                     He is fitted with a catheter which

has given rise to infection necessitating surgical intervention.

It is to be noted that the necessary surgical incision was made

without any anaesthetic because Anthony Bland is utterly devoid

of feeling of any kind.                He requires four to five hours nursing

attention by two nurses every day.                        No complaint is made by the

hospital          authorities     of     the    fact      that    they    have    to   allocate

substantial resources to this particular case - that is not a

factor which has             been prayed            in aid of      the course which           the

Plaintiffs now seek to be allowed to                         follow.        By August      1989

supported by             the opinion of Dr.Michael                Johnson,       a Consultant

Neurologist of St.James’ University Hospital Leeds, Dr. Howe had

reached the clear conclusion that there was absolutely no hope

of any improvement. He felt that it would be appropriate to cease

further treatment.            This would involve withdrawing the artificial
feeding through the naso gastric tube and declining antibiotic

treatment if and when infection appeared.                          If this course were

to     be   adopted    then   within       some    10    to   14    days    the   lack    of

sustenance would bring to an end the physical functioning of the

body of Anthony Bland and he would in terms ’die*.                            The process

would be      that of    ’starvation*.            This would be unpleasant               for

those who had to observe it but Anthony Bland himself would be

totally unaware of what was taking place.



In August 1989 Dr.Howe got into touch with the Sheffield Coroner

who was responsible for dealing with the fatal cases arising from

the Hillsborough disaster.                The Coroner, who is both medically

and legally qualified,          alerted Dr. Howe to the risks which he

considered      he    might   run    if    he     took   the       proposed    course     of

withdrawing treatment.          The Coroner pointed out that as the law

stood it was his understanding that Dr. Howe would run the risk

of criminal proceedings if he took a course which brought to an

end the existence of Anthony Bland, even though that existence

could be regarded as being wholly pointless.                         He suggested that

Dr. Howe should consult his legal advisers.                        Heeding the warning

of the Coroner Dr. Howe did indeed consult legal advisers and as

a result the Airedale National Health Service Trust, which is

responsible      for    administering        the Airedale           General    Hospital,

issued the Originating Summons which is now before                            the Court.

This    seeks   declarations        that    the Trust and           their     responsible

physicians may lawfully discontinue all life sustaining treatment

and medical support measures designed to keep Anthony Bland alive

in   his     existing    persistent         vegetative         state    including        the
termination of ventilation nutrition and hydration by artificial

means and that they may lawfully discontinue and thereafter need

not furnish medical treatment to Anthony Bland except for the

sole purpose of enabling Anthony Bland to end his life and die

peacefully        with   the      greatest     dignity     and     the       least    of    pain

suffering and distress.              The Plaintiffs action is fully supported

by the parents and             family of Anthony Bland.                  Because Anthony

Bland himself is wholly incapable of taking any step with regard

to this matter the Official Solicitor of the Supreme Court has

been    appointed        to    act    as    his     Guardian      ad    litem.         He     has

instructed Counsel            to appear       on the hearing            of   this     Summons.

Whilst      not     disputing        the   completely      insensate          condition        of

Anthony Bland, he opposes the Plaintiffs’ application contending

that   if     the    action       proposed     by    Dr.   Howe    and       the     Plaint

Hospital Authority were                to be      implemented      it    would       in    terms

amount in law to the crime                  of murder.        Because of the public

importance of this case the Court invited the assistance of the

Attorney      General       and   he has      instructed       Counsel        to appear        as

’amicus curiae’.



This   case       clearly     raises       serious moral,        medical       and     ethical

issues.     However, none of the facts relating to the circumstances

and the condition of Anthony Bland are in dispute.                            The Court has

been assisted by expert medical evidence from witnesses of the

highest calibre and of the very greatest experience.                                 All agree

that Anthony Bland is now and has been ever since the date of the

Hillsborough disaster in what is known to the medical profession

now    as   a     Persistent         Vegetative      State.            The    condition        is
irreversible and is not susceptible of any improvement.                     He is

completely insensate and no medical procedure or treatment can

bring about any beneficial          change     in his      condition.     All   the

witnesses have stated that the standard of care which has been

afforded to Anthony Bland at The Airedale General Hospital is of

the highest character.        His parents have visited him daily and

his sister has also been present frequently.                 The anguish which

they continue    to experience        is self evident.            His father has

given oral evidence before me and I also have a statement from

Anthony Bland *s mother.      The father is a splendid straightforward

Yorkshireman.     He    has   faced    the    terrible      tragedy     which   has

befallen his family with remarkable realism and dignity.                   He has

not allowed emotion to influence his judgment.                   He traced for me

Anthony’s brief life - explaining how he was a thoroughly normal

boy.   He described him as not a very clever boy but with a good

personality - sensitive and willing.                His     great   interest was

football and Liverpool his chosen team.                 He said that he was not

religious but that he had attended Sunday School in the Church

of England.     His    assessment     of Anthony Bland’s situation was

expressed in these clear terms:            ’’He certainly wouldn’t want to

be left like he is.      I would feel that he should be removed and

the family feel the same.          I was angry when the advice from the

Coroner   was   received.      I    can      see   no    point    whatsoever     in

continuing treatment.’’       Of    course Anthony Bland            is unable    to

express views of his own and there had been no occasion for him

to express any view as to how he might view his situation if some

terrible tragedy such as this befell him.

This case raises for the first time in the English Courts                               the

question in what circumstances,                 if any,     can a doctor lawfully

discontinue life sustaining treatment (including nutrition and

hydration) without which a patient in Anthony Bland’s condition

will die?    Professor Bryan Jennett CBE until recently Foundation

Professor    of    Neuro    Surgery       at   the    Institute     of    Neurological

Science in the University of Glasgow and having the very widest

experience    as    a   neuro     surgeon was         responsible        together    with

Professor    Plum of       New York       for coining        the   term    *Persistentj

Vegetative State* in 1972.            It is intended to describe a syndrome

that was being increasingly encountered as the life saving and

life sustaining technologies of intensive care were securing the

survival of some patients with brain damage of a severity that

would previously have proved fatal.                   Professor Jennett told the

Court that until this descriptive term was proposed,                            and soonj

widely adopted, such patients were often referred to as being inf

a prolonged or irreversible coma.                    However the word 'coma1, he              f
said, implies a continuing sleeplike state due to depression of

the brain stem activating systems - whilst the hallmark of the f

vegetative     patient      is    that     after      a    variable      time   in   coma f

wakefulness       returns,! with         long    periods      of   spontaneous          eyef

functioning.          The key          to     the diagnosis        is    that,     on    clinical

with severe depression of cortical activity obvious                                     only in a

minority     of    cases.             Professor       Jennett      referred       to    the     very

considerable research which has taken place internationally and

 the consideration of the problem by the Medical Ethics Committee

of the British Medical Association.                         He concluded from all the

 research material that only exceptional cases have been reported

 as showing       recovery after a year,                   and none      of those patients

 appear to have achieved independence.                          He gave it as his opinion


                                                  7
that naso gastric feeding i§ a form of 'medical treatment*I just

as   is   a     ventilator        or   a kidney            machine.       It      is    a means        of

substituting a function that has naturally failed.                                     He said that

tube feeding is accepted as                      'medical treatment'               in the United

States of America and in Canada.                            He referred to the Appleton

International            Conference     which             accepted    that     life      sustaining

hydration          and     nutrition        is    a       medical     treatment          which        may

justifiably be withdrawn from persistently vegetative patients

for whom there are no patient based reasons                                for continuing to

treat.     He expressed the opinion that it has become accepted good

practice in this country as elsewhere to agree in consultation

with      the      families       of   the       vegetative          patients          to    withhold

antibiotics and cardio pulmonary resuscitation in the event of

complications that would call for such measures in patients with

a prospect of recovery.                He expressed the very strong view that

it would.be in accordance with good medical practice in the case

of Anthony Bland to withdraw the naso gastric artificial feeding.

He     stated       that     he    considered              there     to   be      no    benefit        in

maintaining life sustaining treatment                              because he could see no

prospect of recovery of cognitive function.                                He like the other

expert medical witnesses who gave evidence before me had examined

Anthony Bland.             He stated that in his view this was an extreme

and clear case of the Persistent Vegetative State.                                     He could see

no benefit to the patient in continuing the treatment of feeding

by means        of a naso         gastric        tube.        Dr.    Cartlidge         FRCP      is   the

Consultant         Neurologist         to    the Newcastle Health                  Authority and

senior lecturer in neurology at the University of Newcastle upon

Tyne.         He   has     very   considerable              experience       of    the      so   called


                                                      8
Persistent Vegetative State.                He too examined Anthony Bland and

expressed the firm opinion that he was showing all the signs of

this    extreme      condition.        He       said    there       is   no     possibility

whatsoever that he will recover.                  He too expressed the opinion

that it would be medically justifiable to withdraw the artificial

feeding process for there was no useful purpose in continuing it

and    it   was    not    in   the   patient's         best    interests        to   prolong

survival in these circumstances.                  Professor Peter 0. Behan FRCP

of the Department of Neurology at the Institute of Neurological

Sciences      at    the    Southern     General         Hospital         of    Glasgow   was

instructed by the Official Solicitor to examine Anthony Bland.

The Court has the advantage of a report prepared by Professor

Behan which has           been accepted      in evidence.            He was unable        to

attend Court to give oral evidence.                         In his   report he said:

"What is the diagnosis?              This can be confidently answered that

on the basis of history, physical and neurological examination

supplemented by laboratory data, this is a classical example of

the Persistent Vegetative State."                  He went on to say:                 "I am

confident     that       from my     knowledge         of   other    patients,       neuro­

physiology, previous cases from the literature and from animal

experimentation that           the patient has no awareness                     nor can he

suffer pain or experience pleasure.                         Further the prospect of

improvement can also confidently be answered since based on what

we know of the degree of damage to his brain, the comparison of

his    case with those         recorded in the literature                     (particularly

considering the nature of his                damage and the duration of his

illness) and the type of systems and signs he exhibits, there is

no hint or hope or any prospect of improvement."                              Next he said:


                                            9
"In my opinion artificial               feeding and hydration,         constitutes

'medical treatment'.          If a patient were to be admitted under my

care and was for one reason or another unable to feed himself,

the setting up of a naso gastric tube for feeding and hydration

would constitute beyond any measure of doubt 'medical treatment'

as opposed to normal feeding."                 He further stated that he was:

 "Very impressed by the recommendation of the British Medical

Association that is to say in respect of the consultation and

treatment of patients in the persistent vegetative state.                           In

particular the recommendation that where the diagnosis had been

well established and the differential diagnoses had been ruled

out     and    all   the   necessary      laboratory        tests   done    then   the

prognosis could confidently be given as zero if after one year

there was no sign of improvement."



Dr.   Keith      Andrews    FRCP   is    the     Director    of   Medical   Research

Services at the Royal Hospital and Home Putney.                     At his hospital

there is a twenty bedded brain injury rehabilitation unit.                         Dr.

Andrews has had experience of about 50 patients in a persistent

vegetative state.          He examined Anthony Bland.             He told the Court

"I regard him as being in a persistent vegetative state."                           He

said:         "He is the most      severe      case I have seen and         I do   not

consider Tony Bland will make any recovery whatsoever.                         If the

regime continues as          at present he is          likely to survive a few

years, not more than five,              because he is prone to infections."

He expressed the view that feeding by tube was not in his view

medical treatment if In amplification he said:                      "The use of the

equipment might be thought to be medical treatment but not the


                                            10
supply of food which is a basic human requirement."                 He said hef

wduld not favour the withdrawal of treatment because tie would^

find the means of death worrying.           It would be distressing         to

watch although Anthony Bland himself would not experience                  any

sensation.     He agreed      that   sedative   drugs    could be given     to

lessen the unpleasant features which he felt would                  inevitably

follow from the withdrawal of the artificial feeding.



The Plaintiffs' submissions have been put clearly and succinctly

by Mr. Francis QC both in a written skeleton argument and also

in oral submissions.       He submits that it is the unanimous opinion

of all the expert medical witnesses that Anthony Bland is in a

severe Persistent Vegetative State.             There is no hope of        any

improvement.       His parents with knowledge of their son say that

he   would   not    wish   his   present   condition      to   be   continued.

Although Anthony Bland himself cannot express any view it should

be inferred in the light of the medical evidence as well as of

the evidence of his own father and mother that the prolongation

of the present treatment is not in his best                interests .f   Good

medical practice,      accepted by a large and          responsible body of

medical opinion suggests that the course proposed by Dr.Howe, and

supported by Professor Jennett and by Dr.               Cartlidge should be

followed.    Mr.    Francis referred to a passage in the speech of

Lord Bridge    in    the   leading   case of    In Re F    (Mental Patient:

Sterilisation) reported in f19901 2 Appeal Cases at page 1 .                At

page 52 of the report Lord Bridge said:             "Moreover it seens tof

It would be intolerable for members of the medical nursing and

other professions devoted to the care of the sick that, in caring

for those       lacking the capacity to consent                 to     treatment       they

should    be    put    in    the dilemma       that,     if     they administer          the

treatment       which       they believe       to   be    in     the patient's         best

interests,      acting with due skill and care,                 they run the risk of

being held guilty of trespass to the person, but if they withhold

that treatment, they may be in breach of a duty of care owed to

the patient.         If those who undertake responsibility for the care

of incompetent or unconscious patients                    administer curative or

prophylactic treatment which they believe to be appropriate to

the patient's existing condition of disease,                          injury or bodily

malfunction or susceptibility to such a condition in the future,

the     lawfulness      of    that   treatment         should    be     judged    by     ona

similar situation to that of the mental patient in the case of

Re F.     There is no curative or therapeutic treatment which can

be applied to Anthony Bland.               However, Mr.Francis submits,                  the

same basic principles should be followed because what is proposed

by Dr.Howe      is effectively medical              treatment and           it is in     the

patient's      best     interests.          He      subntits     that       it   would    bef

In his detailed and erudite submission Mr.Munby                       Q.C. on behalf
                                                                    • •••■• •» ' '
of the Official Solicitor cha 11 enged the view that th< :artificial'

sought support for that submission from the evidence of Dr. Keith

Andrew.       However   his     principal   submission        was          that         what   is

proposed by Dr.Howe is the doing of an act intended to lead to

the   death    of    Anthony    Bland.      In    the   result       he              argued    the

withdrawal of the feeding regime would amount to unlawful killing

and would in fact be the crime of murder.                     He referred to the

summing   up   of Mr.Justice Devlin,             in   the   case of The Queen v

Bodkin Adams." ?He picked out a phrase used by the learned Judge:

"Cutting the thread of life" .{ Mr.Munby argued that even if the

artificial feeding process were to be considered to be medical

treatment it would nevertheless be unlawful in the instant case

to withdraw that treatment.           He referred to what Lord Donaldson,

Master of the Rolls described as the ’critical equation’ in the

case of In re J (Wardship: Medical Treatment) reported in T 1 9 9 H

Family Division Reports at page             33.       That    case concerned                   the

consideration of potential further treatment to a severely brain

damaged child.        The problem raised in the case was what should

be done if the child should suffer another collapse which might

occur at any time.         Should resuscitative treatment be given in

such a case?        Mr.Munby relying upon a passage in the judgment of

Lord Donaldson        at page    46   submitted that because                         of the very

strong presumption which exists in favour of preserving life a
withholding or withdrawing of treatment could only be justified

                                    thev:pain-and..suffering -likely to be -1

suffered by the patient exceeded the benefit to the patient of

presetting life,f At page 46 of the report Lord Donaldson said:

"This brings me face to face with the problem of formulating the

critical equation.        In truth it cannot be done with mathematical

or    any   precision.      There    is       without     doubt      a   very    strong

presumption in favour of a course of action which will prolong

life, but,     even excepting the "cabbage" case to which special

considerations may well apply, it is not irrebuttable.                          As this

Court recognised in "In Re B " . account has to be taken of the

pain and     suffering and quality            of   life which        the child       will

experience if life is prolonged.               Account has also to be taken

of the pain and suffering           involved in the proposed                 treatment

itself."     Later in his judgment he said:               "But in the end there

will be cases in which the answer must be that it is not in the

interests of     the child to subject it             to treatment which will

cause increased suffering and produce no commensurate benefit,

giving the fullest possible weight to the child's and mankinds

desire to survive."        In this case liowever, said Mr.Munby, theref

is;::.nO ;question .of^^^fef^rlKgt^bfCause Anthony Bland                  is "/totallyf

without ./feeli^                              He   went   on    to   speak      of   "the

slippery slope" which would be embarked upon if the Court were

to make a declaration in the terms sought by the Plaintiffs:                            A

dangerous precedent would be established.                 He developed in depth

his   submission   that    there    is    an absolute          prohibition       upon   a

doctor against taking active steps designed to bring about death.

He likened the situation to that of two climbers roped together


                                         14
where    one     climber      deliberately           cut   the     rope    which    bound      his

companion to himself, or to switching off an iron lung.



Mr.Anthony Lester Q.C.                instructed by          the Attorney          General      to

appear     as    Amicus        Curiae        made     submissions         which     in     effect

supported the Plaintiff's case.                     He acknowledged that the subject

matter of this case is obviously emotive and difficult.                                   He saidj

that ■■ the     Court    would        not /be-: ;as:sisted:vv^y :van V:^absolutist; -or-f

dogmatically- legalistic               approach.!          It ^vas ..not- a         so .cal.ledf

euthanasia case; j it was in terms a case about whether in the

view of the doctors and the Court a particular treatment decision

should be taken which would remove the artificial support                                      for

life    and     allow        nature     to     take    its       course     so     that     death

supervenes.          He submitted that the law should strive to be in

accordance with          contemporary medical                ethics       and good        medical

practice.       He acknowledged that Anthony Bland's case is difficult

because, at first sight, it seems to require the Court to reject

the vital principle of the sanctity of life in favour of value

judgments       as      to     the     quality        of     the    further        artificial

prolongation of the life of Anthony Bland.                          He submitted however

that':ther<a-is; no inherent' conflict between-having' regard ,'to,.the #

Qualify --af---lif#:::and; respecting;-the,-sanctity---of--viife.^                        on   the

contrary, they are complementary;                      the principle of sanctity of

life embraces the need for full respect to be accorded to the

dignity and memory of the individual human being.                                 The meaning f

arii: criteria of quality of life should focus on benefit to the|

patient.       He contended that Anthony Bland had an interest in the*

way in which his family would remember him after his death and |


                                                15
in the manner of his dying and submitted that where one coirld                                       #

medically    sure       oh    all     the    evidence       that    the    patient        in    a

persistent vegetative state is suffering permanently from loss

of consciousness, there is no legal duty to maintain what remains

of-his or her "life" whether by feeding or by giving medication.

It is not in the patient's best interests to do so.                                    In those

circumstances he submitted there would be no breach of duty or

criminal liability in ceasing to feed or otherwise to treat the

patient.     Such a conclusion,              he argued,       is in accordance with

existing English case law.                  If the Court declared the treatment

proposed by Dr. Howe to be 'lawful' then he said the criminal law

would not become involved because a basic                          element of criminal

liability, that is to say an unlawful act (the actus reus) is not

made out.



It is correct that there has been no previous case of this nature

in this jurisdiction.               Mr. Lester referred to a case before the

Supreme Court of the United States:                       Cruzan v Director, Missouri

Department       of    Health       cited    at     110    S.Ct.    2841       (1990).         The

headnote    of        the    report    reads:         "Guardians          of    patients        in

persistent vegetative state brought declaratory judgment action

seeking judicial sanction of their wish to terminate artificial

hydration and nutrition for patient.                       The Circuit Court, Jasper

County,    Probate Division,              Charles E. Teel Junior, J.                   directed

State employees to cause request of guardians to be carried out.

Appeal     was    taken.            The     Missouri       Supreme        Court    reversed.

Certiorari       was        granted.         The    Supreme        Court       Chief    Justice

Rehnquist, held that:


                                               16
1      The United States constitution did not forbid Missouri from

          requiring     that       clear    and     convincing              evidence      of    an

          incompetents wishes          to the withdrawal of life sustaining

          treatment;



2      State Supreme Court did not commit constitutional error in

          concluding that evidence adduced at trial did not amount to

          clear and convincing evidence of patient's desire to cease

          hydration and nutrition;            and



3         Due process       did not    require State              to accept substituted

          judgment of close family members absent substantial proof

          that their views reflected those of the patient.



The decision therefore turned on a constitutional point as to the

jurisdiction of the State of Missouri.                            Howevertin dissenting

judgments Justice Brennan and two other Justices referred to what

may be regarded as the substantive merits of the case with regard

to the treatment of patients in a Persistent Vegetative State.

Mr.   Lester     referred          to passages      in the         judgments      of   Justice

Brennan and Justice Stevens.                 He drew attention to a passage at

page 2883      of the       report:
                               ^
                                           "Medical advances Have altered

"But for patients .'like Nancy Gruzan who have no consciousness an<|j

only as an effort to define life's meaning, not as an attempt to

preserve its sanctity.'?           At page 2887           he     said "In any       event,|

absent some     theological        abstraction,           the idea of life is not#

conceived separately from the idea of a living person."/ Justice

Brennan used a phrase to which Mr.Lester also pointed when he

described persons in the condition of the subject in that case

as "passive prisoners of medical technology".                         Mr.Lester          also

drew   attention     to    the Canadian Law Reform Commission Working

Paper of July 1983.          I do not need to comment in detail upon it

but in it the Law Reform Commission of Canada recommended that

the cessation of life sustaining treatment in such cases should

not attract     criminal liability.                 There are a number of other

decisions      of   State    Courts       in       the   United     States    in     which

applications for a declaration or                    for leave      to withdraw          life

sustaining treatment have been granted.                         However they are not

strictly comparable to cases in this jurisdiction because many

of   them   import    a     consideration           of   'parens    patriae'        in    the


                                              18
particular States.       In the present case there is no question but

that Anthony Bland is in a condition known as the Persistent

Vegetative State.       He has no feeling, no awareness, nor can he

experience anything relating to his surroundings.                  To his parents I

and family he is "dead".?        His spirit has left him and all                 that I

remains is the shell of his body.              f'This is kept functioning as

a biological unit by the artificial process of feeding through

a mechanically operated naso gastric tube.                  Intensive attention

by skilled nurses assists the continuation of the existence of

the body.       It is a desperately tragic situation both for what

remains    of Anthony Bland       and    for    the devoted members         of    his

family.     The doctor having the responsibility for the care of

Anthony Bland has come to a very clear medical conclusion.                         He

is   supported     in   his   assessment       and     opinion    by   doctors     of

unrivalled experience and professional                 standing.       They say    x.i

terms that it is in accordance with good medical practice and in

accordance with the true benefit to Anthony Bland himself that

the artificial feeding regime should be withdrawn.                     The Official

Solicitor has made clear to the Court the possible implications

of a precedent being established by a decision in favour of the

Plaintiffs in this case, although such a decision would accord

with decisions      taken     in other    common law jurisdictions.               The

Court must      consider this     case   in the       light     of its particular

facts     and   upon    the   principles        of    law     obtaining    in    this

jurisdiction.      In my Judgment the provision of artificial feeding

by means     of a naso gastric tube            is    ’medical    treatment*.      The

Court has before it overwhelming medical evidence which supports

this view.      I accept it.     The clinical judgment of Dr.Howe is to


                                         19
the effect      that it would be in the best            interests of Anthony-

Bland for that artificial feeding regime to be withdrawn at this

stage.     He has   cogently       given his    reasons      for   reaching     that

conclusion.     After three and a half years he has not lightly made

that decision.          It   is a clinical     decision      arrived at    in     the

honest and responsible exercise of his duty of caring for his

patient.     The fact that Anthony Bland's existence will terminate

does not in my judgment alter the reality that the true cause of

death will be the massive injuries which he sustained in what has

been described as the Hillsborough disaster.                 I am satisfied that

there is no reasonable possibility of Anthony Bland ever emerging

from his     existing persistent vegetative             state to a cognitive

sapient state.      I am satisfied that             there    is no    therapeutic,

medical    or   other    benefit    to   Anthony     Bland    in     continuing    to

maintain his ventilation nutrition and hydration by artificial

means.     I am further satisfied that to discontinue the same would

accord with good medical           practice    as    recognised and approved

within the medical profession and finally that the order that I

propose to make is in the circumstances in the best interests of

Anthony Bland.      His parents and sister concur in the making of

the order which I propose to make and I therefore declare that

despite the inability of Anthony Bland to consent thereto^ the

Plaintiffs and the responsible attending physicians:



1    May lawfully discontinue all life sustaining treatment and

     medical     support measures        designed      to keep       Anthony Bland

     alive in his existing persistent vegetative state including

     the termination of ventilation, nutrition and hydration by


                                         20
    artificial means and



2   That they may lawfully discontinue ind thereafter need not

     furnish medical treatment to Anthony Bland except for the

    sole purpose of enabling Anthony Bland to end his life and

     to die peacefully with the greatest dignity and the least

    distress.          I do not       consider it appropriate                to make     any

    declaration with regard to any possible consequences so far

    as       the   criminal     law   is   concerned.            In my      Judgment     the

     declaration         that     the      course        proposed      is     lawful      is

     sufficient to give to the doctors and to the hospital the

     necessary         assurance      as      to   the    lawfulness         of   what    is

    proposed.          There will of course be liberty to apply in the

     event of there being any material change in the existing

     circumstances        before        the    withdrawal         of   the    artif 3 . i

     feeding.



It is understandable that those who are concerned with patients

in the Persistent Vegetative State should seek assistance as to

appropriate practice in the future.                      Because of the gravity of

the decision and the likely possible variation in the facts of

individual cases I consider that the approval of the Court should

be sought in cases of a similar nature.                        In accordance with the

procedures indicated by Lord Brandon of Oakbrook in the case of

In Re    F    T19901    2 Appeal      Cases        at   page    65     the    appropriate

procedure should be by a summons for a declaration made to the

Family Division of the High Court.                  The Official Solicitor should

in my Judgment be invited to act as the Guardian ad litem of the


                                              21
patient which would guarantee the fullest possible investigation

of all    the   facts and       circumstances        of   the     individual        case.

Although      essentially       the    decision     is    one    for   the     clinical

judgment of responsible medical practitioners, in my judgment it

is desirable as a safeguard and for the reassurance of the public

that    the   Court    should     be    involved     in   the    way    that    I    have

indicated.      I would expect that in all similar applications there

would    be   not     merely    one     medical     opinion     but    at    least    two

responsible     medical        opinions.        Further    the    position      of    the

members of the family is very important.                    It may be that there

will be cases where there is a division of opinion among members

of a family.        In such cases it would be essential in my judgment

for    responsible     medical        carers   to   seek the     authority of         the

Court.

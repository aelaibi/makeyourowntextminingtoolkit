Dear Mr. Chester,
                       Inspection of Floodlight Pilon
         After the visitation by the South Yorkshire Working Party
the weather had cleared up a bit and so I made an inspection
of the pilon immediately behind the South stand.
             I am pleased to say that the steelwork is generally in a
very good condition but there is localised breakdown of the
paintwork mainly near the joints.   I had the tail end of a
film in my camera and the three pictures which I took showing
typical corrosion patterns are attached.   Photograph 1 shows
rusting both above and below a bolted splice and also some
rusting between the splice plates.     This is just about the
worst of the damage in the tower and although it looks quite
bad, the actual loss of metal is probably still quite
minimal.
    Photograph 2 is a close-up of another joint where ther.e.-'is
similar rusting between the splice plates and the main angles.
This kind of damage occurs because it is virtually impossible
to seal the gaps between the edges of the pieces of steel forming
the splice with paint so that the steelwork inside the joint
is almost unprotected.

     Photograph No. 3 shows some rusting developing on top
 of one of the angles forming diagonal bracing.   Although
 this looks rather bad it has to be kept in mind that rust
 expands compared with the original thickness of steel
 from which it has been derived and I doubt whether rust
 has penetrated more than about half a millimetre.
     The situation is not such that immediate action is required
 except that if you are wishing to maintain the life of
 the towers for the very longest possible period into the
 future, more than a century say, then it is important that
 maintenance be carried out before the damage has progressed
 too far.   On the other hand, you are only thinking of
 say another 50 years life then I think it likely that it will
 be another three or four years before the amount of deterioration
 makes it imperative that the steelwork be treated to remove
 the localised rusting and then completely repainted.
     Part of the equation is that the cost of painting the
 towers is probably about a quarter of the cost of a new set
 of towers.    Thus by extending the time between successive
 paint treatments, the money saved will in due course pay for
 some new pilons possibly of a more modern kind.
     Unless the Club has in mind that it wishes to obtain the
 longest possible life from the present pilons, I suggest that
 there is no need to paint at the present time and that you may
 well find it is three or four more years before work becomes
 essential.


                             Yours sincerely,

            Dear Sir,

            Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

            I thank you for your letter dated 12th June.

            Taking into account all the factors which you mention (particularly the
            steel sheeting of the wooden decking of the upper seated area by the
            start of the forthcoming season), the existing roof of the South Stand
            will be regarded as acceptable on a temporary basis until the end of
            the 1985/86 season. At that time, either a new roof must be constructed
            or the under-roof timber cladding of the existing roof replaced by the
            start of the 1986/87 season.

            Details and plans of the work will, of course, be required in the usual
            way.

            Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


 Dear Sirs,
                        Safety of Sport Grounds Act, 1975
                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
              Thank you for your letter of 18 December, 1985 -enclosing
  comments of the Building Authority to which I would reply as follows


  Disabled Facilities
  a)   There is no doubt that the Kop is covered by the Building
              Regulations and that we shall need Building Regulations
              approval.                  However, there has effectively been no change
              in the 1985 Regulations.
              Even if there were a change in Regulations, it is obviously
              commonsense that facilities for the disabled apply to the
              ground as a whole and not to one particular building. At
              the moment there are perfectly adequate facilities under
              the overhang of the roof of the North stand. There is a
              level approach. The disabled are under the cover, of the
              cantilever roof. Any facilities at the front of the Kop
              would be less sheltered from the rain, and more prone to
              disruption by the fans immediately behind. It is not a good
              place at all for disabled people.


                                       An Unlimited Company, Registered in England - No. 1833144
                                                                  SHEET   2


EASTWOOD & PARTNERS

b)   We have no intention of entering into further discussion
     regarding a way in which the 50 or any other number of
     places could be provided under the new Kop.    There are
     adequate facilities for the ground as a whole at the
     moment.

c)   The Building Authority clearly has no knowledge whatever
     of the cost of football ground structures. The extra
     £500,000 is made up of several components. Firstly,
     there is a steel frame supporting a precast concrete
     deck, some of it at very high level. Very expensive
     piling is required for the columns of this steel frame
     because most of the columns are high up on the bank.
     Secondly, the main roof girders have to carry very much
     more load, because of the larger area.    The spans of the
     radial girders are also that much greater so they have
     to be stronger. The cost per square foot of all the
     covered space is increased. In addition the framing and
     sheeting at the rear of the stand are on average very
     much higher and, therefore, more expensive. Thirdly,
     the addition of the extra spectators has resulted in
     the need for complete re-organisation of exit routes with
     considerable extra expense.   New turnstiles are needed and
     additional toilet accommodation. A re-examination of our
     figures shows the additional cost for the 5,000 extra places
     is about £560,000. To simply roof over the existing Kop with
     no extension would reduce the cost of the scheme to less than
     a half of that for the enlarged Kop.     I trust we shall have
     no more of this uninformed opinion.

     This extra money is being provided to achieve 5000
     extra spectators. If we give up 1000 of those spaces to
     provide for say 100 disabled plus 100 helpers then over
     £100,000 of the extra cost of the enlarged Kop has to be set
     against the disabled accommodation. The Building Authority
     must accept that the extra £580,000 the Club intends to spend
     is to cater for those days when the ground is full or nearly full
     to capacity.
                                                                    SHEET


EASTWOOD & PARTNERS

    With regard to the proposal that a glazed shelter might
     be placed over thedisabled accommodation in front of the
    North stand, it was not our intention that any seats within
     the North stand would have an obscured view although a few
     of the spectators might have to look through the glass of
     the canopy to see the near touchline. There are materials
     available for the glazed roof which might prove to be safe for
     that purpose.

     I regard it as regrettable that there has been such a
     negative attitude on this particular matter.    We have not,
     of course, taken the design study any further with regard
     to the possibility of a covering for part of the disabled
     area nearest to the Kop end of the North stand, but would
     reconsider the matter if the Working Party has a change of
     heart.


     Enlarged Kop
          With regard to the request for a barrier to protect
     the ladies toilet, it has perhaps not been realised that
     there is handrailing already in place.   A gap will be
     created for an entrance to the ladies toilet.     The
     final version of the proposed arrangements is shown on
     the attached print of drawing number 6648/53.     The new
     brickwork is shown shaded.


     Roofing the Kop
          We are really surprised by the suggestion that the
     steel frame of the gable walls and presumably the back of the
     stand should be sheeted over. It is a common feature of
     every stand structure that I know of in any football ground
     in the country that the sheeting rails and other bracing
     members are exposed on the inner face.   In older structures
     they are generally only at 1.2 m centres but in more modern
     structures they are generally at 1.8 m centres.     With the
     1.8 m spacing it would be extremely difficult indeed to
     climb up except adjacent to a column. However, I know of
     no instance where the sheeting rails of an existing stand
     are regarded as being such a hazard that they should be boxed
     in, with an inner skin as well as an outer skin. I find
     it very surprising that this matter is being pressed.

          This correspondence on these matters leads me to believe
     that there would be great advantage if the Club's advisers were
     present for part of each of the meetings of the Officer Working
     Party.   Matters of this kind need to be discussed round the
     table rather than in lengthy correspondence.   We can be of great
     assistance in providing information which may result in fewer
     matters becoming contentious.   It is also inevitable that we
     send you plans which are in some ways preliminary in order
     to give the opportunity to comment at an early stage.    The
     plans are incomplete in some respects and this may lead to
     misunderstanding of what is intended or a lack of appreciation
     of the thinking behind what is proposed.   There is also the
     difficulty^in the light of comments received from the Club, and
     indeed those from the Working Party, quite significant
     changes may take place at a very late stage.   It is desirable
     that any late changes be dealt with in as short a time as
     possible.    In this regard I now enclose six prints of each of
     our drawings numbers 7C, 8A, 9A, 17A and 56. As the Club
     will be wishing to place an order for the :new ±»uilding not
     later than the end of January, it may be that an oral presentation
     to your Working Part of what is proposed might be beneficial
     all round.

    For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


    Dear Sirs,
                        Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
            Thank you for your letter of 18 December enclosing the
    comments of the Building Authority to which I would reply as
    follows


    Disabled Facilities
    a)      There is no doubt that the Kop is covered by the
            Building Regulations and that we shall need Building
            Regulations approval.   However I would question the
            statement that the November 1985 Regulations apply.
            It has been standard procedure over the years that
            where the planning consent refers to satisfying the
            Building Regulations as one of its conditions, it
            is the Regulations in force at the time the planning
            consent is given which apply. As we obtained our
           planning consent in August,it is the old Regulations
           which have to be met.   Having said this, there has
           effectively been no change because there is as yet no
     Approved Document for this particular matter in the
     new Regulations.   Even if there were a change in
     Regulations, it is obviously coramonsense that facilities
     for the disabled apply to the ground as a whole and not
     to one particular building.   At the moment there
     are perfectly adequate facilities under the overhang
     of the roof of the North stand. Any facilities at
     the front of the Kop would be less sheltered from the
     rain, and more prone to disruption by the fans
     immediately behind. It is not a good place at all
     for disabled people.


b)   We have no intention of entering into further discussion
     regarding a way in which the 50 or any other number of
     places could be provided under the new Kop, except to
     say that at Bramall Lane thereis a runway in front      of
     the chairs, to allow one chair to pass another, and
     this, together with the provision of a seat alongside
     each disabled person for an attendant, is the reason
     why provision of places for the disabled means the
     loss of a large number of standing spaces.


el   The Building Authority clearly has no knowledge whatever
      of the cost of football ground structures. The extra
     £500,000 is made up of several components.   Firstly,
     there is a steel frame supporting a precast concrete
     deck, some of it at very high level. Very expensive
     piling is required for the columns of this steel frame
     because most of the columns are high up on the bank.
     Secondly, the main roof girders have to carry very much
     more load, because of the larger area. The spans of the
     radial girders are also that much greater so they have
     to be stronger.   The cost per square foot of covered
     space is increased. In addition the framing and
     sheeting at the rear of the stand are on average very
much higher and therefore more expensive.     Thirdly,
the addition of the extra spectators has resulted
in the need for complete re-organisation of exit
routes with considerable extra expense.     New turnstiles
are needed and additional toilet accommodation.     A
re~exarainatlon of our figures shows the additional
cost for the 5,000 extra places is about £560,000.
To simply roofover the existing Kop with no extension
would reduce the cost of the scheme to less than a
half of that for the enlarged Kop. I trust we shall
have no more of this uninformed opinion.

This extra money is being provided to achieve 5000
extra spectators.   If we give up 1000 of those spaces
to provide for say 100 disabled plus 100 helpers then
over 1100,000 of the extra cost of the enlarged Kop
has to be set against the disabled accommodation.   The
Building Authority must accept that the extra £580,000
the Club intends to spend is to cater for those days
when the ground is full or nearly full to capacity.

With regard to the proposal that a glazed shelter
might be placed over the disabled accommodation in
front of the North stand, it was not our intention that
any seats within the North stand would have an obscured
view although a fvw of the spectators might have to look
through the glass of the canopy to see the near touchline
There are materials available for the glazed roof which
might prove to be safe for that purpose.
I regard it as regrettable that there has been such a
negative attitude on this particular matter.     We have
not of course taken the design study any further with
regard to the possibility of a covering for part of the
disabled area nearest to the Kop end of the North stand,
but would reconsider the matter if the Working Party
has a change of heart.
Enlarged Kop
        We regard the comments with regard to a barrier to
protect the ladies toilet as being over-fussy.   There is a
pinch point only a few metres upstream and the crowd will be
free moving where it passes the toilet because the width
available is greater than that at the pinch point.   At the
worst the ladies toilet presents no more of an obstruction
than say the walls on either side of the gates going out of
the ground. It is clearly visible and the width is greater
than that of the exit gates which are calculated to the Green
book formula.


Roofing over Kop
        We are really surprised that this question of the steel
frame of the gable walls and presumably the back of the stand
has been raised. It is a common feature of every stand
structure that I know of in any football ground in the country
that the sheeting rails and other bracing members are exposed
on the inner face.   In older structures they are generally only
at 1.2m centres but in more modern structures they are generally
at 1.8m centres. With the 1.8m spacing it would be extremely
difficult indeed to climb up except adjacent to a column.
However I know of no instance where the steel framing on an
existing ground is regarded as being such a hazard that it
should be boxed in, with an inner skin as well as an outer skin.
I find it almost unbelievable that this matter is being pressed.



        This correspondence on these matters leads me to believe
that there would be great advantage if the Club's advisers were
present for part of each of the meetings of the Officer Working
Party.   Matters of this kind need to be discussed round the
table rather than in lengthy correspondaace.   We can be of great
assistance in providing information which may result in fewer
matters becoming contentious.   It is also inevitable that we
send you plans which are in some ways preliminary in order
to give the opportunity to comment at an early stage. The
plans are incomplete in some respects and this may lead to
misunderstanding of what is intended or a lack of appreciation
of the thinking behind what is proposed. There is also the
difficulty in the light of comments received ffom the Club, and
indeed those from the Working Party, quite significant
changes may take place at a very late stage. It is desirable
that any late changes be dealt with in as short a time as
possible. In this regard we shall be sending you some revised
drawings in the nex t two or three days. As the Club will be
wishing to place an order for the new building by the end of
January it may be that an oral presentation to your Working
Party of what is proposed might be beneficial all round.

    Dear Sirs

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975                                 19 DEC 1985
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

    I thank you for your letter dated 29th November.

    The Building Authority in particular has requested me to bring the following
    points to your attention:-

    Disabled Facilities

    a)   The roofing in of the Spion Kop would appear to constitute the erection
         of a new building. Therefore, the Building Regulations 1985 will apply.
         Hence, with regard to the Disabled, it will be necessary to have regard
         for Schedule 2 of the Regulations.  (Schedule 2 reproduces Part T of the
         1976 Regulations - "Facilities for disabled people", until an appropriate
         Approved Document is issued).

    b)   The Building Authority would like to see a breakdown of the proposals for
         accommodating the 50 disabled places quoted. How have the arrangements and
         calculations for area been carried out? e.g. why the necessity for "a runway
         in front of the chairs"? At Bramall Lane, access is from the end of the
         terrace. At Hillsborough, the front of the Kop could be modified similary
         in the view of the Building Authority.

    c)   The Building Authority also question your costing of £500,000 just for the
         additional terracing.

         The Building Authority refer to the "loss" of 1000 spectators, and your own
         words that "we must have regard for the usual gates at the ground not the
         rare capacity occasions". Under normal circumstances the spectators, whatever
         the correct number, will merely be displaced in their opinion.

         The Building Authority consider that costing should also include a balance for
         possible losses resulting from obscured seats in the North Stand if an adequate
         protected area/shelter was provided in the suggested position in that Stand.

Enlarged Kop

The ladies toilet does protrude onto the exit route, as even if the route
increases in width at this point, the corner of the toilets would present an
obstruction to "flow". A barrier should simply direct the "flow" off the corner
and not in itself become an obstruction. The barrier could also prevent pressure
on the toilet wall.

Roofing the Kop

Having regard to the words of the police that "they will climb anything", the
Building Authority feel that the provision of rails at the usual 1.8m vertical
centres and a projecting width of say 200 mm, would seem to be unacceptable.

                                             Yours faithfully,

Dear Dick,
        Many thanks for sending me the copy of Benny Hill's
letter.   I have drafted a reply which we might send if you
so wish, a copy of which is enclosed.
        I think he is being a little demanding but obviously
you will wish to keep him happy. If the Club feels that it
would like to give improved access to the press box, we could
prepare a little report.


                           Yours sincerely,
                                                        WE/KH/6517

Dear Mr.        ,
           Dick Chester sent us a copy of your letter of 23 May
and has now forwarded a copy of your letter of 28 November.
The question of access to the press box was looked at during
the early summer.   No action has been taken because the Club
was looking at the future development of the South stand.
If the South stand were remodelled, patt of the scheme would
be a much improved facility for the press and television.
        In the last three months, roofing of the Kop has
become the first priority and it is therefore appropriate to
have another look at the press box.   We will write a brief
report for the Club in the near future.


                            Yours sincerely,

    For the attention of Mr. R.H. Chester


    Dear Dick,
    - ' - - - ;-        Safety Work During 1985
       As requested at our meeting last Wednesday afternoon we have
.1 pleasure in enclosing a copy of our cost estimates for the various
    items of safety work carried out so far this year. ;
    _ Jfou will recall that the ^services jof .the resident engineer _
    were originallyagreed for the North stand painting contract.
    Because it is not yet certain that you will receive a grant for
P   the North stand, I have included most of the cost of the R.E.
    against the South stand steel deck.     You will recall that the
    ceiling figure for the South stand was to be £68,000.      That did
    not include for an R.E. but we have in fact been able to charge
    most of the ,R.E*s time to.that particular job.       ______ _
        The figures for our professional fees are based on the scale
    charges. I think it likely that our job costings will in some
    cases be below the scale figure. In that case we will give a
    donation to the club.


                                     Yours sincerely,
                                                                  W E /JA S /S W /6 5 1 7

            In March this year we carried out an inspection of the
    steelwork supporting the cantilever raof over the North Stand.
    It was found that quite a lot of the steel members, especially
    the smaller ones were rusting. In some places the rusting was
    quite pronounced. The mast seriously rusted steel was found
    on the bottoni booms of the main lattice girders beneath some
    flashings which had allowed water to run into and lodge between
    the upturned flanges of the steelwork members.
         It was also discovered that the roof sheets were allowing
    water to penetrate and again corrode some of the internal steel
    members.    These are especially vulnerable because they are made
    from relatively thin steel.
         In our report to the Club we recommended that action should
    be taken to remove the rust, apply a protective paint system,
    replace the old flashings over the bottom boom members and to
    seal the laps of the roof sheets.
                             '      ..                                 V-;.v 1

     The matter was brought to the attention of S.Y.C.C. who agreed
that remedial measures should be taken to prevent further
deterioration of the roof steelwork.
     Enclosed are copies of the foLlowing documents relating to
the work on the North Stand roof.

        a) Our report dated 26 March 1985 to S.W.F.C,
        b) Our letter of invitation to tender, dated 24 April,       for
             the preparation and painting of the steelwork.
        c) Our summary of tenders dated 21 May from D.M.B. Contractors
             Ltd., Midland Painters, Tighe industrial Winters Ltd.
             and J. P. Gazzard Ltd.
        d)   Letter from Proctor Rooflcad Ltd. dated 14 June giving
             prices for replacing a few   roof   sheets and flashings over
             the bottom booms of the roof girders.
        e) Our letter dated 5 July to Proctor Roofclad ltd.
        f) Our Fig. 1 showing detail of sheeting ond laps.
        g) Our letter dated 24 July to S.W.F.C.

 substantial and to keep my work to manageable proportions
 I propose to send you documentation for each section separately.
Enclosed is the paperwork for the South stand Fire Protection.
     I will send similar evidence for the segregation works at
the Leppings Lane end of the ground and the work     chi   the North
stand reof over the next two or three days.

                             Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs,

                   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                    ' ' ' South S tand Fire Protection

     As requested we have pleasure in enclosing copies of various
letters and documents for the items of work related to the sheet
metal fire protection installed in the South Stand just before
the start of the present season.
     Enclosed are copies of the following documents relating to
the fire larotection.

     a)   Letter dated 18 July from S.Y.C.C. to S.W.F.C. confirming
          their requirement for the timber deck to be protected.

     b)   Our letters dated 4 and 11 June inviting three firms to
          tender for the work.

     c)   Tenders fran Allclad, Proctor Roofclad and Rogerson Roofing,
          all dated 7 June. These tenders also included for re-sheeting
          the South Stand roof for which S.Y.C.C. have since given
          the Club a "stay of execution".

          Associated with the above work was the application of a
          ncm-iilp wearing surface.   It is referred to in the letter,
                                                                             2




               dated 18 July, fran S.Y.C.C.

          d)   Our letter dated 25 July reporting on the tenders for
               that work

          e)   The quotation dated 18 July front Safety Underfoot Ltd.

               Before tenders were obtained for the sheet metal protection
               we had some trials done for the benefit of the Fire
               Officer to show him our proposals.    These trials were
               carried out on a daywork basis plus materials basis by
               Allclad, all supervised by us. Unfortunat&ly we did
               not keep a copy of their invoice but we do enclose the
               following.

          f)   Our certificate for payment, dated 1 July, for the sum of
               £153.0 8.

               One more cost assoicated with protective decking was the
               carpet in the directors box.     It was discovered that the
               original carpet would not qome up without being damaged.
               Proctors had made an allowance for taking up the carpet
               but not replacing it with naw.    because time was pressing
               we obtained a price for laying a new carpet over the
               metal sheets, leavingthe old carpet in place, from
               Shirtcliffe Contracts.

          g) Quotation dated 19 August from Shirtcliffe Contracts,

          h) Our letter to Shirtcliffe Contracts dated 23 August.

          i)   Our certificate for payment, dated 3 September, for the sum
               of £1341.12

          j) Shirtcliffe Contracts invoice dated 17 August.
          The final accounts for Proctor Roofclad Ltd and Safety Underfoot
     Ltd have still to be agreed.

                                       Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick,

              Alarm Points and Fire Extinguishers

     Thank you for sending the note written by Mr.
about the alarm points and fire extinguishers in the
West and North stands.

     The original philospphy behind installing the call
points in the bars was that in the ©vent of fire during
a match the alarm could be sounded from an area that
was always occupied, i.e. by the bar staff.   At the 8
same time the call points are out of reach by the public.
Although out of match hours an alarm cannot be raised
without going into one of the bars we believe that the
call points are mounted in the most appropriate place.

     We have discussed the matter with the Fire Service
and they are happy with the present arrangement.
     A fire is most likely to start in one of the bars
where there are gas appliances and flamable material
present and we believe that the extinguishers should,
therefore, be close at hand in the bars.   However, we
learn that the Fire Service may soon be asking for
additional extinguishers to be provided in circulation
areas in the event of a fire occurring somewhere else
in the stand. Wait and see what they suggest should be
done before taking any action.




                                      Yours sincerely,

Dear Bill,

I note that an additional gate has been installed in the perimeter fence
in front of the Kop by Gleesons.

Could you please advise on cost and confirmation of approval for work to
be commenced. I recollect our discussions regarding the necessity and
urgency, but I do not recollect approval of price.

I have, incidentally, had a visit from Tinsley Wire who have a "new
Proposal" and requested the use of Hillsborough as a showpiece for their
project.

Yours sincerely,



R. H. Chester,
Secretary.

Dear Mr. Vaughan,

                   Safety of sports Grounds Act, 1975
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

       Thank you for your letter of 22 August regarding the brick
wall. The discussion is n o w C l e a r l y b e i n g s i d e - t r a c k e d *
It will be recalled that the section of wall which was being
examined had had no bricks placed on it since the previous
day.    The criticism which was made was that the internal joints
should have been completely filled with mortar. This would have
been quite incorrect since there would then have been a plane
of weakness between new mortar and old at the level of a bed joint.
The way in which the wall was being constructed was correct and
what was being asked for was incorrect.
     There is the secondary issue of the extent to which the
joints need to be filled when the next course of bricks is laid.
It is normal bricklaying practice for the bed to be fully covered
with mortar and for the bricks to be then pressed or knocked down
to level. This ensures that the top of the open joint becomes
filled with mortar and a good key is thus obtained with the bricks
immediately below. It is this key which is the most important
element in ensuring that concentrated loads can be transmitted
along the wall in horizontal bending.
     £t may be that the procedure outlined above will not ensure
that every bit of the vertical joint will be filled but that is
of minor importance. The essential issue is that of filling
the joints up as each layer of bricks is laid, if the technique *
advocated by the Building Control Authority were adopted, the
wall would be dramatically weakened.
     I do Hot understand the point being made about the non-
standard bonding of the brickwork at the stepped portions of
the wall. There is in general bonding at every fourth course
which is perfectly normal. The strength of the bricks is
so much greater than that of the mortar. This is a perfectly
adequate ratio. Complications obviously arise where the thickness
of the wall is reduced by stepping but there is nothing whatever
to cause concern in the way bonding has been carried out in this
particular wall.
     I reiterate that the construction standards are normal.
The wall has been designed for most onerous conditions and using
the very pessimistic permissible stresses contained in the Code,
which are more akin to walls badly constructed and subject to
100 years of atmospheric pollution. With this background, the
criticisms which are being made are irritating to say the least.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

Thank you for your letter dated 12th August in connection with the Note of
the meeting in relation to the inspection of Hillsborough Stadium on
7th August.

Your comments and views are noted and I would confirm that these will be
recorded as you suggest.

In connection with the workmanship of the brick wall reported in section 2A
of the notes of meeting, the Building Authority maintain the view that the
portion of wall inspected did not meet the requirements of accepted work­
manship procedures outlined in regulations. Typical of these are CP121 and
BS5628 Pt. 3 where clause 32.7 is quite specific on the question of filling
of brickwork joints.

Additionally it is felt that a structural wall of this nature, although
designed as a cantilever, should be provided with lateral as well as vertical
strength in order to spread any applied local loading. A slight loss of
beneficial self-weight would also be lost by non-filling of vertical joints
and, of course, as mentioned in Codes of Practice, weathering and durability
may be a problem with open joints.

A further point noted by the Building Authority was the non-standard bonding
of brickwork at the stepped portions of the wall due to the manual cutting of
individual brick units.

It is considered that your points raised in relation to construction are
relevant, but this type of problem could be avoided by using proper site
techniques.

                                                 Yours faithfully,




                                                 Chief Executive.

Dear
                        South Stand Steel Peeking
        In response to your telephone call last week we have pleasure
in putting forward our suggestions for painting the remainder of
the recently installed steel decking in the south stand.
     If the work is to be done gradually by the ground staff we
suggest that preparation of the steel plates, which are likely to
be lightly rusted by the tine work starts, is limited to being
rubbed down with Emery cloth and/or wire brushed.     The type of
paint therefore needs to be fairly tolerant because without blast
cleaning it is unlikely that every vestige of rust will be removed
This really excludes primers such as the zinc rich chromates and
phosphates which are normally used these days for the protection
of steelwork. A traditional red lead primer therefore seems to
satisfy the requirements. It is relatively cheap and is easy to
apply. Over the primer would then go an alkyd undercoat and gloss
coat.
        However, this involves the application of three coats which
would be very time consuming. If you intend to paint all the
sheeting including that, behind the seats, there is probably about
1650 m* to cover.
     A single coat application could be attractive and probably
the enamel finish paint manufactured by Finnegan's is very suitable.
Their literature is enclosed. You have probably seen it advertised
recently, though at approximately £6 per litre it is fairly expensive.
To paint the steel plates about 240 litres would be required at a
cost of say £1440.
     Using a red lead primer with alkyd undercoat and gloss the
material costs would be about £790. Roughly half the cost of the
Finnegan's enamel finish but would take probably three times as long
to apply.
     As for durability, the enamel paint is likely to last the
longest though with both systems regular touching up and overcoating
ought to be allowed for in future maintenance budgets.


                                  Yours sincerely,

Qaar Dick,
      Many thanks for your note of 12 August enclosing the
copy of David Vaughan's note of the m e t i n g held at the ground
on 7 August.    A copy of my letter to David Vaughan was sent
to you the same day so that our letters have crossed in the
post.
        You will see that I have taken up very strongly the
suggestion by Don Sherrif that the workmanship in the brickwork
was poor and would lead to weakness.     It is unfortunate that
David Vaughan did not record that I had completely refuted
what Don Sheriff said.   David now recognises that this was a
mistake but ill putting the matter right by circulating a copy
of my letter.
      Turning to the matters on the second pages*
"It was agreed"
My comments on the points you have in mind are as follows

(b)     This refers to the existing gate between the new 2m wide
        gap formed by the radial fence which will be used for
        police access only.   You will notice from the wording
        of David's minute that I persuaded them that steps could
    A                                                                    2   .
i




              be used.   I have interpreted    this as being from
              the inside only which means that we will not lose
              any of your advertising space.   We have added the
              provision of some timber steps on the inside to
              the work being carried by Gleeson.


        (c>   The other radial fence forming the small visitors
              pen has left a length of terrace without a direct
              access on to the pitch. There is of course a gate
              at the top of the terrace connecting into the next
              pen and we had hoped that the police would accept
              that as an adequate means of exit in emergency.
              However at the meeting they made the point very
              strongly that If someone had to be got out of the pen
              which has no gate or if there was misbehaviour the
              police would only be able to get in via the neighbouring
              pen, passing up the terrace through the gate at the
              back and then down again in the isolated pen.     They
              considered this unacceptable.    I think that this
              particular item can be paid for out of the contingency
              sum and suggest that it be added to Gleeson's work.


        (d)   You will recall that when you and I went round with
              Superintendent John Freeman he pointed out that the
              advertising hoardings on the parapet of the seating
              area of the West stand were simply hooked over the
              parapet wall and some of the hooks had been bent.
              We agreed that a fixing would be provided. He had
              apparently reported this to David Vaughan so the
              matter *as raised again. It is clearly a good point
              because any hooligans in the seated area could easily
              drop an advertising board on to people below.    I have
              in mind that the hoardings can be fixed by a runner
              of timber and again subject to your approval, this
              can be carried out as part of the present works.
(e)   This is a very minor matter which can be dealt with
      next year.


(f)   You will probably know that the bases of the steel columns
      behind the West stand have bean queried year by year
      by Don Sheriff who has requested ^hat exaavations be
      carried out to ensure bhat the steel is not rusting
      below ground level.    By chance Gleesons had exposed
      one of the columns and I was interested to see that it has
      not suffered badly.   However I have pointed out that the
      columns do notcarry any load.    They form part of the
      previous structure and were chopped down to that level
      when the new concrete stand was built for the World
      Cup.   They merely form a frame within which the brick
      wall is built.   There is therefore no cause for concern.
      At the next meeting in February I will try to get this
      item deleted from the list.



      Quite a number of items have now been added at Police
request.   In addition there is the cost of the new gas main
and also unexpected costs in connection with the electricity
supply to the new refreshment area in the North West corner.
I am asking John Strange to check on all these items to see
whether they can be accommodated within the contingency sum
which we Included in Gleesons contract. I am on holiday but
John will be in -touch early next week.


                       Yours sincerely,

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the " s u m m e r " inspection of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2.    Ground Inspection.

A.    Leppings Lane End

The progress of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working Party's meeting held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive's letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of 1st August.

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
checking and comment.

On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the new
dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
^Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by  "
45 chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

:The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
 aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall
 and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan submitted).

As regards the single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted
the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the
dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
concrete slabs.  It was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick walls
in the Male Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be completely
finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
be left on site.

The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the Police.
This gate would still be available for the use ofspectators in an
emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide gap.
However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required.   It
was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
Central Terrace Pen.

As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
both the Stand and at the Access level.

IT WAS AGREED

(a)   that the condition of the internal walls in the new male and   female
toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

      that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
extended or have steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. wide gap
formed by the new radial fence;

      that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be provided from
the new South Central Terrace Pen;

<d>   that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
area should be securely fixed to the concrete wall;

      that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
upper seated stand area should receive attention as a matter of maintenance;

(f^   that the   corrosion of the steel columns at the rear of the Stand
snould receive   attention on a maintenance basis.

      South Stand

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reported that the condition of the upper
concrete outer portion of the exterior wall of the Stand had been
investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.

It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non-slip
surface was to commence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
start of the season).
IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should largely overcome the flammability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure that the
wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
laying of the metal sheeting.

C.    Spion Kop

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details of the Club's
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part of that scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed.  Its present condition
remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.

In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which could
occur when large crowds were present.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new gate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
arrangement to assist access and egress.

D.   North Stand

The temporary storage facilities created by the erection of a timber wall
(in front of the Ladies' Changing Facilities in the Sports Hall) were
inspected.

IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.

E.   Closed Circuit Television Facilities

The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and outside
the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed Closed Circuit
Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED:-

( a t h a t a 2| kg. CO 2 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
Police Control Box and the Disc Jockey Box;

(b^^ that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should be made
secure.

    For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


    Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                          Safety of Sports Grounds Act
                        Inspectionof Hillsborough Stadium
                               7 August, 1985
          Thank you for sending me a copy of your notes, which I
    note had been produced on the same day as the meeting.
                                                                   ton
    2A Which records that the Building Authority representatives
    considered that the standard of workmanship of the brick wall is
    poor.   This statement should becclarified.   The general
    standard of workmanship of this wall was not questioned, and
    the matter which caused concern to the Authority was that the
    perpends and vertical longitudinal joints of the interior of the
    wall were not being filled from the top        as each course of
    bricks is built. You will recall that I said this is normal
    construction procedure.    I think my statement should have been
    recorded.
          Indeed I would now go so far as to say that what was
    being advocated by the Building Control Authority is in fact
    undesirable.   If the vertical joints are packed with mortar
    as the bricks are being placed, the mortar will set and even
dry out before the next course of bricks is placed.    The
interface of the two lots of mortar will be weak, and it would
fail in tension under overturning forces or in shear due £0
bending about a vertical axis.
      If the vertical joints are left partly open until the
next course of bricks is laid, the mortar laid on the bed
is pushed down into the joint as the brick is tapped down to
level. The amount of mortar pushed down into the joint is
unlikely to fill it completely, but it will be sufficient
to obtain a good key, and without a plane of weakness on the bed
of the brickwork.   Some mortar also extrudes upwards thus
filling the lower part of the vertical joint of the latest
brick to be laid, although the amount forced upwards is likely
to be less than that forced downwards.
      It would beaappreciated if my views on this matter could
be reflected in some way, either by an addendum to the Note or
by an addition to the nexfl Note in February 1986.
       One other small point needs clarificaiton.     In the
section headed Spion Kop, the word 'removed' in the fourth line
should perhaps read 'remodelled'.   There will still be an exit
at that point.


                             Yours   sincerely,

             Informal meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield on 5th June 1985

             PRESENT:   S. Allcock (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
                        B. Mincher (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

                        D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

             1.      Purpose of Meeting.

             The purpose of the meeting was to inspect the mock-up of the proposed steel
             covering to the wooden decking to  the Upper South Stand seated area, and to
             consider the future of the timbered under-roof cladding to the asbestos roof
             of the Stand.

             2._____ Proposed Steel Covering to the Wooden De cking.

             To achieve fire resistance of the   wooden decking (which sat on concrete
             decking ), the Club were considering covering it with steel sheeting.

             The Fire Service felt that whilst this would be a short-term answer to fire
             resistance, there would be a slipping hazard if the steel sheets were not
             surfaced in some way and a tripping hazard where the sheets were joined and,
             as time passed, by the sheets lifting at the edges.   In time, the sheets
             would also wear, and queried what form of maintenance would be suitable.
             The mock-up also had a small gap where the sheets were joined which would
             enable small items to pass through and fall into the small void between the
             wooden and concrete deckings.  Whilst the Building Authority felt that there
             were no objections to the proposal from a structural point of view, they
             supported the points raised by the Fire Service.   (NOTE - subsequent to the
             meeting, Mr. Sheriff 'phoned to say that to avoid deterioration of the
             woodwork, it would be necessary to allow some form of ventilation if it were
             to be covered by the steelwork, and that he had mentioned this to John
             Strange; he would also make the point to Steve Al lock).

             IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, there was no objection
             in principle to the Club's proposal to encase the wooden decking of the
             upper South Stand seated area with steel sheeting:-

        ^    (i)     the horizontal areas of the sheets to be sprayed or covered with a
              # £    non-slip substance,
1        ^    **
             (ii)     the lateral ends of the sheets to be securely fastened to prevent
        J            lifting;

             (iii)   the vertical ends of    the sheets tohave    an overlay toprevent articles
                     passing through into    the small voids between    thewooden and concrete
        J            deckings;

             (iv)    some form of ventilation to be provided to overcome deterioration
      KIP            of the encased woodwork;
     Xia
             (v)     inspection of the steel sheeting to take place after every match and
                     maintenance carried out as necessary.

3.     South Stand Roof.

The under-roof area of the asbestos roof of the Stand consisted of wooden
cladding which had been treated with creosote or similar at some time in the
past.  The Club had long-term proposals to replace and extend the roof to
cover both the upper and lower seated areas.  However, they were actively
considering replacing the roof as existing by metal sheeting.

The Fire Service considered that recent events had illustrated the necessity
of some form of action on timbered roofs, even though originally it had
been accepted on certification.  Encasement of the wooden decking to the
upper seated area would reduce the fire risk, but it was considered that
action would still be necessary.

The Building Authority pointed out that the proposal would be acceptable
from a structural point of view and would considerably reduce the loading on
the roof.  Other factors, such as reverse loading in wind conditions, would
also have to be taken into account.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club's proposals to replace the existing roof with
steel sheeting were acceptable in principle.

4._____ Time      Scale.

It was     felt   that so long as the    wooden decking was encased      with steel
sheeting   on     the lines agreed by    the start     of    the season in     mid-August, work
on the     roof   could be on-going with a view to completion shortly after the
start of    the   season.

                  Sheffield WBdnesday Football Club
                           Ground Safety
      I promised to let you know the outcome of discussions
between the Club and the County Fire Service regarding the
timber in the south stand. It has been decided that the
whole of the timber decfc, both the treads and the risers,
will be covered with steel sheeting.    A small angle will be
placed at the bottom of each step behind the sheets so that
no paper or cigarette ends can penetrate the crack.   The
timber steps will therefore be completely covered on the
underside by the reinforced concrete sloping deck and by
steel plate on the top side.   There will be no way in which
a fire can be started and even if there were some sabotage
such as lifting an area of the sheel sheet, air will     be
completely excluded so that a fire will not be able to spread.
The steel sheets are to be very wellfixed down and   will
alio have a non-slip surface.
      The County Chief Fire Officer has taken a personal
interest and visited the stand in ray company recently.
      The work is now proceeding and we anticipate having all
the seats back in place a few days before the opening game
against Chelsea.
                                                   Yours sincerely

     Dear Sir,

     Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

     I thank you for your letter dated 12th June.

     Taking into account all the factors which you mention (particularly the
     steel sheeting of the wooden decking of the upper seated area by the
     start of the forthcoming season), the existing roof of the South Stand
     will be regarded as acceptable on a temporary basis until the end of
     the 1985/86 season. At that time, either a new roof must be constructed
     or the under-roof timber cladding of the existing roof replaced by the
     start of the 1986/87 season.

     Details and plans of the work will, of course, be required in the usual
     way.

     Yours faithfully.

For the attention of inspector C. Calvert.

Dear Mr. Calvert,

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
      Further to our telephone conversation on 24 June we have
pleasure in enclosing two copies of our drawing 6705/8 showing
the proposed arrangement of the turnstiles and fences and gates
at the rear of the West stand.
      It is also proposed, but not shown on the drawing to
install a single barrier rail, just above head height down
the centre of the seated area and also a fence approximately
2m away from the existing radial fence.on the right hand side
of the terrace (looking from the pitch),to separate standing
spectators. The fence will be just like the ones ailready installed
      Although Dr, Eastwood has discussed the proposals in
outline with Chief Inspector Moseley we would also appreciate
receiving your comments.
      Perhaps the work can be completed ready for the start
of the season if the scheme meets with your approval.

                               Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick,
                 Ground Safety Work, 1985
          Meeting with Chief Superintendent Moseley
                 and Councillor
    As requested X met the police representatives on Thursday,
13 June.   I had some difficulty in persuading Mr. Moseley
that it was not appropriate to have a high segregating barrier
down the middle of the seating area in the West stand.   I think
he finally accepted that it was not necessary to do any more
than have a relatively low level rail which would be sufficient
to make the two lots of spectators go to the appropriate
refreshment bars and toilets and also make their way out through
the correct route.
    Superintendent Moseley was very concerned about the
segregation of the two lots of spectators on the West 'fc rrace
on those occasions when the centre of the terrace will be filled
by visitors.   He said that on the occasion of the Liverpool
match he had had to station policemen in pairs down the full
length of the dividing fence and this had been a very uncomfortable
situation for the officers.   Not leas# of his difficulties was
that it was not easy for the officers to get in and out of that
particular area if the ground was packed with spectators.
He felt that a higher fence than the present one or a double
fence was necessary.    I suggested that we should have a double
fence with a gap between so as to keep the spectators apart
and to provide a space in which his officers could stand.
Fewer policemen would be needed if the spectators had a
gap between them.      It so happens that right alongside the
existing fence there is a gate on to the pitch and if the
second fence were placed on the other side of the gate, it
will provide an easy access gangway for the police and they
will be able to move in and out of the gap depending on the
situation.   Mr. Moseley was clearly very pleased by this
suggestion and subject to your approval, we are including
the work in the contract for segregating the spectators at
Leppings Lane end.
    I should point out that it will mean losing about a metre
of advertising space because the hoardings carry straight on
past that partigular gate at present.   There will have to be
a gap in the hoardingsto enable the police to get in and out and
of course, to evacuate the crowd in emergency.


                        Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick,

      Thank you for your letter of 10 JUne telling us of
the concern of the Sports Turf Research Institute about the
effect of the scaffolding on their operations.
      I do not thin]: there will be any cause for concern
because we have suggested to the painting contractors that
they sling their working platforms from the bottom flange
of the main cantilevers of the roof. There will thus
be no scaffolding on the underside of the roof. There will
probably be scaffolding behind the stand and also possibly
on top.

      Dear                             ,,.d          11JUNI985

      I have today received a report from the Sports Turf Research
      Institute together with a covering letter referring to the
      work that is necessary on the ground during the close season.

      However, reference is made to aspects relating to the re­
      painting of the North Stand and set out below please find
      the copy of the relevant note:-

             I understand a painting contract for the underside of the
             North Stand roof is contemplated this summer. Since this
             will involve scaffolding set into the edge of the pitch
             and on the surrounding track which would seriously inter­
             fere with slit drainage operations, I recommend the painting
             work be deferred until slit drainage has been completed.

      I would be obliged of your observations on this matter.

      Yours sincerely,



      R.H. @fiester,

For the attention of Mr. D. E. Vaughan


Dear Sir,

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

      Thank you for Mr. Vaughan's note of the informal meeting
on 6 June.
      The comments of the Fire Services with regard to steel
covering of the wooden decking are noted.
      First I shall explain that the 2mm thick sheeting is
not expected to wear significantly for very many years. There
will be some slight loss of metal#due to rusting, but corra-ston
rates for steel under cover are   now very low in Sheffield due
to the drop in sulphur in the atmosphere   and we do not expect
serious loss due to rusting for   at least 10 years.
      Our responses to the five   comments near the footof the
first page are as follows
        (i) It is agreed that the horizontal surfaces of
             the steel sheets need a treatment to prevent
             islipping. We shall be experimenting with
             epoxy and carborundum on a small area which the
             Fire Service will be invited to inspect.       If
             this is successful, the whole area will be
        treated before the start of the new season.

 (ii)   The edges of the sheets are being screwed
        at 75mm centres# and we think this will
        prevent lifting.

(iii>   We are looking into the possibility of providing
        a quarter-round beading to close any small gap
        at the junction of the rise and the tread.

 (iv)   It is not considered appropriate to ventilate
        beneath the timber decking. The prevention of
        the spread of fire is the paramount requirement,
        and free ventilation under the deck would create
        a hazard.   There is no significant danger of the
        timber rotting as there is no source of water to
        start an attack of either wet rot or dry rot.
        The average relative humidity of the air under
        the steps will be about the same as that of the
        free air (unlike a cellar or beneath a house floor
        where moisture is available from the ground). The
        moisture content of the air beneath the timber will
        vary less from night to day, and with the weather
        than the free air, and will be at 100% relative
        humidity less often, we shall however be observing
        whether in strong wind it is possible for light
        rain to drift in below the cantilever of the roof.
        The overhang is very good, but if rain can enter
        the floor it will be necessary to do some opening
        up from time to time to check that all is well.

  (v)   It is not expected that it will be necessary to
        check the steel sheeting after every match. We
        believe the fixings we are specifying will perform
        well. Experience will show how much inspection is
        necessary, but we think that it will be found that
        perhaps twice per year will be adequate.
      The club has now instructed us to accept a tender for the
installation of the steei sheeting on the deck, and we
anticipate that work will be finished by mid-August.
      With regard to the timber in the roof the Club has
received our report and there is considerable concern at the
extent to which the existing steel trusses are overstressed.
We suspect that the steelwork was originally designed for only
10 lb/sq.ft. snow load , but even under that load one or two
members in each truss would be overstressed. It is likely that
the present day requirement of the Code of 15 lb/sq.ft. snow load
will be reduced for this part of Sheffield in the next few years,
but not enough to entirely remove overstressing. The trusses
are old and there has been some loss of metal due to rusting over
the 65 years or so since the stand was built. Mr. Sheriff has
expressed concern over the fact that some of the trusses lean
quite markedly. We have pointed out to the Club that the
proposed changes to the roof are such that a Building Regulations
approval is probably required, and the local authority will need
to be somewhat indulgent if it is to grant such an approval.
We have also asked the Club to indemnify us against claims
in the event that the roof should fail in snow or wind.
      In the face of this situation the Club requires a little
more time to consider the matter.   Obviously a decision to spend
a large sum of money on the existing roof, which would still
leave it sub-standard cannot be taken lightly. There is some
feeling that a completely new roof should be provided so
as to remove all possible sources of criticism on safety
grounds. This would also fit in better with long term plans.
      Time was already very tight if the timber was to be
replaced this summer. The full Board will not be able to
consider the situation for some weeks due to holidays. I
therefore request the Licensing Authority to give the Club
time to come to a decision, with a view to constructing the new
roof, or alternatively replacing the timber in the existing
roof, during the period May - August 1986.
      It is anticipated that the decision will be taken within
a matter of weeks. If a completely new roof is to be installed
the planning and Building Regulations approvals will be sought
later this year, and tenders obtained sufficiently early for
work to commence in May 1986.
      This will involve the South stand continiAng to function
with the timber in the roof remaining for the coming season.
But the position will be considerably improved compared with
the past,   it is obviously very unlikely that theeroof could
catch fire once the seated area has been covered with steel
sheets. The timber in the roof is protected from fireworks
or smoke bombs by the asbestos sheets which overlay the timber.
It does not, of course, have the hazard of bituminous felt
covering as at Bradford. The Club hopes that a sympathetic
view can be taken on this particular matter for the coming
season.
      Should your working party or its representatives wish to
see the work on the deck in progress they will be very
welcome to visit at their convenience.

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                   Ground Safety
     Mr. Chester has passed to me a copy of your letter with
suggestions for firepro&flng the South stand.
     What you suggest is perfectly sensible and the idea
of a sprinkler system was one of the things which was considered
in the immediate aftermath of Bradford. I should, of course,
point out that the South stand at Hillsborough is completely
different from that of Bradford in that the timber steps
sit on a sloping concrete deck.   You will no doubt have seen
the concrete construction when making your way into the seated
areas.   There are in fact two concrete decks, the flat one
which houses the toilets and refreshment areas at first floor
level plus the sloping one above immediately beneath the seats.
Each of these concrete decks provides one hour fire protection
so that a fire down below causes   very   little hazard indeed to
the people seated in the stand.
     Although there is timber boarding in the roof, it is covered
by non-combustible corrugated sheeting. The roof at Bradford was
unfortunately covered with several layers of bituminous felt.
It was this felt which caused the fire to spread so rapidly. It
was also a hazard in that a firework or smoke bomb landing on the
roof can cause a fire.   The corrugated sheeting at Hillsborough
would prevent this.
     You may take it that the Club is very actively considering
safety measures    collaborating with the County Sire Service
and any steps which are considered necessary will be carried
out promptly.
     May I close by congratulating you on a very clear letter
setting out what is one very sensible way to deal with the
problem at Hillsborough.    When the Club has reached agreement
with the County Fire Officer, I will write to you again saying
what is proposed.


                             Yours sincerely,
                                 Sheffield

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


 Dear Sirs,
               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
               Painting of Woodwork beneath South Stand
      Following our telephone conversation on Friday, 17 May,
 I have looked into the paint treatment of the timber at
 first floor level beneath the upper tiers of seats.      This is
 the area through which the general public have to pass when
 leaving the stand and making for the main staircases.
      Roundabout 1980 a number of works took place in the
 refreshment areas and the players dining room under our control.
 All the new woodwork and the existing partitions in this area
 were painted using Nullifire intumescent paint (attached is
 a photo-copy of the Bill of Quantities).   You may possibly
 remember that during progress of the works, Mr.
 paid a site visit and found the painters applying paint from
 a can labelled with some other manufacturers name.    However, on
 checking, it was established that the Nullifire had been delivered
 in 5 litre drums and had been poured into smaller cans of another
 manufacturer by the painters.
      Not all the woodwork was treated at that time. However we
 did check that all woodwork in that area was either intumescent
or of class 0 from the point of view of flame spread,
far as we know, that is still the position.


                       Yours faithfully,
                                                       W E /K H /^ g n

Dear Dick,
               Painted Woodwork beneath South Stand
     You probably gathered that whilst I was speaking to
David Vaughan last Friday afternoon he queried the resistance
to fire of the paintwork on the landing beneath the south
stand. Attached is a photo-copy of a letter which I have
written reassuring him.
     It is important that any painting of woodwork which
is carried out in connection with the new toilets should have
a class 0 rating with regard to spread of flames,     if you
need any help on this matter, please get in touch with John
Strange.-


                           Yours sincerely,
                                                                                   <ao^

 Dear Sirs
 Following the recent disaster at Bradford I would like to suggest a way
    solving the difficult need to "fence in " the supporters, whilst
^□.lowing them the only way out in two minutes ie: by direct access to the
 pitch.
 My company specializes in electro-mechanical products, mostly at present
 in the marine trade, ye will shortly be finishing an adaption of one of
 our products to suit your needs.
 The product takes the form of an electro-mechanical bolt for putting on
 gates mounted in the wire fence.
 The design has a rotating bolt some what in the design of car doors - if
 people stand or climb on the fence/gate and deform it, this will not
 cause the bolt to jam up. The bolt on the lock can be designed to take
 a side load of from 200 - 2000 pounds without giving way (crowd pressing
 against it).
 The bolt is secured in place by a 24 volt operated solenoid clutch. On
 release of the 24 volt supply (or power failure) the bolt will rotate
 under slight pressure allox^ing the gate to open outwards on to the pitch.
 A useful addition will be the supply of "key sockets" mounted on the
4g.tch side so that police could unlock and go into any gate they need to.
Crocked or unlocked signals can be incorporated for remote transmission
 to a control post.
 Because I deal in marine products I guarantee that our product will be
 both vandal and weatherproof and with the power supply in armoured
 conduit on the pitch side, there will be no way it can be tampered with.
 (24 volts is a 'safe' voltage anyway).
 The price of this product is not yet available and will depend to a
 certain extent upon demand.
 Please let me know soonest if this is of interest to yourselves and
 either write or telephone me for further information.

Dear pick/..-'
                •■ ■ ■ Perimeter Fencing
        As requested we have prepared a possible scheme for a
perimeter fence along the front of the uncovered seats of the
South stand, and also the North stand.
        Enclosed are two prints of our drawing 6517/2 showing
a cross-section through each fence.
        We propose that a 150 x 75 mesh is used with the
150am dimension mounted vertically. This has the advantage
of not obscuring the view as much as the 50 x 50 mesh used in
front of Spion Kop and still does ntot offer a good foothold for
anyone wishing to climb the fence.
        We have shown a crank at the top as you asked. This
will make the fence more difficult to climb over but youvrould
also consider a vertical fence of the same height, as this would
mean that the steel angle at the crank could be omitted which
would be one less visual obstruction.
        Including professional fees we estimate that the cost
of the two fences, plus a return barrier along the east end
gable w&ll of the North stand is likely to be approximately
£17,200 plus V.A.T. If access gates are required in the fencing
we estimate that these would cost about £300 each. The police
                                                                     2

        may ask for two each end which would bring the total up to
        about £19,500.

                        Dear

                        Many thanks for reply dated 27th March and observations contained
                        therein.

                        I must admit I share the same view as yourself regarding the event
                        of any future problem, now that the matter has been drawn to our
                        attention.

                        It is my belief that this work, at an obviously favourable tender
                        price, should be processed forthwith.

                       Please advise if this work is within the limits of our own
                       maintenance staff or necessitates outside contractors. In
                       the event of the latter please arrange to attain the relevant
                       estimates. Completion of the said works could, I would imagine,
                       be scheduled between matches.

                       Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick*
     Thank you for sending us a copy of the letter form Mr.
         concerning the East end wall of the North stand.
We have taken measurements and you will see from the attached
drawing 6517/1 that Mr.          is quite correct about the wall
being quite low.    Indeed, at the front edge of the step it
is only 26" high.   When someone stands up from his seat, he
will be fairly close to the front edge.   The maximum distance
which anyone could fall is only about 20ft. rather than the 3Gft.
stated by Mr.          but this is nevertheless sufficiently high
to cause injury or even death.
     The guidance given in the Green Code is that there should
be a hand-rail or other barrier with preferred height of 1.1m
<3*7W) but with a minimum height of 1.02m (314" approximately) .
     There is obviously a small element of danger and the
situation Will be made worse if someone should suffer from
vertigo and finds himself allocated a seat right at the end.
Now that the matter has been pointed out to the Club, there would
 be a most serious situation if ever someone were injured. It
will be possible to fix a hand-rail to the top of the concrete
balustrade approximately 300mm above it without too much expense.
Perhaps you will consider whether this should be included in the
next programme of minor works.   It SEEE1 of course have to be
done at both ends of the ground.   I will look at the West
end of the North stand next time I visit the ground to see
whether a hand-rail is needed at that end also.   The height
of the drop is certainly much less because of the North West
corner terracing.

Dear Sirs,

     As a loyal supporter of Sheffield Wednesday, I find it
difficult to be critical of your club in anyway. However,
in the interest of safety I must tell you how concerned I
have become about one section of your otherwise magnificent
ground.

       I recently attended a game against Coventry City and was
allocated a seat at the very end of the North Stand at the
K O p End.  I was horrified to find that the only protection
against falling some 30ft onto a concrete roadway between the
stand and the K O p was a wall about 30" high.

     During the game I was forever watching young children
standing on their seats immediately adjacent to this immense
drop. Had these children been only slightly pushed, I dread
to think of the consequences.

     Would you please look into this urgent situation with a
view to errecting some kind of safety barrier.

                            Yours faithfully,
                                                                      FILE

Dear Dick,
             Batteries for Emergency Lighting System
      Thank you for your letter of 5 March with the photo-copy
of the report and quotation from Chloride Security Systems.
      We designed the extensions to the emergency lighting
system which had to be installed at the time the ground received
its first safety certificate and at that time had to assess the
appropriateness of the batteries.   We carried out tests with the
Fire Brigade in attendance on a very dark night to ensure that
the lighting intensity did not fall off within half an hour
of the emergency lights coming into operation.   The batteries
performed better than expected and there was no doubt at all
at that time that they were adequate.   We reported that in view
of their age it was to be expected that within five years or
so, the batteries would be so near to the end of their useful
life that they would have to be either replaced or an alternative
source of power provided.
      It now appears that the batteries are still performing
well and .as only two cells {including the present one) have had
to be replaced in five years, I see* no reason to consider
replacing the system for the time being.
      When the batteries do eventually reach the end of
their lives, we shall almost certainly be recommending that
they be replaced by a diesel generator set.   You may recall
that we installed a diesel set at Bramall Lane and the cost
was very much below the cost of a battery set.   Maintenance
costs are also likely to Le lower over the years with a diesel
generator. The diesel engine will be run so infrequently
that it should virtually never wear out.
      When the time comes to install the diesel set, you
might consider having an oversized generator to cope with
any other nmergency load, either to keep your offices supplied
during a power cut or a strike or even to provide power for
floodlighting.   We can discuss the matter again when the
batteries finally become uneconomic to maintain.


                           Yours sincerely,
ClflpRIDE,                                                                       V IS IT                                                                     CERT NC

    Dear Sirs,

    RE:   AGREEMENT 20907/0001

    Please find attached your battery inspection report for Sheffield
    Wednesday Football Club.

    Our engineer has reported that cell number 21 is faulty and requires
    replacement of which I attach a quotation for its replacement.

    However, I must point out that our engineer has also reported that
    your charging/control gear is of an obsolete design for which replacements
    can no longer be obtained and that your battery is now over 30 years
    old and future life is limited. I have therefore forwarded a copy
    of this report to our Sales Office who will contact you shortly.

    Yours faithfully,
    For and on behalf of,
    CHLORIDE SECURITY SYSTEMS.

Cubicle                           Fabricated from 1 6m m sheet steel in a range of standard sizes. Tne
                                  cubicles are finished with acid and alkaline resistant grey textured coating
                                  to BS 318C: Shade 631. Protection is provided to IP22 of BS 5420


Charger                           Solid state constant Voltage type incorporating a self-protecting current
                                  limiting feature for protection against low battery volts and short circuit
                                  Reverse battery protection is also included.
                                  Standard systems chargers are designed to fully recharge the battery
                                  within 24 hours following a rated discharge.
                                  C harger output voltage is controlled to a tolerance of ±2% irrespective of
                                  AC input variations of ±10% and load requirem ents of 0% to 100%.
                                  Constant voltage charging m inim ises the need for topping up the battery.
                                  M axim um charger ripple of 2% RMS of the DC nom inal voltage helps to
                                  protect the battery plates.


Contactors                        Adequately rated for changeover of m axim um load output and designed
                                  fo r a starting surge of up to ten tim es full load current to cater for tungsten
                                  or 10W voltage fluorescent loads. The control coil supply is interrupted by
                                  a connection link to facilitate the use of rem ote sub-circuit or phase
                                  m onitors o r test switch. In order to meet certain legislative requirem ents
                                  or the need for frequent testing, alternative contactors to com ply with BS
                                  764 can be supplied.


M aintained Circuits             The AC m aintained output provided by an isolation transform er is
                                 engineered to enable a zero to full load regulation of better than 5%.
                                 Input to the transform er is interrupted by a connection link to enable
                                 night-w atchm an switching of the maintained lighting w ithout affecting the
                                 non-m aintained function of the system.
                                 Input tappings are provided to optim ise output according to local
                                 supplies.


Fusing                            HRC fuses protect the AC supply to the charger, contactor coil and
                                  m aintained transformer.
                                  HRC cartridge DC output fuses are m atched to load requirements.

               Dear

                Thank you for your letter dated 11th February regarding the various
                points raised by the Working Party at their recent ground inspection
                and I would like to comment as follows

                1.    I am in agreement with your suggestion to provide safety mesh
                      for the bridge between the South Stand and the Restaurant Kitchen
                      when strengthening work to the crush barriers is carried out
                      during the summer.
               2.     Regarding the spalled columns at the rear of the South Stand -
                      you have my approval to have a small scaffold tower erected
                      to about half way up the worst cracked column and open it up
                      at two or three places to investigate properly the current
                      state of the reinforcement.
               3.     I agree with your proposal to investigate the steel columns
                      at the rear of the West Stand for any signs of rust and for
                      John Strange to liaise with our ground staff to undertake the
                      opening up work at the time when some of the crush barriers
                      are being tested in June or July.
               A.     I confirm that it will be in order for our staff to carry out
                      some pointing work to the perimeter wall alongside Penistone
                      Road to detailed specifications by John Strange and should
                      the work prove to be excessive for our own staff, I would
                      consider calling in outside contractors.

               Yours sincerely,



                                                                                       -r -   -   „

Dear Dick,
      Thank you for your letter of 6 February regarding the
points raised in the minutes of the Working Party.     Our
comments on these various matters are as follows


1.    Bridge Between South Stand and the Restaurant Kitchen
             Bearing in mind that they saw that the bridge is
      sometimes used in frosty weather, it is difficult to
      refuse point blank to provide safety mesh.     It will not
      be too expensive an exercise provided that the job is
      saved up until there is other work of a similar nature
      to be carried out.    We find most years that one or two
      of the crush barriers are shown to need some strengthening
      during the annual testing programme.     W6 will therefore
      wait until the crush barriers have been tested in July
      before taking action with regard to the bridge across
      to the kitchen.


2.    Spallftd Columns at the Rear of the Stand
             You will recall that we found very serious spalling
      of the concrete and heavy rusting of the reinforcement
when walls were demolished to make way for the new
social facilities last summer.      It is quite likely
that similar damage is occurring higher up the
building but I think it will not be so far advanced.
The columns which were strengthened last summer
had suffered in part due to rising damp from the ground.
This particular source of water will be less dominant
higher up the building.      Also the load on the columns
reduces at higher level so that the situation is less
Ciritical.   Another favourable factor is that at
high level there are infilling panels of brickwork
which will help carry the downward load.
     Although there are good reasons to believe that
the condition of the upper part of the columns is
not yet becoming critical/ it should be kept in mind
that if the steel is allowed to deteriorate too far
we could eventually have a situation where a repair
would be very much more expensive.       Indeed, if
neglected for too long the stage could be reached
Where the life of the     etand is endangered.    I suggest
thetefore that during the close season we should have
a small scaffold tower erected to about half way up the
worst cracked column and open it up at two or three
places to investigate properly the current state of
the reinforcement.      Depending on the outcome it m a y b e
possible to say that no work is necessary for a few years
On the other hand, if the situation is becoming serious
a programme of work can be set in hand, if necessary
phasing it over two or three years.
     Subject to your approval we will make arrangements
for the inspection in May/June.


cracked Brickwork at Rear of South Stand
     I do not regard this particular cracking as having
any structural significance.     I think it is entirely
associated with shrinkage and expansion of the
brickwork arising from changes of temperature
and dampness.      The crack certainly does not seem
to have become worse over the last three or four
years.      I suggest that we continue to look at the
crack each year but no other action is needed
in the meantime.


Rusting of Steel Columns at Rear of West Stand
        When steelwork is enclosed in a brick wall in
close contact with the bricks, damp which is praeent
within the brickwork can cause serious rusting to
develop in the steel with the passage of time.In
some circumstances a highly dangerous situation
can develop (we are dealing with just such a situation
at Garrards, the royal jewellers, in Regent Street
at the present time).      The infilling brickwork at the
back of the west stand will have considerable load
carrying capacity even if the steel columns rust
away.      The most dangerous situation could arise
if the bottom brickwork is on a shallow Inadequate
foundation and the column has completely rusted away
below ground level.      We have seen this happen on
a couple of occasions in other buildings.
        As part of the summer maintenance programme, one
of the column bases could be opened up by digging
a small sized hole along*Ide it.      In addition two
or three bricks could be taken out of the wall alongside
the column so as to see the state of the steel inside
the wall.      This opening up work could possibly be
undertaken by your own staff and we would inspect the
steel.     I will ask John Strange to liaise with your
ground staff at the time when the one fifth of the
crush barriers are being tested in June or July.
Perimeter Wall Alongside Penistone Road
     This particular wall would not pass the Building
Regulations if the Working Party insisted on calculations
being done.      It does not have sufficient strength to
resist the design wind pressure which is applicable in
Sheffield.    However I believe that the wall is so
sheltered by the bank of Spion Kop that the risk of it
blowing outwards into Penistone Road is sufficiently
negligible to be accepted.      If the wind should be blowing
from the east the wall is much less sheltered and could
conceivably blow over in an extreme gale but the wind
would be of such a force, at least 80 m.p.h.   j&r   that
there would be no chance of a football game being in
progress and hence there would be no risk of spectators
inside the ground.      1 therefore think the wall does not
need major strengthening but it is reasonable to keep
it in good repair and thus avoid further pressure from
the Working Party.     Again you may consider it reasonable
to let your own staff carry out the pointing work
although it will need care if the job is to look good
on completion.       If you agree   that your own staff
can carry out the work, John Strange will give them a
detailed specification in May so that they can carry
out the work when their other duties permit.

    Dear____

    Would you please advise the position regarding the following
    recommendations in the report of the Working Party

    IT WAS AGREED -
                   That the remaining bridge between that South Stand and the
                   Club at the rear of the Stand (now used solely as a means
                   of escape from the Kitchen area) should be infilled with
                   mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly with
                   the appropriate Regulations.
                   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical
                   columns at the rear of the Stand would continue to be
                   monitored and receive attention by the Club as a matter
                   of maintenance.
                   That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete
                   vertical column at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the
                   North-West Terrace) should continue to be monitored.
                   That the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear
                   of the Stand should receive appropriate treatment by the
                   Club.
                   That the Club would carry out the pointing work to the outer
                   perimeter wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

    Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Chester,
                                    Inspection of Floodlight Pilon
         After the visitation by the South Yorkshire Working Party
the weather had cleared up a bit and so I made an inspection
of the pilon immediately behind the South stand.
    I am pleased to say that the steelwork is generally in a
very good condition but there is localised breakdown of the
paintwork mainly near the joints.   I had the tail end of a
film in my camera and the three pictures which I took showing
typical corrosion patterns are attached.                                  Photograph 1 shows
rusting both above and below a bolted splice and also some
rusting between the splice plates.                                 This is just about the
worst of the damage in the tower and although it looks quite
bad, the actual loss of metal is probably still quite
minimal.
    Photograph 2 is a close-up of another joint where:Tther.e:±siw
similar rusting between the splice plates and the main angles.
This kind of damage occurs because it is virtually impossible
to seal the gaps between the edges of the pieces of steel forming
the splice with paint so that the steelwork inside the joint
is almost unprotected.

EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




      Photograph No. 3 shows some rusting developing on top
 of one of the angles forming diagonal bracing.   Although
 this looks rather bad it has to be kept in mind that rust
 expands compared with the original thickness of steel
 from which it has been derived and      I doubt whether rust
 has penetrated more than about half a millimetre.
     The situation is not such that immediate action is required
 except that if you are wishing to maintain the life of
 the towers for the very longest possible period into the
 future, more than a century say, then it is important that
 maintenance be carried     out before the damage has progressed
 too far.       On the other hand, you are only thinking of
 say another 50 years life then I think it likely that it will
 be another three or four years before the amount of deterioration
 makes it imperative that the steelwork be treated to remove
 the localised rusting and then completely repainted.
     Part of the equation is that the cost of painting the
 towers is probably about a quarter of the cost of a new set
 Of   towers.      Thus by extending the time between successive
 paint treatments, the money saved will in due course pay for
 some new pilons possibly of a more modern kind.
     Unless the Club has in mind that it wishes to obtain the
 longest possible life from the present pilons, I suggest that
 there is no need to paint at the present time and that you may
 well find it is three or four more years before work becomes
 essential.


                                 Yours sincerely,
                                             SHEET   3.

Dear Secretary,

     I can now inform you that, at a meeting of Trustees yesterday, it was
decided tomake an additional percentage distribution t6 clubs inrespect
of monies already received on safety expenditure.  This distribution will
be made in two payments in early February and early March and will raise
the percentage of grant aid on safety expenditure to 75?.

     I regret, however, that I am not in a position, at the present moment,
to inform you of exact amounts due to individual clubs. A full letter giving
precise   details will be forwarded with the first payment.

     WITH EFFECT FROM 1ST JANUARY 1985 ALL SAFETY GRANTS WILL BE PAID AT
THE NEW   RATE OF 75* OF APPROVED SAFETY EXPENDITURE.

     I must also inform you of a recent change in the Trustees of F.G.I.T.
Mr.               tias now resigned and Mr.              has been newly appointed
as a Trustee. This change has obviously necessitated a change to the areas
covered by the Trustees and these will now be as follows

                  Scotland - T. Wharton and H.B. Sturgeon
                  Groups One and Two - T. Finney and C. Lloyd
                  Groups Three and Four - P.C. Dodds and R.H.G. Kelly
                  Groups Five and Six - S.W. Taylor and P.D. Smithson


     Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.



                                       Yours sincerely,




                                           Secretary.

1.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the             /             •
Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football
League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

2.    Ground Inspection

      South Stand

The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
had been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

(ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit" sign in the Match
Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

(iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
with the appropriate Regulations.

(iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

B.    West Stand and Terrace

The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
temporary barriers.  This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when the number of
visiting supporters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
obviously desirable to allow home supporters access to a sheltered area.
IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for
permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
usual way.

(ii) That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.

(iii) That the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
Stand should receive appropriate treatment by the Club.

C.   North West Terrace

No comments.

D.    North Stand

IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily combustible, materials
continued to be stored in the timber screened store area under the Stand,
the area would be regarded as acceptable.

E.   Spion Kop

It was noted that the remedial work to the roof of the tunnel exit from
the Kop had stabilised its condition for the time being (pending the
Club's development proposals proceeding'; that the loose coping stores
had been removed from the top of the wall between the Spion Kop and the
South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop should
continue to be monitored.

(ii) That the Club would carry out the pointing work to the outer perimeter
wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

^*   Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons (first mentioned at the
inspection on 29th February, 1984) had yet to be carried out by the Club.

IT WAS AGREED that the visual inspection of the lighting pylons would be
carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

3.___ Public Address System

The Club pointed out that an improved public address system had been installed,
and the Police confirmed that reports received indicated that it was noticeably
better than the previous system.
4.    Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Officer Working Party confirmed that plans for the revised catering
facilities at the rear of the West Stand had been received from the Club's
Architect and had been formally approved.

The Club reported that the scheme for the general up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand) was shortly to be
considered by the Board.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would submit the proposals for improved toilet
and catering facilities for approval in the usual way, subject, of course,
to the Board's decision whether to proceed with the scheme.

Dear Dick,
    As promised in our recent correspondence regarding the work
carried out by George Banks Ltd., I now have pleasure in enclosing
our fee account for all the general ground safety work during
1984.     This Includes the various meetings with the South Yorkshire
C.C. working party, the preparation of tender documents for the
safety work which was required and supervision and certification
of the work carried out by George Banks Ltd.     All of this fee
account should qualify for a grant, I believe.
     Incidentally you may have ntoiced that Banks account contained
an extra of £128.42 for additional work carried out on the posts
and angle struts supporting the folding door adjacent to exits
K and L.      When the steelwork was exposed it was discovered that
they were very badly corroded and more strengthening plates were
needed.      The posts then required encasing to provide additional
protection and the adjacent south stand corner column which Was
spalling had to be made good.
    Also enclosed is our account for the testing and reporting on
the fifth batch of crush barriers which was carried out last June.
This latest batch now completes the five year cycle, and this summer
the barriers at the front half of the Kop are due to be tested.
    Finally, I enclose    aur account for the structural work
on the new reception and club facilities.     YOu will have
gathered that this turned    out to be a much more complicated
exercise than was originally envisaged.     This was because
the Building Control department in the Town Hall insisted on
calculations to establish the loads coming down from the stand
onto the columns and foundations which are incorporated in the
new building.
    This account does not, of course, qualify for a grant.


                         Yours sincerely,
                                                                  FILE

members         of      staff        did       need more            senior        help and            I wa s        able    to a r r a n g e

this.

To    the      b es t    of m y        recollection                 I made        two      decisions              during        this     f i rs t

h ou r    t hat      attempted                resuscitation               should          be    s t o p pe d .       Both       involved

men and         I t h i nk        b ot h w e r e          during         rny f i r st      c h ec k     through           the

R e s u s c i t a t i o n area.                One    involved a middle                        a g e d man,         probably         in his

4 0 * s or 5 0 8 s .            He     had       d ar k     h air     with male            pattern J ^ L d n e s s .               I think

he was         wearing          a d ar k         b l ue     t shirt         or    jersey a ni^hew.y                   certainly            of

rather         squat         b u i l d.        He    had     b ee n      intubated and                w l i / ? ce i v i ng        external

cardiac         massage           and artificial                    ventilation.                 T he      h i s t o r y was       t hat      he

had      not    had a         cardiac            output        s i n ce     leaving            the    ground and            he     had     b ee n

in t he        Department              for       probably           10 m i n u t e s       or    so.         Hi s    pupils        were

fi xe d ,      dilated and                he w a s        deeply         cyanosed.              I felt        that        resuscitation

measures          should          be      ceased and              he was         s en t    thorugh           to     the    Plaster         Room.

The      other       man      I can           remember         little           about.          He    wa s    being        looked after

by       one    of      the     junior           doctors          who     ha d    been attempting                    to    resuscitate

him      for    s om e       time.            It s e e m e d      clear         to me      t hat      as     he     had    h ad    no

cardiac         output          for       a    considerable               period and             h ad      fixed,         dilated

pup il s,       there         wa s     no      c h a nc e    of     his     survival            and     t hat       therefore           the

only      correct            c o ur s e       of a c t i o n      wa s    to     stop      resuscitation measures                          and

concentrate              on t h os e           individuals               wh o    we   f e lt     would        be m o r e        likely        to

benefit         from         those        efforts.             Unfortunately                   I do     not       remember         who     the

Nurses         looking          after          the    first         man were          nor       the     identity           of     the D o c t o r

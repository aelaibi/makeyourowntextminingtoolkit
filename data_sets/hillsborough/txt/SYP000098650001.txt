              RESPONSES BY MR. GLASGOW AND MR. TOULSON
                   TO MR. PAYNE'S OPENING ADDRESS
D.L. SELLERS & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




          MR. PAYNE:  May it please your Lordship.  I did in fact close
              my opening yesterday but my friends have been kind enough
              to say that I may draw your Lordship's attention to a
              document that I forgot to ask your Lordship to look at
              yesterday.

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                   Yes.

g         MR. PAYNE:  It is on the question of causation and it is at the
              back of the Taylor bundle, Appendix 1.

           MR.      JUSTICE JOWITT: Yes, I have it.

           MR.     PAYNE: It relates to the concourse area between the
                  turnstiles A - G and Gate C, and that roughly triangular
                  space between there and the back of the west stand. My
C                 Lord, I   mentioned in the course of opening - and I
                  certainly will not repeat it at any length - that it is our
                  case that the opening of Gate C by itself did not cause the
                  spectators to go into pens 3 and A.   On the question of the
                  causation of those Gate C spectators going into pens 3 and
                  A, there are two causes: First, there was no control
                  system designed to count and record the numbers going into
                  those pens, and that is the fault, on our case, of the Club
D                 and the Engineer.  The second cause is that the Police did
                  not intervene and we recognise that it is open to your
                  Lordship to find that that is the fault of the Police.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  Thank you very much.     Mr. Glasgow, do you
               wish to respond briefly?

           MR. GLASGOW: My Lord, very shortly. What I have done in the
E              hope of keeping it brief, my Lord, is to just prepare you a
                little written note which I have circulated.  My Lord, I
                apologise for the fact that although we sat up until the
                early hours of the morning to type it myself - and with my
                typing speed that is necessary - the Manchester air got to
                the word processor and the whole thing had to be re-done
                this morning, and I am afraid it is not perfect.  However,
 P             I think   it will help and it will at least save your
                Lordship some writing for the note, and perhaps a written
                document at this stage makes it easier for highlighting the
                matters that you may wish to question at certain stages, or
                indeed it also helps you to cross out certain things that
                you do not agree with and want to put out of your mind at
                an early stage.

 G          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                 Yes.

            MR. GLASGOW: My Lord, before we turn to the document itself,
                may I just say that loyal to your Lordship's ruling, I
                think we have tried to keep it very short, because that is
                what you want, and it is not of course any pretence at an
                opening and therefore is not intended to be helpful at all
                along those lines.

Q.L. SELLERS Be Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




A         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    No.

          MR. GLASGOW:    And we are conscious of its shortcomings in that
               respect.   But   when we open the case - and we would like to
               help you at the stage when it is appropriate to do so - we
               would like to     look at some more of the material in the core
               bundle.   My Lord, that is not said by way of complaint
               because, of course, an opening is necessarily selective,
B             but some of the matters which are on your Lordship's mind
               and which you ventilated helpfully with us cannot be taken
               any further until we have looked at a lot more of the
               documentation, particularly that going one way or the other
               to the question of Police knowledge.      As I think your
               Lordship has very much in mind, the question of knowledge
               is highly material on causation because it goes first to
               the question of foreseeability and how likely was it that
C             people were going to act in a particular way if they knew
               or did not know of the potential dangers, and, secondly, it
               goes directly to the question of causation as well, as to
               whether or not somebody can be heard to say "I didn't know
               that there was that danger.      Nobody told me.  I had never
               come across it before." The documents may help us on that.

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    Yes.
D
          MR. GLASGOW:   Before we look very briefly at it, might I just
               be forgiven for mentioning probably the most obvious point
               in the case.   I genuinely hesitate before doing so, because
               I am acutely conscious of the fact that it is on your
               Lordship's mind, but it may not be on everybody's mind.    It
               is said understandably - and well said by my friend, and it
„             is helpful - "I am only here for a contribution and the
               Police are only here for a contribution." We would,
               through your Lordship, ask everybody to bear in mind that
               the important question is, "A contribution to what?" We do
               appear, my Lord, on behalf of the officers and the
               directors of the Football Club.   There has already been a
               public attack, very much publicised, levelled at them at
               the Taylor Inquiry, on the (I think one can say fairly in
p             the light of   Lord Justice Taylor's findings) wholly
               misconceived footing that they were responsible for the
               monitoring in the pens.   That is an attack which was
               launched and maintained on behalf of the Police, and I
               choose my words carefully because many of the police
               officers concerned, as your Lordship knows from the Taylor
               Report, were rather complimentary about the Club.    But the
               attack was maintained notwithstanding the fact that it was
G              almost wholly unsupported by evidence and, as Lord Justice
               Taylor found, contradicted by the overwhelming weight of
               Police evidence.

                       Therefore, perhaps I more than anybody else am
                  sensitive - and I may be over-sensitive and if I am, I
                  apologise - to the question of evidence and what evidence
                  we are going to have this time now that it is a new attack
 H                that I have to defend these men on. My Lord, it is a very
Q.L. SELLERS 8cCo. / W. LLOYO W O O O L A N O




                 serious charge to be responsible for people's deaths,
A               whether it is one man's death or 95, and it is one that is
                 felt very acutely by some of those for whom we appear.

                      The attack has changed.   We are not entitled to
                 complain about that, and I am not making an emotional scene
                 about that.  Of course, wisdom may prevail and the attack
                may change, but I draw your Lordship's attention at the
g               earliest stage that is proper to the fact that the attack
                now is, as we understand it, not that which    is pleaded, not
                 that heralded by any report, and certainly not that that
                has been advanced and maintained before, but quite suddenly
                 the attack is that the Police were indeed responsible for
                monitoring the pens - and that is a direct contradiction of
                what we have had before - but that the system that they
                inherited, to use the most neutral word, was "hopeless" and
q               "dangerous".   Those are the two words that have been used.

                     My Lord, we say nothing more than this  at this stage,
                because it is inappropriate at this stage.   We would just
                ask your Lordship and others to bear in mind that we cannot
                deal with that until we know what evidence is going to be
                called in support of that contention, of the hopelessness
                of the system and of the lack of knowledge that it was
D               dangerous.

                     It is against that background that we simply say - and
                we will repeat - it is unfortunate that the decision has
                been taken that there are no officers who can help, because
                that is the reason why they are not called.

                     Having said that, my Lord, that will probably explain
E              why we confine ourselves very strictly to the headlines
                that may be helpful for your Lordship to bear in mind.
                What we have tried to do in the document is to list your
                Lordship's questions, which we genuinely accept as being
                very helpful - and that is not just said because your
                Lordship is there and we are here - because your Lordship
                succeeds in achieving something which the parties could
                not.  I attempted to explain that inelegantly yesterday.
                It is actually helpful, my Lord. With the greatest of
                respect, judges all the wa^      to the House of Lords
                frequently say "What this case boils down to, after you
                have spent three years litigating it, surely is a simple
                question."   The answer is "Yes, of course it does, by the
                time you have taken yourself through the stages that
                entitle you to make that submission." But the reason why
 q             the parties cannot do it, refine things down, is when you
                sit down to refine the issues - and your Lordship knows
                that a great deal of hard and co-operative work was done to
                refine the issues - they were done in a way which was
                intended loyally to reflect all the points that anybody
                wanted to make, not excluding anything that anybody thought
                was fair to put in.   I do not mean it in any rude sense
                when I say that it would be easy for the judge to look at
                the list of issues and to s a y ---
Q.L. SELLERS & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




^        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  Yes, one comes to it with a fresh eye and
             after a considerable amount of refinement of the issues has
             taken place.

         MR. GLASGOW:   My Lord, having said that, I hope without any
              hint of offence, we do mean it when we say that it is very
              helpful to have it grouped in those three areas, the three
              questions that have to be answered.  What we have tried to
B            do is adopt the suggestions that my learned friend Mr.
              Payne made yesterday of identifying the issues with just a
              one-word headline for ease of reference.

         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    Yes.

         MR. GLASGOW:   My Lord, it may have to be corrected because
              there is a little bit of dispute - using the word in its
C            most polite sense - there is a little disagreement as to
              which head some of the numbers falls under and therefore if
              there are any corrections to be made to that list, what we
              will do is, if we may, have those corrections by the end of
              the day and I will re-type it on a single sheetof paper
              with no other contentious material on it at all and provide
              it to your Lordship as a single sheet without comment.

D        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  It is quite possible, of course, that one
             issue may go to more than one of the heads.

         MR. GLASGOW:  My Lord, of course.  When you have got something
             almost like a Scott schedule by your side, it may be useful
             for you to refer to with a red pen occasionally - "Where
             are we going on this one?"

E        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    Yes.

         MR. GLASGOW:  And as I have said on the second page, the issues
             agreed by the parties are intended to reflect the Pleadings
             but are only helpful in so far as they assist in answering
             those three questions, if they do.

p                     The key - and again it comes from your Lordship rather
                 than from me so I can claim no credit for it - to answering
                 all throe questions is causation. We would ask you to bear
                 that in mind. And it is a misleading waste of time - and I
                 make the allegation against all of us - for the parties to
                 look for matters in respect of which they can criticise one
                 another unless those criticisms relate to matters which can
                 properly be said to have caused death or injury.
G
          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  I am rather inclined to agree about that,
              but I suppose there has to be this slight caveat that
              failure to look at some aspects of safety, though not
              causative, may, though not necessarily, be indicative of
              failure elsewhere.

          MR. GLASGOW:               Yes, my Lord.
H
O.L. SELLERS & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




A        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  But I do not think, on the facts of this
             particular case, one should perhaps place too much reliance
             on that.

         MR. GLASGOW:               No.

         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    Principally causation is the factor.

B         MR. GLASGOW:   Causation is the key, but of course it would be
               wholly wrong to exclude evidence if - and let me take the
               point against myself - the evidence were the that the Club
               had a wholly reckless attitude towards safety generally and
               a mean attitude towards the expenditure of money.

         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    Yes.

C         MR. GLASGOW:   That would justify some of the areas into which
              my friend was tempted to go - I do not say trespass -
              yesterday, but we shall pray in aid very much the findings
               and the accepted findings of Lord Justice Taylor on that,
               because had we not, and had they not been accepted, I am
               afraid we would have burdened your Lordship with the
               accounts, with an explanation from the officers as to how
               the millions were spent, with the explanation which is now
D              accepted by Lord Justice Taylor and I think may have been
               overlooked by my learned friend when reading the documents
               (but I did not interrupt) that the Bradford fire coming
               three days before the famous meeting, the Minute of which
              he read relating to the abandonment of the 1985 scheme,
              your Lordship would need no reminding of the sort of impact
               that that would have on the directors of football clubs
               when attention turned, as Lord Justice Taylor accepted, to
               the flammable stands and the paint that was going to burn;
               and that is the awful thing about hindsight.

                 when somebody comes along and we see on our television screens something
                 like that human beings react to it immediately. It may be unhappy to
                 characterise that straightaway as being evidence of meanness (?) when in
                 fact Lord Justice Taylor went out of his way to draw attention to the fact
       A         that the Bradford fire had quite an impact, so we do not have to go into
                 all those areas. If one were tempted to look at the Club in that light
                 then, bearing in mind the gravity of the charge, which ultimately if
                 properly laid is on the shoulders of personal men and women and we do
                 want to see it against the background of the way in which they in fact
                 behaved.
                      Having said that, myLord, my I just say that the Green Guide and what
       B         I shall condemn as a fine tooth comb exercise of the Green Guide maybe
                 particularly unhelpful. We can look at various examples and it is
                 inappropriate to go into them in any great length. To take an example,
                 any of the paragraphs of the Green Guide which for example dictate the
                 width of gates in the face of Lord Justice Taylor's findings to which we
                 shall draw attention, we would say it really is — not meant as an offensive
                 use of the word — but it is misleading in that it distracts attention from
   «             the Issue to which we are properly directing our minds; to start with
                 whether or not a gate ought to be marginally wider when unhappily the
                 accepted evidence is that those gates were slammed shut repeatedly in the
                 face of escaping people by the officers on whose behalf the allegation is
                 made that they should have been wider. That is the sort of allegation where
                 you have to test rather carefully against the accepted findings of Lord
                 Justice Taylor.
       D              The Club accepts, my Lord, and I hope it is relevant and proper to
                 say it has always accepted as your Lordship knows that from Lord Justice
                 Taylor's report, that criticisms can be made of this ground. It is stating
                 the obvious. There cannot be a single public building or ground in the
                 country where you would not be able to go round and find something that
                 was inappropriate. Indeed we shall see the closeness with which that
                 ground was inspected by the local authority, right down for example to
                 the size of lettering of signs and of course there are matters of criticism
       E         that can be made about the ground. They may reflect upon us. They may
                 reflect upon Dr. Eastwood. They may reflect upon the local authority,
                 but it is going to be our unshakeable submission to your LOrdship that
                 not one of those submissions that has ever been made — and theyhave
                 bounced in and out and they come and go — is relevant to the causation
                 of death or injury in this case.
                       If they are to be made at all they might be made against the background
       F         of the admitted findings of Lord Justice Taylor. It is one of the best
                  stadiums in the country and the money that has been spent on it and the
                  attitude of responsibility to which he paid tribute on behalf of the Club.
                       In the context of the Taylor inquiry, those admissions made through
                  me, were made from the outset, day one. We think that they were properly
                  and helpfully made, because we were conscious of the fact that the declared
                  stated parliamentary purpose of the Taylor inquiry was to discover the cause
       **        and if possible to prevent repetition of the tragedy. It would be singularly
                  unhelpful if people who thought that they had admissions to make or
                  contributions to give towards safety were to give guarded answers because
                  they were looking at their insurance companies or listening to their
                  lawyers.
                      We accepted those criticisms wholeheartedly as to the matters which
                 ought to be improved in the hope that they would be incorporated as they
                 are in the report to go to the safer footballing future of this country.

                  My Lord, they do not sound causatively in an action where the
             allegation is culpable responsibility for death. The object of this
             action is entirely different from that engaged on by Lord Oustice Taylor.
             Again, it is rude to even say it, but your Lordship knows that and has
A           accepted it. I am merely reminding myself of that fact that when your
             Lordship looked at the report on occasions you have said — and respectfully
             rightly said — "I have to remind myself that he was engaged ina different
             exercise". May I just add my pennyworth, the exercise was this different
             in this way as well as looking into different things and finding causation
             for different reasons. Your Lordship is concerned, and it is exclusively
             your province and no-one can trespass either by what they have written in
R           advance or what we may have the audacity to suggest, that causation is for
             you and it is going to be the most important aspect of this case and has
             to be kept very firmly in mind.
                  I am very conscious of it, and particularly conscious of it because
             Lord Oustice Taylor talks about causation and he deliberately — I hope
             that is obvious as one knows of his quality as a Judge -- must have
             deliberately used words like "due to" and not "caused by" and "areas
c           which have to be looked at" rather than the word "causation" which does
             not appear. Even in that very helpful summary of the explanation of the
             build up to the turnstiles up to the opening of Gate C and then the cause
             of injury after Gate C, it is very noticeable the actual language that
             Lord Oustice Taylor uses and why, despite the respect that I have no doubt
             we all have, your Lordship is not frightened of saying "I am going to make
             my own mind up about causation because that is not an exercise that has
             been done for me and if it had been done for me I would not pay any
D           attention to it anyway, because I am the Judge of causation on the
             evidence that I hear or what is agreed."
     MR. OUSTICE OOWITT: I think as a matter of legal principle I am not entitled
          to regard as persuasive Lord Oustice Taylor's conclusions about that,
          except where they are admitted by the parties that some criticism was
          made.
E MR. GLASGOW: My Lord, that is right. It is as your Lordship says it is sauce
       for geese as well as ganders. I never would say Lord Oustice Taylor found
       that this case was overwhelmingly caused by police misbehaviour of varying
       degrees. They are the people who have made this charge. They range
       unhappily from dishonesty on two material counts right through to
       recklessness, but what he finds as the facts going to that, insofar as
       they are unchallenged, we do pray in aid. But his conclusions as to the
       level at which that ought to be put are matters which we wish to address
       your Lordship on at the appropriate time when youhave got some evidence.
                  As I say at the foot that that page my LOrd, the Police have now
             admitted fault and causation, thankfully, although for the first time,
             but it is important to recognise that they do so only derivatively.
            What they say is that any fault that they have is only inherited from
            other people. Somebody else gave them a bad scheme, they did not see
q           its shortcomings and they were not advised about its shortcomings. It
             hopeless, it was dangerous and they did their best. So even now there
             is not acceptance of responsibility for their own mistakes. It is all
             being given something by somebody else which was so defective that they
             ought never to have been required to do it.
                  It is still necessary, my Lord, to examine in our respectful submission
             the degree of fault and its causative potency before you consider the
H           culpable contribution — and I stress the word culpable contribution -- of
             any party. That was why — and again it is not for the sake of sparring

                                                7.

             let alone any question of rudeness among colleagues -- but that is why
            we are so sensitive to the way in which the case is put and the evidence
            that is tendered in support of it, the breakdown of the Issues. When we
            look at an Issue which appears to raise as the pleadings have and as the
A           argument does inthe submission that was opened to your Lordship, solely
            directed, we are told in paragraph 3 of the opening, the only issue is
            the contribution of Dr. Eastwood and the Club.
                  My Lord, no that is not looked at in vacua. It is the culpability
            of the party principally at fault and whether or not in the light of that
            degree of fault and its causative potency any fault that there may have
            been — and I am making no concession as to that causatively -- any fault
®           that there may have been contribute materially to the causation of that
             incident and that is the matter to which we shall direct your Lordship's
            attention, accepting that fault as it lies but questioning closely its
            causative potency.
                  We go on, my Lord, to say that the matters will have a bearing on the
             "negligence". I put it in inverted commas because I am using it now in
            the technical sense involving concepts of foreseeability, duty breach and
^           damage and the concept of foreseeability. Of course, we have got to look
            at the Police behaviour. I know they do not want us to and I entirely
            understand why they do not want those matters raked over again; but one
            has to look, if they raise the question of foreseeability and say without
            calling evidence "We did not know that so and so was going tobe dangerous"
            and the man actually incharge cannot help the Court on that Issue.
D                 We have got to look at the whole history. We have got to go back to
            the 1981 incident which your Lordship knows about that. We have not yet
             looked at it in detail. I make no complaint. We will look in the core
             bundle at what was said and the criticism that was levelled by the police
             at their own officers for failing to open the gates in time. We have got
             to ask without the assistance of a police officer to ask, but we will
             have to ask somebody what was done or what appears from the papers to have
             beendone to make sure that that never happened again, that police officers
E           did not open the gates in time.
                 We will have to look at the 1983 agreement which we now know was
            entered into in relation to stewarding and policing. Unfortunately it
            comes at a very late stage because only as a result of a statement that
            has been served very late — and I make no complaint because these things
            do happen late — but we have had our attention drawn to the evidence that
            was actually given to Mr. Justice Boreham in the Harris case. We shall
F           shallhave to look at that because although Lord Justice Taylor did not
            have it, and it is a great pity he did not have it, we now know and will
            want your Lordship to examine quite closely the evidence that was given
            by the Police when they were seeking to sing a very different song, when
            they were sayihg quite rightly on the complicated way in which they are
            funded, "We want to be paid for what we do to police grounds". By sheer
            irony it happened to be this area where the dispute broke out, although
c           again in the most civilised way with the parties not falling out,but by
            co-operating and referring the matter to the Court with the contentions.
                  Of course, it now appears that the evidence that they gave in respect
            of what they regarded their duties inside the ground tobe maybe markedly
            different from that which they told Lord Justice Taylor. That is a matter
            which he did not hear about. As I say, it is most unfortunate that these
            documents were not disclosed and we shall have to look at them quite
 jj         closely. We will have to look at that 1986 action.

i/v   D.L. SELLERS & CO. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




                        My Lord, finally we will have to bring the matter right up to date
                   because it is a continuing pattern by the Police of negligence right from
                   1981 onwards right up to 1987 and 1988 when for reasons that no explanation
                   to you has been offered and indeed before Lord JusticeTaylor it was factually
      A           denied it had happened, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary that
                   the tunnel had been closed at both the previous games, 1987 and 1988. Yet
                   they stand here today and say that the Club should have warned them. I
                   do not know, they might even say that Dr. Eastwood should have warned them
                   that the tunnel might need closing, and to make that allegation without
                   reference to the evidence that they had done it twice before to us is
                   unfortunate to use the most neutral phrase. It is in the light of that
                   background that we would suggest the answers to your Lordship's questions
      "           will probably be those that we have set out, although it is obviously
                   presumptuous to anticipate the opening until we have finished the evidence.
                   That is what we list.
                        My Lord, we say in answer to your first question as matters stand at
                   the moment and on the evidence presently available, the only material cause
                   of the build up of pressure to a dangerous degree — obviously there is
      p           going to be pressure — was bad policing, bad both in planning and in
                   execution, which has always been our pleaded case as found by Lord Justice
                   Taylor. The details can obviously only be addressed when we have heard
                   such evidence as we are going to hear from the police witness and what he
                   is basing his opinion on, because we are not going to have the facts.
                        The Club remains concerned that no evidence or explanation is to be
                   offered by the officers concerned. I say concerned simply because it may
      D           be difficult to find out what the truth is in fairness to all concerned.
                   That is all. It just makes it very difficult to suddenly be taken by
                   surprise and told we will not have the opportunity of investigating opinions
                   and their validity without knowing what the people who are actually doing
                   the job might have said about it when it is a completely new attack.
                        We believe my Lord that the most serious problem that has to be
                   faced is that the Police were at all material times well aware of the
      E            problems which would inevitably be confronted at Leppings Lane, as I
                   say, none of which have yet been touched upon. Those are the areas where
 #                 we shall be directing your attention and we are conscious of the fact that
                   the police contention in respect of the Leppings Lane end if the ground
                   is presumably the same as was advanced to Lord Justice Taylor, namely
                   that it is unpoliceable which was the word used, and your Lordship bears
                   in mind that that contention even when supported by evidence, because at
                   least we had that grace on that occasion, was firmly rejected by Lord
                   Justice Taylor, but it is now being advanced with evidence.

          you are dealing.

      MR.     J U S T I C E JOWITT: O r ought to know.    I t h i n k one has to a s k wha t

              enquiry, and in the light of that wha t o u g h t they to have
              known.

      MR.     GLASGOW:       Yes.   My Lord, the point I see k to make, and of
              course I accept my friend's correction, is t h a t it just
              highl i g h t s the d i f f i c u l t y of e n q u i r i n g into the v a l i d i t y of
D             o p i ni ons based upo n facts and w h e t h e r or no t s o m e b o d y k n e w
              s o m et hing is a fact w i t h o u t h e a r i n g f r o m the 0ian wh o sai d it,
              and of course I accept my friend's expl a n a t i o n .                 I am
              surprised, but I accept it from him.                        H e says that, for
              example, Mr. Mole cannot help on that m a t t e r as to w h e t h e r or
              not he knew of these matters.                  T here we are.

                        The second is that we say the a n s w e r to the se c o n d
E
              q u e s t i o n is rea l l y so obvious as to be undeniable: the tunnel
              o b v i o u s l y had to be c l o s e d before gate C w a s o p e n e d and the
              s u g g e s t i o n w h i c h has b een advanced, that it w a s a m i s t a k e n
              d e c i s i o n taken, i.e. might raise the a g o n y of the moment, I
              think that is wha t it is, is u n s u p p o r t a b l e , not o nly
              u n s u p p o r t i v e but u n s u p p o r t a b l e and has no p l a c e b e f o r e you r
              L o r d s h i p at all.        I avoid the wor d i m p r o p e r but it re a l l y
              should never be said.                   It just is not s u p p o r t e d and t here is no
              evidence for it.

                        The most significant fact is that the tunnel had b e e n
               cl o s e d in similar circu m s t a n c e s on at l e a s t two p r e v i o u s
               o c casions w h i c h we are able to prove, although, of course, as
               Lord Justice Taylor found, those r e s p o n s i b l e for p o l i c i n g on
               the day appear to be unaw a r e of the fact that t h e i r own
               officers had closed the tunnel previously.

                    The excuse, a gain I choose the word, o f f e r e d to Lord
               Justice Taylor was that the Club was r e s p o n s i b l e for m o n i t o r i n g
               the pens.   That was the excuse and w h a t he found to be an
               excuse.   That is r i g h t l y rejec t e d as being 'unrealistic* is
               Lord Justice T a y lor's word, and that is his finding at

              pa r a g r a p h 285. But the new excuse is that the r e s p o n s i b i l i t y
^             w h i c h the Police had indeed a c c e p t e d to m o n i t o r the pens was a
              hopeless task and all we are e n t i t l e d to say at the m o m e n t is,
              on the evidence p r e s e n t l y available, that s u b m i s s i o n w o u l d
              appear to be equally unrealistic.

                       As to the third matter, my Lord, t here w e r e no other
              factors in our submi s s i o n w h i c h were c u l p a b l e and c a u s a t i v e of
              the tragedy.      Again I return to the e x e r c i s e w h i c h we will have
B             to take your Lordship t h r o u g h in some detail, an d I hope it
              will be helpful.      Taking the fine t ooth comb to the G r e e n G uide
              is unhelpful, and we think it is a c t u a l l y m i s c o n c e i v e d .      We
              give you a graphic example in the case of the p e r i m e t e r gates
              w h i c h the policemen were slamming in the faces of p e o p l e trying
              to es cape as being an actual one.

                        We also think, w i t h respect, and I t h i n k it is p r o b a b l y
C             more helpful that I say so at this stage b e f o r e e v i d e n c e is
              ca l l e d and, my Lord, I will comment on it f u r t h e r and m o r e
              fully in the opening, we think that it is m i s c o n c e i v e d as well
              to look at the Green G u i d e and to fail to r e c o g n i s e that the
              G r e e n Guide is the material u p o n w h i c h all p a r t i e s base their
              work, w h e n preparing a Safety Certificate. Bu t o n c e yo u have
              p r e p a r e d your Safety C e r t i f i c a t e it is not e v e n o p e n to the
              Club, and this appeared to have been c o m p l e t e l y o v e r l o o k e d by
D             my friend, it is not e ven o p e n to us to take d o w n a cop y of the
              G r e e n G uide and go and have a chat w i t h Dr. E a s t w o o d one
              morning and say "We have s u d denly decided, we w e r e sitt i n g at
              the back of the Court the other day an d we h e a r d J u s t i c e Jowitt
              say, 'Wouldn't it be a good idea to have a s tone w a l l w i t h a
              cap on the top four feet high,'" if that w e r e the suggestion.
              An d the Club had scuttled off and said, "Well, p u l l the fences
E             down, we will put a wall up."                   You can't do that.        My Lord, it
              may be a very good idea and it may be in the G r e e n Guide.                      The
              w i d t h of the fences may be a very good idea, the w i d t h of the
              gates, and it might be a lot better if t hey had ha d the bright
               idea of pulling them all down and putt i n g in four m e t r e gates.
              T h e y are simply not allowed to do it.                O nce the Sa f e t y
              Ce r t i f i c a t e has been issued we are b ound by the t erms of the
              Safety Certificate.

                     Indeed, as I u n d e r s t a n d it, this d o u b l e e d g e d and
              mischievous attack.       Yo u hav^ c~ly f,ot to loo k at wha t they say
              in relation to 144.       The bu r d e n of the complaint, and that is
              w h y we heard nothing about it, is that we s h o u l d not have
              allowed people to tamper w ith 144 b e c a u s e the S a f e t y
              C ertificate said it had to be there and it ha d to be there.
              The Police come along and say, and of co u r s e it was the Police,
              with safety in mind, and they u s u a l l y d i d hav e s a f e t y in m i n d
              (we paid tribute to that when we were a l l o w e d the o p p o r t u n i t y
              of q uestioning them, not to at t a c k t h e m but on m a n y o c c a s i o n s
              to complement and thank them), they came a long an d said, "144
              is a potential source of danger."

                    Dr. E a s twood was given the o p p o r t u n i t y of look i n g at it in
^             terms w h i c h he will doubtless explain, and one has to say one
              has some sympathy for the d i l e m m a that c o n f r o n t e d him.

       MR.     JUST I C E JOWITT:   Of course it m a y be that you have some a r e a s
               in w h i c h there are confli c t i n g considerations.

       MR.     GLASGOW:           Yes,     my Lord.

B      MR.      JUST I C E JOWITT: It may be safe for this re a s o n but cr e a t e
               problems for another reason and it m a y be n e c e s s a r y to have                 a
               compromise.

       MR.    GLASGOW:   The point, my Lord, is that it does not lie in our
              mouths and it certainly does not lie in the P o l i c e to c o m p l a i n
              afterwards, to say that we can go t h r o u g h the G r e e n G u i d e
              picking out the bits we like w i t h the b e n e f i t of hindsight,
C             ignoring the Safety Certif i c a t e and p r e t e n d i n g that we w o u l d
               have been free to change our gro u n d in any w a y we wanted.

       MR.      JUST ICE JOWITT:         I may have to look later, I d on't s u g g e s t we
               try and do it now, at the q u e s t i o n of w h e t h e r the Safety
               Ce r t i f i c a t e once issued freezes the ground, so to speak, until
               there is an amendment or a fresh S a f e t y Certificate.

D      MR.     GLASGOW:           Yes.

       MR.     JUSTICE JOWITT:       Whether wha t the Sa f e t y C e r t i f i c a t e does is to
               lay d own certain m i n i m u m r e q u i r e m e n t s beyond w h i c h the
               occupiers of the stadium are q uite e n t i t l e d to                  go.   I do not
               invite discu s s i o n about that at this stage but                      that is
               something, in view of what you have s u b m i t t e d to me, we m a y
E              have to look at.

        MR.    GLASGOW:         We will, my Lord.     I t h i n k the ef f e c t of the Safety
               Certificate is something w h i c h is of real importance,
               part i c u l a r l y in the light of the w a y the 144 a t t a c k is
               launched.          My Lord, it is i m portant b e c a u s e w h a t e v e r else we
               claim credit for we have not o v e r b u r d e n e d the C o u r t             w i t h yet
               another party or two.          The Local A u t h o r i t y are not, of course,
               before        you, and itis a ma t t e r w h i c h we have got to think
               about.          We all had to reserve our p o s i t i o n on that.           We do so
               and I do not shrink from saying we beli e v e the a t t a c k to be
               misconceived.

                     We very much hope that it will not be n e c e s s a r y to take
                third party procee d i n g s agai n s t the Local Authority.       If my
                friend   is right in saying there w e r e a lot of things w h i c h were
                culpable and causative and ought to have bee n c o r r e c t e d in the
                Certificate, then the c r iticisms that Lord Just i c e T a y l o r made
                of the Local A u thority will find bite.        He was v e r y c r i t i c a l of
                the Local Authority.       Indeed, as you r L o r d s h i p will recall the
                exceptional case he actually set out at le n g t h v e r b a t i m the
                responsible officer's evidence in his Report in o r d e r to show
                really how haphazard the attitude was.

             a t t i tude but we do not think it was causative. If your

      MR.    JUSTICE JOWITT:              Yes,   Mr.   Toulson.

C     MR.    TOULSON:      My Lord, if it please your Lordship, I apo l o g i s e that
             I do not have anything in w r i t i n g for r e a s o n s that your
             L o r d ship will follow.  I am c o m f o r t e d in this, since we have a
             d a i l y transcript if I say a n y thing w h i c h is w o r t h a note it
             will be there and then your L o r dship m a y not feel unduly
             troub l e d this morning.

                   My Lord, the purpose of this r e s p o n s e to my learned
D            friend's opening is, of course, not to a r g u e my case but to
             indicate as briefly as one may how one p u t s it and p o s s i b l y to
             identify certain points in the l a n d s c a p e w h i c h have not come
             out fully now.   Your Lordship may feel it help f u l to have t h e m
             in m ind as the evidence unfolds.             I a m con s c i o u s always of the
             advice to the advocate to keep it short and the great
             temptation to overdo it, and, in the co u r s e of trying to fulfil
             this function, if your L o r dship feels I am going too far and
E
             being unhelpful, I w o u l d o b v i o u s l y be e x t r e m e l y grateful for
             reproof.

                  My Lord, we, as I have alre a d y indicated, adopt your
             Lordship's framework for looking at the case, those three
             issues.  May I therefore touch on eac h of t h e m just i n dicating
             how we see them and the matters w h i c h we invite your L o r d s h i p
             to have in mind as the evidence unfolds.

                       Firstly, why the build up at the t u r n s t i l e s w h i c h led to
             the nee d to open gate C.            My Lord, that is dealt with, of
             course, at Taylor Chapter 10, page 33 to 39.                      We have not
             ch a l l e n g e d a word of that Chapter and m ost of it, factually, is
             unchallenged.             It appears to be the P o l i c e case per the
             Phillips* report that the crises at the turns t i l e s was due
             p r i n c i p a l l y to nobody's fault but the fans un r u l y behaviour.         I
             make only two observations, one that that is c o n t r a r y to the
             u n c h a l l e n g e d finding of Taylor, p a r a g r a p h s 196-7, and (2) that
             even if it were open to be explored as an issue, w h i l e it might
             be relevant to how those two were there behaved, it h a r d l y goes
             to the question of why there were so m a n y of them.

                         N o w there is an alle g a t i o n against me on the ple a d i n g s and
A               I m ust t h e refore merely identify it and my a n s w e r to it.           I
                take it no further.        Your Lordship has not, of course, been
                taken t h r o u g h the pleadings and I am not c o m p l a i n i n g about
                that, but may I do so now me r e l y to identify that point and the
                an s w e r to it.

                          There is a p a g inated p l e adings bundle.

B        MR.    J U S T I C E JOWITT:     I take it that you were not p u r s u i n g that if
                the a l l e g a t i o n made in the pleadings has not bee n made the
                subje ct of one of the i s s u e s ...(i n t e r r u p t i o n )

         MR.     TOULSON:          It may be dead against me.

         MR.     J U S T I C E JOWITT: If that is wrong I hope to         be corrected.

C        MR.     TOULSON:          It may be dead against me.

         MR.     PAYNE: We accept what your Lordship said.                  We thought that the
                object of the list of issues was to collect t o g e t h e r w h a t e v e r
                a n y b o d y w a n t e d to say under whatever issues they w a n t e d to
                d e v i s e c o l l e c t i v e l y by agreement, and that the w h o l e lot was
                t here and that that is the case.                 I think strictly, if my
                f riend wants to refer to the other p l e adings he is e n t i t l e d to
D               do s o .

         MR.    J U S T I C E JOWITT:      He is only doing so d e f e n s i v e l y agai n s t an
                a l l e g a t i o n against him which you have adopted.             If you make
                c o n c e s s i o n s as just now it is not something in the issues and
                it is not something on which you are relying, as I u n d e r s t a n d
                it.
E
         MR.    PAYNE:          My Lord, I only go so far as to say the issues are the
                case, but it does not seem to me that they rule out the
                p l e a d i n g s as a matter of procedure and if my friend wants to
                r e f e r to the pleadings then he can.

         MR.     TOULSON:    Perhaps my friend in due course can c o n s i d e r the
                 point.   Ma y I merely identify it.
F
         MR.     J U S T I C E JOWITT:           Please do.

         MR.     TOULSON:  And he will no doubt let us know w h e t h e r he pursues

    ')




         MR. TOULSON:  The allegation is cited at the foot of the page
A            and then the answer to it at the top of the following page:

                        "It was never part of the Fourth defendants retainer
                        to advise the Second defendants in relation to the
                        number of persons who could be admitted through their
                        turnstiles in any particular time or what number of
                        turnstiles they ought to provide (or use at any
g                       particular match).

                        Further and more specifically, the allegation presumes
                        that the Fourth defendants knew, or ought to have know
                        that 24,000 spectators were to be admitted to the
                        ground through the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane
                        end. This was not so.

q                       The necessity to admit 24,000 spectators at the
                        Leppings Lane end turnstiles arose from the decision
                        (about which the fourth defendants were not consulted
                        since it was none of their business) to close the
                        turnstiles in Penistone Road which normally served the
                        North stand, so diverting 6,000 spectators from the
                        turnstiles in Penistone Road to the Leppings Lane end.
                        If those 6,000 spectators had not had to use the
D                       Leppings Lane end, there would have been no difficulty
                        at the Leppings Lane turnstiles."

              And the comment is made that the crowd, at the worst time,
              is 5,000, and the extra diverted to this end was 6,000.

                   The Green Guide, 1986 edition, states that the maximum
              notional rate at which spectators can pass through
E             turnstiles would depend on a variety of factors but in
              general is unlikely to exceed 750 person per hour. Without
              the additional 6,000 spectators, there would have been 23
              turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end to serve 18,000
              Spectators. At that rate of entry, the admission time
              would have been effectively an hour. At the rate of entry
              of 1,000 per hour because it was an all ticket match, and
              therefore you would not have the delay while people were
              getting their money out and taking change from the
              turnstile operator, the admission time would be 47 minutes.
              By comparison, the current recommendation made by Lord
              Justice Taylor is that they virtually would have got in
              within an hour.
                    I do not know whether any of the facts which we set
              out in that Defence are challenged; whether it is asserted
q             that we were consulted about or knew of the diversion of
              6,000 to the Leppings Lane end. That is our case in point.

         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  Of course, the terms of the retainer may
             be important in deciding on the extent of his duty?

         MR. TOULSON:   Yes. I do not think that anybody has ever
             suggested, but of course when it comes to operation of
 H           turnstiles, so much depends on how you are going to use


                                                 16.

                 them, for what game and soforth.  But for the closure of
    A            those turnstiles, you have 17 turnstiles; 18,000
                 spectators.  The complaint pleaded is "You ought to have
                 known there were 24,000 and that they were not going to be
                 able to cope with 24,000." The answer is, the factual
                 premis, simply, "No."

                      I am not aware and my friend may tell us in due course
                 whether that allegation is pursued, but other than this I
    B
                 am not aware of any allegation against the Engineer that he
                 was in any way responsible for the   build up at the Leppings
                 Lane end, or involved therefore in   Issue 1. In that, the
                 Issue 16, I think, is the relevant   issue and I do not see
                 it making it so certain against me   there but may be I have
                 not read it as it should be.

    c                 The next Issue is:  "Ought Gate 'C' to have been
                 opened without closing the tunnel", and that of course
                 permits a short answer and a long answer.  The short answer
                 to it is, "No, of course not." May I just ask your
                 Lordship, in this context, to look at two unchallenged
                 passages in the Taylor report, which we regard as very
                 important as the starting point of consideration of this
                 issue? My Lord, they are on page 32, paragraph 184:
    D
                           "By 2.52 p.m. when Gate 'C' was open, pens 3 and 4
                           were over-full even by this test" - by which he refers
                           to the test in the previous paragraph -"full when you
                           reached a level which the fans could not tolerate.
                           Even by that test, they were over-full. Many were
                           uncomfortable.   To allow more into the pens was likely
                           to cause injury.   To allow a large stream was courting
    E                      disaster."

0        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                       I am sorry, I have missed the reference.
             What paragraph?

         MR. TOULSON:                I am sorry, my Lord, it is paragraph 184, on page
             32.

    F    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                       Yes, I have it.

         MR. TOULSON:  So he is drawing the distinction between, if you
             like, the three stages: at 2.52, uncomfortable.  If you
             admit more, risk of injury.  If you allow in a large
             stream, courting disaster.

    G    M R * JUSTICE JOWITT:  It is that paragraph which prompted me
               when I suggested that we might put the case under three
               headings.  So that prior to 2.52, the pens were
               uncomfortably full but it is likely there would be any
               fatality had not Gate 'C' not been opened and the tunnel
               remain open?

         MR. TOULSON:  Precisely.  This of course is a fatal accident
    H        claim and my friend has indicated that he accepts these


                                                            17.

               findings and he is not seeking to take any factual evidence
               to go beyond them.

                    The other key passage which is 230 paragraph, on page
               40, again, not challenged:

                         "Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 p.m., the tunnel
                         should have been closed off whether Gate 'C' was to be
                         opened or not.  The exercise was a simple one and had
B
                         been carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was
                         for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance
                         of the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere."

                    My Lord, the conclusion which of course is challenged
              -           and your Lordship is absolutely right, the fact that Lord
              Justice Taylor reached it is of no persuasive authority at
^             all - is that in those circumstances the closure of the
              tunnel was a blunder of major magnitude and one that we
              advance and one which we say, with the greatest respect, is
              glaringly plain.    It is against that background that one
              looks at the basis of the challenge because the case which
              is to be made, and my friend has indicated that this is the
              primary claim in this case, is that this was all the fault
              of a faulty system and the Police went along with a system
D             which was the fault of others. They say, in short, they
               tried to do their best to operate it; human error; they
               failed and they say in short that the opening of the gate
              was a foreseeable consequence of a faulty system for which
              others, including the Engineer are to blame.

                    They are right to seek to put their case in that way,
              we submit, for this reason; that if they fail on that
E             ground, in my submission, their claim fails. One could
              develop that further.

       MR. PAYNE:   My Lordj I am sorry to interrupt but it is
           important that if he is directly addressing this point he
            should understand it clearly.  It is not the opening of the
            gate that was foreseeable; it is the overcrowding of pens 3
„          and 4 which was foreseeable.
F
        MR. TOULSON:  I am very grateful.  I take that to be an
            expressed concession that my friend does not say that the
            opening of Gate 'C', without closure of the tunnel, was
            reasonably foreseeable by the Engineer, and I hear no
            contradiction.

£       MR. PAYNE: What I am saying is that the defects in the system,
            which I have explained, allowed the overcrowding in pens 3
            and 4 to take place.  How exactly that overcrowding arose,
            I have not said anything about that. What I have said is
            that the absence of assisting, counting and control and no
            certified capacity for the pen, meant that it was
            foreseeable that sooner or later those pens would become
            overcrowded.

       MR. TOULSON:   It is not my function to argue the case now but
            merely to identify the points that are in issue and this
            exchange maybe helpful.  I prefaced it by going to those
            two key unchallenged factors for this reason, and your
            Lordship already has the point: the distinction between the
            crowding previous to the opening of the gate; discomfort,
            and the crowding after the opening of the gate;fatality.
            This is a fatal accident claim.   I understood it to be the
g          thrust of my friend's case that that act of opening the
            gate without closing the tunnel, was a foreseeable
            consequence of a faulty system and, therefore, my client
            has some responsibility for that.   But I now understand him
            to be saying not that at all but that merely the faulty
            system permitted foreseeable overcrowding of a kind. But
            he, as I understand from a moment ago, does not seek to say
            that it was foreseeable by the Engineer that the Police
C          would open the outside gate and fail to close the tunnel.

       MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   So far as overcrowding is concerned, there
            may be two factors which are important in the assessment of
            the danger; one is the factor of overcrowding and secondly,
            the rate at which the overcrowding occurs.

       MR. TOULSON:               Absolutely, absolutely.
D
       MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: And of course the opening of Gate 'C' - I
           have seen the video personally, as this is a public hearing
           I think it is desirable at some stage we see it again in
           open court - it is quite clear when one sees the rate of
           egress through the turnstiles and compares it with the
           ingress once Gate 'C' is opened, that the rate of
           overcrowding is dramatically increased once Gate 'C' is
E          opened.

       MR. PAYNE:   My Lord, I wonder if I may be allowed to make the
           point clear and I am grateful to my friend for allowing me
           to intervene again.   If there had been a means of
           controlling the entry, as we say there should have been,
           and counting people into pens 3 and 4, then the rate of
„          entry into those pens would have been controlled. The
           entry of the people through Gate 'C' would not have made
           any difference because the conrtir.g would have taken care
            of that, as it ought to have done.

       MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  I follow that. What you say is that with
           a proper system, pens 3 and 4 would already in some way
           have been shut off before the gate was opened.
 Q
       MR. PAYNE:   And if any more were let in, then they would have
           been let in through the counting system.   So that the speed
           of entry through Gate 'C 1 would not have had anything to do
           with it.

        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  But that is not the same thing and you do
            not say that they ought to have foreseen the opening of
 H

    )




                Gate 'C* at a time? That is not the same. You do not say
                that they ought to have forseen the opening of Gate 'C'?

        MR. PAYNE:             No, I am not making that point.

        MR. TOULSON:  I am extremely grateful, my Lord, because that is
            a matter for argument later, in my submission, and might
            have very profound consequences.
B
                     May I just pursue your Lordship's point about the
                importance of opening the gate not merely on numbers but
                flow and seen by going to a document on this, because it
                actually goes straight to the point very clearly and what
                the Engineers had in mind. Your Lordship was taken to the
                trial bundle, page 300, and a reference to the disaster.
                May I just come to that because it is a point....
C
        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                      Which document is it?

        MR. TOULSON:  Bundle 1, the core bundle, page 300. This is in
            that sequence of documents at a time when the Club and the
            Engineer were having discussions about more radials, in
            1985, and the possibility of complete segregation and Mr.
            Chester, the Club secretary, was putting his views on what
D          they wanted.    He was making, "Discussed copies  of our
            drawing" and then it was item 2 my friend read out:

                          "Four banks of three turnstiles with gate. Gate to
                          let people in if all ticket", and then Strange's  *
                          comment: ‘'(Disaster)"

               My friend read that to your Lordship and said, "Of course,
E             that   is not this disaster."

        MR. PAYNE:             I am entitled to observations.

        MR. TOULSON:    But ^iat at that stage the Club secretary was
             saying was, "Look, if you have this scheme; you have
             turnstiles and we have got a gate by it, for an all ticket
„           match can we let them in through the gate?” The Engineer
             is saying, "Absolutely not, because if you are letting
             people in through a gate, you have got no control over
             those people.   They are not coming in through the
             turnstiles", and that tallies in with one of the key points
             in the Green Guide, that the rate of egress should be
             controlled by turnstiles and should match what you are
             capable of doing once you get them in. My Lord, that in
G           the core bundle is at page 18.

                 Paragraph 5:

                          "INGRESS TO THE GROUND

                          Where admission to a football ground or parts of it is
                          controlled by turnstiles, these, by their number and
                          location, control not only the rate of admission but,
                          to a large extent, the dispersal of spectators within
                          a ground to their chosen sections.  Turnstiles should
                          be of such numbers as to admit at a rate whereby no
                          unduly large crowds are waiting for admission and yet
                          at no faster rate than the arrangements for
                          distributing spectators within the ground permit"

                 - throwing open the gates and letting 2,00 straight through
                 that.

                      That was very important also in this way.  When I come
                 to refer to the evidence of Inspector Calvert, who was a
                 police liaison officer for a number of years before this
                 happened and who was the officer who put forward on behalf
                 of the Police the desire to remove barrier 144, he said in
                 his his evidence at the Enquiry that of course the context
                 in which they were considering this was that the spectators
                 would be coming in at a controlled rate through the
                 turnstiles and would be being filled into the pens
                 appropriately, and that nobody had any contemplation when
                 they were considering this - the idea of throwing open the
                 gates and having a massive rush.

         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  I mention this at this stage not to invite
             any discussions now, but in the hope that Counsel will
             assist me later about it, because I think it is something I
             shall have to think about.  The (I call it) dramatic inrush
             of people when Gate C was opened - that is my impression
             from the video.film - at the moment it seems to me it
             should have been foreseen, and I would have thought must
             have been foreseen, because there was a serious problem
             outside the turnstiles and Gate C was opened in order to
             provide a dramatic relief to that situation.  That is my
             present approach to it.  I mention it now, as I say, as
             something I shall think about and welcome assistance on.

         MR. TOULSON:  Just how dramatic it was and its consequences may
             be looked at in this way.  Your Lordship asked my friend in
             the course of his opening when one was looking at the
             Taylor paragraphs to the effect that at 32.52 it was
             already full to discomfort, whether there was any evidence
             - what the numbers were at 2.52.  My friend, I think,
             suggested not, but that you could possibly do some
             derivative reasoning from the number let in.

                      There is some evidence; I tell your Lordship what it
                 is for what value it may have.  The H.S.E. had a blown up
                 photograph of, among others, pens 3 and 4 and 2.52; it is
    L. SELLERS a Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




.                   Mr. Norton and it is part of the H.S.E. report.  His count
                    for pen 3 at 2.52 was 678, and his count for pen 2 at--

            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                   His count for pen 3?

            MR. TOULSON:  For pen 3 was 678, and his count for the same pen
                at 3.03 was 1,499 - an increase of some 800.  It is right
                to add at once that that was the fact; that is what he was
g               able to get from the photograph---

            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                   Would you give me that time again, please?

            MR. TOULSON:   3.03, my Lord.   He expresses doubt as to whether
                 the first figure was a realistic figure, and he thinks
                 there must have been more.   One can see the difficulty when
                 you are trying to get numbers to count heads on a
C               photograph, the numbers are not going to be less than that
                 but there may be some missing.   The same would apply
                 equally, of course, to the second count, and indeed that is
                 why he comes to the overall conclusion that the H.S.E. best
                 estimate at 3.03 was 1,576 - rather more than they could
                 count.  Making due allowance for the fact that both count
                 figures taken straight from the photographs may be too low,
                 nevertheless it was the comparison between the two which
D               was so very striking, and it is that increase on the order
                 of 800 between those two times.

                         That tallies, of course, also strikingly with the
                    2,000 admitted, because there is evidence that 2,000 were
                    admitted through the gate (again on H.S.E. calculations).
                    If it be accepted that this significant majority went
                    straight down into pens 3 and 4 - we cannot give precise
E                  percentages, obviously, but supposing simply to be thinking
                    in the right area that 80% went straight down into pens 3
                    and 4, 80% of 2,000 would be 1,600 and if, for the sake of
                    argument, half went into 3 and half went into 4, you have
                    got 800 going into 3.  So that both the H.S.E. count from
                    the photographs and the calculation back from the number
                    who came in and where they went to would tend to indicate
P                  that you have got a number who went into pen 3 - it may not
                    be precisely in hundreds; it may be 700, it may be 900, or
                    anything, but you are talking of that number of magnitude.

                         That also bites in this way.   The H.S.E.'s best
                    estimate of a total was 1,576.  If about 800 came in that
                    ten minutes, it means that that number has doubled in that
                    short space of time; then to relate it back to the time
G                  being 2.52 unchallenged, if you have got the unchallenged
                    finding that at 2.52 it is full to the point of what fans
                    could tolerate - they are uncomfortable - and then you
                    actually double that figure (plus or minus) in a matter of
                    a few minutes, it gives an order of the magnitude of the
                    consequences of that sudden inrush.   One then comes back to
                    the question which was the point of departure:   whether
                    there is any suggestion that that opening of the gate which
H                  had those dramatic consequences was foreseeable.

                       I then come back to where I was.  It will be my
                  submission that when you take those simple facts and it was
                  that massive inrush which turned an uncomfortable into a
                  tragic situation, it will be my submission that it would
                  not be enough for the Police to be able to establish - even
                  if they could - that the Engineer was responsible in some
                  measure for the crowding at 2.52. They would have to
                  establish, when it is this intervening event - it is that
                  fact - of the throwing open of the gates, to cope with a
B
                  situation outside the ground (nothing to do with the
                  Engineer), they would have to establish that in some way
                  that fatal step was foreseeable by him before he could be
                  in any way liable for the consequences of that.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  I have written this down; they are my own
               words but tell me if it does accurately encapsulate your
               submission:  If pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.52 p.m. then
               before the Engineer can be held liable for the consequences
               of opening Gate C it would have to be proved that he should
               have foreseen a dramatic increase in the numbers occurring
               in these pens at the sort of rate it did.  This could only
               have occurred as a result of opening Gate C for an incident
               comparable to its effect and no such incident was
               reasonably foreseeable.
D
           MR. TOULSON:               Absolutely, my Lord.

                       I then turn to indicate how I shall be putting my case
                  in relation to this matter of system which has been the
                  burden of the way my friend has opened his case.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Just before we leave that, I say this
 E             because it is something I shall have to think      about later.
               You might be accused of resurrecting the lost opportunity,
               namely that what we are looking at is ....(inaudible).

           MR. TOULSON:               Yes.

                        My Lord, there are a trio of cases on my list of
                  authorities; it will not surprise your Lordship to know
 F                that Wagomire(?) is one of them and that others are Dorset
                  Yacht -v- Home Office and also Smith      Littlewoods
                  Organisation, a recent decision of their Lordship's House.
                  The point that we make is going to be simply this, that
                  where a necessary and central part of the causation of the
                  matter complained of is due to the voluntary human activity
                  of another, before you can hold a defendant liable for the
 q                consequences of that it must have been foreseeable by him.
                  It is a simple application of that principle.

           MR. JUSTICE              JOWITT:      Otherwise it is too late.

           MR. TOULSON:               Otherwise it is too late.

»               It is one thing to say, even if they could establish it,
                 "You were responsible with others for a situation at 2.52
                 by which the people in this pen were uncomfortably
                 filling." It is quite another thing to say, "You were also
                 responsible for the consequences which then ensued when the
                 Gate C was thrown open to tackle an entirely different
                 problem, namely the build up at Leppings Lane for which you
                 had no responsibility, and when that happened with the
g               consequence of that this pen became fatally overcrowded,
                 you are responsible for that."  It is just bad.

                      Now, my Lord, I turn to indicate   how I shall put my
                 case on this matter of system.  It is   going to be necessary
                 to look at the matter in three stages   to start with:  (1 )
                 before 1981;  (2) the 1981 semi-final   incident;  and (3)
                 after 1981.
C
                      Of course, there has been much talk about Dr.
                 Eastwood's design. Your Lordship will recall that Dr.
                 Eastward design was that which he put forward to the Club
                 and to the Licensing Authority in 1979, which was then
                 accepted and approved and which provided for a socially and
                 open planned terrace.  At that stage you had one open plan
                 terraces with its three entrances, the tunnel in the
D                middle, and the two at either end.Then came at that stage
                 the overall certified capacity, which was 7,200 or 10,100
                 if you include the north west corner.

                      My Lord, for the calculation of capacity, as we know,
                 the Green Guide takes an overall figure of 5.4 per square
                 metre, but it also recognises the obvious fact - obvious,
                 that is, to anybody who has ever been to a football match -
E                that such a crowd will not in fact be evenly distributed
                 over an open terrace but there will in fact be more people
                 behind the goal than elsewhere, and indeed the Guide not
                 only recognises but actually defines what it talks about as
                 "peak viewing" and "other areas."  It requires that there
                 should be more barriers in the peak viewing areas.   But it
                 does not draw any distinction between peak viewing and non-
 p               peak viewing when it comes to calculation of capacity.

                       Therefore, where you have your open plan terrace,
                 capacity is calculated by 5.4 per square metre, or
                 whatever, throughout, with the recognition that in places
                 it is going to be greater than 5.4, you peak viewing areas,
                 and in other places it is going to be less.   Nowhere does
                 the Green Guide try to describe - and no doubt it would be
G                impracticable to try to describe - what one might call a
                 local maximum pressure figure.   Rather, it provides for the
                  situation in three ways:  firstly, by seeing an overall
                 density figure, with the recognition that there are going
                  to be more in some and less in others but by setting an
                  overall figure it is going to have an effect on the figure
                  in there;  secondly, by requiring more barriers where it is
                  likely going to be denser than average;  and thirdly, by
 H               stipulating (as in fact is stipulated in paragraph 7.3 of
ai~ SELLERS   a Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D




^              the Guide) that arrangements should be made to encourage
               even distribution.

                    However, my Lord, all that may not solve the problem.
               You may still get unacceptable local overcrowding, and it
               was precisely that which happened in the 1981 incident.   It
               was a semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and
               Tottenham.  I do not want to take up your Lordship's time
3              by going through the documents now, but, because of the
               transcript, may I just merely indicate what the principal
               page numbers are and then indicate purely for present
               purposes what they will amount to.

       MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                       Yes.

       MR. TOULSON:  They start at page 183 with the pre-semi-final
C          inspection by the working party, and then you get the
           following pages:   185, 188, 196, 200, 204, 220 and 221.
           They are the principal pages, and a lot of them are Police
           debriefing and Police internal memoranda.

                     My Lord, what it all comes to is that there was an
               episode of local overcrowding and fans were got out through
               one of the perimeter gates.   The Police acted speedily on
D              that occasion in opening the gates and actually managed to
               get them out without injury, but the Police were very
               exercised afterwards at the risk that this might have been
               very much worse.   They had a debriefing where a lot of
                officers all discussed the cause, and the conclusion which
               was reached was this: that the cause of the problem was
                that there were gaps in the terrace which the Police could
_              not get the fans to move into and, because the Police were
               unable to get the fans to move into where there were gaps
                because the fans were unwilling to move from where they
               were and where they had a nice viewing place, the result
               was to cause pressure elsewhere.

                     The solution which was come to by the Police was that
                there should be radial barriers in order that they could
p              exercise more control over the fans and where they went in
                order to prevent a repetition of this problem.   So the
                whole raison d'etre for the introduction of the radials was
                to avoid a repetition of that kind of crushing by enabling
                the Police to exercise more active control over where the
                fans went on the terrace.

                     In paragraph 172 of Taylor at page 30 - a paragraph
G              challenged by my learned friend in opening ---

        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                      Paragraph ...?

        MR. TOULSON:  Paragraph 172, on page 30.  Lord Justice Taylor
            says - and it is the underlined sentence - "In theory, the
            whole object of the radial fences had been to achieve even
            distribution by directing fans into desired positions." My
H           friend said in opening that Lord Justice Taylor had got
Q.L. SELLERS a Co. / W. LLOYD WO O D L A N D




^                that wrong on the evidence.   The purpose, he said, was not
                 to enable the Police to direct but was to achieve
                 segregation of fans.   I have to say that when one looks at
                 the documents - and they speak for themselves - Lord
                 Justice Taylor's finding is absolutely right that that was
                 the purpose of their introduction.

                      Now, they came also to have a secondary purpose, my
B                Lord, because at the time time as the Police were proposing
                 that, they also realised that it would have another
                 advantage to the Police.   It was the time when football
                 hooliganism was becoming a problem and th6y realised that
                 it would also have the advantage that, for example, for
                 League games where a capacity crowd was not expected, they
                 could have the ticketing such that they could then divide
                 the terrace into sections and they could, if they wanted
C                to, have fans from one club in one end of the terrace in
                 one particular pen and have the fans from the other side in
                 other separate pens with, if they like, a sort of sterile
                 central pen, so that if ---

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                  Pen 5?

          MR. TOULSON:   That is right.  It gave them flexibility.    That
D             was not the germ of the idea;   that was a secondary
              advantage.   The germ of the idea was t   o   p   0 $ttive ■'
              control so that they could get the people to move into the
              gaps and enable a more effective exercise of positive
              control.

                       This was the first time, therefore, that we came to a
                 departure from the original Eastwood design of the
k                barriers.   It is very relevant to bear in mind here, when
                 one is looking at the Green Guide and in the light of the
                 attacks which are now made, what is the guidance given to
                  licensing authorities on the approach which they should
                 adopt to the Green Guide.

                       My Lord, in that respect, may I refer to one document,
p                a Home Office Circular which your Lordship will find in the
                  bundle.  It starts at page 58(A).   The paragraph that I
                  was merely going to invite your Lordship's attention to is
                  at page 58(1). This is a Circular to licensing authorities
                  and at page 58(1), which is part of Annexe B, you have
                  "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - Football" and then
                  half-way down the column ---

G        MR. PAYNE:   I am sorry to interrupt my friend. I am
              floundering slightly. We do not seem to have this.

          MR. TOULSON:              I am so sorry.

          MR. PAYNE:   We go from 58 to 59.             (Document handed to Mr.
               Payne).

 H        MR. TOULSON:              My Lord, 58(1), half-way down the column:
Q.L. SELLERS & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D
  )




^                          "The Guide is not a set requirement to be originally
                           applied regardless of individual circumstances.   As
                           Lord Wheatley recognised, it is important to maintain
                           the maximum flexibility in any system of control so as
                           to take account of the differing circumstances at
                           individual grounds."

                 So here one has the situation that the Engineer has started
B               with his design but it has run into a problem, an actual
                problem at an actual match.   The Police, with all the
                experience they have of crowd management and control, have
                said, "We think there is a solution to this and we think
                that this is the adjustment which ought to be made."   Be it
                noted that it has not, as it were, emanated from the
                Engineers as an idea of theirs;   it has emanated from those
                who have the experience of controlling crowds as the way
C               they see of preventing danger and encouraging safety.

                      Here one comes to the wise observation that your
                Lordship was making earlier, that very often, of course,
                when you are considering these things there are two sides
                 to it and we have competing considerations - most
                graphically, of course, perimeter fences, because there is
                a desire to keep the fans in to prevent pitch invasions,
D               which, incidentally, have a danger as well as disruption as
                a consequence because if fans invade the pitch, you get
                public affray and fighting and so on, so there is a safety
                factor there as well as an interference with the game, but,
                on the other hand, you may need to get them out, so there
                is a direct conflict.

                      Indeed, your Lordship will see that at the end of that
                 line of documents which I read out to your Lordship when
                 the working party considered this - and it is actually the
                 document at page 221 - the Minutes reflect at a meeting
                 that the Engineers are not at, because they are not part of
                 the working party, that they expressly recognise and the
                 Minutes reflect that they saw advantages and disadvantages
                 but, on balance, thought that it was a good, sensible idea.
                 So it is the balancing factor at work.

                      I apologise for taking a V.ttle time on this.  If your
                 Lordship finds it unhelpful, I know your Lordship will stop
                 me, but it does go absolutely to the heart of this.

                      It is relevant to see what was the conventional
                 wisdom, as stated in the Green Guide, about radial fences
                 at this time.  That comes in two passages in the Green
                 Guide, in bundle 1, pages 37 and 23.  First at page 23 ---

          MR.    JUSTICE JOWITT: If you just give me the references, then       I
                 can get them down.

          MR. TOULSON: Yes, my Lord.   It is page 37 paragraph 18, and
              page 23 paragraph 7.6. May I simply say what I read them
 H            to mean.  They are saying that major sections of the ground

^              such as an end or a side should be wholly self-contained,
               as of course at Hillsborough they were;   the Leppings Lane
               end was self-contained.   But, in addition, less problems
               are encountered when terraces are divided into sections;
               and ideally - they use the word ideally - these individual
               sections should be self-contained.   However, there is no
               suggestion in the Guide that you should only have terraces
               sub-divided in this way if each is self-contained.   On the
B              contrary, the way they are putting it is that radial fences
               are in principle desirable - better still, ideal, if they
               are fully self-contained.

              MR. JUSTICE OOWITT: You gave me two references.    I have got on page 37,
                   paragraph 18.
           MR. TOULSON: Page 33, paragraph 7(6). What did the Engineers do? The answer
                was they suggested the ideal solution in the form of that scheme fully
                self-contained. It was not said "That is not your responsility". What
                was in fact sought to be introduced were radials without the full self-
                contained. That, far from contravening the Green Guide was in line with
                the thinking supported by the POlice for the protection of people and
                received the approval of the working party. The case against Dr. Eastwood
                really on that has to come to this: that you ought to have dug your heels
                and said to the working party, said to the licencing party, never mind
         B      what the police have said about the crushing at the serai-final, we think
                that you ought not to have this at all unless it goes the absolute whole
                hog of the ideal that they were negligent or not, and the basis for that
                attack would have to be this: that to have radial fences of the kind the
                Police were wanting for the purposes of exercising more control would not
                be safe but unsafe.
                         Now, of course, if you are going to have radial fences for the
                    express purpose of enabling a more positive system of directing fans to
                    make sure they do take up the gaps, it goes without saying that somebody
                    must exercise that positive control. You cannot safely and sensibly
                    devise a system which is intended to enable positive control to be
                    exercised (inaudible) exercising positive control. It would be extra­
                    ordinary for the Engineer to say to the Police when they say "We have
                    to police these semi-finals. We want these radials in order that we can
         D          control the fans and prevent repetition" and for the Engineer to say
                    "Well if you have them are you going to do what you intend." It would
                    be a very odd thing to day.
                         Even if you do not have them at all. If you have the open plan, as
                    we know from that experience, you cannot prevent local density, you cannot
                    prevent getting local danger situations. No amount of visual monitoring
                    is going to tell you what the precise headcount in any area of the ground
         E          is. It is accepted that if you have the radials you are not going to be
                    able to tell by looking that there are precisely this number here and
                    precisely that number there. What anybody sensible is going to be able
                    to do is to say, well I can use that to fill them evenly, and I can see
                    that if there is an obvious disparity here then we should stop this part
                    of our positive filling. The whole object is to fill up the pens, when
                    we can see that that pen is filling up and this one is not, then we direct
                    the fans where they should go.
         F
              MR. JUSTICE OOWITT: I have your point Radial fences to allow control pre­
                   supposes that control will be exercised.
           MR. TOULSON: I leave it simply this way: ought the Engineer to have said to
                the Police that the task of doing that is so difficult that even with 801
                police officers on the ground as they had at Hillsborough you are not
         q      going tobe able to close a gap before people are crushed to death, or can
                experienced police officers, with all the experience theyhave of policing,
                be relied on sensibly to do it, so that you never get anywhere near to
                people being crushed to death. Your Lordship has the point.
                         The third stage one comes to then is what happened post 1981. Iam
                    not going through the 1985 events because it would be unnecessary for the
                    purposes of opening. It is more a development of the same, Sheffield
          H         Wednesday having gone into the First Division, more radials to enable yet

                    further control. The broad point is this: that after 1981 in all
                    League matches the findings of Lord Justice Taylor are unchallenged.
                   The Police did in fact for eight years from 1981 to 1989 at League
                   matches operate quite safely and sensibly a system of filling the pens.
                   There is no mention in any document as far as we can see, to the working
       A           party, the Engineer or anybody else that they ever found the slightest
                   difficulty in doing that.
                         My Lord, let it not be thought that theynever had large crowds.
                   There is in the bundle — I do not wish your Lordship to look at it,
                   but I mention it so that it is on the transcript, at page 1272 there
                    is a list of League attendances in recent years. One sees that they
                   had over 48,000 when Manchester United came, over 48,000 when Liverpool
       B           came. So, they had experience of very large crowds at League matches.
                        Then one asks what about the Cup matches, because it was after
                   the Cup match that the system was first introduced. After 1981 there
                   were three Cup matches, 1987, 1988 and 1989. The evidence from the
                   police officers is that in 1987 they closed off the tunnel and pens
                   3 and 4. In 1988 they did the same, the system for which the radials
       c           had been introduced. In 1989 they did not.
                         Your Lordship may at some stage find it helpful to look at some
                   photographs of 1988 where one can see at the back of pens 3 and 4 a long
                    line of policemen. One can see the helmets at the back of that pen. My
                   Lord, one is therefore left with this: my friend has said throughout his
                   opening that the Police adopted and tried to use a system of visual
                   monitoring and that in 1989 it failed because it was inherently such a
       D           difficult system to operate. But with the greatest respect, that is
                   contrary to the evidence which they themselves presented to the Taylor
                    inquiry and the Phillips report which they have put before your Lordship
                   as the whole thrust of their case, because what theyhave said is that in
                    1989 no police officer had the job of looking at the filling pens. Not
                   one of the 801 police officers at the ground regarded it or was told to
                   regard it as his job to see that the pens were closed when full.
       E                 It is emphatically not the case of them attempting to do something,
                   of some officer coming and saying yes, that was my job. I tried to
                   do it and I misread the situation. They did not try to do it. That is
 #                 why my friend said when we said in our Issues and he made some comments
                   about it in our replies to Issues 8 and 9, Issue 8 what the system should
                   have beenand how (inaudible) operated in a sensible way, Issue 9 on the
                   day there was no system. He said, I agree, the Police accept there was
                   no system. They were not trying to do it.
       F
                         Therefore, in a sentence it was not a failure of the system in
                    operation, but a failure of the Police to operate the system at all.
                         My Lord, I turn to the subsidiary head, group 3, other allegedly
                    culpable causative factors which existed prior to the opening of Gate C
                    and are alleged to have played a part in causing the deaths of Mr.
       q            Chapman and Mr. Rimmer. Your Lordship has already observed that the
                    Taylor Inquiry was concerned, as indeed as its terms of reference say,
                    to inquire into the events at the football ground and to make
                    recommendations about the needs of crowd control. That obviously requires
                    looking at the matters very broadly, whereas this trial is in a narrow
                    compass.
                         I am not going to duck the matters raised under this heading, but
       H            I do submit, and it is a matter that will be of relevance at the appropriate
                    time, that if the Police failed to establish culpability on the part of the

                                                       30

             Engineer in relation to either of the first two Issues, what required
             Gate C to be opened and the opening of Gate C without closure of the
             tunnel, that then their claim against the Engineer is bad in law,
             and I say that for these reasons: your Lordship really has the point.
A           It cannot be disputed as a matter of simple history that it was the
             build up followed by the admission of fans without closing the gate
             which was the central and vital factor which caused these deaths.   But
             for that they would never have happened.
                  If I be right in my submission that neither of those whole aspects
             was foreseeable by the Engineers. They did not know the number of
             turnstiles being used at this gave and they did not know the diversion
B           and there was nothing faulty, that they as Engineers had no reason to
             suppose the Police would not do in 1989 what they had done in 1987 and
             1988 throughout, that then all these other matters are going no doubt
            to be the subject of minute attention when we come to Mr. Burne's evidence,
             I do not wish to be dismissive, but they amount to nothing in terms of
            causation, because these are all matters which pre-date. They are patent
            matters in the configuration of pens and are obvious for all to see and
            we are not here talking about some latent danger. There is a patent
^           system. All these matters predate those events. They themselves caused
             no trouble throughout all these ensuing years, whatever criticism may be
            made of them, whether it is sound or not.
                  What causes the tragedy are these passive intervening events and
            that therefore even if my friend were to succeed only on his subsidiary
             point that there was in some respect or another fault on the part of the
P           Engineer, that in my respectful submission would fail to enable   him to
             succeed against my clients on simple principles of causation and
             foreseeability.
                 I then touch on if I may very briefly what seems to be the facts
            relied upon:
                  (1) Pre-existing crowding.           I havesaidenough about   that and need
E           say no more.
                  (2) Capacity. That is an irrelevance and I say that with greatest
            respect for this reason and it is necessary just once more to refer to
            the pleadings for the last time. Can I take your Lordship to the pleadings
             bundle at page 102. My Lord at page 101, question 61. "Please state
             whether the plaintiffs case that the overall numbers admitted to the Leppings
             Lane end of the ground on the 15th April were successive and unsafe." The
F           answer given by the Police at page 104.
        MR. PAYNE: I am afraid my bundle is not numbered.           This is the further and
             better particulars of what?
        MR. TOULSON: Of the statement of claim as adopted by the Police.          Does your
             Lordship have page 104?
G MR. JUSTICE OOWITT: Yes.
        MR. TOULSON: "The overall number was safe provided the crowd had been
             distributed evenly across the whole terrace."
        MR. JUSTICE OOWITT:          Remind me whose request was this?
pj MR. TOULSON: My request. So we are not on the pleaded case concerned with
        capacity. We are concerned with distribution. Next the point is made
0,L SELLERS & Co. / W. LLOYD W O O D L A N D

            about the annual certificate by the Engineers. That raises the point
            one would have to go into about the relationship between the Engineers
            and the licensing authority which acted through its working party.
            Without going into the documents, of which there are many, but to state
A          the matter shortly we are in a slightly odd position because of the
            history of the action. The plaintiffs started with the estate of the
            unfortunate Mr. Chapman and Mr. Riramer. They began this action against
            the Police and the Club at the behest of somebody, one or other defendant,
            who indicated allegations would be made against the City Council and the
            Engineers. They were then joined in, the City Council as third defendants,
           the Engineers as fourth. The allegation against the Engineers to an extent
           mirrored the allegations made against the City Council, you the licencing
B          authority did this, you the Engineers took part in that.

 D                        T h e a n s w e r to your L o r d s h i p ' s q u e stion about to what
                e x t e n d the S a f e t y Ce r t i f i c a t e freezes things, you cannot make a
                c h a n g e to the ground w i t h o u t not i f y i n g the Local Authority, the
                Li c e n s i n g Authority, and obt a i n i n g their consent.             That is one
                of the terms of the Licence.

                          So tha t w h a t happe n e d in the vari o u s changes, the two
 £              r e l e v a n t changes, the two chan g e s relied on since 1979, the
                i n t r o d u c t i o n of railings and removal of 144, were both
                i n s t a n c e s that the Police, in fact, raised ei t h e r w i t h the Club
                or w i t h the Work i n g Party: we want this to happen.           The Working
                Party, b a s e d on-the w i s d o m of its varies disciplines, agreed,
                and the c r i t i c i s m against the E n g i n e e r is, you should have held
                out a g a i n s t that a l t e r a t i o n to your scheme.

 F                        N o w w h e n they are making the Safety C ertificate it is the
                C e r t i f i c a t e w h i c h is issued by the Licensing Authority.           What
                the E n g i n e e r s issue each year is in effect a certificate of
                compliance.             W hat they are indicating is their purpose is to go
                r ound and c h e c k the structures, so that if you go round and you
                find t hat some stands are li k e l y to collapse you don't get a
                cer t i f i c a t e .     When, therefore, the Working Party has had before
                it the s u b m i s s i o n that has been raised wi t h i n the Working Party
 G              itself, we w a n t to remove this barrier, and the Working Party
                L i c e n s i n g A u t h o r i t y takes the d e c i s i o n to do so, the idea that
                w h e n s u b s e q u e n t l y the Engineers at the end of the year issue
                t heir certificate, that is to be seen as some sort of
                v a l i d a t i o n of the w i s d o m of the d e c i s i o n made by the Licensing
                A u t h o r i t y earlier, it really does not make sense.

           MR. J U S T I C E JOWITT:            A s I see it the Safety C e r t i ficate does not
    A          a b s o l v e the C l u b from the need to introduce changes and get the
                n e c e s s a r y p e r m i s s i o n if they see or know or ought to know that
                t h e r e is some problem, but because of the wa y in w hich the
                S a f e t y C e r t i f i c a t e c o m e s into being, that may provide evidence.
                It m a y be of g r e a t e r c o g e n c y in the case of the Clu b than the
                E n g i n e e r that t h e y w e r e not making the w r o n g decision.

           MR. TOULSON:          T h a t ' s right.       W h e n you come to the issuing of that
    B          Ce r t i ficate, of course, it goes w i t h o u t saying that the
               E n g i n e e r c o n t e m p l a t e d the gr o u n d was going to be used in the
               no r m a l way, i.e. for instance, (we have seen the Strange
               d i s a s t e r memo), if you c e r t i f y that the w est stand is safe for
               a c e r t a i n n u m b e r and t h e n in fact the gates are all thrown open
                so that e v e r y b o d y t ries to p o u n d up the staircase at the same
                time, it m a y not be safe.                   But yo u are not contemplating that
+              use w h e n yo u issue the cer t i f i c a t e .           The marine surveyor who
    C          w o u l d have bee n r e q u i r e d by law to c e r t i f y the sea worthiness
               of the H e r a l d of Fre e E n t e r p r i s e w o u l d not be at fault because
                it goe s to sea w i t h its bow d o o r s open.

                             W h e n yo u com e to the actual d e c i s i o n s made, your Lordship
                   has in m i n d the f l e xible a p p r o a c h p o i n t in the Local
                   A u t h o r i t y ' s g u i d a n c e fro m the Home Office.         One has in mind
                   also that w h e n they came to make these dec i s i o n s they were
    D              ha v i n g to b a l a n c e one thing a g a i n s t another, the radials being
                   one example, and w h e n it came to the removal of 144, I am not
                   g oing to go into that in detail no w but the point is this, the
                   P o l i c e ra i s e d in the W o r k i n g P a r t y at an inspection just before
                   the b e g i n n i n g of the season, t h e i r w o r r i e s reflected in an end
                   of se a s o n re p o r t f r o m I n s p e c t o r C a l v e r t to his superiors, that
                   this b a r r i e r just inside the e n t r a n c e to the ground was causing
    £              problems.            It was c a u s i n g a b uild up of fans at the beginning
                   of games w i t h ill t e m p e r and u n r u l y behaviour, and they were
                   w o r r i e d a b o u t the p o s s i b i l i t y it m ight impede evacuation, the
                   p r i n c i p l e way, of course, being t h r o u g h the tunnel.             They
                   ra i s e d t hese a s - s a f e t y matters.         The Work i n g Party decided then
                   and there that it s h o u l d be removed.

                             Dr. E a s t w o o d was not c o n s u l t e d about this in advance, was
                   not p r e s e n t at the m e e t i n g and had no knowledge of it, but of
                   co u r s e l e a r n e d of it a f t e r w a r d s and c o n s i d e r e d the point,
                   c o n s i d e r e d tha t he saw the a r guments and that it was not an
                   u n r e a s o n a b l e decision, and did not as it were set about trying
                   to h ave the d e c i s i o n rescinded.                 The context in which they were
                   t h i n k i n g a b o u t this p r o b l e m was that you have got fans coming
                   in in an o r d e r l y c o n t r o l l e d wa y thro u g h the turnstiles, you are
                   going to have po l i c e s h u t t i n g off the gates whe n                   full, and the
                   most likely occasion                w h e n the p r o b l e m w h i c h they had in
                   c o n t e m p l a t i o n was the one I have just mentioned. What nobody
                   had in c o n t e m p l a t i o n    w h e n c o n s i d e r i n g that was, well, what is
                   going to h a p p e n if you get 2,000 outs i d e the ground, you throw
                   o p e n the gates, and off t hey all come d o w n in.                        It is a classic

                                   C r i t i c i s m is made of the w i d t h of the gap between the

                                   If you are g o i n g to put radi a l s in it is ver y important
                         that yo u have got to get p e o p l e out t h r o u g h the tunnel quickly.
                         T herefore, you have got to have s u f f i c i e n t ga p that you are not

                         it is g o i n g to be shut off, that is not seen as so much of a

                m e a s u r e d as it should have b e e n on one span.                  Tha t wa s a fault.

       MR.     TOULSON:          Yes.      The first point is c l e a r l y right.                  We argue
               about 'excessive,' but c l e a r l y the a b s e n c e of b a r r i e r 144, what
               we u n d e r s t a n d the c o n s e q u e n c e of tha t to be is not that there

               tra n s m i t s itself to the o t h e r one, it is that the purp o s e of
B              the removal of 144 is to en a b l e the fans to flow in more
               easily.          Therefore, you are g o i n g to get p r o b a b l y a large
               n u m b e r in w h e n you cut off the t u r n s t i l e and let t h e m all come

               absolutely.           It is si m p l y that we w o u l d not, I think, accept
I              that there is any cl o s e r d i r e c t r e l a t i o n s h i p b e t w e e n 144 and
 C             124A.        T here is the general p o i n t tha t remove 144 to increase
               the flow m e a n s that that m a n y m o r e c o m e in.

               inev i t a b l y gets t r a n s l a t e d on a p a r t i c u l a r barrier.

       MR.     TOULSON:           Tha t     is a b s o l u t e l y right.   I quite accept that,         my
D              Lord.

          MR. TOULSON: My Lord, my last word is to repeat my gratitude
              to your Lordship for allowing me time before we start the
              evidence.  My Lord, I apologise for the length of time
              taken on what was to be a short opening but obviously what
              has been said now will not have to be said later.

    B     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   There is one matter that I hope Iwill
              have help about later and its this: at the moment, the
               Police start off bearing one hundred per cent on
               responsibility; they get nothing unless they show causative
               fault on the part of someone else.  If that is established,
               then there is a balancing exercise to be done.   If the
              Judge is left in this state of mind about the Police part
              °f the state of the evidence, I do not know if something
    C         which ought to have been done was done or not.    It would be
              culpable if it was not done.    How does that affect the
              balance? Does the Judge say, "Well, I do not know and I
              proceed on the footing, therefore, I cannot say it was not
              done? or does he proceed on the footing, "It is the
              Police, when they say the others are at fault and who have
              to demonstrate the balance"?   If they do not show that
              something was done which ought to have been done, then one
    D         finds the balance on the footing that it was not done?
              That is something I hope to have help about later.    Very
              well.   How long do you want?             < n

          MR. TOULSON:             My Lord, may we start tomorrow morning?

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  I know I said we would not start the
              engineering evidence today.  I just wondered whether or not
              there was other evidence we would be able to hear today?

          MR. TOULSON: My learned friend says he has none.                        He is not
*             calling any.

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    I am thinking of Mr. Phillips?

    p     MR. PAYNE:  I must say that I proceeded on the basis that my
              learned friend had asked for an adjournment for the rest of
              today.

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    I see.   So be it.

          MR. PAYNE:  There is actually one point which we can usefully
              clear up at this moment, if I may?  I think it is something
    G         which will prove not to be contentious.  I drew my learned
              friend s (Mr. Toulson) attention to some correspondence
              which has been passing between his solicitors and mine
              about the whereabouts of Mr. Chapman, which still unhappily
              remains unresolved before your Lordship.

                      We have a letter from Dr. Eastwood's solicitors,
                 Reynolds, Porter, Chamberlain, dated the 20th September,
    H            1990, which (if I may be forgiven for not reading it all

          out) eventually comes to the point that they say to us -
          this is after the parties have done a lot of work between
          them, trying to agree the plan which was mentioned to your
          Lordship at an earlier hearing, about the whereabouts of
          various people - "In the circumstances, we are prepared to
          agree the consolidated body plan as being reasonably
          accurate."

               We have, in fact, taken that it is common ground
          therefore that number 67, which according to the index is
          the whereabouts of Mr. Chapman - identified apparently dead
          - is agreed.   This would be a convenient moment in fact to
          make sure of that.  So can I hand these documents to my
          friend? This is something which is entirely agreed between
          the Club and the Police.

   MR.     JUSTICE JOWITT:                Yes.

   MR.    PAYNE: The correspondence has been passing between all                   the
          parties.

   MR.     TOULSON: My Lord, I think we said - if it is not
          contentious, I do not need take your Lordship further -
          that we accept that that is where the body was first found
          when dead.  I think we accept that.

   MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  If that is where it was found when dead,
       the crush in the pen suggests that it was at that spot
       where Mr. Chapman died because there would be little room
       for him to have been moved once he was dead?

   MR. TOULSON: Yes.   I do not think much is going to turn on
       that but it may be - I do not know to what extent bodies
       got moved around during the operations but we will have a
       look at that, but I think that is the extent of the
       evidence and what follows from it will no doubt be a matter
       for submission
   MR. PAYNE:  I do not proceed now to answer.  I was wondering
       whether I was going to have to call the police officer who
       found Mr. Chapman?

   MR. TOULSON:  No. No, I think we have indicated that.  I h3ve
       certainly no objection to my friend calling Mr. Phillips
       and going on or indeed if he wanted to call Mr. Burne and
       get started, as long as I have time, if I might
       respectfully ask for it, before examining?

   MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    Yes, I see.   What is the position Mr.
       Payne?

   MR. PAYNE:  I have prepared on the basis that, as I understood
       my learned friend's application, he wanted today and I have
       not got any other evidence.

   MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  I see. Very well.   I will mention one
       matter relevant to the construction of Annex 'C' (the

                                     about that and 1 think his answer is
                going to be that where the rules admit various

                safety is the one which should be adopted.

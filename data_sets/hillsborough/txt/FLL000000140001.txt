G.H. Mackrell, Esq.,
The Secretary,
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited,
Hillsborough,
SHEFFIELD
S6 1SW


Dear Graham,

     It was our intention for the League to be represented at
the preliminary hearing with Lord Justice Taylor at Sheffield
Town Hall on Friday.

     At a meeting yesterday the Executive Committee of the
Football Association decided to instruct their solicitors,
Freshfields, to jointly represent the interests of the Football
Association and the Football League,  In the event that a
conflict of interest becomes apparent we will of course make a
separate appointment.

     It is appreciated, however, that your club may still wish
to attend in its own right.


                       Yours sincerely,




                          Secretary.

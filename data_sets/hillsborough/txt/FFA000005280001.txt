FA/HILLSBOROUGH

I spoke to John Dyson QC. He would let me have a copy of
the transcripts for the week 12 to 16 June and I would ask
the messenger to stay whilst he delivers his core bundle
back to him. I would send it back to him this afternoon or
tomorrow morning.

He had spoken to Graham Kelly and we had a meeting scheduled
at 3 pm on Thursday 29 June at the FA. There was need to
put in brief submissions to deal with the judge's temporary
recommendations for instance relating to perimeter fencing.
These recommendations would^have to put into effect before
the season starts. It wad^necessarily the case that the
judge would take on board our Phase 2 submission.

He was going up to Sheffield on Wednesday morning and was
having a session with JGW on Wednesday evening to map out
the submissions we would be making. He thought they would
be pretty short. I should ring him tomorrow with my
comments.

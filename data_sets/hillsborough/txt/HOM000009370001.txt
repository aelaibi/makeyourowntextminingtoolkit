      HILLSBOROUGH:    PROGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION

      In Peter Bolton1s absence on leave I attach for consideration a
      draft letter for the Home Secretary to send to John Carlisle MP
      (paragraph 9 of your note of 12 September refers).

      The content overlaps that contained in the draft prepared for
      Mr E d e y , which I have sent to you separately. I have consulted
      F8 Division.       Legal Advisers were consulted on the draft for
      Mr E d e y .

      P R B 1s advice is that in the absence of being able to specifically
      confirm implementation of all the "pre-season" recommendations
      the letter ought not to be given to the pres s.

You asked me whether the Home Office was satisfied with the
response of the football clubs,                         local authorities and others
to the recommendations in the Interim Report of Lord Justice
Taylor's      inquiry       into        the    Hillsborough             tragedy.            I should
perhaps     first of all set out what we expected people to do
or to be doing.


You    will    know       that      our       immediate          action        on    the     day    of
publication of the Interim Report on 4 August was to issue a
circular      letter      with      copies         of     the     report       to    the     police,
local authorities,               other emergency services,                      football clubs
and    to   sports       organisations               urging       them     all       to     take   the
action      required        in    order       to     implement,          as    necessary,          the
Inquiry's      recommendations                 without           delay.             The     circular
letter also reminded local authorities of their power under
the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975                              (the 1975 Act)             for use
if there is judged to be a serious risk to spectators in any
part of a sports ground.


The Home Office           is keeping under                 review,        primarily          through
the police and Fire Service,                       the progress on implementation
of the recommendations at the football league grounds.                                              The
in dications          are        that     all        the        parties        concerned           have
addressed      them       and     have        either       put    them        into     effect       or,
where that was not immediately possible,                                 have the matter in
hand.       There have been some practical difficulties at some
grounds     and     some difficulties                of interpretation.                     This was
only to be expected given the variation between grounds.                                             We
have    helped      to    resolve         them where we             can.         Our      advice     is
that    the   recommendations                 should       be    complied        with       wherever
practicable         but      that       where        an       alternative            solution        is
unavoidable,        it must be one which meets the intention of the
recommendation by providing at least an equivalent degree of
safety.        As     regards       the       reductions           in     ground          capacities
I am satisfied that it is a prudent precaution to impose the
15%     reduction        recommended            by      the      Inquiry       as      an    interim
measure       until       we      can     be       confident            that        the     criteria
affecting the calculations of terrace capacities at football
frounds have been properly applied.


Lord     Justice       Taylor      has     indicated         that    he     will      consider
wh e t h e r    there       should        be     some       national        oversight            or
inspection       of    local      authority          responsibilities           in relation
to safety in sports grounds in stage 2 of his Inquiry.                                       You
will know from your involvement with the Football Spectators
Bill     that    the    Government         has       already    amended        the    Bill       so
that,     if it is considered right, this supervisory role could
be    given     to    the    proposed       Football         Licensing         Authority         in
respect of grounds to which the Bill applies.


Even      so    we     shall       be     taking       up    with     local          or     other
authorities concerned any case which is reported to us where
it appears        that the Report's recommendations                         are not being
implemented.           The option referred to in our circular letter
of     enforcing       the       Report's      recommendations            by    means       of    a
s t at uto ry        instrument          requiring          safety    certificates               to
include mandatory terms and conditions remains open and we
have      not    ruled       it    out.         Whether        further         measures       are
necessary to secure improvements in public safety at sports
grounds        will    be    a    matter       for    decision       when      Lord       Justice
Taylor has published his final report.

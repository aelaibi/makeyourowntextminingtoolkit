Thank you for your letter of 4 December (Kevin Williams death certificate).    We have written
to Mr Dorries as you suggest.

Perhaps I can also respond to your second letter of 8 December, just arrived. We will process
your expenses claim, but it would help if you could fill out the attached forms where I have
marked them and return them to me (apologies for that!).

The Home Secretary has said that he will publish the Judge’s report. I am sure that the Home
Office will send you a copy along with all the other principals.

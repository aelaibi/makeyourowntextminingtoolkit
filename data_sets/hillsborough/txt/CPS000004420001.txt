  Dear Mr Kennedy

  I refer to our meeting with Mr Peter Birts QC, and the letter (copy
  attached) from Dr Eastwoods Solicitors.

  On Monday 1st May 1990 I met with the Solicitors representing Dr Eastwood
  and explained   to them the reason for requesting the interview and pointing
  out the areas   I wished to pursue.

  The response however remains the same and their advice to Dr Eastwood is
  not to answer any further questions in a cautioned interview.  They would
  agree to him responding by way of written questions and answers directed
  through them but that will not achieve the objective and be of little
  value.

  They have asked I point out to you their reasoning based upon Dr
  Eastwood’s instructions. Briefly it is this; he spent in excess of two
  days giving evidence before Lord Justice Taylor and only became a "party"
  in that Inquiry some days after it commenced. He was under great stress
  at the time because his only daughter had died in the February.

  He also faces  now a court appearance in respect of the Civil Action in
  October 1990  and there is the prospect of giving evidence at a future full
  Inquest. His solicitors say Dr Eastwood feels he has done enough by
  producing all of the relevant documentation for the Inquiry in addition to
  his time giving evidence.

  The evidence submitted already is sufficient for the Director of Public
  Prosecutions to make a decision on any alleged criminal offences and
  nothing further can be gained by interview is the conclusion they have
  reached.


                                                                   Continued...




    PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
                                    2   .

I can add nothing to the above that is not already stated in the report to
you on the evidence relating to Dr Eastwood. I would value your advice
and that of Mr Peter Birts QC, albeit I presume it will be the same
conclusion as discussed at our last meeting.

For your information I have arranged to see the Solicitors representing
the other parties at Sheffield on the 8th and 9th May 1990 to disclose the
video and photographic material we intend to feature. At this time I
anticipate being in a position to begin the necessary interviews in
consultation with the Chief Constable Mr Sharp.

Yours sincerely

Detective Chief Superintendent

              Dear Sir,


              Hillsborough Disaster - Criminal Investigation



              Thank you for your letter of 2nd March sent to us on behalf of
              Dr. Eastwood.

              We imagine that your letter reflected a standard form sent to
              all  interested  parties.         It has   nevertheless caused
              Dr. Eastwood considerable concern and disquiet.

              We have advised Dr. Eastwood that we cannot contemplate any
              criminal charges which could possibly be brought against him,
              not least in view of Lord Justice Taylor's         comments at
              paragraph 289 of his Interim Report where he said:


                                        "For his part, Dr. Eastwood is skilled and
                                        experienced   in this   field,  as  already
                                        indicated, and he sought I have no doubt to
                                        act efficiently and professionally in his
                                        advice and practical work. "


              Our view, and Lord Justice Taylor's comments, have brought some
              comfort to Dr.    Eastwood but he remains distressed at the
              prospect,  however remote,   of his being interviewed under
              caution.

              You will know that Dr. Eastwood voluntarily supplied a full
              written statement with supporting documents from his files for




                  Lloyd’s Office: Room 692, Floor 6, Lloyd’s, 1 Lime Street, London EC3M 7DQ. Telephone: 01623 7100 (Ext 4188) Fax: 01929 I960

                                                              Authorised by the Law Society to conduct investment business.

Assistant Chief Constable
West Midlands Police                     -   2-                   9 April 1990



the purpose of the Inquiry.    He did so even though he was made
a party extremely late in the day, indeed many weeks after the
actual Inquiry hearing had commenced.      He gave oral evidence
to the Inquiry for more than 2% days, far longer than any other
witness.    During that period he was questioned by Leading and
Junior Counsel, as the case may be,    forall parties as well as
by Lord Justice Taylor himself.

We cannot conceive that in his Statement and oral evidence, of
which you will have a transcript, Dr. Eastwood did not deal
exhaustively with all matters of relevance.      We cannot see
that a distressing interview under caution could or would add
anything to what Dr. Eastwood has already said in evidence.

Nevertheless, Dr. Eastwood wishes as ever to be co-operative.
In the unlikely event that there is any particular aspect which
you feel may not have been covered adequately in his written
Statement or oral evidence then the most convenient and
appropriate course might be for       you to write to  us with
relevant questions.   Dr. Eastwood willthen be happy to answer
them in writing via ourselves.


Yours faithfully,




REYNOLDS        CHAMBERLAIN

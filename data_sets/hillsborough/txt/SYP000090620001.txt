                 On Saturday the           15th of April            1989 (150489), my tour of duty was 10pm

                 <2200)    to 6 am (0600)             I am a uniformed patrol officer at Dinnington

                 Police Station,          a sub-division of Maltby.



                Because of the FA Cup Semi-Final,                       I booked on duty at 6pm (1800),

                 covering to 6am (0600).                  I was contacted by a WPC from Rotherham at

                6pm    (1800) and because I am casualty bureau trained,                       I was asked to

                 attend the Casualty Bureau at Ecclesfield Training Centre.



                 I arrived there at about 6.20pm                      (1820).    We were given a 'run d o w n 9 on

                 what had occurred at Hillsborough and 3 voluntejjrs were asked for to

                 attend the temporary mortuary at the av mn a sy um . / 1 v o l ^ j a X eered,

                 along with two W P C 's , whom I had never seen b e f h j x t T                   —
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          S3488



We took along with us a number of casualty bureau identification

forms,


                                                           Hrfb'S'l
On arrival at the gymnasium we made ourselves known to D J r ^ f r f t Q E S   who

was in charge at the g y m «



I was overwhelmed at the sight of 83 bodies         laying in rows.     It was

apparent that each body had been given a consecutive number and that a

police officer was assigned to each body,         They were   laid out in rows

of 10 and I believe that another officer was overlooking each row.



Together with DI CHARLES?       I handed out the body forms to each officer

and then afterwards     I Just assisted officers where I could with the

completion of the f o r m s .



The forms had been completed for the 83, when some more bodies arrived

from the hospitals.,     These were also numbered,     assigned an officer and

the forms completed.      The total number of bodies when I left the gym

was 94.



                             omp                     back to the Casualty

Bureau at Ecclesfield.



I remained on duty at the Casualty Bureau until 6am (0600), and also

worked the following day.



Throughout my involvement with the Casualty B u r e a u , everything went

smoothly.    The only real      improvement that could have been provided

would have been a direct phone link between the Casualty Bureau and

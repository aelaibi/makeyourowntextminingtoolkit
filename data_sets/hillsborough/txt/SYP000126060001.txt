BEFORE KICK OFF WE WERE GETTING SQUASHED I WAS FEELING FAINT. WE CLIMBED OVER
THE RAILINGS OUT OF THE MASS OF PEOPLE. OTHERS WERE SCREAMING AND FAINTING
AROUND US. WE TRIED TO HELP PEOPLE OVER RAILING BUT THEY WERE PACKED SO TIGHT
WE COULD NOT PULL THEM OUT. WE WERE THEN PULLED UP INTO THE STAND AND THEN WE
TRIED TO PULL PEOPLE OUT. WE COULD SEE PEOPLE SORT OF FLOATING ABOVE THE
HEADS OF OTHERS IT WAS TERRIBLE TRYING TO CHOOSE WHO TO PICK OUT TO SAFETY.
AFTER THAT I SAT ON THE STEPS AND JUST CRIED IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING. I DID SEE
THE POLICE EVENTUALLY HELP KICK FENCING OUT TO LET PEOPLE OUT AFTER THEY
REALISED SOMETHING WAS WRONG. THERE WERE N 0 ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THE P.A.
SYSJTEM.
I     A SEASON TICKET HOLDER. I STILL HAVE MY TICKET STUB.
I ATTENDED THE MATCH WITH               OF SHEFFIELD UNIVERSITY YOU COULD

THERE WERE NO OTHER PERSONS WITH HIM AT THE TIME.
I THOUGHT THAT THE POLICE WERE SLOW TO REACT INITIALLY WHEN THE CRUSH STARTED
BUT WHEN THEY REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING THEY DID VERY WELL AND I CANNOT
FAULT THEM.
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT THE LIVERPOOL FANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED
MORE TICKETS AND THIS INCIDENT WOULD NEVER HAD HAPPENED.

WE WERE TRYING TO TELL THE FANS TO MOVE BACK. THERE WAS SUDDENLY ANOTHER AND
I FELT THAT THE ONLY WAY OF STAYING UPRIGHT WAS TO HOLD ON TO THE SHOULDERS
OF THE PERSON IN FRONT. BY THIS POINT I COULDN'T SEE THE PITCH, JUST THE
FENCES. I WAS NOW FRIGHTENED FOR MY LIFE.
I COULD SEE THE POLICE WAVING FOR THE FANS TO PUSH BACK AND AT ONE STAGE I
SAW 2 OFFICERS PULLING THE ARMS OF A PERSON TRAPPED IN THE CROWD BUT THEY
WERE NOT ABLE TO PULL THE PERSON OUT.I CAN'T REALLY SAY MUCH MORE I THINK I
Wi^IN SHOCK AND CAN'T REMEMBER SEEING MUCH MORE.                   __

CONTD
I GOT TO THE GROUND AT ABOUT 2:30PM. IT WAS CHAOTIC OUTSIDE THERE WAS NO
QUEUES . PEOPLE WERE PUSHING WITH THERE BEING SO MANY PEOPLE THE CROWD WAS
JUST SWAYING .THERE WERE 2 POLICE ON HORSES BUT ALL THEY DID WAS DIVIDE THE
CROWD UP , DID NOT ORGANISE THEM INTO QUEUES. I DID NOT SEE ANY STEWARDS.
THERE WAS ONE POLICEMAN BY THE TURNSTYLES. I WENT IN THROUGH TURNSTYLE B AND
HANDED IN MY TICKET . A POLICEMAN DID TAKE A PLASTIC BOTTLE OF MILK OFF ME.
AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TURNSTYLE THERE WAS A POLICEWOMAN AND A MAN. THATS
ALL.
ALL YOU COULD SEE WAS THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNELL THERE WAS NOTHING
TO SAY THAT YOU COULD GO LEFT OR RIGHT.
I JKENT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TUNNEL IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR BUT AT THE BOTTOM
I^BwAS PACKED WE WERE BEING CARRIED TO THE FRONT . I REALISED WHAT WAS
HAPPENING AND TOLD YOUR FRIEND TO MAKE OUR WAY TO THE BACK AND TO THE LEFT.
WE WERE STANDING TO THE LEFT OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE GOAL POST. WE WERE ALL
SWAYING . AT ONE POINT I THOUGHTI HAD BEEN HIT IN THE SIDE I TURNED ROUND
AND I SAW THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE BARRIERS.
WE WERE WAITING FOR KICK OFF WHEN A 17 YR LAD JUST FELL INFRONT OF ME. I BENT
DOWN TO TRY AND PICK HIM, UP THE FELLA NEXT TO ME SCREAMED AT ME TO GET BACK
THEN WE BOTH BENT DOWN AND GOT HIM UP AND PASSED UP ABOVE PEOPLES HEADS TO
THE FRONT. I DOUBT THAT HE MADE IT BECAUSE PEOPLE AT THE FRONT WERE FALLING
I STARTED TO GET WORRIED. MY FRIEND HAD SWEAT WAS POURING OFF HIM . I THOUGHT
AT THAT TIME THAT WE WERE GOING DIE.
IT ALL GOES HAZY THEN.
WE GOT TO THE BACK AND I SAW A LAD BEING PULLED UP TO THE STANDS ABOVE. I
MANAGED TO CATCH THE EYE OF THISMAN AND HE PULLED ME UP AND WHEN I WAS UP I
WAS ABLE TO PULL MY FRIEND UP AS WELL.
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AN OVERSPILL PROBLEM . I COULD SEE PEOPLE TRYING TO GET
OVER THE FENCE AT THE FRONT. THERE WERE ONLY A FEW POLICE THERE AND THEY DID
NOT SEEM TO BE DOING MUCH . SOME FANS WRIPPED DOWN THE ADVERT BOARDS AND USED
THEM AS STRETCHERS.                              _—
THE POLICE WERE THEN TRYING TO PULL DOWN THE FENCES ^ L AJIQUND PEOPLE WERE
RECEIVING FIRST AID.

I WAS NOT REALLY SURE WHERE TO GO SO I FOLLOWED THE CROWD DOWN THE TUNNEL,
WHEN I GOT ONTO THE TERRACING BEHING THE GOAL IT WAS VERY CROWDED, I COULD
SEE THAT THE SIDE WINGS WERE RELATIVELY EMPTY AND SO MADE MY WAY TO THE LEFT
OF THE STAND IN ORDER TO GET TO THE WINGS,. I DID NOT REALISE UNTIL I WAS
CLOSE THAT THERE WAS A BARRIER SEPERATING THE SIDE AREA, I WAS WORRIED BY THE
CRUSH AND SO MANAGED TO PUSH MY WAY TO THE BACK OF THE STAND. PEOPLE STANDING
NEXT TO ME GOT SWEPT AWAY BY THE CRUSH.

SEEMED TO GET REALLY CRUSHED, I GOT SEPERATED FROM MY FRIEND, I HAD TROUBLE
KEEPING TO MY FEET.
I HELPED ONE LAD WHO WAS CAUGHT ON THE BARRIER, TO GET FREE, BUT THEN LOOKING
AROUND THERE WAS A SENSE OF FEAR, WE TRIED TO GET A CHANT UP OF" PUSH BACK

PUSH BACK".
SOME POLICE AT THE FRONT WERE ALSO SHOUTING FOR EVERY ONE TO PUSH BACK, THEY
ALSO TRIED TO STOP THE MATCH, AT FIRST THE POLICE TRIED TO STOP THE
PEQELE, BUT WHEN THEY REALISED THAT PEOPLE WERE GETTING HURT THATS WHEN
T H W BEGAN TO HELP PTHEM CLIMB OVER THE FENCE.
AT THE SAME TIME I SAW SOME PEOPLE BEING PULLED UP TO THE STAND ABOVE,
NO ONE WAS INTERESTED IN THE GAME, EVERYONE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE PEOPLE.
PEOPLE SEEMED TO EITHER MOVE TO THE SIDE.
I GOT BACK TO THE BARRIER AND FOUND MY FRIEND, PEOPLE MOVED A WAY A BIT.THERE
SEEMED PEOPLE IN A PILE, I SAW A MAN GOING BLUE I WITH A COUPLE OF
PEOPLE MANAGED TO PULL THE SHIRT OFF AND TOLD HIM TO SIT AND TRY AND BRAETH,
I THEN SAW A GIRL WHO ALSO SEEEMED TO HAVE PROBLEMS BREATHING SHE WAS WITH
HER SISTER, HELD HER UP AND WAS BREATHING OKAY, WE LEFT HER, WE THEN WENT TO
THE FRONT, THERE WAS PEOPLE WAS IN A PILE, WE TRIED TO HELP THEM UP AND
PASS THEM BACK SO THAT THEY COULD BE TAKEN OUT OF THE GROUND.
MOST OF THE PEOPLE HAD GONE FROM GREY TO BLUE, YOU COULD NOT TELLIF THEY
WERE DEAD OR ALIVE. I THOUGHT ONE MAN WAS DEAD BUT I SAW HIM MOVE AND WITH
THE AID OF A POLICE OFFICER I CARRIED HIM OUT. I THINK I CARRIED OUT 5 OR 6
I COULD N'T TELL IF THEY WERE ALIVE OR DEAD, SOME OF THEM HAD URINATED OR
MESSED THERE TROUSERS.
I SAW POUND COINS BUT NO ONE SEEMED INTERESED IN THE MONEY.
ONE GUY WE CARRIED HIM OUT FROM THE TUNNEL AND LAID HIM OUTSIDE HE MIGHT
HAVE INJURIED HIS BACK, BY THAT TIME THERE MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT 15 OR 20
PEOPLE LAID OUT, WITH OTHER PEOPLE GIVING FIRST AID.
WE ATTEPMTED TO GO BACK THORUGHT THE TUNNEL BUT THE POLICE HAD GOT IN COMTROL
SO WE LEFT THEM, AND SAT DOWN TO CALM DOWN.
WE WENT TO THE RIGHT HAND STAND, WE CLIMBED UP THE WALL AND WATCHEDWHAT WAS
GOING ON, IT WAS BY THE POLICE OBSERVATION BOX.
NO ANOWNCMENTS MADE FOR ABOUT 15 OR 20 MINUTES I FEEL SURE THAT IF SOME HAD
BEEN MADE SOONER LIVES MAY HAVE BEEN SAVED.
I WAS WITH                                           LIVERPOOL.
I AM ADVAILABLE MONDAYS FRIDAYS AND WEEK ENDS.

CRUSH, THE GAME HAD ALREADY KICKED OFF AT THIS STAGE,I SAW PEOPLE ATTHE
AREA OF THE GOAL CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE, AND SOME TOTHESIDES    OF THE FENCE
BUT NOT TO MANY.
WE WERE HELPING PEOPLE GOING UP INTO THE STAND, I DON'T KNOWN THE TIME, BUT
IT WAS WHEN I SAW A BODY BEING PASSEWD BACK UP THE TUNNEL THAT I REALISED
THAT SOMETHING WAS SERIOUSLY WRONG, THAT WHEN WE LEFT THE TERRACES AND WENT
BACK DOWN THE TUNNEL.
I STILL HAVE MY TICKET, I LEFT JUST AFTER I SAW THE BODY.

THE DEAD AND INJURIED, WE DID TRY TO GIVE FIRST AID TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN
THE TUNNEL, NEITHER I OR MY FRIENDS WERE HURT.

INFO      » I ARRIVED OUTSIDE THE GROUND AT ABOUT 13.3OH I WENT EARLY TO TRY
            AND BUY A TICKET. ABOUT QUARTER TO THREE I STILL HADN'T GOT A
            TICKET. I WAS STANDING IN THE LEPPINGS LANE ENTRANCE AQND GOT
            PUSHED IN WITH ALL THE CROWDS. THE CROWDS OUTSIDE WERE TERRIBLE
            AND I COULDN'T MOVE. I GOT PUSHED THJROUGH THE TURNSTILE AND
            THERE WAS A POLICEMAN ON EVERY TURNSTILE. THEY SAW US GETTING
            PUSHED THROUGH BUT

LOOKED THE OTHER WAY. IT WAS CHAOS AT THIS TIME. I WENT THROUGH THE
TURNSTILE WITHOUT A TICKET. WHEN I MANAGED TO GET THROUGH IT WASQUITE EMPTY.
I THEN WENT DOWN THE TUNNEL WHICH WAS EMPTY BUT COULD SEE THE GROUND WAS
PACKED. ME AND MY MATES PUSHED OUR WAY THROUGH TO THE SIDE OF ONE OF THE
PENS BEHIND THE GOAL AND MANAGED TO GET DOWN TO THE FRONT. THE PLAYERS HAD
JUST STARTED TO COME OUT. ME AND MY 4    MATES DECIDED TO CLIMB OVER THE
FENCE INTO THE PEN TO MY RIGHT. ME AND ONE MATE MANAGED TO GET OVER BUT THE
OTHERS GOT STUCK ON THE WAY. ME AND MY FRIEND THEN STARTED HELPING OTHER
PEQBLE OVER BECAUSE IT WAS SO PACKED. WHERE I HAD STOOD PREVIOUSLY I COULD
Se R ’HAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING CRUSHED THEY JUST COULDN'T MOVE, AND I NOW
KNOW THAT SOME OF THEM DIED. I SAW AN OLD MAN RUBBING HIS HEART AND I THINK
HE WAS HAVING A HEART ATTACK. I THEN GOT OUT ONTO THE PITCH BECAUSE A GATE
WAS OPENED. I WALKED ALONG THE FRONT AND COULD SEE THE PEOPLE GETTING
CRUSHED AND KILLED. ME AND MY FRIEND WALKED TOWARDS THJE FENCE AND STARTED
PULLING AT THE IT BUT COULDN'T LOOSEN IT. I THEN SAW MY FRIENDS INSIDE
GETTING CRUSHED THEY LOOKED TERRIBLE THEY WERE UP AGAINST THE MIDDLE
FENCING AT THE BOTTOM .. THE POLICE LEANED OVER THE FENCE SEPERATING THE PENS
AND GOT THE THREE OF THEM OUT. THEY WERE VERY NUMB, BUT OTHERWISE ALRIGHT
AND DID NOT ATTENDE HOSPITAL. I DO NOT WISH TO GIVE YOU MY FRIENDS NAMES AS
THEY DID NOT HAVE TICKETS EITHER AND I DO NOT KNOW IF THEY WANT ME TO GIVE
THEIR DETAILS TO YOU. HOWEVER I WILL GO AND SEE THEM NOW AND ASK THEM TO
CONTACT YOU.

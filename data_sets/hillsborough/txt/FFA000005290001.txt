FA/HILLSBOROUGH
JGW had an urgent query from Sheffield.    Did the FA know
that when they invited Sheffield United   to be a venue for
the semi-final that they did not have a   safety certificate?
I said I would find out and get back to   Adrian.
Engaged 10 minutes including dictation
Subsequently attending            and leaving a message and
saying the invitation from th6 FA was on 24 February and the
response from Sheffield United was on 8 March. Presumably
the FA would not have known that a valid safety certificate
was not in force otherwise they would not have asked them to
stage the tie.

            To:        H.M* Chief Inspector of Constabulary

            Subject:   INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONS BY LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR


            Further to our telephone conversation of 23rd August, 1989 I
            caused enquiry to be made of all forces, England and Wales
            with regard to the extent to which, in broad terms, the
            recommendations of the Taylor Report have been implemented
            and any areas of difficulty which may have been highlighted.
            Consequent upon the publication of the Interim Report and
            Home Office Circular 68/1989, police forces and football
            clubs have accepted the recommendations and responded with
            speed, enthusiasm and commitment in their undertaking to
            implement same. Nonetheless a number of the recommendations
            continue to promote discussion and/or reservation and I shall
            confine my remarks to those which have elicited most comment.
            Recommendation 4 deals with the need for "....a written
            agreement between the police and the club setting out their
            respective responsibilities for crowd safety and control...."
            It is fair to say that there has been a divergence of opinion
            on the content of the written agreement and the form it
            should take.   Many clubs however have exchanged agreements
            with the forces concerned and the remainder have set out
            mutually agreed parameters outlining essential areas of
            responsibility which will be the basis for immediate use and
            be subject of further scrutiny by the appropriate legal
            offices.    It is not anticipated that such scrutiny and
            eventual agreement will be resolved immediately and further
            liaison will be arranged, as necessary. At this stage there
            has been no intimation that agreement will            not be
            forthcoming.
            Recommendations 8 and 9 which deal with the requirements for
            all gates (in perimeter fences) opening onto the pitch, to be
            fully opened and manned during the course of the match, have
            resource and public disorder implications that have been
            highlighted by a significant number of forces. Indeed there
            has been a decision at two grounds (Bolton and Millwall) that
            much flexibility will be deployed in this regard. Both these
            recommendations and that at 28 (which deals with the
            provision of police reserves for immediate deployment) pose
            potentially large increases in charges for police presence at
            the club concerned and significant and continued resistance
            has been experienced by ground commanders in some force
            areas.
            Recommendations 21, 31 and 32 deal with the installation of
            close circuit television, enhanced radio communication and
            operators to handle same and the provision of a separate
            system of land line, have again, cost implications for the
            clubs which have been resisted.
                                                            continued/

 h             Nevertheless it is fair to report that the focussing of minds
               engendered   by    the   implications   of    these   interim
               recommendations has not impaired, as I indicated earlier,
               relationships between the Police Service and the football
               clubs. Suggestions have continued to be made by forces and
               are being collated by the A.C.P.O.         General Purposes
               Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events, on such
             . matters as colour-coding for exit gates, national training
               videos and a national system of hand signals should radio
               communications be rendered ineffective.
              I have no doubt that you will continue to be apprised of
              developments with regard to these recommendations after the
              next meeting of the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at
              Sporting Events.    A meeting has been speedily arranged for
              Friday, 8th September, 1989 at Greater Manchester Police
              Force Headquarters.

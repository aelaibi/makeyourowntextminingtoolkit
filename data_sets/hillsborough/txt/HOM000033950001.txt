Thank you for your letter o f 21 November about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny into the
Hillsborough Disaster. I am very sorry for the delay in replying.

The terms o f reference which I have given Lord Justice Stuart-Smith for the Scrutiny will
allow him to establish conclusively whether any material evidence was overlooked in the
consideration o f the causes of the disaster or the consideration o f criminal or other
proceedings. As you point out, his terms o f reference also enable him to recommend any
other action which should be taken in the public interest. His terms o f reference are, therefore,
very wide indeed and I am confident that they have allowed him to carry out a full scrutiny of
the evidence submitted by the families and others.

I am sure you will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the
detailed issues you raise in your letter, many o f which fall within the remit o f the Scrutiny. As
I have indicated before, I will make public the advice given by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in
his report, and will take whatever action is needed in the event that he suggests material
evidence about the disaster has been overlooked. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has indicated that
he hopes to deliver his report shortly.




                                                                  /

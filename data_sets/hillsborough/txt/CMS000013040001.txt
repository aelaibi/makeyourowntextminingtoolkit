     A report on the implications for clubs of a reduced capacity of 15% in terraced
     areas.


     The list on the following page shows the clubs in Division One and their current
     capacities (as at May 1989), together with the likely new capacity, following
     a reduction of 15% for standing areas.

    When compared with last season's attendances, these figures show that there
         n° caPa c ity matches In the First Division last season and only 8 matches
    m the First Division produced attendances in excess of the likely new capacity

    It is surprising that there were no capacity attendances last season. However,
    I think it is fair to say that the segregation and crowd control arrangements
    already in force (i.e. sterile zones etc.) will prevent the full capacity, as
    contained in the safety certificate, being reached.

    As an example of this, .the Littlewoods Cup tie between Arsenal and Liverpool
    on 9th November, 19SS, was widely reported^to have attracted a sell-out crowd
    with 3 jto 5 thousand people locked out. : . Tire attendance was MTQ29, yet the'
    ■capacity at Arsenal is shown as 57,000*              '

    The table attached shows that only 8 -‘matches would have been affected by the
    reduction in terraced areas. However, the" likely new capacity figures are only
    projections and it remains to be seen whether the local authorities opt for
    generally lower capacities, which would obviously bring more matches into this
    category*

    The figures do not include FA. Cup ties.

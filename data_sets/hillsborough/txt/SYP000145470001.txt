        (2 )   It w a s obvious that the Police thought th ere had been a

               crowd fight which spilled onto the pitch?                     fans were

               climbing over the fencing and the Police were trying to

               stop them running up the pitch towards the Nottingham

               Forest end.

        (3)    the communication system seemed absolutely terrible.

               seemed for the first 20 minutes that the                       fans were doing

               ail tne w o u ,   carry One dead and injured                   from thepitch     and

        there.     The fans were exchanging verbal abuse and there was

        were caused by a wall       collapsing.

         other 'than climbing.             Why 'weren’t they directed to the right

Q38,    IS THERE ANYTHING           THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

        TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?



        <’i)   fhere is a need for much better                 communication,        people need

               to know what         is happening.         ihe loudspeaker systems are

               word,

        (c.)   1 think       that     one person should             beresponsible for the

               control       of the occasion,        ie. a match marshall           who would        be

               in charge and he would             tall the referee when he could

               start and not        before.      He would also be totally in charge

                   hospitality.    He would be in absolute charge of everything

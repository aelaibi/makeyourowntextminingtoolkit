            At    8 a.m.         on S a t u r d a y ,            15th       April,          1989,       I    paraded         at     Attercliffe

            Police          Station.

            At       9 a.m.       I atended                a    briefing          at    West       Bar       Police          Station       where       we

            were       informed             of       our       duties       for       the    forthcoming                 day.       With       other

            officers             I was          in    serial          13,       the    serial          Sergeant           was     Police        Sergeant

            840       Wright          and       Inspector             Dews      was     in       charge          of    serial       13 a n d     others.

            At       9.40    a.m.          we    arrived             at    Midland          Station,             our     duties      were       to    escort

            Liverpool             fans          from       the       Midland          Station          and       place       them    on    buses

            provided             by    t he      South          Yorkshire             Passenger             Transport           Executive            and

            from       there          they       were          taken       to    Hillsborough.                    The     fans      were       escorted

            on       the    buses          by    two       Police          Officers.

            The       first       train          arrived             at    10.20       a.m.       and       the       fans    were       put    on    the

            buses.              Some       of    the       fans       protested             at    this       asking          what    they       would       do

            on       arrival          at    the       ground          at    such       an    early          time.

            Later          trains          arrived             and    still       fans       were       protesting              about      being       put

            on       the    buses.              Several          of       the    fans       had    a    large          amount       of    canned       beer

            with       them,          this       was       being          taken       from       them       by    th e    officers         searching

            fans       prior          to    getting             on    the       buses.

            Later          on    in t h e        morning             with       Police       Constable                1632    Smith,       I went          onto

               the    platform             of    the       Midland          Station          to     prevent            Liverpool          fans
                                                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                                                             R167

wandering           about       inside          the       station.               A      lot    of       the    fans        were

attempting              to    leave    by       other          exits        to       avoid         the     compulsory                 bus    trip.

I    continued           these       duties          until          about        1.1D         p.m.

At    this     time          with    Police          Constable              1632         Smith          and    Police           Sergeant

2235    Gutcher,              I accompanied                a    bus       full          of    Liverpool             fans        from        the

Midland        Station          to    Hillsborough.                       The        Liverpool            fans        were       all        dropped

off    at    t he       Leppings       Lane          end       of    the       ground,             although           I remember              a

couple       of     fans       wanted       to       get       off        prior         to    this       saying        they       had

arranged           to    meet       friends.              These       requests                were       denied.

On    arrival           at    Leppings          Lane       I was          surprised                by    the    large           amount        of

people       who        were    milling          about          outside              the      ground,          they        were       just

hanging       around           and    it    did       not       appear           as      though          they were              being

Policed.            A    large       number          of    these          fans,          I would          say       the     majority              were

drinking           beer       from    cans.

After       t he    fans       had    got       from       the       bu s,       with         1632       and    2235,           I made        my

way    from        Leppings          Lane       to    the       Police          Room.              We    went       down        Vere       Road

and    into        Penistone          Road.           As       I walked             along          Penistone           Road       towards

the    Police           Room    I    can    remember                the    perimeter                walls       of     the       houses           in

Penistone           Road       were    littered                with       empty          beer       cans       and     bottles.               Again

fans    were        wandering          about          but       not       as    many          as    at    the       Leppings           Lane        end

of    the    ground.

When    we    got        to    the    Police          Room          I got       a       drink       and       sat    down        outside           the

Police       Room.            Whilst       I was          sat       having          a    drink          there       was     a    constant

stream       of     prisoners          being          brought             into          the    Police          Room.            I do       n ot

know    which           team    these       supporters                had       come          to    see    but       most        of    the

prisoners           were       the    worse          for       drink.

Sergeant           Wright       arrived          a    short          time       later,             I saw       him     go       into       t he    gym

area    then        into       the    Police          Room,          when       he       came       out    of       t he    Police          Room

he    informed           us    we    had    a    job       to       do.

With    Police           Constable          1632 an d               others,             I went          from    t he       area       of    t he
                                                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                                                 R 1 67

Police          Room      and     under       the    North          Stand          along          the       passageway.

Once       in     the      passageway             there       was       a    lot       of    smoke          and     I thought                this

was    the        reason         why    we    had       been       called          out.           As    a     serial          we      made        a

search          of    the       toilets       to    the       right          of    the       passageway                 and       also       the       bar

areas        and      food       selling          premises          on       the       left       of    the        passageway.                    About

half       way       along       the    passageway             on       the       left       hand       side        I came             to    a    room

where        pies       were      being       prepared,             I saw          smoke          was       coming           from       this

ro o m .        I saw       a    cardboard          tray       on w hich               pies       were        stacked             and       had       been

scorched.

After        this,         with    Police          Constable                1632       and    other           officers,                I was          only

aware        of      Police       Constable             1632       at       this       time       but       know        other          officers

were       with       us,       I went       to    area       ’N W ’ a n d         then       through              to    the          area       near

to    gate        ’A ’ .        Once    at    this       location             I saw          that       there           was       a    large

number          of    fans       still       outside          the       ground.              I saw          through           a       glass       p ane

to    t he      right       of    the     gate      that       people             on    the       other        side          were       being

crushed and                they    appeared             to    be    in a          very       distressed                 and       frightened

state.

I then          remember          Sergeant          Wright          going          to       the    steward              who       was       manning

this       gate,          Sergeant        Wright         appeared             to       know       this        man.           Sergeant

Wright          asked       the    steward          to       open       the       gate,       but       he     refused                stating          if

we    opened          the       gate    we    would          all    be       crushed          in       t he    rush.              I did          not

hear       anything             over    the       radio       system          as       I was       not        in    possession                   of    a

radio .

After        this         I went       again       with       Police          Constable                Smith        to       the       area

behind          turnstiles             1- 1 6 .     I there             saw       Inspector             Bennett              standing             on

the     roof         of    the    building          which          holds          the       turnstiles,                 he    was       pulling

people          from       in    front       of    the       turnstiles                up    over       t he       wall       and       into          the

ground.              I saw       that     some      of       the    people             who    were          being        pulled             over       the

wall       had       shoes       missing          and    appeared             to       be    in a       very        distressed

state.             I could        see     through            the    turnstiles                that          there        were          thousands
                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                      R 1 67

of    people       still       waiting          to    get       into      the       ground.

Whilst       I was       at    this       location          I was         verbally             abused       by       a    great       number

of    people       who     were      mentioning             the      crush          outside          the    ground.

I    cannot       remember          what       time       it w a s     but      at       one    stage       I    looked          at    my

watch       and    it w a s        exactly       3    p.m.

From    this       location,             again       with       Police         Constable             Smith,          I made       my       way

to    the    area       in L e p p i n g s      Lane       where       the      tunnel         and     toilets             are.        As      I

made    my w ay         into       this    area       there       was      a    stream          of    liquid             running       down

along       the    edge       of    the    wall.           I looked            up    towards          the       toilets          and       saw

a    number       of    men    urinating             up    against         the       wall.

I have       performed             duties       in    this       location            on    a    number          of       previous

football          matches          and    I have          never      seen       this       behaviour             before.              Also

when    I have          performed          duties          at    this      location,             the       main          task    is    to

search       incoming          supporters.                 These       supporters               were       not       being       searched

and    I cannot          remember          seeing          any    Police            in    this       area.           Again,       both

Police       Constable             Smith       and    myself         suffered             verbal       abuse             about    the

crushing          outside          the    ground.           I can         also       remember          whilst             I was       in

this    area,          a man       and    woman       coming         to    us,       I think          they       had       either          on e

or    two    children          with       them.           They    asked         us       how    they       could          get    to    t he

front       to w a t c h      the    game.           Police       Constable               Smith       indicated             to    t he

tunnel       and       said    words       to    the       efect       that,         "A ll      those       are          trying       to    get

to    the    f r o n t ."

I    then    made       my wa y      to    the       blue       gate      ’C* ,      again       with       163H.           It w a s

then    an     Inspector            or    Chief       Inspector            stated          words       to       the       effect       ’o p e n

that    g a t e ’ indicating               towards           gate      ’B ’ .        With       Police          Constable             Smith

I went       to    gate       ’B ’ , t h e      steward          refused            to    open       the    gate          saying       he

would       not    take       responsibility.                    Another            steward          then       turned          up a nd

opened       the       padlock       which       secured          the      gate.           I then          pulled          at    one       half

of    the    gate       with       Police       Constables             1632         Smith       and    I think             1790

Craighill.              I think          two    stewards          were         pulling          at    the       other       half       of
                                                                                                                                       PAGE            5

the    gate.        Due        to       the    pressure           on    the    gate          they       were       difficult           to

open.

The    gate       was     not       fully       open,        I would          estimate             they       were     open

approximately              6-8          feet.        There        was    an    initial             surge       when        the    gates

were    first        opened             and    I ca n       remember          telling             supporters           to    slow

down.       The     gates           were       only     open       for    at       the       most       a minute           and    after          the

initial        surge       the          flow    of     supporters             stopped             and    so     the    gate       was

closed      again.

As    the    gates        were          closed,        I saw       a    number          of    officers             running        towards

area    ’S ’ a g a i n         with       Police        Constable             Smith,          I    ran       on w i t h     the

officers.            I expected                crowd        trouble.

I went       into        the       South       Stand        via    a    gate.           I    can       remember        I had       no

trouble        getting             to    this     location,             there       were          no    more       fans     at    this

location          than     on       a    normal       match        day.

Once    in t h e         South          Stand     I made          my    way    down          an    aisle        towards          the

pitch.         It    was       then       I saw a           number       of    fans          on    the       pitch    and        I thought

there       had     been       a    pitch       invasion.

I    carried        on    and       made       my way        onto       the    pitch          and       saw     people       jumping

over    t he      perimeter              fence       onto     the       pitch.              I also       saw       fans     from       the

terracing           being          pulled       up     into       the    seated             area.

I made       my way        to       the       area     on    the       pitch       in       front       of    t he    Leppings          lane

end    goal.         As    I       looked       at     the    crowd       I saw             people       crushed           against          t he

perimeter           fence.              I saw     one       female       whose          face       was       side     on    to    the

fence       and     her    hand          was    near        her    face,       her          face       had    turned        blue       and       it

was    apparent           she       was       dead.

At    this     stage       I felt             confused        and       shocked             and    I d i d n ’t k n o w          what       to

do.     When        I came          to    my    senses        I went          to    a       gate       in t h e      perimeter          fence

near     to a r e a       ’C S ’ .        I assisted              with    other             officers          to     pull    fans       from

the     terracing.                 At    first       the     injured          were          being       pulled        out    via       this

gate,       I also        assisted              fans    who       had     clambered               over       the     fence.        The

majority            of       these         people          appeared             to    have       minor           injuries,          some      of     t he

 people        were          obviously            in a         very        deep       state          of     shock.

After        these           people         had      been           removed,          other          officers           in    the     terracing

started            to    carry            people      to       the       gate.         These          people           were    obviously

dead.          I    carried               12-15      people          who        were     dead         out     of       the    terracing,            I

was     shocked              to     see     how      many           people       were       in       fact     dead.           After       they      had

been     lifted              from     the       terracing                the     dead       people          were        laid    out      on

advertising                  hoarding           and        then       carried          away          from     the       scene.

Out     of    all        the        dead       people          I carried              out    of       the    terracing,             I can          only

remember           one,           he w a s      an    old       well       built         man         with     grey       hair,      he     was

wearing        brown              coloured           trousers.                 I can        remember             him     because         I was

with     another               unknown          officer             and    we     were       having          trouble           carrying

hi m.        Due        to    this,        a young             lad,       I believe              a    Liverpool              supporter,

came     and       helped            us    carry        him.

The     time       appeared               to    fly     by      and       I can r e m e m be r             someone           telling          me    we

had     been       on        the     pitch        for      about          two        hours.           All    the       bodies had          been

taken        away        by       this     time       and       I remember               hearing            over       the     P.A.      that       the

match        had    been            abandoned.                 Fans       started           to       leave       the    ground.           I can

remember           there            were     still         a    lot       of    fans        on       the    pitch.

Serial        13 w a s            reformed           and       Inspector             Dews        told       us    to    leave       the    ground

and     go    onto           Penistone           Road.              We    left       the     ground          via       exit     *0’ and            went

onto     Penistone                  Road.        Once          on    Penistone             Road        I supervised              Liverpool

fans     onto       a        b us    and     then       travelled               with        them       to    the       Midland        Station.

Two     fans       requested               to    leave          the       bus    in    the       area        of    Park       Square,         this

request        was           denied        and       all       the       fans    were        dropped             off    at    Midland

Station.            Once            there       I performed                duties          supervising                 Liverpool          fans

into     the       station.

With     regard              to     the    stewards             in       the    ground,              I have       worked       numerous

football           matches            at       both     Hillsborough and                     Bramall             Lane.         It a p p e a r s

              I am     originally           a Liverpool           person and           have     supported Liverpool                   all     my

              life.         I still       have     relatives          in L i v e r p o o l    and    they         got me    a ticket

             f r o m L i v e r p o o 1.

                                                                                                                                  SI 9 5 5

I travelled            to S h e f f i e l d             by m y s e l f     by car a l o n g         the Ml,         arriving           in

S h e f f i e l d at a b o u t        11.20             am    (1120       hrs)       after        a trou ble free          journey.




I had arranged               to m e e t         5       friends        from L i v e r p o o l       on   the        corner       of

Leppings         L n at a r o u n d         12          midday        (12 0 0 hrs).




I got         some    fish and          chips           and     sat       on a w a l l       and    the      five ar rived,
                                                                                                          r./'
about         12.45    pm    ( 1 2 4 5 h r s).               Whilst        I     waited I ch^fted              to    fans        a n d all

appeared         to    be    good       natured.



I did         initially          park m y           car      by the        Owl      Public        House       but    realised          I was

some      distance          away      and moved                it    closer          to a s t r e e t     I     think       is    called

Wadsworth            Ave.        I walked            from       there          to    the    ground amongst               the     Forest

f an s    without          any    problems.
                                                        /
                                                    /
Although         public          houses/close                  to    the       ground       were     closed         I sawF o r e s t

fans      drinking          o u t s i d e / the          Owl    Public           H o u s e , but     I d i d n ' t see         any

drunkeness            but    some       Fans         h ad      drunk       quite        heavily.




The      five    friends          met      me       about       12.45          (1245       hrs)    after       they      had

e;<perienced           problems            on       the      journey           from Liverpool.



Four      of    the    others         had       tickets             for    the       standing       area       of L e p p i n g s      Ln

myself         and                went      to       look       for a          drink       but    couldn't          find    one,       so at

about         1.40    pm    (1340       h r s ) we           walked        down       to    the L e p p i n g s     Ln     end.        I

stewards        in the        seated area                but       I cannot         say       I noticed           stewards          at    the

rear    of     the     stand.



On    taking      up our       seat       we       both       remarked            that    the       c e nt r e    part      behind        the

At    that     time     there       were       small          surges       and      the       c r o w d was       s t ill    moving

Over    the     n e x t 3 0 minar or               so    the       fans    continued            to     enter       that      section

and    the    density         of    the      crowd           got    greater        and        I noticed           that      the     waves

of    fans    moving         forward         continued              but    they      did       not     go   back        h al f     as

much.

      section       behind        the      goals    seemed           j>ul 1 to         capacity and                 the       flanks        still

      were    relatively             empty.        At    th^fX t i m e          a    lot     of    people must                 have       been

      worried       as     fans      were    tryityif to          climb         over       the     fences           into       the    f l a nk s ,

      but    certain Police                Officers           were      preventing              too      many       doing       this.




      This    situation           conlfinued up u n t i l                k ic k      off     and      I wondered               just       how

      many    more       people/would           enter          this      section,            as    it s e e m e d         to    be    bursting

      to    capacity.



      As    the    game     started         people       in the a r e a              I was        in w e r e        singing          and

      shouting        and      everything          seemed         to     be     fine,        following              a    couple       of

      corners        by N o t t s     Forest       I could           see       that       fans w er e          trying          to    climb

      off    the     pitch,       I could        see     Police          officers            still         pushing            fans    back

seemed          to    be w o r k i n g         hard    to       get    fans       out.

me    that       it m a y        become         something             greater       than       it w a s    at    the    time,

mainly          feelings           of a n g e r       at    the F o r e s t        fans       taunts,      coupled with              the

Police          presence           becoming           confrontative                in n a t ur e ,       that    was    quickly

sets       of    fans,          who     h ad    hitherto          been       friendly          and      together.           This

togetherness                soon        returned and              coinciding             with    the      realisation          by     the

       myself          b a c k at        the         ground wanting                to    help,         and went             back        into    the

        stand,         in the N o r t h               Stand         near     to    the       West       Stand.




        It w a s       no w    that        I saw         one        man     in    particular             c limbing            over       the    fence       in

       what      seemed a            very            tired      condition,              he    then       staggered             towards          me a n d

       On      reflection             just           before         we    left     the       first       time w h e n          things          could

        have     got       nasty         I s aw a P o l i c e m a n               carrying             a young          bo y a b o ut       10 y rs        of

       a g e , along           the       pitch and              the P o l i c e m a n         wa s      distressed and                   crying.




       After         seeing         th e    man        I described                fall       I left          the     ground and went                  to my

        car,     and      after          a time          drove           home     from Sheffield                   having        to      stop       twice

       on      the     Motorway            because             I felt        too       stunned          to    drive and was                 physically

       shaking.               I arrived               h om e    about        7    pm    ( 1 900        hrs).




       My      feeling        about         the        whole         incident           is t-tfat t h e r e w a s              no       senior       or a n y

       way      to     get     things           done.




                                                                                                                                               'S

         The      one     strong           point       I would          raise           to    criticise         whoever           was

         responsible                 for a l l o c a t i n g       theyldverpool              fans    the L e p p i n g s         Ln    end    of

         the      g r o u n d , when            you    take    is»/ffo a c c o u n t     th e    vast      difference             in the

         numbers          of     fans          that    supiftrt a n d a t t e n d            both    grounds,         it s e e m e d      common

         sense       to a l l o c a t e          th e JBpion H o p          for    the       standing       Liverpool             fans.




         I would          say        that       due    to    the    fact a        lot    of L i v e r p o o l     fans       could       not       get

         tickets          prior           to    the    Saturday          it w o u l d    encourage          them      to     go    to the

         ground          to    try a n d         see    the m a t c h       by w h a t e v e r      means     possible.




         Over       the       past        few year s         I have       had     the    feeling        that      something             similar

         to       this    could           have     h a p p e n e d at     l a r g e ^ m .               Further         to    this

         observation                 I would          say    that       Hillsborough            is far      outdated          t o take         a

         50,000          plus        crowd and          that       it    is w r o n g    to     expect      that a         ground        that

         normally             h as     15000       to 2 0 0 0 0     every       other        week    and    for     one      m a t c h a year

         handle          the     vast          crowd    of a semi           final,       both       in a    physical          and

         administrative                    sense.

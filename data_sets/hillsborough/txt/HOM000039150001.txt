                 INTERIM STATEMENT RELATING TO A COMPLAINT AGAINST
    ^                 AN OFFICER OF THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE

{
    Following the tragedy at the Hillsborough stadium on 15 April 1989 Mr D A Lackev
    made the following complaints against PC P E Smith:-

         The police officer standing on the pitch side of Gate 3 facing the crowd should have
         opened the gate when asked because it would have saved the life of some
         supporters:

         When the police officer did open it he pushed one lad back into the crowd.

    The m atter was referred to the Police Complaints Authority under Section 87(l)(a)(i) of
    the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The Authority decided to supervise the
    investigation under Section 89(l)(a) of the Act and approved the appointment of Chief
    C o n stab le L Sharp of th e C um bria C on stab u lary as the In v e stig a tin g O ffic e r.

    The overall investigation has examined 9560 questionnaires, 5341 statem ents, 2392 sets
    of docum ents including 71 hours of video reco rd in gs, 2411 pho to g rap h s and the
    transcripts of the 174 persons who gave evidence to the Lord Justice Taylor enquiry.

    The Investigating Officer's final report covering these complaints was received by the
    Authority on 2 August 1990. The report was supported by 109 statem ents, video
    recordings of the events taking place, photographic evidence, plans of the stadium,
    together with copies of tape recordings and transcripts of the interviews with PC P E
    Smith.

    The complaints have been thoroughly investigated to the satisfaction of the Police
    Complaints Authority.

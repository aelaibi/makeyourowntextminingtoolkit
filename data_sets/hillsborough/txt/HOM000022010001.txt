             Dear Sirs,



             We have been instructed by a number of families of persons killed in the
             Hillsborough tragedy.

              They would like us to represent them on the Public enquiry and we should be
              kind enough if you would let us know whether the chairman is prepared
              to make any order regarding payment from Central funds of the cost of legal
              representation of these families.

             We await hearing from you.




              Yours faithfully,

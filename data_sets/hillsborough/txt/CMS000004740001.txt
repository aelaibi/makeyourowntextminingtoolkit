           Following publication of the interim report on the Hillsborough disaster,
           this Committee has been asked by several members of the BMA, for guidance
           regarding work as a football club medical officer or 'crowd doctor', the
           employment of the latter, as you know, has been recommended in the above
           report.

           As we obviously wish to give our members up-to-date information, we should
           be grateful to receive your views as to whether, and if so how, the
           recommendations of both the interim and final report are to be implemented.

           I look forward to hearing from you and would thank you for your help.

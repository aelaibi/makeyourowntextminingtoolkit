a l r e a d y a number       of Liverpool       fans w a ndering about,           some making         their

way to the        ground,        others    walking     in completely the          opposite

direction.        We were a sked           by quite a number of these             fans where        the




At    1215pm we were             requested by our serial            Inspector     to the J u n c t i o n of

P e n i s t o n e R o a d h ad   i n c reased quite     considerably.         I n o t i c e d t h a t q u it e

a majority        of the younger           fans were      carrying      cans and bottles           of beer,

the    requests       for    open    pubs/off       licence^ also       grew,

The    steady stream of fans                continued    to    grow until       at about 2 . 1 5 pm

<1415)     a large group of s u p p o r t e r s / c a m e       down Penistone Roa d e s c orted

fav officers        both on foot and rnourVted. Host                 of these     fans were        in very

these     fans were also            carrying    packs     of beer,      drinking      it as    they

walked,      a few spraying           it over other members             of their      group.     After

this    group,      the     number    of fans       travel ling along P e n istone Road             never

really d e creased the m a j o r i t y heading                towards    the ground       but quite a

few walking against                the flow asked       “any spares       lads."      "Any s p a r e s ’1 As

time went        past the general           demeanour      of the     crowd     became more

excitable and a number                of the fans were          running     or jogging        I was

c o n s t a n 1 1y te 11 .ing them to slow down as              some we r e f a 1 ling ove r i n

At about 2. 4 0 p m         <1440)    we were a p p r o a c h e d   by our Serial S e r g e a n t        who

was    in possession of a personal                   radio,    he told us that         it sounded          like

there was        fighting         in the   ground.

We a rr i ve d at t he 'C r ou n d at about             11.30 am       (1130 hrs);           at this       point

it was        fairly quiet         outside    the Ground,        w it h both Liverpool               and Forest

fans mingl in g         together.

We d e ci de d to go for a walk as                  it was     too    early to go           into the Ground,

so we     just headed away from the area.                       I don't      know where we went,                it

must     have      been four       or five miles        in total.          It was a nice day and we

saw no        problems wit h viol ence             or a ny thing     of the       like,      no pubs were

open,     and      I only saw a few          people     drinking       c a n s ; we     in fact      bought a

couple        of   cans from an off-licence.                 It was       such a nice day and

e v e r yb o d y was    good humoured.                                         ^

We    got back       to the G r ou n d at about           1.45 pm      (1345 h r s ? , and was amazed

to find so many            people        outside    the Ground.           It looked as          if no bo dy was

going     through the         turnstiles,          there were        so man y there.            I couldn't

see any         signs    d irecting       us to w hich t urnstiles           to go          to, so   I went

over     to     a P ol i ce m an   on horseback.           I don't        know him, and a sk ed him

where     to go - my ticket was               for Leppings Ln,             standing         (value £6.00).

The P o l i c e ma n just       looked at me and said a ny wh er e - so I went                          over    to

w here    the      crush was       starting,       w hi ch w ou ld    be where        the    cast    iron gates

start,        and tried to make my way thrtfugh.                     At    this    point       I was more       or

less     on     the f ar th es t Xr i gh t point of the entrances                  by     the fence        to the

but the Fol i ce^Sqo,k no                 notice.    At this      point    I could see           people      being

crushed and hurt;                  people were      lifting     children up onto           the    perimeter

wall     to get           them awa y from the        crowd.      I saw a girl       near to me fall

over     but        couldn't        do a ny th i ng to help her as        she d i sa pp ea re d out of

Once     I got through,              I went    to the    left    by a wall where           there were          some

hot-dog        sellers and just             sat down on the f l o o r ^ o   get my brea th back.

I stayed           there        for about    five minutes,       and at abou^\ 2 . 2 0 pm (1420 rrrs)

I got        up and wa l ke d towards           the tunnel       to go to the stands.

At this        point        I could see       no signs    in the Ground directing                 us where          to

go.      I was        just       following    the map on the back         of my ticket,           and was

able     to see           the    pitch th ro u gh the    tunnel and       thought    that was          the     only

p 1aceN^o          go .

At this        po'isnt there was a steady flow of people.                        I joined them and

e n te r e d the          tunnel;    I saw no Police       or stewards       at all        once    I had

bad you were          stuck       in one     position,       being unable          to move your arms.

Pe op l e were       still       coming     in;    I couldn't       u nd er st an d why they hadn't

stop pe d them as              people    by this     stage were        in obvious         problems.          I

could see some             p e o p l e ’s faces     changing       colour where       they couldn't

b-fe^fcie properly.
                                 Sot.-
At about                  pm    (1455 hrs)        it was    so bad     I couldn't move my head,                       but

people were          coifing      in in droves.            I tried moving          backwards;       I just

w a nt e d   to get out          of the Ground.            I saw a young        lad about 5'          in front

of me start          to drop to the floor.                  I tried to get hold of him but

there was       no way          I could move my arms              in the    crush.

I shouted,          "There's          a child on the floor,            move",      but nobody took any

notice.        He just          d is a pp e ar e d out of sight.           There was       nothing       I

could do.           I didn't          see him a ga in but         I wouldn't       have thought          he'd

have     been able         to survive        the    crush.        I don't    know him but would

describe       him as          between    10 and     12,    but    I can't     really describe               him any

furthe r .

At thate's! began to              panic;     I was    trying       d e sp e ra te ly to get     to the           back

to go out           through the tunnel a nd out the Ground.                          I don't    know what

time    this        was    but    I remember the m atch had s t a r t e d.                I could     hear

people screaming,                and there was        just     one thing       I wa nt ed to do and               that

was    to get out.

I e ve nt u al l y    forced my way through the                    crowd and as       I got     to the

tunnel       I was    clambering          through     people       to get out.        I can't        remember

much a bout         this       because    I was     in such a panic          to get out.            I don't

know what           it was       like    in the tunnel,         but   I remember emerging            from         it

an d going          out    into the       courtyard.         There werse still a lot of               people

I was    in a daze and             I remember        e ve nt ua ll y walking       out through an open

blue    gate,     I don't       even know where           it was,     and once outside          I threw

myself    on the floor and just                 lay there       crying and shaking.              I d i d n ’t

realise      the extent         of what       had happened until            people were       coming       out

of the Ground,             asking me      if I was alright,           and telling me that             there

were    people        hurt    inside    the Ground.

 ' d o n ’t know how          long    I was    outside       for,   but    I was a p p ro a ch e d   by three

P o l i c e m e n who helped me?          they got me up and took me over                   to an

                      As   I was     getting    into the                         I heard a group of

people    shouting at the Police,                    "You m u rd er in g    bastards".        I then

r ea lised      pec          'tust have    been killed         in the      crush.




                                       I had bruising          to         legs,    feet,   arms and back,
                                                                       V     4
plus    I was     still       badly    shaken up.




I left                             in a bus     provided w hi ch took us to the                railway

station,        and from t he re        I went       home.



I cannot        really       comment    on how the        incident was           handled after       the

m a t c h was    stopped,       as    I had been       intent       on getting      out of the Gr ou nd

and took        no notice       of what was          going    on a ro un d me.

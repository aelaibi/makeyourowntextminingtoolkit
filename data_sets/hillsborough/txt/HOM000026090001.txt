          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:                W ha t t i m e are we t a l k i n g a b o u t ?
A.        I w e n t to L e p p i n g s Lane, sir, twice.           The f i r s t time

Is that on the opposite side of the road from the turnstiles?
A. Yes. Well, it seemed to me to be in the middle of the
junction somehow. That is probably where the stick is at
the moment, yes. Does the road swing round there?

It turns right. A. I got the impression he was in the
middle of the road. The road is raised and I can remember
having an overview of the position of the turnstiles from
there.

Did you observe what, if anything, individual police officers
were doing as the crowds approached the turnstiles? A. Yes,
they were in good humour; they were speaking to the
spectators.   I made special reference to this in my report.
I thought they behaved courteously.   I was close at hand
on a few occasions when they were talking to supporters
and asking them for their tickets, looking at their tickets
and advising them where to go, and so on. I thought they
behaved well.

So far as asking to see tickets or if they had got tickets
is concerned, w&a that what you mfght call a formal system
of filtering people or being done informally?   A. I have
tried to give some thought to this. We are talking about
Vere Road, which is the link road between Penistone Road
and Lepp&ngs Lane, but I have had to talk myself through
the two barriers ther#Â« There was another place where I
had to talk myself through. Now, I feel that that might
have been a cordon to prevent access to the South Stands.
I am not certain.

Do you mean once you were inside the turnstiles? A. No.
I wanted to get back to the South Stand. I wanted to go
all the way round.  I can remember having to talk my way
through again on two occasions.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: To get into that roadway? A. To
get into that roadway. But at first - memory plays tricks,
I'm afraid, sir - I thought it was a cordon for checking
tickets, for filtering tickets, but on reflection I think
it was probably one that prevented access to Liverpool
supporters to the South Stand which, of course, was the
territory of the Nottingham Forest supporters.

     Mr. GOLDSACK: You have said that you subsequently
visited the police control box?  A. Yes.

And observed on the monitors there that there appeared to
be a lot of people outsMisLeppings Lane at about 20-to-3?
A. I can't remember whether it was observing something
on the monitors, to be honest, but the discussion in the
control room suggested to me that there might be some delay
in getting the Liverpool suppofcfeers in.

So you went back to Leppings Lane tÂ© look for yourself?
A. Yes.

                                                 K. EVANS

Q. When you got back and observed the size of the crowd, did
   you at that stage think they would all be in by 3 o'clock?
   A. I didnât think they would all be in by 3 o'clock, but
   it was an improving situation and not a deteriorating one.
   In the event, by five minutes after kick-off there was what
   I have described in my report as a steady trickle or a trickle
   of people going in. There were still people going in five
   minutes after the kick-off but it was orderly and there were
   no problems.

Q. At about that time did you go back into the ground to the
   match itself?   A. Yes, sir.

Q. Can I now ask you please about the Leppings Lane terrace.
   Did you observe at last year's match how that was filled?
   A. No, sir. What you are talking about is in what way it
   was filled in terms of each section. No, I cart't answer
   that, sir, because I wasn't inside the ground.

Q. You were not inside the ground at all before the kick-off?
   A. I was but I didn't take note of it. It didnât register
   with me.  I was in the control room, as I have mentioned,
   and early on I was with the Secretary, but I can't say that
   I took note of how that particular section was being filled.
   By the time I got back in, of course, it was well filMd.

Q. Where did you watch    the match from?     A. From a seat in the
   directors' box.

Q. In the South Stand?      A.   Yes.

Q. From where you have, do you, a reasonable view of the Leppings
   Lane terrace? â A. Yes.

Q. Were fou in the directors' box for the whole match?         A. Yes.

Q. What was your assessment of the number of people in the
   Leppings Lane terrace at the match?    A. It was a well
   attended game.  I didn't see discomfort at all. It is
   difficult to judge from a distance, but there have been
   occasions, if I can explain it this way, when from a
   similar position - not at this ground but at other grounds -
   I have looked at the crowd and I've said to myself "Thatâs
   too tightly packed" and within a short time the police have
   taken action to relieve that pressure. I didn't get that
   impression at the Aeppings Lane end.

Q. Did you see, within the Leppings lane terrace last year,
   any evidence of a police presence?    A. Are you talking
   about on the terraces or at the perimeter?

Q. On the terraces?     A. I can't recall that, sir. Normally I
   do take note of t h e location of police, again in case there
   is a subsequent need to refer to it at any F.A. inquiry and
   so on, but that is of no c o n s e q u e n c e really if the matter
   has gone off okay without problems.

                                                 K. EVANS

Q. Did you see any evidence of stewards' presence on those
   terraces?   A. I make a    noteÂ® in ray report that the
   stewards were evident in   the ground. Just where they were
   I can't say, sir, I'm sorry.

Q. When you had your initial look around the inside earlier
   that day, had it registered with you that the Leppings Lane
   terrace was divided into pens by radial fences? A. I know
   that it is divided. When it registered, I don't know, but
   I know that it is divided.

Q. You knew it on that day?     A. Yes, sir.

Q. From your general experience, what proportion of themajor
   grounds are so divided?   A. It is usually the visitors'
   terrace, and I know the Leppings Lane end is normally the
   visitors' terrace, the visitors' end? and it is divided
   in this way to give flexibility in the accommodation of
   visiting supporters, taking into account the fact that thfey
   come in varying numbers. What we don't want is 500 away
   supporters in the terrace accommodating whatever number.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Why is that, because they run
     about or what?   A. Because they run about. That is one
     thing we want to prevent. Also, it makes the policing
     of it that much easier because as far as the perimeter is
     concerned you just have to cover that section of the
     perimeter.

Q.        Mr. GOLDSACK:   So is it your experience, Mr. Evans,
     that most First Division grounds do have the away
     supporters' terrace sub-divided?    A. I know of several
     grounds fchfet are sub-divided --

Q. Certainly quite a lot?   A. In trying to answer your
   question, I am trying to think of all the grounds. For
   example, at Villa Park it is sub-divided.  I know that
   Leeds United is sub-divided on their popular side into
   seven sectors.

Q. As an experienced ex-policeman, how would you have expected
   those terraces to be filled at the semi-final?

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Do you mean by what procedure?

Q.        Mr. GOLDSACK:  Yes.   A. There are differing views
     on how this should be done but my own view is that they
     should be packed -- crowd distribution is a problem and
     so supporters should go into one section at a time and
     fill that to a comfortable position and then move on to
     the next sector.




                                    /Q. By whom would you expect..
                                  K. EVANS


By whom would you expect that to be done? - A. This is a
bit of a contentious area really. The Police would be
involved in this but the Stewards would be involved in the
decision on how it should be done but the Stewards should
be assisting in making sure this happened.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Can you explain to me why you
think that method is to be preferred on a big match occasion?
- A . It ensures that the whole of that area is filled
reasonably to capacity before moving on to the next one.

What is the merit of that? - A. The merit of that is when
you have got a large crowd one of the problems is there are
usually spaces at the front which people find difficult to
get to from the back and it is better to try and arrange
this one compartment at a time. There are differing views,
sir, but that would be the reason I would do that. It is
easier for ....
You mean you get more people in that way? - A. Yes, get
more people in. Well when I say "get more people in" what
I am saying is very often we find - I am not talking about
Sheffield Wednesday's ground at the moment - we find that
there is still capacity in the ground but the spectators
have difficulty getting to the space available, so what
we try to do is encourage people to fill up all the space
in the particular compartment first*

      MR. GOLDSACK: Of course what you are advocating
is what is recommended in the ACPO Report which I think
was published in 1987, it is our Tab 12, and of which
you were a member until your retirement. Is that right?
- A. I was a member of that Sub-Committee until I retired
in 1986. I knew that was to be rewritten, well updated
really, it was not a total rewrite.  I think that might
have been in the original 1981 document as well.

Yes, Tab 12, paragraph 149. - A. Yes, I have read that
sir.
That accords with your recollection and your own preferred
way of filling terraces? - A. Yes.

I think Mr. Evans during the course of your visit to
Hillsborough last year you went to the Club Control Room
and saw their close circuit and computer for determining
numbers through turnstiles. Were you aware that there was
no way of determining the individual numbers in pens from
the turnstile computer? - A. There is freedom of movement
between the pens and so in normal circumstances there
would be no need to have individual totalisers for each
pen.
       If you were filling for example one particular pen
 you could check the totaliser and then say; "Well that
                                  K. EVANS


is full enough" and then move to the next one. That is
another advantage of doing it in the way that is suggested
here.
If you don't have a way of monitoring the number in individual
pens and don't fill the pens one by one, overcrowding in
certain parts is almost inevitable, isn't it? - A. Yes, the
favoured areas are usually those immediately behind the
goal and as I say if that is not watched then as you say
you can in those circumstances have an undue proportion in
one section of the ground.

You produced in your report for the last year at number 20
a break down of attendance figures. Can you help us as to
where you got those figures from? â A. The break down of
the attendance, yes. When I first met the Club Secretary
and we were talking about the layout of the ground, he was
giving me some figures for each section of the ground and
at that time I said: "At the end of the game    I would
be interested to know the numbers in each section" and just
before I left he shouted out the numbers to me and I
recorded them.
Did any of those figures strike you as odd? - A. Well I
have got to apologise to the Inquiry and to the Football
Association because I first realised I had made an error
in describing the layout of the stadium ....

That is paragraph 6? - A. Paragraph 6. There is obviously
an error where I have got West Stand 4,465 and West Terrace
the same figure, so that is a mess up, and I did notice it.
What happens is I send my report to the F.A. and thejs they
send me a copy back with the reports of the other Assessors
of the games they have attended and I noticed it then, but
I must say I did not realise, of course, that it would have
the significance, that it would be subject to scrutiny at
an Inquiry such as this and all I can say sir I am sorry
and from memory I cannot correct the figures, perhaps the
Club Secretary will be able to put those right.

Does it come to this, Mr. Evans, you weren't conscious until
very recently that the combined figures for the West Stand
and Terraces appeared to be in excess of their capacities?
- A. No because there was no credibility in the figures
I recorded for the West Terrace.

To be fair I think we may well hear that the excess was not
as great as it appears because of turnstiles 9 and 10 being
counted in the wrong one, but I am also interested, Mr. Evans,
in the figure for the Spion Kop, 18,500, which is quite a
way below its capacity isn't it? - A. The capacity is 21,000
and if I have recorded that figure correctly, and I have
no reason to doubt that I havenât, then it is below capacity.

Did it occur to you that that perhaps suggested that the
Nottingham Forest supporters did not need all the tickets
                                  K. EVANS


which they had been allocated? - A. There is very often a
shortfall anyway on capacities at all ticket games. That is
a large shortfall and bigger than I would have expected.

Of course once they have been allocated, if they are not
picked up by the Nottingham supporters they are likely to
end up on the black market, aren't they? - A. That is a
possibility and that can create problems.

And if the Liverpool supporters can't get enough tickets
from their own Club, they are likely to be interested in
buying those spare Nottingham ones? - A. That is a danger.




                        /Q. Resulting in ....
                                            K. EVANS


Resulting in a lot of Liverpool supporters turning up with
tickets for the wrong end of the ground? - A. For the wrong
e n d , yes.

Did any thoughts like that go through your mind either last
year or when you learned it was to be a repeat fixture this
year? - A. I saw no mix of supporters on that occasion.   I
can't recall seeing any Liverpool supporters amongst the
Nottingham Forest supporters on the Kop, but the point you are
making, I suppose, is where did they go if they went anywhere,
and did they go to the Leppings Lane end?

If all the tickets last year were in fact sold and 2,500 were
not in the Spion Kop, where were they? - A. Where were they,
yes.  I don't know but the position was otherwise than they
just were not sold.  I don't know that.

At all events, Mr. Evans, it was not something that registered
with you as a potential problem if the same fixture was
repeated? - A. On the face of it there were 18,564 on the
Spion Kop, which suggests to me that 18,564 tickets were sold
and the remainder were unsold, but I take the point you are
making.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  We had a shortfall this year, too,
did not we? 19,906, I think.

     MR. GOLDSACK:   Yes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   In the Spion Kop this year.

     MR. GOLDSACK:   Can I move on to a slightly different
topic, Mr. Evans.  In recent years has the attendance at
popular matches of people without tickets been a problem you
have been aware of? - A. Not an insurmountable problem, no,
but there have been some matches where sizeable numbers have
turned up.

Is that in your experience an increasing problem or one that
has been very much the same for the last few years? -A. Can I
answer it in this way? As a general rule matches are not all
ticket, but the Football Association have in recent times
required matches played away from home by Leeds United,
Wolverhampton Wanderers and Cardiff City to be made all
ticket, and those are the ones I am referring to. At the
Nottingham Forest-Leeds United Cup match played at Nottingham
Forest ground this year, I attended there, and there were 500
or more Leeds United supporters there without tickets, and
the police refused ;them entry.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Just give me the venue again,
please? - A. I think it is called the City Ground at
Nottingham, the home ground of Nottingham Forest.
They played a Cup match against Leeds United. Over
recent time, let us go back a year or so, there were
many games where Leeds United were the visitors, and
they were turning up in large numbers, and when
                            11

                                                    K. EVANS


     policing those events the local Police said, "We
     would rather have them inside the ground than
     outside", and this undermined the FA requirement
     imposed on Leeds. The club did not like it. Leeds
     United did not like it either, letting them in. Just
     before I retired, at the meeting you are aware of, of
     Regional ACPO ranks, we agreed we would try to stand
     firm and keep the Leeds United supporters out in the
     hope that this action would discourage them
     attending, and this did work.     I have noted that
     after I retired the numbers did decrease
     significantly.  For some reason there was never the
     same problem with Wolverhampton Wanderers playing
     away from home, and generally speaking most other
     games the admissions are through the turnstiles.      The
     all-ticket games'I have attended, I think it was
     Barnsley and Everton, I d o n ât think there were all
     that many Everton supporters turning up without
     tickets.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:   The occasions you have referred to where
     specific club games were made all ticket, and then the Police
     decided to let non-ticket holders in, was that on payment? -A.
     That was on payment, yes. They opened up a turnstile for
     payment.

Q. Were they non-capacity matches? - A. They were non-capacity
   matches.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Do you of any match other than the
     opening of the gates here, where the Police have allowed nonÂ­
     ticket holders in at what was a sell out, all-ticket match? -
     A. Yes, I was at York City-Sunderland, and that resulted in an
     FA Inquiry.  They opened the gates there.

Q. That was in March, 1988? Is that right? - A. I will take your
   word for that, sir. At Birmingham and Leeds United, and I was
   at that game but I had got other events happening in the city
   centre so I didn't arrive until half-time, but that game, it
   was not an all-ticket game; Birmingham and Leeds; there the
   Leeds supporters were trying to ram open the exit gate, and
   the decision made there to allow them in, about 400 or 500,
   but there was plenty of space the other side of the turnstile
   to allow that to happen in safety.  I couldn't criticise it
   and I would not criticise it at the time because they were
   there and I was not.  It is not something I would like to see
   happen.

Q. They were let in for payment or non-payment? - A. They just
   came in.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:    I am not quite clear. Were they
     actually let into the ground itself or was there an area
     within the turnstiles where they were contained? - A. They did
     get into the ground.  It was written up in the submission to
     Mr. Justice Popplewell's Inquiry, and I guess there were about
     400 got into the ground in that way.

                                                       K. EVANS



     Q. What sort of numbers were let in at the York-Sunderland match?
        - A. It was not a great number.  I would guess round about 100
        or so. What they tried to do was part open a gate to check
        them in more quickly than they could go through the
        turnstiles, and of course that is a bad move.

     Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   The thin end of the wedge? - A.
          Thin edge of the wedge, and they just poured through.   I did
          not witness that.  I had been back at the ground, and I could
          see there were people there, and then suddenly I saw a surge
          of supporters from my position inside the ground, and I
          learned afterwards what had happened.

     Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:   I don't know, Mr. Evans, are you able to
          assess whether there appears to be any growing expectation on
          the part of the fans that one way or another they will be
          allowed in if they are still there at 5-to-3 in large numbers?
          - A. Well, the firm stand taken by Police over the last two
          years in the manner I have described has certainly reduced the
          expectations in regard to Leeds. The Nottingham Forest one
          was an exception because it was a Cup match, and may be Cup
          matches people will turn up anyway in hope, but generally
          speaking I would say that there is not so much expectation of
          getting in on all-ticket games.

     Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I did not quite get the names.
          Two matches you referred to, York-Sunderland and Leeds-
          Nottingham Forest? - A. York City and Sunderland was where
          they opened the gates.    Birmingham City and Leeds was where
          they opened the gates.    Nottingham Forest and     Leeds was the
          game where Leeds United   supporters turned up,     500or more,
          without tickets, and they were not allowed in       theground.

     Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:   Did you know of an incident at a Watford-
          Liverpool match in the 1987-88 season? - A. No, sir.

     Q. Would you expect the FA to receive reports as a matter of
        course from some source of incidents where gates are opened? -
        A. I know that the Fa always receive referees' reports where
        the game is stopped for any reason. Whether there is a
        requirement upon club management to notify the FA in such
        cases, I don't know.

     Q. Do you think there should be? - A. I think there should be.

     Q. Would it help to have a report from either the Police or club
        management, not necessarily a long one, but a brief report of
        the policing and crowd at each match? -A. I think it would be
        very helpful to know the reasons why it happened and what
        steps might be taken to prevent it in the future, because
        what happens at one ground, and this is the whole point of
        the Police intelligence network, that network is designed to
        record the behaviour of both home and visiting supporters for
        the information of other Police Forces that they can take
        them into account when making Police arrangements.
                                             K. EVANS


If a Police Force is notified of an incident where gates were
opened for its own supporters to go in, would you expect that
to form part of the information they would pass on to other
Forces? - A. Most certainly.

Do you know whether in fact it does? - A. I am yesterday's
man, unfortunately.  I have been away from it for 2-and-a-half
years, but I would be very surprised if it did not form part
of that exchange of information.  It certainly would be.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Let us not have any invidious
naming, but supposing club A visits club B, and club A's nonÂ­
ticket holders get let in at B, you are saying that in
addition to any information that may come from the B club or
the B Police Force you would expect the A Police Force at home
to let other Police Forces know that their town's supporters
go away and misbehave themselves? - A. Yes. The design of the
system is that home club A notify visiting the Police Force of
visiting club B of the crowd behaviour and events at that
game, and the purpose of that is for away club B to make of
it for future reference at the same game next year, but more
importantly to tell home club C when home club B are playing
away again that they get that same sort of information.

                                                       /LORD      JUSTICE        TAYLOR:           If   you.
                                      K. EVANS

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: If you say that that makes all
the difference, what is the point of having any safety
number in any particular section? You might just as well
say "Well, regard it as a whole", as you say they can pass
from one to another?   A. Yes.   I have mentioned
previously that the purpose of these separating fences
is to give police flexibility in the allocation of space
to visiting supporters - and they are usually unequal
comparments - so that in the event of an away support having
only 1,000, then they would be allocated a particular
segment, but in reality there would be nothing to stop
them* apart from the police presence, from going into
any of the other sections.

     Mr. HITNERs I will return to Lord Justice Taylor's
question in a moment.  I am not sure that you have
answered it. But can you answer me thiss Are you saying,
Mr. Evans, that in 1988 you were aware that at the Leppings
Lane end there was no provision for monitoring the safety
capacity of each individual pen but you did not consider
it necessary to report that matter because in your view,
because of the freedom of movement that you saw, it was
unnecessary to have monitoring of the individual safety
capacities?   A. I reported and I observed that the Club
had a computer-controlled turnstile counter.  I didn't
look at it closely to see to what extent the breakdown was,
but I did observe that they were better off than many
grounds in the country? that they did have a computer-
controlled turnstile counter.

Were you in 1988 aware that there was no provision for
monitoring the safety capacity in each individual pen?
A. I wasn't aware of that.

Had you been aware of it, would it have been a matter which
you would have thought necessaryto report to the F.A?
A. No. To be honest, I don't know whether that computer-
controlled VDU did show the numbers going through into
each pen, if you are telling me that that is so. But,
for the reasons I have stated, it would not be a matter
that I would feel obliged to report to the F.A.

You see, I am not suggesting for a moment, Mr. Evans, that
you failed in your duty by failing to find this fact out.
Do you follow?   A. Yes.

You were not doing an inspection of the ground. What does
concern me is the second answer which is that even if you
had known it, it woull not have been a matter of concern
because it would not have been unsafe. So can I now come
back to Lord Justice Taylor's questions. Under the
present arrangement, how do you prevent pen 3 having 2,000
people in it and pen 4 having 3,000 people in it, the
safety capacities being 1,000 and 1,200? A. As I have
said, by packing each pen one at a time, then it is
possible to use the turnstile counter to assess how many
are in a pen before moving on to the next one. There is
                                            K. EVANS

toothing to stop, while there is freedom of movement between
one and the other, from one compartment to the other,
one section being more overcrowded than the other.   It
is a problem. Crowd distribution is a problem and it is
a matter that we give attention to.

Mr. Evans, you have with enormous ingenuity, if I may
congratulate you, produced a method of packing the
Leppings Lane end with these particular turnstiles that
nobody has yet thought of - certainly not Sheffield
Wednesday. Can we just go through it? You could use this
method, could you, in the following way: that only one
pen is open at a time, so you take, for example, the
North West terrace and the computer count comes through
to control and control then say "We have got so many
thousand through the turnstiles" and you then block off
the North West terrace; you then do the same job with
pen 3 and then with pen 4 and then with the opposite
corner?   A. You have asked me how I would cope with
that and that was my answer.

That is your answer. Unless that system were in operation,
for which as I say you are to be congratulated, there was
no method of ensuring that the safety capacity was not
exceeded?   A. There is no definitive method, but from
observation and the extentÂ£of, if you like, overcrowding
in one particular section, it would bÂ« obvious. The
area behind the goal is usually favoured. The wing sections
are usually less crowded. So it is the job of stewards and
police to make sure that there is this even spread.  I am
talking generally now.  I am not talking about Leppings
Lane.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: If you adopted your method, you
would have to have very close co-operation, would you not,
between the control room and those on the ground at the
entrance to the tunnel, for example?   A. Yes.

As I understand it, you would start off with filling one
pen adid when you got to its safety capacity on your screen,
you would stopj tell everybody "Shut that off" and then
move to the next one? A. Yes.

You then watch your total figure and you do a subtraction
sum, subtract the number you first thought of and then you
have got what is in the second one. But it riffMres
constant to-ing and froing?   A. It would never be as
precise as that, my Lord. The display unit is checked.
I can only speak for Villa Park where we have three
compartments and they fill from both tkfe back and the
front, from a corridor at the front, and the people arriving
late are directed by police and stewards to the areas
where there is space, where it can be seen there is space;
and that is the best test - where there is space you put
the people.

     Mr. HYTNER: The only other thing I want to ask you
is this: Whoever does the job of dispersing the crowd
within a section to prevent overcrowding in one part and
                                           K. EVANS

sppces in another, at the end of: the day the crowd have
got to be persuaded to move. Some people have got to be
persuaded to move from the densely packed section to a
less packed section. For that, you really require the
co-operation of the tannoy, do you not?   A. Yes, and
very often this happens. People are asked to move down
to the front or whatever, yes.

That is your experience at grounds, that crowds are asked
"Thfeee is plenty of space in there, will you please move?"?
A. Yes, they usually say "There's still plenty of people
to come in. Will you make space for them?"

It is essential, ttofarefore, that whether it is the police
or the stewards who are doing it on the ground, there has
got to be communication and co-operation between them and
control?   A. True.

     Mrk, HYTNER:   Thank you.

            Cross-examined by Mr. JACKSON:

Mr. Evans, there are three matters. First of all, you
modestly describe yourself as "yesterday's ma n".    Is
it not the position that only last week Mr. Anderton of
Manchester, chairing a Police Committee on this very
subject, announced that the police were about to inaugurate
a new computer-based intelligence system for supporter
behaviour nationwide?   A. Yes, sir.

You see, the matters raised by my Lord on that point are
in fact matters which have been not only the subject of
investigation but have been the actual subject of a decision?
A. Yes.

May I turn secondly to you rsp|>fr to my learned friend about
people arriving at 12 o'clock. Mr. Evans, is it not
completely unrealistic to expect more than a handful of
people to stand for five hours on a Leppings Lane or any
other terrace to watch a match that will last probably an
hour and 40 minutes?   A. It's not unusual for many more
than a handful to turn up at 12 o'clock â¬or a match of
this sort. In fact, I was at a match at Bradford and
Manchester City, all-ticket, and the turnstiles were open
before 1 o'clock; they were due to open at 1 o'clock but
they were opened before 1 o'clock because there was such
a large crowd waiting to get in.

Mr. Evans, is not the late arrival of fans oÂ«ite of the
modern problems of football?   A. It is.

It is well kooMB that there will be submissions by those
who instruct me on this very matter. Encouragement has
got to be given to get fans to the ground earlier? A. Yes.

Would you look at Composite Album No. 2 and the first
photograph?   This is your evidence on the point of there
being space but no possibility of getting to it. A. I'm
sorry, could you repeat that?
                                          K. EVANS

Yern indeed.  It is your evidence on the point of there
being space ----    A.It's the photograph I wanted.

The first one.   A.   Thank you, sir.

If we look at that photograph, we can see what can be
described as a reasonably full terrace or very over-packed,
depending on your point of view.   It is a photograph
that is very familiar to the Inquiry. There is space
near to the front?   A. Yes.

Is that an example of year observation that there may be
space when a terrace is full and no-one could get to it?
A.   Yes, sir.

May I deal next with the Barnsley v. Everton game that you
attended this year? I think it was the Third or Fourth
Round of the F.A. Cup. That would be late January or
early February of this year?   A. I can remember the game.

It has become more important since this Inquiry was held
because there was a similar problem with supporters at
one end of the ground, was there not?   A. Yes, there is
entrance to that ground from one end and not the other
end, so there is a tendency for it to fill up and be more
crowded at one end than the other.

And indeed in the Everton area it became overcrowded and
the crowd spilled out of their enclosure?   A. When we
were talking about this earlier, sir, this is one game
that I had in mind where the police formed a cordon,
opened the gate, allowed people out of the more congested
area and moved them along the track and placed them in the
less congested area at the other end.

That was the South Yorkshire Police, the same authority
dealing with Hillsborough?   A. Yes.

It happened only weeks before the semi-final?   A. It would
be before the semi-final, yes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I suppose a decision to do that
must be a police decision, must it not?   A. It was a
police decision.

I know it was, but it would have to be, would it not?
A. Yes, sir.

     Mr. JACKSON: Mr. Evans, we are all conscious of taking
too much time but the point I was trying to make is that
it is well known that when overcrowding areas are observed,
the police take action and move fans?   A. Yes.

Finally, we have heard in this Inquiry from a number of
police officers that tWfey police by consent. One could
be forgiven for getting the impression that if people do
not consent, they cannot be properly policed in the numbers
that would attend a semi-final. Would you agree, Mr. Evans,
                          23


                                               K. EVANS

   that taking people from a railway station, shepherding
   them into a football ground and fitting them into a pen
   is regrettably as far from policing by consent as it is
   possible to imagine?   A. I think you have made it a bit
   strong but I follow your line of argument.

Q. May I emphasise that I accept that the behaviour of some
   football fans over the last 20 jpars has reduced the
    authorities to having^that as their only option, but
   may I suggest one matter that may assist in the future.
   I want to imagine that you were chairing your committee,
   advising as to how people should be taken from a railway
   station to a football match and returned.  I have no doubt
   you would invite the local police to be pspcesented; I
   have no doubt you would invite the football club to be
   represented;  I have no doubt you would ask many people
   to be represented. But, regrettably, until 1988 at the
   earliest, nobody has thought of asking the fans to be
   represented. Do you think it may be of assistance if a
   responsible representative of the supporters was allowed
   some input into decisions of that nature?   A. I think
   it would be sensible.  I was speaking just a few days ago
   to the Chief Superintendent in charge at Leeds United's
   ground and he does attend the Supporters' Clubs meetings
   and he has heard the sort of complaints that you have been
   talking about this morning.

        Mr. JACKSON:   Thank you, Mr. Evans.

              Cross-examined by Mr. MULLER:

Q. Mr. Evans, I want to ask you a little bit more about
   terraces which are divided into pens, the subject that
   Mr. Hytner was asking you about.  I think you would agree,
   would you, that an essential prerequisite of safety on such
   a terrace is that the designated capacities for each pen
   are not exceeded?   A. Yes.

Q. That is a basic requirement?   A.   Yes. Canwe just
   distinguish between self-contained pens -â It does apply,
   whatever pen, but I just want to know what you are talking
   about - whether it is a self-contained pen with its own
   toilets and refreshments and no opportunity to go elsewhere.

Q. I am asking you about pens simpliciter in which there are
   designated capacities. There is no point in having a
   designated capacity, is there, unless you adhere to that
   capacity?   A. True.

Q. You are immediately going to put safety in jeopardy if you
   exceed that capacity.  I think we will come on very shortly
   to the point that you are making. As faÂ® as that matter
   is concerned, it is a matter for the police and/or the
   stewards to make sure that that happens, that capacity is
   not exceeded in each pen - do you agree? A.   Yes.
                                          K. EVANS

One of the problems that arises, particularly in relation
in this case to pens 3 and 4, the pens immediately behind
the goal posts, is that that is the place, as you have
said, where people want to be?   A. Yes.

And the situation may very well be, may it not, Mr. Evans,
that although there appears to be room to squash in by
an anxious spectator trying to get into that part of the
terrace, in fact there is not room within the terms of
the safe capacity which have already been laid down? Do
you follow me?   A. I do follow you, sir.

A spectator can see that there is room there and will say
"There is room there.  I want to go in there. Why c an ât
I go in". Do you follow me?    A. Yes.

However the numbers are monitored, you must, must you not,
once you have got pens with designated capacity, have an
effective way of stopping people going into that particular
pen?    A. It is noJdifferent from an open section on the
long side of a pitch where the home supporters want to
follow the attacking play of their team and they move in
large numbers from one end to the other. Crowd
distribution is a problem, but I follow.your point, I
follow what you are saying, sir.

But do you not agree that if you are saying it is essential
for safety to keep the numbers down to the designated
numbers, it is essential to be able to shut off that pen
so that no more people go in?   A. What we can't ignore
is that there is a capacity for the whole of that section.
What we canât ignore is that there are turnstiles feeding
that section and there are refreshment areas and toilets.
Now, the only way you can ensure that the whole is self-
contained and not liable to changes in numbers is to have
the whole thing self-contained with its own facilities.

That may be a good thing, but may I just put it to you
again.  If you are going to contain the numbers within
the designated number, it follows as night follows day,
does it not, that you have got to have some means of
shutting it off?   Do you follow me, Mr. Evans? A. I
follow you, yes.




                               /Q.   Isnât that right?.
                                  K. EVANS


Isn't that right? - A. I can't argue with your line of
argument but when a place is full, if it is uncomfortably
full then people are not going to get in anyway. The
purpose of these fences that we are talking about is to
assist crowd distribution.
      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: You see if you are right, the
criterion should not be 1,200 in Pen 3, it should be when
people get uncomfortable they will move out through the
little gate at the top. I sntthat right. That is what you
are really saying which is a rather more coarse test,
isn't it? - A. It is a more coarse test but in the first
place we do get Â® good impression in the manner I have
described of how many are in a particular pen.

      MR. MULLER:  Can Itake it a little bit    further perhaps
and this will make the point clearer to you.    There would
be no point, would there ultimately as far as   Pens 3 and 4 ..
You are aware which they are, arenât you, Mr.   Evans? - A.
Yes.
They are the two centre pens? - A. Yes.

There would be no point in shutting the tunnel to prevent
people going down the tunnel into Pens 3 and 4 if you left
open the radial gate, would there? - A. That is true.

Because people would say: "Well we can't get in there, we
will go round the other way and come to the gates at tne
top"? - A. Which would be supervised.

 Precisely. The whole point is that if it is going to
 operate that gate, the radial gate has to be supervised,
 doesnât it? - A. Oh yes.
 Because what you have to do is to make sure, if you
 going to shut off the tunnel, you could also shut off the
 radial gate. Isn't that right? - A. That is right.

 And as far as that is concerned one of the problems that
 you will have and perhaps you will just accept this figure
 from me at the moment, I am not going to put it to you
 specifically, it takes just over eight minutes to evacuate
 everybody from Pen 3 for exampte into Pens 1 and 2 through
 that radial gate. Just accept that for the moment because
 that is applying the Green Guide. That means, of course,
 that in eight minutes you could get 1,000, if they could
 get in, going the other way, doesn't it? - A. Yes.

. And one of the problems is this, isn't it, although people
  may in an emergency want to get out of Pen 3 and Pen 4
  very quickly the bigger the gates are or the
  there are the quicker they can get in. Isn t that right.
  - a . That follows.
                                    K. EVANS


So if   you want to actually control the numbers that are
going   to be in Pens 3 and    4, you have     gotto have a gate
of a reasonable size which is actually effectively going
to enable you to control it. Isn't that right? - A. No,
you can have more than one gate and have two supervisors.

So be   it. The more gates       you havegot    themore supervision
is required? - A. True.

Of course if you have somebody at the gate and somebody
wants to go out and leave to go to the toilet or something
like that, if there is a Police Officer at the gate or
however many Police Officers it requires, he can say to
that mans  "You open the gate, let him go out and watch
him, make sure he does leave by the tunnel". Do you
follow me? - A. Yes.

And if he doesn't pull him back.     Do you follow me? - A.
Yes.
So it comes to this, doesn't it, that if you are going to
have a system like this and if the Police as they were
are in control of those radial gates, that was a stipulation
that was laid down and perhaps you will accept that from
me, in exercising their duty in controlling their gates
it was highly desirable that there should be somebody at
those radial gates, wasn't it? - A. To supervise those
gates, yes.

All the time? - A. Yes.

Because without it you can't work the system properly at
all, can you? - A. Quite true.

You have got absolutely no hope of controlling the numbers
in that pen unless you are supervising that gate, have
you. Isn't that right, Mr. Evans? - A. What I have said
is we have got a capacity for the whole of that terrace
and those pens that we have talked about are there to
assist in crowd distribution. The movement of two or three
people either way would not make a great deal of difference.

But the only way you can control whether it is two or three
people or as I have said to you 1,000 in eight minutes is
by having a Police Officer there? - A. Or a Steward.

      MR. MULLER:   Thank you.


               Cross-Examined by MR. MAXWELL:

Mr. Evans you told Lord Justice Taylor that one can see
what the terms of your remit from the F.A. were by looking
at the subject headings of your report? - A. Yes.
                                  K. EVANS


And one of those subject headings is the "Turnstiles"? -
A. Yes.

I would like to ask you something about that. It is on
page 2 of the report at the top? - A. Yes.

In the report you say: "There were 90 turnstiles in
operation which were adequate for this all ticket game."
Does it follow from that that you had to consider the
adequacy of the turnstiles and to do so in the context
of crowd behaviour and crowd control? - A. 90 turnstiles
with the throughput, with the increased throughput because
it was an all ticket game would have been sufficient for
the crowd having regard to the time the turnstiles were
opened at 12 noon.

And that was a conclusion that you reached after some
earlier doubts as to whether the crowd would get in in
time, wasnât it? - A. Yes.

If you had any doubts at the end of your observations
you would have expressed them in this report? - A. About
the adequacy of the number of the turnstiles we are
talking about?

Yes? - A. Yes.

And told the F.A. about your doubts. Would you have made
any recommendations to them? - A. My concern when I go
round grounds the number of turnstiles laid down are included
in the Safety Certificate. My concern is when I find turnÂ­
stiles not in operation.

Your concern though is where you have an inadequate number
of turnstiles to get the spectators in because that can
give rise to a crowd behaviour problem or risk of that
problem? - A. Yes.

If you had had any doubts or fears about the number of
turnstiles here you would have told the F.A? - A. Yes.

What would the F.A. have done? - A. I would have mentioned
it in my report. What the F.A. would have done about that
I don't know.

You have also told Lord Justice Taylor that because there
is freedom of movement between the pens, there is no need
to have individual totalisers in order to monitor the
numbers going into the individual pens.

      In your experience is the arrangement at this
Football Ground different from any other in that respect
in terms of having individual monitoring or monitoring
at individual pens? - A. Eiich self-contained section of
a ground has its own computer total.
                                             K. EVANS


q   . in your view are these pens s&If-contained sections? - A.
      No.
Q. And in your experience is the reason why you say that
   because they have a gate at the back? - A. The reason I
   say that is that unless they are self-contained with their
   own toilet and refreshment accommodation there is freedom
   of movement and so the figures you are reading on the visual
   display unit are not necessarily accurate for open pens
   such as you have described.

Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I can see why you might say
        these pens are not self-contained because there is a gate
        which enables you to get from one to another, but you seem
        to be saying they are not self-contained because they have
        not got their own toilets which is not what the capacity
        of the pen laid down has got in mind at all, is it?
        The capacity of the pen means what it says, that you should
        not have more than 1,200 people in that pen? - A. That is
        so,my Lord. It is the break up of a terrace as I have said
        to give Police flexibility in accommodating visiting
        supporters.
Q.        I follow that. - A. And the numbers in each pen are known
         and in this way the Police decide which pen should be taken
         into use, but the point ....

Q.        I am sorry to interrupt but can I try and c u t through this.
         Is what you are saying this: you conceive that the desiÂ­
         gnated capacity for any one of these pens is only relevant
         when that pen is being used with the gates shut as against
         any other pen otherwise you view the whole terrace as
         a 10,100 terrace. Is that what you are saying? - A. Yes,
         and the reason I say that my Lord is people do want to
         go either to the toilet or for refreshments or may be
         change their position and there is nothing to stop them
         doing that. In the same way if they wanted to go from
         one end of the ground to the other, this does not apply
         here, on the long side of a ground, there would be nothing
         really to stop them doing that.
q       .         MR. MAXWELL:  Is the position this, Mr. Evans, that
            if the ga&es are shut, you can then create a self-contained
            unit on the terrace. Is; that right? - A. Well I don t
            know what the position is here but that would be something
            that could be done.  I donât really know what the position
            is here at Hillsborough.

    Q. You don't know whether there is a gate? - A. No.

    Q. You don't know? - A. No, I did not get on to the terrace.

    q   . in    your experience do other grounds have radial fences
            with gates at the back of them, that is at the turnstile
            end away from the ground end of the radial fence? - A.
            No.
                           29

                                        K. EVANS


Q.    That is not something that is met anywhere else in your
     experience? - A. I can't recall a ground. At Villa Park,
     for example, there is freedom of movement at the back of
     each of the pens along the back of these pens, yes.

Q. And is the freedom of movement gained by going through a
   gap between the end of the radial fence? - A. It is, yes,
   there is a gate there and it would be supervised.

Q. Are there individual capacities for the pens at Villa
   Park? - A. Yes.

Q. For each individual pen? - A. Yes.

Q. Is that because each individual pen can be made into a
   self-contained unit when you wish? - A. No. If they want
   to go to the toilet or for refreshments they have to go
   through the gate that I have referred to.

Q. What is the purpose of the individual capacity of a pen
   that you know of at Villa Park. What's its significance?
   - A. To prevent lateral movement and as I have said, to
   give flexibility in the accommodation of visiting
   supporters.
Q. And how at Villa Park do you ensure th&t the individual
   capacity is not exceeded? - A. I hear what you are saying
   on that.
Q.    It is not intended to be a trap? - A. I can see that. I
     am not saying it is a trap. We do that just by looking
     at the crowd.
Q.    You look at the crowd and stop short of allowing it to
     be uncomfortable.   Is that the way it is done? - A. That
     is right. As I say we have got the facility to feed people
     in from the front of the terrace to take up any spare space.

Q. How do you ensure that you stop short of it becoming
   uncomfortable at Villa Park? - A. By directing people into
   other parts and into other sections.  It has a total
   capacity and the total capacity of that terrace would not
   be exceeded.
Q. You also told Lord Justice Taylor that because there is
   freedom of movement between the pens there is no need to
   have individual totalisers for the pens. Are you aware of
   any ground where there is an arrangement of having an
   individual totaliser for a pen, that is a totaliser
   specifically limited to that pen? - A. I know the grounds
   with totalisers but I can't say how they are broken down.
   I do know those with totalisers do have a tally for the
   numbers in each self-contained section but I cannot say
   whether they would include the number in a particular
   segment. There are many grounds without these totalisers.
                                       K. EVANS


        MR. MAXWELL:    Thank you.


                Cross-Examined by MR. GLASGOW:

Q. Mr. Evans, I think your concern on behalf of the Football
   Association is to attempt to ensure that the Clubs who
   are part of that Association behave themselves and have
   the facilities to enable the sport to be played safety? -
   A. That is a fair summary I suppose.

Q. Despite the fact that you yourself have had a long and
   distinguished career as a Police Officer, you are not
   visiting crowds and games in order to see whether or not
   the Police are behaving themselves? - A. I am there to
   see crowd behaviour and the way the whole match is policed
   and supervised.

Q. And if you came across anything that indicated that the
   Club, its management or its staff were not acting sensibly
   or in the interests of the safe pursuit of the game, that
   is something which you would highlight in your report?
   - A. I would either highlight it in the report or mention
   it to an Official of the Club and more often than not
   I do mention in the Report that I have mentioned it to the
   Official of the Club.

Q. We were told, I think you heard Mr. Kelly yesterday and
   you heard him say that it is the F.A. policy that at semiÂ­
   finals there should be equal distribution of tickets where
   possible despite any possible inequality between the support
   of the two supporting sides? - A. Yes.

Q. The tickets are shared as far as the ground conditions
   permit equally? - A. Yes.

Q. Is it nonetheless right that although one team's supporters
   will have an equal share of the tickets, you would expect
   that Club to exercise sense and control over the way
   in which they disposed of their half share? - A. Yes.

Q. And if one of the Supporters' Clubs had more tickets than
   they were able in the event to make use of for their
   own supporters, you would expect them to retain them
   unsold and to take active steps to prevent them from
   getting on to may I call it the black market? - A. Yes sir.

Q. When you told Lord Justice Taylor that it would not surprise
   you if the Spion Kop allocation had not been completely sold,
   were you aware of the fact that Nottingham Forest had in
   fact retained an unsold portion of their tickets in 1988
   so as to ensure that they did not fall into the wrong hands?
   - A. I was unaware of that.




                       /Q. But would you nonetheless
                         31

                                                 K. EVANS


Q. But would you nonetheless confirm that is precisely what you
   would expect a responsible club to do? - A. Most certainly.

Q. Could we now come to the organisation at the Leppings Lane
   terraces on the match that you visited.  Were you aware of the
   fact that the way in which that terrace was being police
   represented a new policy in force for the first in 1988? - A.
   No, sir.

Q. Were you aware of the fact that until 1988 the Police policy
   in force at this ground had been precisely that which you
   advocate, namely that one pen was filled at a time and then
   closed, including the radial gates, when it reached a safe
   capacity, and then the next pen full? - A. I was unaware of
   that.

Q. Nobody particularly, Mr. Evans, had told you of the evidence
   which the Chief Inspector responsible for that end of the
   ground, has given this Inquiry? - A. Nobody had mentioned
   that.

Q. Am I right in thinking that is almost precisely what you and
   those whom you shared the ACPO board with would have expected
   the Chief Inspector, whose name was Creaser, to do? - A. Yes,
   but it is not an instruction.  It is advice.  Police Forces
   must deal with things as they see them themselves, but
   nevertheless they should take note of the advice.

Q. In fairness to you and to the ACPO advice and to the Officers
   concerned, M r . Evans, I think you have already said that you
   respect the other view which is to allow the thing to fill up
   gradually all over? - A. Yes, there could be good reasons for
   doing that.

Q. You have been asked a lot of questions on   the misleading
   premise that these pens have a designated   safety capacity as
   we were told. Were you aware of the fact    that although /these
   pens had been physically in existence for   about 8 years they
   had never been given a safety capacity of   any kind? - A. No.

Q. Were you aware of the fact that so far as the certifying
   authority and the working party was concerned, the safety
   capacity of the terrace was viewed as a whole and the pens had
   no individual safety capacities? - A. i was given the safety
   capacity for the terrace as a whole and not the individual
   pens.

Q. And until you were asked questions by a number of people this
   morning had anybody ever suggested to you that there was a
   designated safety capacity for the pens as distinct from the
   terrace? - A. No.

Q. Whoever may be at fault, mr. Evans, does the term "designated
   safety capacity", whatever it is supposed to mean, does it in
   fact make any sense at all if it is applied to pens which are
   left open? - A. This was the point I was trying to make
   earlier.
                           32

                                                   K. IVANS



Q. It may be you were misled, Mr. Evans, by the questions.  I
   wondered whether you were aware of the fact that there was no
   safety capacity designated for these pens, because in fairness
   to you that may be should be pointed out to you. - A. Thank
   you.

Q. You did not know? - A. I did not know.    No.    The simple answer
   to that question is no.

Q. Can I now ask you about the suggestion that there may have
   been confusion as to who was responsible for filling those
   pens, and you remember the questions you were asked about
   that? - A. Yes.

Q. May we assume, Mr. Evans, that on behalf of the Football
   Association or even as a retired distinguished Police Officer,
   you would obviously be concerned if you thought there was
   confusion between a club and the police who were assisting it
   as to responsibility for any part of crowd control? - A.
   Certainly.

Q. May we assume for a moment that you were in doubt about that
   matter when you visited in 1988? I think you were not in fact
   in doubt, but may I try retrospectively to plant that doubt in
   your mind and to say to you, Mr. Evans, with your Police
   experience, "I want you to go and look at this match and see
   whether or not there is confusion in the way in which the
   terraces are controlled".  Is that reasonably clear? - A. Yes.

Q. If you went to the ground, am I right in thinking you would
   want to speak, in whatever order, to both the stewards and to
   the Police to see whether there was any confusion? - A. I
   would speak to the senior steward, and the steward with
   responsibility for that end of the ground; the senior steward
   for that end of the ground, and the Police.

Q.   May we take the steward    with responsibilityfor that endof
     the ground first of all, because I think I can tell you it is
     accepted that he reported directly to the club's management,
     and therefore had responsibility for stewarding at that end of
     the ground. Am I right in thinking if that is the truth you
     would accept him as being the responsible man to go to? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   He would have told you, if he told you what he told Lord
     Justice Taylor, that he would not expect his stewards to go on
     to the terrace at all.   If he had told you that am I right in
     thinking you would want to move on to the Police Officers in
     order to see whether or not they were aware of his views and
     of the fact that stewards did not and were not expected by the
     club to go on to the terraces? - A. Yes.

Q. May I assume then that you would have gone to the most senior
   Police Officer responsible for ground movement? Would that be
   the next step, or would you start at the bottom and work up?
   I don't mind. We will take it in either order. - A. I would
                                            K. EVANS


have been told who was responsible for that end.

Can we start with the Officer then? - A. Yes.

Let us assume you had gone to Superintendent Mole who had then
been the man at your time responsible for the ground? - A.
yes.

And again, if he had told you what he told Lord Justice Taylor
that he would not expect to see any stewards on the terraces
and that it would be wholly unreasonable and unrealistic to
expect stewards to be able to control people going in and out
of terraces, would that reassure you as to whether or not the
Police knew what the clubâs attitude to stewarding of the
terraces was? - A. Yes.

May I assume finally that because of your long experience and
cautious approach you were not even satisfied with the
Superintendent, and you decided to check at, to use the awful
phrase, at grass roots level, and you went down to see the
Sergeants who were actually in charge of the men, and one of
the Sergeants behind those terraces had told you that he,
being a Policeman he would say perceived that his duties
included walking round those terraces to ensure that they did
not become overcrowded, would that put the finishing touches
as to any doubt you might have as to whether there was really
any confusion as to who was responsible? - A. It is clear to
me that the responsibility from what you have said was wholly
that of the Police.

Thank you very much.

     MR. JACKSON:   Sir, before the matter continues, I
noticed yesterday afternoon that Mr. Kelly was not subject to
any cross-examination after telling the Inquiry the 1988 Semi-
Final was a sell out.   I understand from the content of the
questions of my learned friend, Mr. Glasgow, that may well not
have been the case.   I have sought instructions and
information from the Football Association who tell me at this
moment they are not able to say and that the only people who
would know would be the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. So
it would seem to me to be of fundamental importance in the
allocation of the ground for the 1989 Semi-Final if there were
unsold tickets for the Spion Kop for the 1988 Semi-Final. May
I ask through you, sir, that those matters be made available,
if they are as one would indicate through Mr. Glasgow's
questions, as they appear to be.

     MR. COLLINS:    All I can say about that is if one looks
at Mr. Evans' figures one can see for oneself that there were
about 2,500 short on the Kop. That does not necessarily mean,
of course, that the tickets were not sold and people did not
turn up.  It is capable of two explanations.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I donât know whether you were in,
Mr. Collins, but it was being put - you were in.
                                              K. EVANS



     MR. COLLINS:   I was in, that there were some unsold
tickets at Nottingham Forest.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Nottingham Forest had responsibly
retained tickets that they had not been able to sell.

     MR. COLLINS:   Yes.    I confess I was not aware of that.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    That was in 1988, was it?

     MR. COLLINS:   1988, I am sorry.    So it would not be
these figures.

     MR. GLASGOW:   As is probably apparent to everybody, the
instructions come this morning because the matter was raised,
I think, for the first time yesterday. Our instructions are
that Nottingham Forest retained - the figure we have been
given this morning - 500 tickets, but that we cannot speak to
other than hearsay over the telephone. Although they had a
full allocation, and I am afraid I do not understand football
accounting, whether you call that being sold or not, but out
of their allocation they retained 500 because they did not
sell them and were concerned that they might fall into the
wrong hands, and had therefore told Sheffield Wednesday that
is what they had done.  That was in 1988.  I am sorry, I
can't take the matter further, and I apologise if it takes
people by surprise.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     1989 was a sell out, was it?

     MR. GLASGOW:    So far as we are told, yes, sir.    We are
having that checked.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   One likes to have precision, but I
doubt whether that number retained would have made a great
deal of difference to anything, would it?

     MR. GLASGOW:   We think not, sir, but I thought insofar
as we have....

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I do n ât think it is a matter for
creating a great issue, particularly as it is not the relevant
match.  There we are.

     MR. GLASGOW:   I think the importance, and all I sought
for the FA, although I don't represent them, was that a
responsible attitude was being displayed by clubs who
otherwise may come in for a great deal of criticism.


     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   And it might have been another
small point that might have been, if he had known about it, in
Mr. Kelly's mind of whether in view of what one heard
yesterday it would have figured in the Committee's decision,
seems rather doubtful.
                                             K. EVANS


     MR. GLASGOW:   I regret not putting it to him.  I would
have done so had I been able to. We are all operating under
the same constraints, but I am very sorry if it upsets my
friend.

     MR. HYTNER:    While we have an interruption, sir, may I
just say this.   It has been suggested that I have been putting
questions to Mr. Evans on the wrong premise, that there was a
safety capacity for pens 3 and 4

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Designated.  I think it is the
word "designated" that is being focused upon.  I think I may
have been guilty of falling into the same terminology.

     MR. HYTNER:   We are in the sixth week of the Inquiry,      i
have been putting similar questions to stewards and Police
Officers, and it does not seem to me there has been yet any
objection.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Can we just get this clear? Mr.
Glasgow, let there be no mystery about this. By "not
designated" do you mean it was not written into the safety
certificate? We have seen plans that had these figures on,
and I suppose they ,â probably derive from the area or what was
thought to be the Green Guide equation, having regard to area
and numbers.  Is that right?

     MR. GLASGOW:   No, sir, I think not.  I think that is the
difficulty.  For some time a number of us have been asking
where those figures came from, because they are nothing to do
with either the local authority, the club, and I know my
friend, Mr. Collins, is unable and I was unable to assist him.
We do now have the benefit that Dr. Eastwood is represented
and present.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We may hear later.

     MR. GLASGOW:   They are, of course, his figures, and my
learned friend, Mr. Toulson, has been kind enough to explain
to me for the first time, because we have not had access to
his client, where they come from, and it might be courteous he
be given the opportunity to cross-examine even now that he is
here, but that is a matter entirely in your hands, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well, he has got the opportunity
of putting it as he is representing Dr. Eastwood.

     MR. GLASGOW:   We had all forgotten him because he was
behind.  I had already offered him my seat.

     MR. TOULSON:   I am very happy to help the Inquiry, and
if I can contribute something after six weeks, I can answer
question, and it is in the core bundle.   It is theletter on
page 161, my client to Mr. Eric England:
                                              K. EVANS


       "As requested last Wednesday we have pleasure in
       enclosing two copies of our drawing 1610/64A marked up to
       indicate the standing capacities of the five areas at
       Leppings Lane end".

The document enclosed is not in the bundle. Having had the
benefit of reading last night Mr. Collins' opening, I see that
he actually referred to the document and said he did not know
what the genesis of it was.  The plan is in my client's proof
of evidence.  It is one of the plans attached at the back.
It is number in the bottom right-hand corner is drawing
1610/64E.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I had that.  I thought we were
looking for A. According to the letter we are looking for A.

     MR. TOULSON:     I think it is sufficient for this purpose
if you have 64/E.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Assuming A and E are the same,
yes.

     MR. TOULSON:   You have the legend, and if you the same
copy as I have there is a summary of A, B, C, D, and E in the
bottom right-hand corner, and if you start with each revision
which is annotated, the drawing itself is a January 1980
drawing, but you see the summary of revision A.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   "Capacities added", yes.

     MR. TOULSON:   Exactly. You see the date 6.11.81. That
is the date of the letter I was just about to invite you to
look at. That is the answer to the question.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: That takes us so far, Mr. Toulson,
because it says, "Central pen 2,200". This was at a stage
presumably before the central pen was split.   Where we got
1,200 and 1,000 from perhaps there is a further story.   I
d o n 't know.

     MR. TOULSON:   I will try and help as best I can. As you
appreciate, what happens is that the negative of the drawing
is kept and as each revision comes something gets superimposed
on the print. So you are absolutely right, when revision A
was, there would not have been anything other than fences 1
and 2, and there was therefore a central pen. Dr. Eastwood is
a little unclear now why it was that Eric England was asking
for those figures. He is doing his best to scratch his head
and see if he can recall. We know the drawing I think you
have referred to, which shows 1,000 and 1 ,200 , post-dates the
no-man's land, and I have put Dr. Eastwood's memory to the
test on that, too. Whether we will be able to help you or
not, we will be able to tell you later.

      MR. HYTNER:   I am still not sure what Mr. Glasgow is
saying about this, and I think it is important that we do
know.   I clearly understand what he is saying is that there
                                            K. EVANS


was no designated safety capacity in the statutory sense, but
I am still not sure whether he is saying there was no fixed or
determined or decided safety capacity for these pens.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   To which they were working.

     MR. HYTNER:   To which anybody was working, or whether
these figures have simply been used by us during the last 6
weeks falsely and in silence from the club.

     MR. GLASGOW:     Sir, all we can say is that while the
gates remained open at the back and the stand was one,
discussions that had taken place as to what the capacity of
those pens would be as self-contained units, were meaningless
and certainly meant nothing to the working party, the local
authority or to u s , and it is the word "designated" that we
found, and I think that is the first time today that that word
has been used, that we found wrong and misleading.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I see that, but it is right to
say, Mr. Glasgow, the 1,000 and 1,200 have been bandied about
fairly freely for 6 weeks without any point being taken on
them. We will have to hear what Dr. Eastwood says about how
these figures arose.

     MR. GLASGOW:   Sir, we have all been in the same
confusion. We have all been asking, because I do know Mr.
Collins has asked us all, and until this morning we did not
know and were unable to help him, and we have all been
precisely in the same position.

     MR. COLLINS:   What I was asking, as I think is clear
from my opening, was where these figures originated from, but
that they were figures that were being used and appeared on
these plans, and indeed apparently appeared from the letter at
161, was quite plain, that someone at some stage had assiyped
that that was the actual capacity if you divided up the
terrace.  I confess what I had assumed was it was simply done
on the basis that the terrace holds 7,200, it is divided now
by barriers, and we are taking a rough assessment of dividing
it by area, and we get the figures that we get. That is what
I have assumed happened, and we will discover that in due
course no doubt. No-one has ever suggested that anything was
put on the safety certificate.  The whole point we have been
making throughout is that it was overlooked.

     MR. MAXWELL:   Sir, I hope this assists.  I made
available at the start of the Inquiry a plan dated 1987 from
Dr. Eastwood which came into our possession after the
disaster, and which does contain the subdivision of
the 2,200 into 1,200 and 1,000.  I mention this now
so it may assist those acting for Dr. Eastwood and in
order to refer you to this plan which I hope has also
come into your possession.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Where am I to find it?

     MR. MAXWELL:   It is not in any bundle, sir, but it was
made available.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Is it this one which has been
reduced?

     MR. MAXWELL:   It is marked "Ground layout 1987" in the
bottom right-hand corner, 6945/1A.

Q. And then the terrace would be closed off?         A. Another one
   would be opened.

Q. Does that mean that if people had wanted to stand in the
   wings, they would not be allowed to do it if they got there
   early?   A. We would fill one pans&t a time.

Q. Does that mean that if one of Mr. Jackson's fans had come
   along with his family and said "I want to be in the north
   wing", your system would not have allowed that? A. The
   system wouldn't, no. I donât know.    If the individual
   with the two children said **I don't like getting behind
   the goal area. We have come early and it gets too crowded
   behind the goal and I would rather stand in the wing",
   I would expect them to say "Go and stand in the wing*.
   It is a method of crowd distribution that we are talking
   about.

Q. Of course, it is a great problem, is it not, dealing with
   crowds on an occasion such as this? One does not want an
   oppressive police presence? A. No.

Q. Too many policemen have a counter-productive response
   occasionally. Were you in the Inquiry room yesterday when
   Mr. Kay was giving his evidence, IHi spectator who spoke
   of an experience at the Birmingham semi-final two years
   ago when, as he was walking down the road, he observed a
   considerable police presence all the way along? A. Oh
   yes, the stake-out.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: What do you call it - the
     stake-out?    A. Yes. I guess it's the route from either
     the railway station or the coach park. Rather than
     continually escort in groups - it is all right if you
     have got one 500 train coming because you can escort that
     train - sometimes it is better, in protecting the property
     along that route, to stake people out along that route
     and let the crowd come through rather than accompanying
     thfe crowd.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, I follow.

Q.          Mr. WOODWARD:   But a balance has to be struck, does it
     not?      A. Yes.

Q. Because there will be those who resent the presence of too
   many policemen?   A. I've not really found that.

Q. Mr. Kay ^ o b s e r v a t i o n and his feeling at the time, whether
   justified or not, was that they were too numerous.             A. No.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  It may have been concerned with
     thrift rather than anything else.

Q.        Mr. WOODWARD: On the question of information, that is
     to say the information being passed after events by visiting
     clubs concerning their supporters, were you aware that that
     was a requirement by the F.A. that information should be
                              46

                                                    K. EVANS

     passed to home clubs concerning the behaviour of the
     supporters?   Were you aware of that? Sir, it is page
     298 in the bundle - G 8 . This is not something to be
     asked for? it was in part already there. Page 298,
     Letter G, Section 8?     A. Yes.

Q. There alre&$yÂ»was some machinery in existence for
   information to be passed back?   A. I've got 298 -
   "Measure to be adopted by the away club".  Is that what
   you are referring to?

Q. Yes, that is right, No. 8 .   A. "Clubs must designate a
   liaison officer to eo-opdÂ±aafce security measures between
   Clubs and with the public authorities and to survey the
   observations of these measures". Yes, part of the police
   network --

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: No, No. 8 at the bottom of the
     page.    A. I beg your pardon.   No, I wasn1t aware of that,
     sir.

Q.          Mr. WOODWARD:   You did not ktow about that?   A. No,
     sir.

Q. Are you aware      whether the Football Association takes any
   steps to see      whether these requirements are followed?
   A. I didnât       know that the requirements existed so I sanât
   really answer      that question.

Q. It would seem that there is a problem when there is too
   much space on a terrace, that problem from your point of
   view being what?   A. That there is too much movement.
   If we have got 500 on a 5,000 terrace, then it is easier
   to police than if they are in a segment that only holds
   1 ,0 0 0 .

Q. When you say "easier to police", do you mean to sort of
   pick out the troublemakers to make sure --   A. Oh no.
   If you wanted to cover the perimeter, for example, you
   would need two policemen instead of 222

Q. So to have them in small groups or penned hasa considerable
   benefit from the point of view of policing?   A.   Yes.

            Mr. WOODWARD:   Thank you, Mr. Evans.

          Mr. HYTNER: Sir, since I have apparently been asking
     questions on false premises, I wonder if I might be
     permitted now to put two questions on the correct data
     that we have been given by Mr. Glasgow?

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes.

              Further cross-examined by Mr. HYTNER:

Q. Do I take it, Mr. Evans, that your method of packingfin
   relation to these pens would have been by observation,
   by the police and the stewards packing and observing when
   discomfort arises?   A. And also having the facility of
                                             K. EVANS

the computer-controlled counter, I would also refer to that.

Assuming that we have not got your ingenious method of using
the computer and packing pen by pen, if pens are going to
be allowed to fill up, is it your view that packing by
observation is satisfactory?   A. Yes.

What then is the need for designated safety capacities on
any particular terrace?   A. That is laid down in the
safety certificate. Let me put it this way:    When you
are packing in the way I have described,     yougo to a
comfort level and then you open up the next one, but under
no circumstances do you exceed the total.

Yes, but each pen apparently does not have any capacity?
A. No, but it has a comfort level.

That is what I am asking you. If it is a     perfectly satisfactory
method of filling a pen to determine the comfort level of
the pen, you could do the same for each pen, could you
not?   A. It is a rule of thumb method for filling each
pen.

Yes. A.   But it is not definitive enough to measure the
whole.

I am sorry it is going to be more than two questions, but
it really is only two questions that I am actually asking.
You have here an entire terrace cut into pens? A. Yes.

Apparently no pen has any capacity given to it?    A. Yes.

It is your view, as I understand it, that each of the pens
can be satisfactorily filled by observation and determining
comfort level? A. I didn't say that. What I did say was
when I was asked the question "How would you judge when
there was sufficient in a particular pen?*, I would look
at comfort level and then when we were looking at the
total terrace I would be looking at the turnstile counter,
and then we would put them in in the spaces where we could.

Let's look at it realistically --

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Mr. Hytner, I wonder whether we
are really getting much further with this.  We have
pursued it with a lot of witnesses.

    Mr. HYTNER:   We have, sir.   Thank you, Mr. Evans/

    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Thank you very much, Mr. Evans.

     Mr. PHILLIPS: Glen Kirton please. Sir, I just want
to deal with two matters with this witness - paragraphs 4
and 6 of his statement.

    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you.

                                                  G. KIRTON

                    GLEN KIRTON - Called
                  Examined by Mr. PHILLIPS:

Q. Are you Glen Kirton?    A. I am.

Q. Are you employed by the Football Association as the
   Commercial and Public Relations Officer?   A. That's
   right.

Q. You went to the match-, did you, on the 15th April of this
   year?   A. I did.

Q. You say that you handed over some tickets to the Club
   Secretary, Mr. Mackrell?   A. That's correct.

Q. How many, in fact?     A. I think there were probably three
   dozen.

Q. Three dozen?   A. Three dozen complimentary tickets that
   had been unused by the Football Association.

Q. These three dozen tickets, would they have been for use
   in the South Stand, in fact?   A. Yes, they were in the
   VIP area in the South Stand.

Q. Now, you were there well before the start of the match,
   I think, and did you find yourself near to the players'
   tunnel at about 20-to-3?   A. Yes, I did.

Q. And were you there with Mr. Mackrell?      A. Yes.

Q. Was anybody else there at the time? A. I donât recall
   anybody with us. There were a lot of people around
   because the photographers had all started to gather round
   that area in anticipation of Mr. Clough coming out towards
   kick-off time.

Q. Were you and Mr. Mackrell looking round the ground?        A. Yes,
   we were.

Q.   Did you notice anything in particular?    A. Mr. Mackrell
     volunteered to me the statement that there were a lot of
     people still to come in. I looked around the ground and
     agreed that there were a number of seating spaces still
     left.

Q. Where particularly?   A. In the stand opposite me, in the
   North Stand, some in the West Stand. Mr. Mackrell said
   that there were still some 20,000 to come in. I expressed
   surprise because I couldn't see where 20,000 people could
   go. I pointed to the Kop and said, for example, "The Kop
   looks pretty full to me" and Mr. Mackrell said "You would
   be surprised with the packing of the terrace, there are
   still a lot of people to come on there."

Q.   Did you look at the terraces at the west end of the ground,
     the Leppings Lane terraces?    A. Yes, I dMfi
                                                G. KIRTON
Q. What did you observe?     A. That there were spaces.

Q. Where particularly?     A. On the flanks.

Q. That is the north west and the south west pens?    A. ThatAs
   correct.                                            ^

Q. What about the centre sections? A. To the best of my
   recollection, it was reasonably full.

Q. And you did not think, did you, that the ground would take
   another 20,000 people? A. I was surprised, but I'm not
   an expert on the packing of grounds or the estimation of
   capacity of grounds, so I accepted Mr. Mackrell's word for
   it.

Q. This figure of 20,000, was it coming to you as a fairly
   accurate figure that was being given or an approximation
   or what? A. I believe he said "There arearound 20,000
   people still to come in".

Q. Did you know that very close to where you were standing
   there was the Club's control room with computers which
   count up the people going through the turnstiles? A. No,
   I did not.

Q. Did you know that the Cl&toMiad that sort of system?     A. Yes,
   I knew they had a counting system.

Q.    So that it would be possible therefore   fortheSecretary
     to know how many were still to come?   A. Yes.

Q.    When you heard this figure at 20-to-3,   didyouthink it
     would be likely that they would get in in time for the
     kick-off?   A. As I have said, I am not an expert on the
     packing of grounds. My recollection of what went through
     my mind is that that was a lot of people in the time that
     was available, but to put the conversation in its context,
     it was a passing remark. Mr. Mackrell conveyed to me no
     concern aboutcthe supporters coming in, so I gave it no
     further thought.

Q. Was anything said about delaying the kick-off?   A. Yes.
   I said to Mr. Mackrell "In view of the fact that there are
   a large number of people outside, are the police going to
   ask for a delay in the kick-off?" and his response was
   "No, they are not".

Q. Did he tell you whether he had asked the police?       A. No,
   he did not.

Q. He did not? A. No. My assumption from what he said was
   that he knew what the position was with the police.

Q. I see. Would the P.A. or its representative have expected
   to have been consulted on the question of whether the kick-
   off should be delayed?   A. We would have texpected to have
( Â« l< t
                                50


                                                 G. KIRTON

           been kept informed. My view is that that is a decision
           that must be made by the police and that the Football
           Association would not obstruct in any way any request
           from the police for such a delay.




                                       /Q.   So there is no question
                          51

                                       G. KIRTON


Q. So there is no question of asking permission of the F.A.
   or its representative? - A. No, it would have been a
   courtesy that they would inform us.

Q. And you would not have objected in any way if the Police
   simply came to you and said: "We want a delay for 15
   minutes"? - A. Notvat all.

Q. Of course it is right, isn't it, that kick-offs had been
   delayed in 1987 at both semi-finals? - A. That is why
   the question sprung to my mind because I recalled a
   very similar situation two years before standing in almost
   exactly the same place when a Police Officer came by and
   said to somebody who I don't recall:  "I think we are
   going to have to delay the kick-off 15 minutes because
   we have a lot of people stuck on the motorway".

Q. Did Mr. Mackrell give you a reason why the kick-off
   shouldn't be delayed, notwithstanding the people to come
   into the ground? - A. Mr. Mackrell said the Police did not
   like delaying the kick-off because it caused all sorts of
   organisational problems at the end of the game.

Q. Do you know what he meant by that? - A. I believe my
   recollection is he then went on to talk about transport
   arrangements, getting people away from the ground, the
   timing of trains etc.

Q. So that was the reason as you understood it why the kick-
   off should be adhered to   if possible? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you have any inkling at that time of any danger to
     people either inside or outside the ground? - A. No.

Q.   Was there anything that youcould or would have done if
     you had have known about for example the crush outside
     in Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, if there was reason to believe
     that there was danger and I had further reason to believe
     that the Club or the Police were not dealing with it
     adequately, I think I would have expressed an opinion,
     but my general view and the view of everyone involved for
     the Football Association at the ground on such an occasion
     is that it is the role of the Police and the Club to deal
     with such matters and where there is no indication of
     anything untoward, it would not only be inappropriate for
     the F.A. to be involved it would be potentially dangerous
     for the Football Association to be involved.

Q. â'Dangerous"? - A. Yes, because when people are doing jobs,
   people who do not have the function of doing that job
   start to put pressure on them about things that they are
   not experts in, it makes their performance of that job
   less efficient.

Q. Your basic relationship was with the Club, wasn't it, so
   you would have spoken to Mr. Mackrell if to anybody? - A. Yes.
                                           G. KIRTOM


Q. Now I think you saw the start of the game and you saw
   the spectators starting to come over the fences at the
   Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you form a view about what was happening at that time?
   - a . My first impression was that we had a problem of
   hooliganism.

Q. What made you think that? - A. Nothing s p e c i f i c a l l y : that
   I saw because I had half my eye on the game and the other
   half on the terrace, simply years of experience. I have
   been responsible for the Football Association's press
   relations for the last twelve years and I know from
   experience any time anything happens in connection with
   football, we are immediately under pressure from the media
   wanting to know what the F.A. is going to do about crowd
   behaviour, so my immediate reaction was:    "Here we have
   another problem that I am going to have to deal with the
   Press on later in the day*"

Q. It is nothing that you actually saw then that gave this
   impression? - A. No.

Q. After the game stopped you saw I think the Chairman of
   Liverpool, didn't you? - A. Yes, I did.

Q.   Who wanted to have the game         called off?       - A. Yes.

Q. Did he speak to you about this? ~ A. Yes, he did.

Q. Why? would he speak to you about it? - A. Because he knew
   me as an Official of the Football Association.

Q.   And it was a matter for the Football Association, was  it,
     to call it off? - A. In his view yes he used thosewords.
     He said: "This is your event. You should be taking
     charge of it."

Q. What did you say to him? - A. I said:  "We are in touch
   with the Police whose decision on crowd safety and crowd
   control this must be, not the Football Association's."

Q. Had you at that time been in touch with the Police? -
   A. At almost exactly the same time and I believe just
   before that conversation I had spoken to a Police Sergeant
   and asked to be kept informed of what was going on.

Q. A Police Sergeant? - A. Yes, the nearest Police Officer
   to me was a Police Sergeant standing at the end of the
   p 1ayer's tunne 1 .
Q. A Sergeant Chapman. He was hot in control of the policing
   of the game, was he? - A. No he wasn't, but he was a
   Police Officer with a radio who could contact the person
   who was in charge of policing the game for us.

                                      G. KIRCON


Q. Did he do that in your presence? - A. No, he didn't.

Q. So to say you had asked for advice from the Police it was
   really to say that you had spoken to the Sergeant? - A.
   That is correct.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I think you said in your
     statement you asked him to put you in touch with the
     Officer in Charge of the event. Is that right? - A.
     That is right.

Q.         MR. PHILLIPS: What did you do about that or what
     did he do about that? - A. I can't answer. I asked him
     to do so. I certainly did not speak to that Police
     Sergeant again.

Q. You went I think with Mr. Kelly and Mr. Mackrell to the
   Control Room? - A. Yes.

Q. I just want to ask you about this because we have had a
   lot of evidence about what was done in that Control Room,
   but I want to ask you about what you were shown. What is
   your recollection of what you were shown when you were
   there? - A. Mr. Duckenfield spoke to Graham Kelly.  I
   was standing just behind Graham Kelly and Mr. Duckenfield
   said that a gate had been forced by supporters and he
   pointed to a monitor and said that that was the picture of
   the actual gate.
Q. What actually did that monitor show? - A. It was a scene
   outside the ground which conveyed absolutely nothing to
   me.
Q. Was it a still photograph that was being shown or a moving
   picture, a replay picture? - A. I had the impression it
   was television, it was not a still picture but there was
   no movement in it that I can recall.

Q. A frozen picture rather than one which showed movement?
   - A. Yes.
Q. You have seen the gates afterwards, haven't you? - A. Yes,
   I have.
Q. Did it show the large gates, the concertina gates that
   were exits from the ground at the end of a match or did
   it show the further out gates, the perimeter gate? - A.
   As I have said I am sorry I can't say that it conveyed
   anything to me. I derived no impression from it at all
   about gates or anything else.

Q. You didn't in fact scrutinise the picture when he showed
   it to you? - A. No I looked at it briefly and there were
   I think four or five other monitors there.  It was a
   very confusing picture for me.

Q. Was it a black and white or a colour picture? - A. It was
   black and white.
                                      G. KIRTON


Q. Would you look at Photograph 48 in West Midlands Bundle 2,
   the larger bundle and just identify, if you can remember,
   the monitor that you looked at. You see there, Mr. Kirton,
   there is five across the top and one at the end which has
   not got a number 06 it and then one in the corner below
   the bank of other monitors. A total of 7 screens. Can
   you identify which one it was you looked at? - A. I can't
   be absolutely certain but I believe it was 4 or 5.

         MR. PHILLIPS;   All right.   Thank you very much.


                 Cross-Examined by MR. HYTNER:

Q. Had you been with Mr. Mackrell for any length of time before
   this conversation? - A. I had been seeing Mr. Mackrell
   on and off from 10.35, but this particular time no, I
   don't believe so.
Q. Did you get the impression he had just come from somewhere
   else, possibly the Club Control Room? - A. I would not know
   where he had come from because I was actually on the pitch,
   but yes I had the impression that he had just come from
   the player's tunnel.


                 Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON;

Q. Mr. Kirton, it is well know, is it not, that despite a
   charismatic Manager, a successful team, Notts. Forest
   are relatively poorly supported? - A. They have a relatively
   low home attendance, yes.
Q. Do you think that if the Liverpool fans had known that
   they were actually returning tickets for the 1988 semiÂ­
   final, they may have been even more annoyed with the
   allocation of Sheffield Wednesday again for 1989? - A.
   Had the Liverpool supporters known that, yes, I am sure
   that would be correct.
Q. Until this morning it has been thought, has it not, that
   1988 was a sell-out and all the tickets Nottingham Forest
   were given were required by them? - A. That is the evidence
   we have heard this morning and that would have been my
   impression of the 1988 game, yes.

0. May I deal with one future matter. Many of the suggestions
   by the Football Supporters' Association have been considered
   and will be considered by this Inquiry in Phase 2, but can
   I ask you to deal with one subject, that which is known
   as the "Ombudsfan" initiative* Are you aware of the backÂ­
   ground to that initiative? - A. Yes.
 O. And in broad terms is it that there will be an organisation
    hopefully not called the Ombudsfan, who will attempt to
    put forward at various levels observation on behalf of
I                           55

                                         G. KIRTON


      the football supporters? - A. The view is often expressed
      within football circles, and I would largely subscribe
      to it, that the football industry in general does not
      relate well to its customers, the football supporters.
      The Football Association I believe will wish to attempt
      to play its part in putting that particular situation
      right. What form that will take at this moment I could
      not say.

    Q. Can we again through this Inquiry have your personal
       confirmation that you yourself are involved with and hope
       to go some way to Initiating the Ombudsman approach?
       - A. No, I am not prepared to say that I would like to
       use the word "Ombudsfan" or have a person or organisation
       that fulfils that function.  I would like to see the
       Football Association on behalf of the game in taking the
       lead in improving relations with supporters in general.


                   Cross-Examined by MR. KALLIPETIS;

    Q. Mr. Kirton, I believe you are the person who can answer
       questions about the satellite relay to countries outside
       of this country during that afternoon? - A. Yes, I can.

    Q. Just a question his Lordship asked yesterday, the revenue
       received from that. Do you have that figure by any chance?
       - a . No, I don't. What I can tell you is that the Football
       Association's total income from satellite broadcasting
       and the sale of videos of matches overseas in the course
       of a year would be about Â£lro. The semi-final would not
       be a large proportion of that. The main proportion is the
       F.A. Cup Final itself.

    Q. You were obviously aware that arrangements had been made
       to broadcast this semi-final by satellite. As far as
       you are aware were the Club aware of that arrangement?
       - A. It certainly would not have been conveyed to the
       Club on ajay official basis.

    Q. Do you know from anything that was said to you whether
       or not they were aware? - A. No, the subject was not
       mentioned on the day or subsequently.

    Q. You were asked about the incident in the Control Room when
       Mr. Duckenfield told you the explanation for the crush
       in the pens. Was Mr. Mackrell with you when he told you
       that? - A. Yes, this was on the first occasion that I
       went to the Control Room with Mr. Kelly and Mr. Mackrell.




                         /q . Where was Mr. Mackrell

                                                        G. KIRTON


     Q. And where was Mr. Mackrell? - A. I believe he was behind me.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I did not catch what the topic
          was?     Crush in the pens?

               MR. KALLIPETIS:   It is the story Mr. Duckenfield told
          Mr. Kelly as to the reason why there was a crush in the pens,
          the fans had forced a gate and people had rushed in. I am
          sorry, sir, I was trying to shortcut it:

     Q    Mr. Kirton, were you present yesterday when I asked questions
          of Mr. Kelly about that? - A. Yes, I was.

     Q. And I am not going to repeat all the questions.  Do you differ
        from him in his recollection of what was said and whether
        other people could have heard it and seen what was shown? - A.
        No, there was a lot of movement, as Mr. Kelly said, there was
        a lot of activity, but not an excessive level of jioise in the
        control room.                                     â 

     Q. So would you agree with his answer, bearing in mind that there
        were people working in that control box, "There may have been
        people who were not aware of what was being said to me but a
        significant proportion, the majority of people in that control
        box would have been aware what was said to me". Would you
        agree with that? - A. Yes, I would.

     Q.   And similarly, "Would they also be aware of what was being
          shown to support that story?" "Yes".   Do you agree that? - A.
          Y es.

     Q. Lastly this, please, Mr. Kirton. Can you help me. Can you
        give any explanation or assist us as to how John Motson of the
        BBC was able at 15.13 to say precisely the same story which
        was untrue, namely that fans had forced a gate and had rushed
        into the centre pens? - A. I have made enquiries.  I have
        spoken to him personally, and he was told by his producer.  I
        have spoken to the producer, who cannot remember where it came
        from.

                         Cross-Examined bv MR. GLASGOW:

     Q.   Mr. Kirton, you heard what Mr. Kellysaid yesterday about the
          conversation in the control box with Mr. Duckenfield? - A.
          Yes.

     Q. Do you confirm your recollection is the same as his, that you
        were behind him, and I think the words he used were that Mr.
        Mackrell was on the steps or coming up the steps? - A. I think
        he used the words, "Pushing up the rear".

     Q. Pushing up the rear? - A, That is my recollection, yes.

     Q. Perhaps we can just clarify this. Although Mr. Mackrell will
        not I think dispute anything you have said or that Mr. Kelly
        has said, it would not surprise you if he was unable to
        corroborate precisely what Mr. Duckenfield actually said? - A.
ft


                                                    G. KIRTON


        No, it would not surprise me.

     Q. Mr. Kirton, one other matter.  I should ask you this. Did the
        Police ever ask the Football Association whether the game
        should be postponed and the kick-off postponed? - A. No, they
        did not.

     Q. And that was a matter which was of considerable concern to you
        that that should be established, I think? - A. Yes.

     Q. You were, understandably, worried that it should be said or
        thought by anybody that the FA had been asked for a
        postponement and had not responded to it? - A. Yes. The day
        immediately following the match when we were in the Football
        Association office there was a press call from the Sheffield
        Star or Telegraph, one of the two, in which the journalist
        said that the Police had said that they had requested a delay,
        and the Football Association had said "No".  I was at great
        pains at that time to say that that had not been the case.

     Q. I think you, again perfectly properly, wanted to speak to as
        many people as you could to refresh your memory that there had
        been no such incident, and that the FA had never been asked
        for a postponement? - A. Yes, I spoke to Graham Kelly.  I
        spoke to Ray Lewis and to, I believe, Ernest Brown, the
        Chairman of the Challenge Cup Committee.

     Q. If I can jog your memory a little further, I think you
        telephoned Mr. Mackrell on the Monday morning? Do you recall
        that? - A. Yes, that is correct, I spoke to Mr. Mackrell.

     Q. And one of the matters, apart from a courtesy that his family
        had looked after your child, which was a courtesy call, the
        question of the rumour that you understood to be circulated,
        putting it crudely, against the FA, was worrying to you, and
        you mentioned it to him? - A. Yes, as I recall that
        conversation I said I could find nobody from the Football
        Association who was aware of any such request, and was he
        aware on behalf of the club of anybody having asked him or
        anybody from the Football Association.

     Q. I think that almost precisely accords with his recollection,
        that you asked him to confirm that he was not aware of any
        request that had been made by the Police at all about a
        postponement? - A. Yes.

     Q. Mr. Kirton, you appreciated that that was a very serious
        matter as far as both you and Mr. Mackrell's club were
        concerned, and that both of you took this rumour at that stage
        very seriously? - A. Yes.

     Q. And to get it in context, without wishing to make any trouble
        for the Police or anybody else, both you and he wanted it
        firmly established that neither the FA nor the club had been
        consulted about postponement at all? - A. Yes.  In many cases
        when you answer press queries you have to give an honest
        immediate response, and then you subsequently attempt to
                            58

                                                 G. KIRTON


     verify that your recollection and your knowledge of the
     circumstances is 100% correct.

Q. I am not suggesting it was anything other than a serious
   matter, but perhaps you could confirm that Mr. Mackrell was so
   concerned about it that he broke off his conversation to you
   to talk to his solicitor with whom he was actually in
   conversation at the time. Do you recall that? - A. I don't
   recall that specifically, but I won't dispute it.

Q. Can I help you about it. I think you know Mr. Mackrell quite
   well? - A. Yes, very well.

Q. When you rang him on the Monday morning he was in fact talking
   with his solicitor in his room, but he agreed to talk to
   you because it was you and the Football Association? - A. I
   can't vary the previous answer.  I do not recollect.

Q. Were you at least aware of the fact or do you recall that he
   broke off talking to you when the conversation about this
   Police rumour started, and said, "Hang on, I just want to talk
   to somebody", and did he give you a name? - A. No, I am afraid
   I d o n 't .

Q. You don't recall that? - A. No.

Q. The one matter which concerns me, and i am sure it is only
   recollection, and I am not imputing your honesty in any way,
   and as you would understand Mr. Mackrell most certainly does
   not wish me to do so, but when you were reassuring one another
   that there had been no request from the Police for a
   postponement, why on earth did you not tell Mr. Mackrell that
   your recollection had been that he had told you that he knew
   what the Police position was? - A. I am sorry, you will have
   to repeat the question.  I don't understand.

Q. You put in your statement and you told us this morning that
   Mr. Mackrell had told you that the Police did not want a
   delay? - A . Yes.

Q. And you told us as well that your impression was that he had
   spoken to the Police about that. When you rang him on the
   Monday morning to ask him to confirm his understanding was the
   same as yours, and that neither club nor FA had been asked for
   a postponement, did not you think to tell him of this
   conversation that you subsequently recalled and put into your
   statement? - A. No, I did not.

Q.   But the position was that while onthe one hand you were
     seeking reassurance from Mr. Mackrell that neither he had been
     asked for a postponement nor to the best of his knowledge had
     the Fa, you did not think it sensible to say, "Don't you
     remember, Graham, you told me that the Police didn't want a
     postponementâ , if indeed that was your recollection on the
     Monday? - A. No, clearly it did not cross my mind that I
     should so do.

                                                     G. KIRTON


     Q. When did you recall after speaking to Mr. Mackrell on the
        telephone that he had in fact told you that the Police did not
        want a postponement? - A. I recalled it on the Sunday when i
        put down on tape my full recollection of the previous d a y âs
        events.

     Q. And when you spoke to him on the Monday morning   seeking the
        reassurance you have told us about, you did not   think it
        sensible or helpful even to tell your friend of   this
        conversation which you say you recall with him?   - A. No, I
        did not.

     Q. There were I think two conversations between you and Mr.
        Mackrell on the perimeter area, on the touchline, that day.
        There were many conversations inside, I think, but two
        particularly on the touchline.  Do you remember that? - A. I
        don't recall the second conversation.

     Q. I am wondering whether you recall a first, because what I am
        going to suggest to you is that at least you knew what the
        capacity of the crowd was, the capacity of the ground in
        general terms? - A. Yes.

     Q. And if what you recall in terms of timing is right, you were
        being told at after 20-to-3 that the ground was only just over
        half full, and I am going to suggest to you that could not
        conceivably have been right with what you could see with your
        own eyes. Would you like to think about that? You know
        enough about football, d o n ât you, to be able to see whether a
        ground is half full or not? - A. I said in answer to the
        question earlier that I was surprised at the answer, but I am
        not an expert on the packing of grounds. I had no reason to
        doubt Mr. Mackrellâs competence, his control of whatever
        situation he was in. I had no intimation of any kind of
        danger.   That is my honest recollection of the conversation at
        the time.

     Q. One of the other matters you told Mr. Mackrell on t|ie
        telephone on the Monday morning, as I say in fact in the
        presence of his solicitor, whether you knew it or not, was
        that you had had great difficulty in recalling the timetable
        of events.  Do you remember saying that? - A. No, I donât
        recall saying that, but I will not dispute it.

     Q. Did you have difficulty in recalling the sequence of the
        timing of events? I mislead you. You did notsay sequence.
        You said the timing. - A. Timing.

     Q. I apologise.  - A. Yes, I think that is a fair statement.
        When you are trying to put down the events of what amounts to
        10 hours, the actual accurate timing of every event in those
        10 hours is difficult.
     Q. Again, Mr. Kirton, in your statement, you had not then written
        it. You had put notes on a tape recorder? - A. Yes.

     Q. But you were then in your statement going to refer fairly

                                                   G. KIRTON


       specifically to one very important conversation which you were
       going to say you had had with your friend? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. Did you not discuss that very important conversation with him
       when you telephoned him to express your concern about
       potential embarrassment of the FA's position? - A.
       No, I did not.

    Q. Did not you think even as a matter of friendship to the man
       you were ringing to thank him for looking after your children,
       his family for looking after your children, did you think it
       right to say, "Oh, by the way, I am going to tell people that
       you told me that the ground was only just half full at 20-to-3
       but that the Police knew all about it", something like that? -
       A. No, I did not.

    Q. Don't you think it is a quite extraordinary thing to have
       slipped your mind, bearing in mind you were going to talk to
       Mr. Mackrell about your concerns that morning? - A. You used
       the phrase "slipped my mind".  I did not say it had slipped my
       mind.  I said it did not occur to me that I should say it to
       him.

    Q. Did you deliberately withhold it from him, or did it slip
       your mind? - A . I withheld i t .

    Q. Did you withhold that piece of information from Mr. Mackrell
       because you wanted to ensure that you got something down on
       paper and communicated to Mr. Kelly to make absolutely clear
       that the FA, whoever else was involved, had been kept in the
       dark about the Police decision? - A. No, sir, I did not. That
       was not the purpose at all. The purpose was that I was
       putting down a recollection of events which would certainly
       figure at a later date, and that I did not want in any way to
       have my recollection of those events tempered by outside
       agencies.

    Q. But Mr. Kirton, I suggest the primary purpose of ringing Mr.
       Mackrell that morning was to get his confirmation that what
       you were going to say was right on the one matter that
       affected the FA, namely whether the Police had asked them for
       a postponement? - A. The one thing you have not put to me in
       the questioning so far is the period after 2.40. You are
       assuming that I am talking here about 'phone Graham Mackrell
       to find out whether or not by 2.40 he had been informed by the
       Police or not about whether they wanted a delay. At 2.40 he
       told me they had not and I accepted that.  The 'phone call was
       to ascertain whether subsequently they had in fact come to him
       or to anybody from the Football Association to the best of his
       knowledge.

    Q. If that is right why withhold the information from him when
       discussing the matter with him, knowing how seriously he was
       taking it? - A. Because my concern was to protect the Football
       Association's position.  I wanted to hear from him what his
       recollection was of what happened on that day.

    Q. And in order to protect the Football Association's position
       you were prepared to use your friendship with Mr. Mackrell in
       order to obtain confirmation of that part of the story which
       assisted the FA, while withholding from him the fact you were
       going to make a statement of a conversation which you knew
       would be damaging to him.  Is that right? - A. No, it is not
       right.  I was not using my friendship with Mr. Mackrell.   I
       was 'phoning him as an employee of the Football association
       seeking information from a club who had staged a match on our
       behalf.

    Q. You say you were not using your friendship with him, but you
       started the conversation with thanking him for looking after
       the child? - A. Absolutely.

    Q. And only after the pleasantries had been exchanged did you say
       something that I suggest so disturbed him that      he   actually
       broke off and spoke to his   solicitor, and you say you can
       accept that that happened although you don't recall it? - A.
       Yes.

               MR. GLASGOW:    Sir, I    am in your hands as      to   time

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR;          I had not realised   this pointwas
       going to take quite so long.        Have you finished it or not?

               MR. GLASGOW:    I have finished this point, sir.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Have you other points?

               MR. GLASGOW:    I have.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      We had better break off then.

                      Cross-examined            by MR.     HYTNER      (Cont. ):

Q.   And   then,     on   p ag e   59,   Crowd     Movement,        Paragraph        206.
     A.     Yes.

                                                  G. KELLY

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Does it come to this, Mr. Kelly,
     that if the F.A. had not set themselves up as officers of
     safety, in effect, that you trust to the safety certificate
     procedure so fir as safety is concerned, and safety is
     not a factor, outside that, that     would take into
     account?   A. No, I don't think we would.

Q.   Do you agree with me?    A.    Yes.


          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes, I see.   Thank you.

Q.        Mr. HYTNER:   Then my next question I shall ask very
     briefly because it is the identical point except it is
     on stewarding.   I will not bother to read you the green
     guide because clearly it does not concern you precisely
     what is in the green guide.   If you had known that there
     were no arrangements made between the police and the Club
     for the effective monitoring of overcrowding on the
     terraces and you had been told that, let's say in Mr.
     Evans's report in 1988, would that have made a difference
     as to whether you would have awarded the semi-final to
     Hillsborough?    A. I suspect it would have been a factor
     for concern.

Q.   Good. Now the gates in thtesperimeter fence.  If you had
     been told by Mr. Evans in his 1988 report that the gates
     in the perimeter fence in two of the pens at the Leppings
     La&eend did not conform to the widths necessary to make
     them safety exit gates from the terraces, would that have
     made a difference to your attitude?   A. My answer would
     be the same; that would have been a caise for concern.

Q.   So all these three things, if you had known them - and I
     am sorry, without discourtesy I actually did demote you,
     because you are the Chief Executive of the F.A. rather
     than the Secretary ---- A. I am both, sir.

Q.   You are both. So you can make decisions on behalf of the
     F.A.?   A. Again that is a very complex question.  I can
     make certain decisions but not all.

Q.   The three matters that I have put to you can now be put
     quite simply.   If you had been told of these three things
      in Mr. Evans's report of 1988, these would have been
     matters of concern and might well have altered your view
      as to whether Hillsborough should have been awarded the
      semi-final?   A. Yes, that's correct.

Q.   Added to that, if you had been told that at some time
     previously to 1988 the tunrstile arrangements at Leppings
     Lane end had caused sufficient concern to the safety
     adviser to the Club, that plans had been drawn up to
     improve the lay-out and that these had been abandoned
     on grounds of cost or for some other reason --

          Mr. COLLINS:  I am sorry, I am muttering slightly,
     because I am not sure that that is what the evidence will
     in fact produce as a conclusion.  I am ntsfc sure that the
                              69

                                                G. KELLY

     premise is correct.

          Mr.   HYTNER:   That is important. Thank you. We
     have not   yet had the evidence and I am putting a premise
     that may   not in the end be right. Do you follow, Mr.
     Kelly?     A. Yes, I understand.

Q.   If Mr. Collins says that, then I will not press that
      question.   I will simply ask you at the end this: There
      are two matters and one arises out of your own observation
      on the day and the other subsequently. Are you now aware,
      Mr. Kelly, of the very deep feelings of resentment among
      the Liverpool supporters that two years running they have
      been; allocated a ground and an end of the ground where
      they have had inadequate tickets? A. Yes, I am aware of
      that.   I have met them and talked to them about it.

Q.   Has the reaction of the Liverpool Club and the spectators
     in that regard taken you by surprise, that they have felt
     that strongly?    A. I don't know that I've had much
     reaction from the Club. From the spectators I have had
     a lot of reaction but a lot of it was immediately after
     the event and feelings were running very high.  I suspect
     they still feel very strongly about it.

Q.   I think that is right.    Has that strength of feeling taken
     you by surprise?    A.    No, I don't think so, I don't think
      so.

Q.   Is it a matter which you can give some assurance about
     in the future that in the future the amount of support
     that a Club has in relation to the opposing Club will be
     taken perhaps more heavily into account than it has in the
     past, in allocating grounds?   A. I feel sure it will
     after this year.

Q.   I think everyone will be happy to hear that.      Lastly -
      and again please do not think that this is any attack
      on you at all; it is not - we have heard of a
      conversation, at least you have told us of a conversation
      between Mr.Kirton and someone else at   the tunnel at
      2.40?   A. Yes.

Q.   You were told of it.     You know of it?   A. Yes.

Q.   I know and we all know that you did not know about it at
      the time.     If at 2.40 you   had been told, I     suppose asa
      visitor to   the ground but    neverthelessthe Chief Executive
      of the F.A., that there were still 20,000 to come and that
      most of those were Liverpool supporters, would that have
      caused you to take any action or would you have regarded
      the organisation of the match as beyond your control and
      beyond your interference?    A. I think I would have raised
      the question.   I think I would have said "Do the Police
      want to defer the kick-off for 15 minutes to allow all the
      spectators into the ground?"

Q.   It would clearly have been a matter of some concern, would
     it not?   A. Yes, I think so.

                                                             G. KELLY

                     Mr. HYTNER:   Thank you very much.

                            Cross-examined by Mr. JACKSON:

           Q.   Mr. Kelly, will you have before you please the Order and
                 Security in the Stadia (Category A matches) please?
                 A. Yes, Mr. Jackson.

           Q.   I have in mind No. 5 under "Ticket Sale and Distribution",
                where the observation is "For security reasons a minimum
                of 5% of the tickets of each standing sector to be left
                unsold". First of all, because you are the head of the
                organisation you are deemed to know everything about
                everything, but have you actually seen that before, that
                particular provision?   A. Yes, I have, yes.

           Q.   Are you aware as to whether or not that observation,
                 recommendation, or whatever, is followed in all-ticket
                matches in this country?    A. I have never known of its
                 relevance to all-ticket matches in this country, Mr.
                Jackson.   It is purely a UEFA requirement as far as I
                 am aware.

           Q.   And I think it would be right that we would not find it
                if we looked at the document that we have looked at this
                morning in the core bundle, the Mr. Croker translation
                of that document to the English clubs?   A. That's correct.

           Q.   May I on behalf of the Football Supporters' Association
                thank you for the concession that with hindsight Hillsborough
                was perhaps a little unfortunate as a choice of venue,
                but may I press you, regrettably, on one aspect of that.
                In your statement at paragraph 26 you make it quite clear
                that Mr. Robinson contacted the F.A. before Hillsborough
                was chosen. There seemed to be a little doubt early this
                morning, and I ask you to look, if you will, about half
                way down the page:    "I was told by Mr. Clarke later
                that morning that a telephone call made to him by Mr.
                Robinson of Liverpool concerning the possible selection
                of Hillsborough ..."   So the position was, was it not,
                that in 1988, after Hillsborough had been chosen, Liverpool
                complained, but in 1989, before Hillsborough was chosen?
                A. Yes, that's correct.

           Q.   I do not want to be unfair to anyone who is not giving
                evidence but can we be very blunt about this. You told
                Mr. Wiseman of the position and he never told the committee?
                A. Neither of us told the committee.




                                            /Q.   Would it   have been your

                                             G. KELLY


    Q.    Would it   have been your duty or your task to tellthe
         committee when you had already told its Chairman?  - A. That
         is a matter for my judgment.  I should make it clear I
         was telling not the Chairman of the Committee, I was telling
         Mr. Wiseman who I regarded as being in the driving seat on
         this particular matter.
    Q. One does rather get the impression from your statement that
       whatever Mr. Wiseman said the Committee would do?    A. I
       don't think that was the case, Mr. Jackson, but I certainly
       think that Mr. Wiseman's 15 years on this particular
       Committee, the last ten of Chairman, wOuld have weighed
       very heavily in his favour if he was arguing a point.

    Q. I think you put it more delicately than I did. You
       "I am told his recommendation is usually adopted ? - A. xes.
       It is my experience that his recommendation is usually
       adopted, invariably adopted.
    O. May I move to the next point. We have heard time and time
       again of this very favourable report from Mr. Evans and
       would you look please at page 3 of his report.  I havÂ®
       been looking for some time for someone to put my questions
       about figures to. I am going to try again with you and
       eventually I may get someone who can answer them.

               If we look at number 20 we see some rather surprising
         figures. This was a sell-out 1988, tickets in great demand?
         people clamouring for tickets? Liverpool complaining about
         their allocation, only 51,622 were admitted. That is the
         first point.
               Secondly, and perhaps much more i m p o r t a n t l y , when we
         look at the West Stand and terraces we see that 1.5,204
         people were admitted when we are told the S a f e t y Certificate
         only allows 14,565 in those two areas, so if anyone had
         applied their minds to those figures it would have
         you this impression would it not, that the number of ticke
         available were not all used but more p e o p l e went into the
         terraces on Leppings Lane than were provided for by the
         Certificate? - A. Yes, that would appear so from these
         figures.

     Q. Aqain Mr. Kelly I don't want to be unfair, those figures
        have been before us for some days and we have spent some
        time looking at them. Do I take it they would not be the
        subject of such analysis by the F.A. when they were
        presented? - A. Well yes, that is right.

     Q. Because it would seem, you see, that although and we have
        just been given today the figures for the Aston Villa
        stadium at Birmingham when Norwich piayedEverton^there
        the capacity was some 46,553, virtually about 50 more than
        capacity.
                At the Spion Kop in 1988 only 18,564.        Mr. Kelly,

        may I suggest ...
              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I am sorry, you have lost me.
        We are at a different ground are we now?

              MR. JACKSON: Yes indeed. I have moved back sir.
        I have drawn his attention to the fact that there are semiÂ­
        finals and I used an example Everton and Norwich of this
        year when the capacity of 46,553 was up by 50 only, but
        when we look at the Spion Kop populated by Notfes. Forest
        fans in 1988, something under 2,500 were missing and
        Mr. Kelly, may I suggest that that would have given anyone
        who knew anything about football this impression: there
        were more tickets allocated to Notts. Forest than they
        could sell? there were likely to be touts selling tickets
        for the Kop to Liverpool fans and that the terraces at
        the Leppings Lane end had been overfull inl988. I draw
        those matters to your attention.
              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well are you asking a question?

              MR. JACKSON:   Yes indeed.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well then would you like to
        pause for an answer?
              THE WITNESS: I can understand what Mr. Jackson is
        saying my Lord, certainly.  I am not sure how I can answer
        the question.
              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Well it is not an easy question
        asformulated to answer, with respect.

              MR. JACKSON: Sir, that was in fact drawing your
        attention to certain figures before I pose this question.

      Q. If someone with a knowledge of football and the football
         world had applied his mind to those attendance figures,
         would not most of the problems that actually did arise in
         1989 have been spelt out? - A. That may be but I don t
         know where these figures have been taken from. Presumably
         they were obtained by Mr. Evans from Sheffield Wednesday
         at the end of the day.
      Q. Mr. Kelly, may we say this: when you said earlier that you
         had applied your mind in the main to the 1988 Report, if
         you had applied the observations I have put about the 1988
         Report it may well have reflected differently on your conÂ­
         clusion? - A. That may well be but the general consensus
         was that 1988 had been excellent.

      0. May I leave that matter, Mr. Kelly, and turn to mention
         very briefly elements that may well be more importantly
         or better dealt with in Part 2 but need to be mentioned
         briefly at this stage.

                                        G. KELLY


            Am I right in saying that the task of providing an
      appropriate stadium for a 1990 semi-final is almost beyond
      the abilities of anyone bearing in mind the state of the
      stadia available? - A. I should say that the range of
      options available when selecting semi-finals for 1990 will
      no doubt be narrower than they were this year.

    Q. Isn't it quite clear, Mr. Kelly,that times have changed
       and new stadia are required? - A. I agree entirely. That
       is what we are saying in our submission to his Lordship in
       Phase 2.

    Q. May I move to perhaps the most important part of my
       instructions.
             It is right, is it not, that prior to let us say 1985
       the relationship between the F.A. and their customers was
       almost non-existent? - A. I know what you are getting at.

    Q. That is why I asked the question? - A. The customers of
       football are by and large the customers of the Football
       League Clubs and liaison between Football League Clubs and
       their spectators is sometimes good, is sometimes bad.

    Q. Is it fair to say that over the last two or three years
       there have been great steps taken by the F.A. to liaise
       better with various Supporters' Associations? - A. Yes, we
       have had meetings with the two main organisations representing
       supporters, your own clients and the National Federation of
       Football Supporters' Clubs. Earlier this season I recommended
       to the F.A. and to the League that they set up a formalised
       liaison procedure whereby I and my counterparts in the
       Football League could meet representatives of these two
       Associations on a regular basis and that is taking place.

    Q. Finally, Mr. Kelly, may I ask this: am I right in saying
       that the Football Association is going so far as to be
       actively considering some sort of funding for the Associations
       who will liaise on behalf of the supporters? - A. Well that
       point was put to me in a private meeting by those whom you
       represent, Mr. Jackson, and it is under consideration.   It
       has not gone too far in the F.A. yet because we have had
       all these other matters, but it is under consideration.

             MR. JACKSON:   I am obliged to you.


                      Cross-Examined by MR. MULLER:

    Q. Mr. Kelly, would you be good enough to have a look again
       at the UEFA Booklet.   It does not matter whether you are
       looking at B Grounds or A and in particular at that subÂ­
       section headed "B. Measures at the Ground" and sub-paragraph
       6 . which deals with protection of the playing field by
       means of a fence and so on. Have you got that? - A. Yes,
       I have sir.
                                  G. KELLY


Do you see after 6 )these words appear:

      "Fences must have sufficient security gates
      opening towards the playing field .

What do you understand by "security gatesâ*? - A. I understand
gates, exits from the terrace or from the area presumably
manned by appropriate personnel so that in an emergency
spectators can gain access to the playing area.




                      /Q. Something may or may not

                                                      G. KELLY


     Q. Something may or may not have been lost in the translation of
        this document, and I am not going to ask you about that, but
        as far as the word "securityâ is concerned, do you understand
        that is something which is to do with safety, or something
        which is to do with access by the Police into the area on the
        terrace beyond the perimeter fence? - A. I understand it to
        mean access by the spectators to the pitch through the
        barrier in an emergency.

     Q. If that is so, perhaps it is an unfortunate word to use,
        "security", but you no doubt are aware that the Green Guide
        requires that there should be access also for Police to get
        in? - A. Yes.

     Q. Are you aware of that? - A. No, I am sorry, no, I am not.       I
        would need to check it.

     Q. I don't want to go into the details of it, but all I am asking
        you about this if you can help us about this, because you had
        expressed a view in relation to whether or not you would be
        concerned about the situation in answer to Mr. Hytner, are you
        aware that as far as perimeter gates are concerned there is
        perhaps a conflicting interest, in the event of an emergency
        for people to get out when you want people to get out as
        quickly as possible, and on the other hand if the Police want
        to get in they want to get in with as few as possible getting
        out out when they open the gates to get in? - A. Yes, I
        understand that.

     Q. There is a conflict, is not there? - A. Well, that is why my
        understanding is the Police man the gates, and they take the
        appropriate action.
     Q.   Just follow me a moment. Can you not appreciate that the
          width of the gate, although a wide gate may assist people in
          getting out - do you follow me - in an emergency? - A. Yes, I
          understand you.

     Q. It will also assist people in getting out when there is not an
        emergency.  - A. Yes.

     Q.   And the Police, obviously, when all they want to do is to go
          in and pick out some trouble maker, they don't want people to
          come out on to the pitch, do they? - A. No.

     Q.   And so there is a problem to be resolved in    balancingthe
          conflicting interests of the Police and getting in, and the
          interest of safety in getting people out if there is an
          emergency? - A. Yes.

     Q.   Can     you help me    about this.  I understand Mr. Walker, one of
          the Inspectors appointed by the Football Association, went to
          this ground in 1987? You told us about that? - A. Yes, I did.

     Q. And specifically looked at the perimeter fences? - A. Yes, I
        think he did.

                              76

                                                   G. KELLY


    Q. You told us earlier on he did. - A. I said he reported that
       the perimeter fences were standard.

    Q. So he was obviously looking at the perimeter fences? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did he make any complaint whatsoever about the width of the
       gates in the perimeter fences? - A. No, sir.

    Q. And he is a man who would be very well familiar with the need
       for such gates and be able to compare the facility in relation
       to gets at Hillsborough with other football grounds? - A. Yes.

    Q. Just to deal with one other matter. You said in answer to my
       learned friend, Mr. Hytner, that if you had been told that the
       gates were not of the width required by the latest Green
       Guide, namely 1.1 metres, you said that would be a matter of
       concern which you would report. Can I just ask you this. Are
       you aware, and if you have got the Green Guide in front of
       you, that at paragraphs 6 to 8 , the very beginning of the
       Guide, that in those paragraphs the Guide specifically draws
       the attention of people to the fact there should be a degree
       of flexibility in the application of the Guide? - A. I
       attempted to make that point to M r .. Hytner, but perhaps not
       quite so eloquently as I should.   I said the Guide was
       precisely that, a guide to clubs and to local authorities.

    Q. What I am trying to understand, if you appreciate that there
       may be, if you look at example 8 , it should be borne in mind
       that when using the Guide to assess where existing
       circumstances provide adequate safety for spectators, the
       criterion to be aimed for is that of a reasonable degree of
       safety. You see that? - A. Yes, reasonable degree, not
       absolute.

    Q. Yes. What I am asking you about is in going along with Mr.
       Hytner as you have, if you had been told that the gates were
       narrower than they should be and they had, for example,
       always been so, would that necessarily have given you concern
       in the light of the fact your own Inspector had looked at it
       and made no complaint of it, and in the light of the fact
       that the working party had presumably approved it, that is
       to say the working party from the local authority which
       issued the certificate? - A. The point put to me by Mr.
       Hytner was, would I have recommended the choice of
       Hillsborough if, if, if, and what I was saying was that
       would have been a cause for concern if there was any
       evidence produced to me that there was a degree of unsafety.

    Q. Mr. Kelly, what I am putting to you is the more fact that
       there is a breach of the precise terms of the Green Guide
       enough to give concern in the light of what appears in 6 to 8
       of the same Green Guide? - A. It may alert me to a possible
       problem, and if I was concerned I would examine it, and I may
       be able to alleviate my concern.

    Q. Does it come to this, that it would alert you to something
       perhaps you ought to consider, but does not necessarily mean
5   .

                                                         G . KELLY


             it is a matter for concern? - A. It may be a matter for
             concern.  I may be able to alleviate that concern without it
             becoming serious.

                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We are into semantics now, Mr.
             Muller.  "Concern" can mean unworried or "concernâ may mean
             that you have raised a point and I had better consider it.

                  MR. MULLER:   If that is what he means I am quite content
             with the answer:

        Q. All I am putting to you, can i put it in this way, Mr. Kelly,
           the mere fact that there is a breach of the Green Guide does
           not mean to you or to anybody that the situation is unsafe and
           therefore unfit for a Semi-Final, does it? - A. That is
           correct. One does not talk in terms of breaches, because it
           is not a statutory document.

        Q. And although somebody drew your attention to it you might note
           it, you might very at the end of the situation come to the
           conclusion that bearing in mind the flexibility that is
           allowed the overall situation still is a safe one? - A. That
           is a possibility, yes.

                          Cross-Examined bv MR. KALLIPETIS:

        Q. Mr. Kelly, would you be kind enough to take the Sheffield
           Wednesday Football Club bundle of documents, the black folder,
           and turn to page 126. That is a photocopy of the Semi-Final
           arrangements which your Association promulgates for the
           purposes of requirements for clubs being appointed to hold
           Semi-Finals? - A. Yes.

        Q. On page 126, at the bottom of the page, is a reference to
           doctors? - A. Yes.

        Q.        "The stage clubs must arrange for a qualified medical
                  practitioner to be in attendance", etc.

             - A. Yes.

        Q. Is that doctor designated for the convenience or for the
           attention to players or to the public? - A. The prime reason
           for this stipulation is because of the possibility of injury
           to players.

        Q. Is there any function at all envisaged by the FA that that
           doctor would also be available to assist in the case of injury
           to the public? - A. I am sure we would be happy him being
           there and being available to assist in the event of injury to
           the public, but his prime requirement is to look after the
           interests of the players.

        Q. Is there any mention at all in this document about a
           requirement for adequate first-aid facilities on the part of
           the clubs holding your Semi-Finals? - A. No, there is not.
           That is covered by the Green Guide as far as I am aware.

Q.   Would you bekind enough also in that document to turnto page
     70? - A. The numbers have gone off the bottom. Can you
     identify it?

Q. It is the Statement of Receipts and Payments form for the
   Coventry City-Leeds United match in 1987. - A. Yes, I have
   that.

Q. Please assist me in case I have misunderstood it. Is this the
   position, that all the expenses incurred in holding that Semi-
   Final are in fact paid for by the Football Associationand not
   by the club? - A. Yes, that is right.

Q. And from that do we see that the club received a straight 10%
   of the gross receipts less VAT? - A. Yes.

Q.   In 1987 that was in excess of Â£34,000? - A. Yes.

Q. Is it also right the cost of the Policing of that Semi-Final
   was just under Â£31,000? - A. Yes.

Q. Is it right the Football Association received a net payment in
   excess of Â£265,000? - A. Yes, for ordinary transmission under
   the stipulations laid down in the rules of the competition.

Q. Do we also see that the cost of providing first-aid attendance
   at that match paid to St. Johnâs Ambulance was Â£30.60p? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Would you be kind enough to turn over the page please and look
   at 1988.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Just before you do, can you
     amplify that? The Â£265,000-odd you say is for onward
     transmission in accordance with your rules? - A. Yes. Shall I
     give you the details?

Q. In general it would be helpful. - A. In very basic terms after
   the deduction of the expenses and the 10% to the staging club,
   and a further deduction of 5.5% under a specific FA rule which
   re-routes money to County Football Associations, the remaining
   balance is divided as to 25% to the Football Association, 10%
   to a pool which is shared out among the Football league clubs
   who enter the competition, and 65% goes to a further pool
   which is divided equally among the four participant clubs in
   the Semi-Finals. The other element in that pool i s , of
   course, the money from the other Semi-Final.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You were going over the page?

Q.       MR. KALLIPETIS:     1988, Mr. Kelly, is it right that from
     the income for that year the club received in excess of
     Â£34,500? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. The FA for onward transmissions in accordance with your rules
   in excess of Â£250,000? - A. Yes.

Q.   Would they also have been aware of what was being shown
     to you to support that story?   A. Yes.

          Mr. KALLIPETIS:      Thank you.

               Cross-examined by Mr. WOODWARD:

Q.   Mr. Kelly, may   I just ask you about that last matter which
     Mr. Kallipetis   has been pursuing with you. You went up
     to the control   box and Mr. Mackrell was with you, was he
     not?   A. Yes,   Mr. Mackrell took me and my colleague,
     Mr. Kirton.

Q.   So that was three of you who went into that box?         A. Yes.

Q.   And there were already the police officers in there?            A. Yes.

Q.   So it was very congested?       A.     Yes.

Q.   And there was a lot happening at that time outside?           A. There
     was a lot happening inside as well.

Q.   There was a lot going on both inside and outside?           A. Yes,
     obviously.

Q.   Mr. Duckenfield said something to you?        A. Yes.

Q.   You are not saying that in fact he pointed to a particular
     screen, are you?   A. No, I'm not saying that.   I'm
     saying my attention was drawn to a screen which purported
     to represent the broken gate, the forced gate or gates.

Q.   Your attention was drawn to a screen, you say, which
     purported to represent a broken gate?   A. The forced
     gate or gates; the forced point of entry.

Q.   What was said about this screen to which your attention
     was drawn?    A. I said "What has happened?" and Mr.
     Duckenfield said "The Liverpool fans have forced a gate"
     and my attention was drawn either by him or one of his
     officers to the screen above me.

Q.   And the screen had a picture on it, did it?         A.   Yes.

Q.   A view of something?       A.   Yes.

Q.   A gate?   A. Yes.

Q.   Did you see what it was on the screen?        A. It didn't mean
     very much to me really.

Q.   Did you know at that time that Mr. Mackrell had been down
     to Gate C?   A. No, I didn't.

Q.   Did Mr. Mackrell say anything to you in the box?         A. Not
     that I can recall, sir, no.

                                                               G. KELLY

             Q.   May I ask you about the F.A. and tickets please? The
                  Football Association concerns itself, amongs other things,
                  with the image that football and football matches have?
                  A. Yes.

             Q.   And safety and safe organisation are matiffilS that are very
                  much in your mind?   A. Crowd hooliganism is to the foreÂ­
                  front of our minds at all times.

             Q.   The size of crowds and crowd management are matters that
                  are important to you, are they not?   A. The image of the
                  game is important to us and the control of hooliganism is
                  important to us, certainly.

             Q.   At page 295 in the core bundle there is set out the Football
                  Association memorandum to League Clubs on crowd management.
                  Do you have it?   A. Yes, I do, sir.

             Q.   It speaks there in Section A of admission ofspectators?
                   A.  Yes.

             Q.   It there says at (b) "Under no circumstances should tickets
                  be sold on the day of the match", and that is in relation
                  to all-ticket match games?    A. Yes.

             Q.   You are aware of that provision there, are you   not?
                   A. Yes.

             Q.   Was that an important provision, an important stipulation
                  for the Football Association to be making?   A. Yes.

             Q.   Indeed it is the sort of stipulation which, if departed
                  from, would be a matter of considerable concern for the
                  Association, would] it not?   A. Yes.

             Q.   And if that activity was happening, that would have been
                  something that you would have wanted to know about?
                  A.   Yes.

             Q.   And if it had been happening, that is something that you
                  would have visited and dealt with very quickly? A. Yes.

             Q.   Because it is a matter of paramount importance if tickets
                  are being sold or are available at all-ticket match games,
                  it strikes at one of the planks of the strategy of having
                  an all-ticket match, does it not?   A. It defeats the
                  object.
             Q.   It defeats it. When you were considering in 1989 the
                  semi-final venue for the Liverpool matâ¬sh^.,you considered
                  Hillsborough?    A. Yes.

             Q.   And at the time that you made your decision, did you have
                   any information concerning the activity of Liverpool
                  supporters attending without tickets at games? A. No.

             Q.   You were not aware, were you, then, that on the 13th
                  February 1988 at the Watford v. Liverpool match, an allÂ­
                  ticket match, there had been a considerable number of
                            87

                                                   G. KELLY

     Liverpool fans who had attended without tickets?     A. I wasn't
     aware of that, sir.

Q.   Not only had they attended but they had been admitted to
     the ground on payment.  Did you know that?   A. No.

Q.   That would be something you would regard very serious iy,
     would it not?   A. Well, if I could qualify my answer
     to that slightly, sir, I would regard it very seriously if
     the all-ticket ruling was imposed by the Football Association.
     If the all-ticket arrangement was one for the Club and
     the local police concerned, I might not be quite so worried
     about it, but I would need to check the circumstances.

Q.   Whoever imposes it, the principle is the same, is it not?
     The objective is the same?    A. I would think so, although
     one has to question what reason has been given for an
     all-ticket decision.

Q.   If you look at paragraph A of your memorandum, this is
     concerned not with the imposition of an all-ticket label
     upon a match by the Association;   it is something that
     the police and the visiting club determine?   A. Sorry,
     the police and the visiting club?

Q.   I beg your pardon; clubs in consultation with the police
     and the visiting club. It is a matter for those engaged
     in the game?   A. Yes.

Q.   And not a matter   for the Football Association?   A. No.

Q.   So may I ask you the question again in relation to the
      Watford match on the 13th February, 1988.  If you had been
      aware of that, that would have been a matter of seriousness
      for you, would it not?   A. Yes, that would have been a
     matter for concern.

Q.   Not only would you have had tickets being sold or admission
     being given to non-ticket attenders, but it would also be
     a breach of Section G on page 298, Section G8, if you had
     not been informed of that - do you see?   Pagfe;-298: "It
     is the responsibility of the away Club to advise the home
     Club of the recent behaviour of their supporters at away
     matches"?   A. Yes, I understand.

Q.   So there are two matters:    first of all, the admission of
      people who have turned up without tickets, on payment, and
      also the failure to inform the F.A.?   A. Yes.

Q.   By the Liverpool Club, if they had been aware of it?
     A. Yes.

Q.   It is inconceivable that they cannot have known about it,
     is it not?    A. I should think so, yes.

Q.   Were you aware that on the    24th September 1988 again an
      all-ticket match had taken   place between Southampton and
      Liverpool?   A. No.

                                                   G. KELLY

Q.   You had not been informed?     A.   Not as far as I am aware,
     sir.

Q.   You see, in relation to that match again a number of
     Liverpool fans attended without tickets and were admitted
     to the ground on payment, a further breach of your A
     section, regulation (b)?    A. Yes.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Where do we get that, Mr.
     Woodward?

          Mr. WOODWARD:   Where do you get it, sir?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Yes.   Where do I find it?

          Mr. WOODWARD:   Sir, that is not in evidence at the
     moment.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    That is rather what I thought.

          Mr. WOODWARD: Sir, we have asked for the investigation
     to be done and we will be putting in a brochure with this
     material in it.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: We have heard about the Watford
     game but this is the first time that we have heard about
     this one, I think, unless I am mistaken.

          Mr. WOODWARD:  I think it is, sir, yes.  It is
     Southampton v. Liverpool, 24th September, 1988.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I have got it down, thank you.

Q.        Mr. WOODWARD:   An all-ticket match where, because
     of the presence of the fans, there was a decision to allow
     them into the ground on payment.   You were unaware that
     that had happened?   A. Yes.

Q.   Would you expect that to be something that not only the
     visiting clubs would inform you of but also the visited
     club?   A. I would like to have been notified of it, but
     I have to say that the attitude of the police generally
     throughout the country in relation to all-ticket matches
     is one which gives us some difficulty, because they do
     tend to admit spectators who turn up on the day rather
     than have tkern causing a problem outside the ground.

Q.   This is the responsibility of the police, is it, that
     these people are being admitted to these private grounds?
     Is that what ypov are saying?    A. I am saying that
     there is a very strong recommendation from the police
     on the day of the match to the Club to admit people who
     turn up without a ticket for an all-ticket match.

Q.   When that happens, do the F.A. make any representations?
     A. We have made a 1 ot of representations to the Association
     of Chief Police Officers over the years about this
     practice.
                         89



                                             G. KELLY


Q.   Have you disciplined any club in respect of it?    A. Not
     so far as I am aware, sir.

Q.   Were you aware of a Southampton v. Liverpool match on the
     12th December 1988 when a similar thing happened --

          Mr. COLLINS: Sir, I am sorry to interrupt but I am
     slightly concerned about this line of cross-examination
     because it appears to be suggesting that other clubs are
     to blame for various matters. They, of course, are not
     represented. These matters have   not been indicated in any
     way in advance. That is one aspect of it. Secondly, if
     my friend were to ask whether Mr. Kelly knew of any of
     these incidents or any incidents of this nature in relation
     to Liverpool and gets the answer "no", there does not
     seem a great deal of point in continuing to cross-examine
     in detail about them. But, as I say, it is the first
     matter that does concern us slightly, which is that these
     appear to be criticisms apparently levelled against clubs
     and there has been no indication and no forewarning that
     such criticisms, if appropriate,  are to be made.

Q.        Mr. WOODWARD:   Mr. Kelly, the point that is to be
     made against the F.A. is this: You have these rules,
     these regulations.  Do you make any serious endeavour to
      ensure that they are observed?   A. Yes, we make a
     very serious endeavour to ensure that our regulations are
     observed, but there are a number df separate facets in my
     answer to your question, sir. The particular memorandum
     is a memorandum which, although current, was issued in
     1985, on the 9th December 1985. The F.A. must rely not
     on the memorandum to take action against clubs but on
     their specific rules. The rules provide that clubs must
     take every precaution against disorder by spectators. If
     a club is "forced" by the police to admit visiting supporters
     who turn up on the day, I should have thought that prima
     facie that is a pretty good defence for the 61ub to offer
     and I am sure that Mr. Evans can give first-hand and much
     better qualified evidence than I on the practice of the
     police and clubs in admitting supporters without tickets.




                                /Q. But does not the Football.
                                    G. KELLY


But does not the Football Association have any responsibility
for co-ordinating its activities and ensuring that some
common policy is not only stated but actually followed? -
A. The Football Association can make representations to
the Association of Chief Police Officers, as I was saying
two or three minutes ago, so they if they Â¥Â«fe here would
say to you that each of the 43 Chief Constables has his
own autonomy and the Commander on the day has the operational
responsibility for maintaining law and order and if his
responsibilities are best served by shoving the people inside
the ground that will do.

That will doby shoving them into the ground? - A. No, I
said that he will do.
       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     No, he said thathe will   do.

       MR. WOODWARD:   I beg   your pardon.

 You see the presence of people without tickets at a game
 which is an all ticket game, people outside in the crowd,
 is something that one could well do without. It is an
 aggravation of a problem, isn't it? ~ A. Yes.

 And it would seem and I am not seeking to suggest whose
 fault any of   those events was, but thereappears  tobe a
 singular lack of communication between the Clubs, the F.A.
 and all those who may be concerned with the safe planning
 ofan event. Do you agree    with that? - A. There may be
 some lack of communication from the Clubs to the Football
 Association in accordance with the terms of our memorandum,
 but in fairness to the Clubs -the memorandum has not been
 reissued to them in the last three seasons and the Police
 themselves do not like all ticket matches. They are not
 easy to handle. They prefer not to have all ticket matches
 and that is one of the aspects to the background of fahis
 particular question.

. Does the F.A. have a view on this? - A. The F.A. has a
  view that all ticket matches are helpful in controlling
  hooliganism in selected cases. It makes representation
  to the Association of Chief Police Officers that in those
  cases they adopt a policy of not allowing the fans in
  because obviously if they allow the fans in in 1988 those
  same fans will go along in 1989 and it is a self-perpetuating
  problem.
       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Perhaps youcan help as to why
 the Police don't like, as you perceive it, allvticket
 matches? - A. Well they don't like all ticket matches
 unless there is the prospect of a capacity crowd. If there
 is not the prospect of a capacity crowd the Police take
 the view that people will still turn up and they would
 rather have them inside the ground than outside because
 they are better controlled there.
                                   G. KELLY


      Secondly the distribution of the tickets is not an
easy matter for the Police and the Clubs to handle and the
tickets can fall into the wrong hands or into the wrong
Club and that again is a problem for them, but I am sure
Mr. Evans can give you as good account of the problems.

      Suffice it to say it is the stated policy both of
ACPO and the Metropolitan Police that they do not like
all ticket matches.

      MR. WOODWARD: This semi-final was inevitably going
to be an all ticket match? - A. Yes, of course, it was a
capacity match.

And the choice of the venue, let us be square about it,
was the Football Association's choice, wasn't it? ^ A. Yes.

      MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you.


               Cross-Examined by MR. DYSON:

Mr. Kelly I would like to ask you first of all to go back
to the choice of venue topic and to consider with you
the importance of the experience of the staging Club.

      Would you take please the little bundle of about
30 pages which you have attached to your statement and go
to page 12. This is the list of the semi-final venues
for the last 20 years and one sees helpfully summarised
at the bottom of the page:  "Original choice of semi-final
venue Hillsborough 13 times, VillasPark 12" and then the
rest are set out including Old Trafford twice? - A. Yes.

I think if we look at the list with the dates above one
can see that the years in which Old Trafford staged the
semi-final were most recently 1974 and then before that
in 1971? - a . Yes.

Do you know first of all how it comes about that Old
Trafford has not staged a semi-final since 1974? - A. Well
there is no question about the competence of Old Trafford
so I would think that the most likely explanation is that
it was either Liverpool or Everton or Manchester in one
of the semi-finals and it was a less attractive venue for
whatever reason.

For geographical considerations? - A.Yes.

Are there any special problems which are peculiar to semiÂ­
finals which experience in handling semi-finals make it
particularly important should be borne inxfflAnd? - A. Well
just the general nature of a semi-final I would think,
Mr. Dyson. As everybbdy knows they are high profile, a
lot of tension, a lot of interest and it demands in my
                                  G. KELLY


view a special expertise and experience is very high on
the list.

      As I was saying this morning, Hillsborough have a very
good track record. When Mr. Collins was asking me I could
not find my sheet of paper.   I thought the figures were 13/5
in favour of Hillsborough when in fact I find out they were
13/2, so that is a very relevant factor.

What about segregation. Are there different segregation
considerations affecting a semi-final from those which affect
an ordinary home match? - A. Well yes, I am not sure about
segregation but certainly about crowd handling.  It requires
a certain degree of expertise because there will be two lots
of away supporters coming to the ground. You wonât have
75% home, 25% away. The entire ground will be foreign, if
I might use the word, supporters.

And roughly split 50/50 or as near as possible? - A. As near
as possible.

So far as the   50/50 split is concerned we are all I think
familiar with   your rule which says 50/50 and it finds its
way also into   the semi-final arrangements, that it is 50/50
unless you in   your discretion vary it? - A. Yes, that is
right.
50/50 or as near as possible. You agreed when answering
a question to Mr. Hytner, that in future you would take
into consideration the degree of support that the respective
Clubs had when making your allocation of tickets? - A. Yes.

I wanted just to explore with you what you meant by that
and in order to explore it can I ask you to cast your mind
back to the Liverpool/Wimbledon semi-final last year. Is
it right ___ A. Can I stop you. Liverpool/Wimbledon
final?
Wimbledon final, I am sorry. The Liverpool/Wimbledon final
last year, did you receive a request from Jji'S'erpool as to
the allocation of tickets for that match? - A. I am not
sure whether we recesiVedt a request from Liverpool before the
match. I think that their stated position has been that
since the match has been, that the allocation of the tickets
for the final should be on the basis of average home
support of the two finalist Clubs concerned.

What is your attitude towards that? - A. My attitude towards
that is that X don*t welcome it. I think that the Liverpool/
Wimbledon example was a 1 in a 100 years1 experience
where the Wimbledon Club have a very small following.

      My experience over recent years with Wembley finals
has been that if a Club is getting to Wembley for a major
final everybody in the town, fche surrounding area will
                                 G. KELLY


come to the ground, will want a ticket for the match, and
I think it is fair that the arrangements remain 50/50 for
a Wssmbley final.

      For example Norwich? Queens Park Rangers; Oxford United,
even in a more minor competition last year when I was at the
Football League we had Burnley against Wolverhampton Wanderers,
two Fourth Division Clubs and they took 81,000 people to
Wembley, so certainly an F.A. Cup Final is an occasion for
a resurgence of local pride*   We saw that with Coventry
City. I certainly think it would have been unfair for them
to have been denied their 50% of the tickets allocated to
the finalist Clubs.

Are you prepared to entertain a distinction in that respect
between the final and the semi-final? - A. If there is a
distinction. When I was replying to Mr. Hytner earlier
I was going along with the point that it was adding insult
to injury to give Liverpool Supporters fewer tickets for
the second consecutive year and I said I conceded there was
an element of unfairness perhaps in that, but certainly I
don't think there is a material distinction between a semiÂ­
final and afinal. People will want to come and support
their local team.

What I wanted to get clear from you, Mr. Kelly, was whether
by your answer you were giving any sort 6f an undertaking
that you would consider the possibility of giving a Club
which has a largesupport more tickets for a semi-final
than a Club which has a smaller support?- A. No, I was
conceding the element of unfairness for two consecutive
years for the Liverpool Supporters only.

So basically the 50/50 rule you think should continue? - A.
I certainly think it should continue, yes. It has applied
at the two main semi-final grounds for many years.

Does the question of neutrality of atmosphere come into
your considerations at all, the neutrality of the atmosphere
of the semi-final or the final? - A. Insofar as the support
be of equal volume or equal vociferousness if you like,
yes, I think it should be as far as possible equal.

Well now coming back to the choice of Hillsborough for 1989
and the history of complaints that we have heard about
from Liverpool first of all in 1988. You told us that
after the match in 1988 a complaint was made. Did you
receive anything in writing from Liverpool after the 1988
match? - A. I think I conceded before the match was played
there was a meeting at which Liverpool's feelings were
made known.

After the choice ___   A. I Must say I was not aware of
that meeting on the day of the selection this year, but
between that meeting and approximately 10 a.m. on the day
                                 G. KELLY


of the selection of venues there was no communication from
Liverpool on this subject or indeed from their supporters
as far as I was aware.

Did you receive after the 1988 match any complaint from
Liverpool about any aspect of the 1988 semi-final? - A. Yes,
the F.A. received one suggestion from Liverpool after the
1988 semi-final. That was in relation to the pooling of
the gate receipts.

      The two matbhes in 1988 were firstly Liverpool v.
Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday and secondly
Wimbledon v. Luton Town at White Hart Lane I believe. That
produced a comparatively small gate and the point being
suggested, the point being made by Liverpool in their
suggestion to the F.A. was that it was no longer fair for
the receipts from the two matches to be pooled, that
Liverpool and Forest should take a share of their match
and Luton and Wimbledon should take their share of the
lower receipts from the other match.




                 /Q. I don't think

                                               G. KELLY


Q. I don't think we need to trouble about the details of that
   complaint, but did the letter of complaint make any reference
   to their complaint about the allocation of tickets? - A. No,
   it did not.

Q. Did you at any time in relation to the 1989 match
   receive a letter of complaint from Liverpool about the
   choice of Hillsborough or the allocation of ends at
   Hillsborough? - A. no.

Q. It was put to you by Mr. Collins that there might have been
   even more of a problem in 1989 than in 1988 because Liverpool
   was in the running for the double this year. Do you remember
   that point being put to you? - A. Yes, I do.

Q. Is not it right that Liverpool was also in the running for the
   double last year? - A. Yes, they must have been.

Q. They won the Championship? - A. They won the Championship and
   they were in the Semi-Final, so they must have been in the
   running for the double, yes.

Q. You were asked questions by Mr. Jackson about the figures
   contained in the Evans report. As a matter of general
   practice, when you look at these reports do you look at that
   kind of detail and analyse those sort of figures, or do you
   look at the text rather in order to assess what the report is
   saying? - A. The report will normally highlight a particular
   problem. We certainly look at the general tenor of the
   report.

Q. You have had a chance to look at that report again.  Is there
   anything on the face of that report which puts you on notice
   that the figures were telling some sort of an alarming story?
   - A. No.

Q. So far as pre-match entertainment is concerned, may I deal
   with that very quickly.  I think you have frankly accepted
   that the non-event of the pre-match entertainment was as a
   result of something of an administrative slip up at the FA? -
   A. Yes, I have. Yes, I have to admit that.

Q. Is the history of the matter this, that for about 10 years up
   until and including 1988 the FA did organise something called
   a Super Skills singles competition for Semi-Finals? - A. Yes,
   I believe so.

Q. And that that competition involved boys showing off their
   juggling skills of one sort or another? - A. I would hope it
   would be boys and girls.

Q. I am sorry, boys and girls, juggling with various parts of
   their bodies but not their hands? - A. Yes.

Q. And that apparently would take place between 10-past-2 and
   2.35.  Is that within your knowledge? - A. Yes, I think so.

     Q.   Do you know whether it was a great success? Do you know
          whether it drew the fans in, or are you not able to comment? -
          A. I really don't know. I suspect not, but I don't know.

     Q.   Then it was decided in late 1988 to replacethat competition
          with something called Soccer Star competition, but the
          sponsors were not interested because it was not going to be
          the subject of live television coverage? - A. That is my
          understanding of the situation.

     Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Is that what you refer to as an
          administrative slip up then? - A. No, the administrative slip
          up was the fact....

     Q. Not telling them? - A. Putting a reference to Soccer Star in
        the arrangements for the Semi-Final, either not knowing it had
        been cancelled, or not being notified after that that it
        should come out, and the club should be involved.

     Q.         MR. DYSON:  Mr. Clarke, in compiling the document, just
          went back to the previous year's Semi-Final arrangements
          document, and assumed that the pre-match entertainment would
          take place, and he had not been told that it would not? - A. I
          believe so, yes.  I think by that time it had been decided it
          would not, but he was not aware of that. He had not been
          told.

     Q. What I want to ask you about very briefly is you were asked
        some questions about your attitude towards pre-match
        entertainment, and you cited the example of Watford. Watford,
        I think you said, is regarded as the leaders in this art, if
        that is the right expression, the most enterprising and go
        ahead in devising ways of making football grounds attractive
        for their supporters. Would that be fair? - A. I said they
        were widely regarded as one of the more imaginative clubs in
        their relations with the family supporter.

     Q. This is in fact in the submission that has gone in on Phase 2,
        but I can perhaps deal with it shortly because it is relevant
        to the evidence.  Is it right that Mr. Plumley, the gentleman
        you referred to, has written to Mr. Kirton the letter of 26th
        May this year, in which he first of all attaches a list of the
        pre-match entertainment that took place at Watford up until
        the Hillsborough Disaster, and he says:

               "I have never been under the impression that pre-match
               entertainment has encouraged supporters to come any
               earlier or that it attracts additional support.
               Nevertheless, whilst the entertainment is in progress it
               is fair to say that it adds to the spectators'
               preoccupation prior to the game commencing".

          - A. Yes, that is right, sir.

     Q. He then lists the examples of entertainment.  They do have a
        fairly strong musical bias; live music, bands and the like;
        but they do include the RAF Police Dog Demonstration Team and

                                                   G. KELLY


       the YMCA Display Team, which one imagines is some sort of
       gymnastic display, but I don't know if you can help about
       that? - A. No, I am afraid not.

    Q. I think Mr. Kirton is actually able to give some evidence
       about what goes on abroad, and I will ask him about that.     I
       won't pursue that further with you.

            Can I turn now to the question of perimeter fences, and
       your attitude towards perimeter fences. You were asked some
       questions this morning about Section D.2 of the 1985
       memorandum which spells out in terms that the clubs must
       protect the playing field by means of a fence, moat, double
       barrier wall or other system capable of denying access to
       spectators.  I think it is common knowledge that there are
       many clubs which do not have perimeter fencing or moats? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. That there are even more which have partial perimeter
       fencing? Right? - A. Yes.

    Q. Parts of the ground? - A. Yes.

    Q. And the attitude of the FA is not to regard those clubs which
       do not have perimeter fences all the way round or moats all
       the way round as being in breach of the regulations and liable
       to being disciplined for misconduct? - A. No, indeed. May be
       my answer to one of the questions this morning was slightly
       incomplete when I said that perimeter fencing came to the fore
       some 10 years ago. The FA was concerned about pitch
       invasions at that time.  In more recent years the
       trend has been rather the reverse. With the advent
       and increase of family enclosures, which by and
       large are terrace seating alongside the ground the
       trend has perhaps been towards the removal of
       perimeter fencing.

    Q. Is the attitude of the FA that it looks to the clubs to take a
       responsible attitude as to whether the club feels that some
       kind of physical barrier is necessary? Is that right? - A. We
       simply want to ensure that there is not pitch invasion. We
       certainly want to avoid the impression of cages and fortresses
       if that is at all possible.

    Q. But in the first instance is it right that the body to whom
       you look to decide whether in the particular case of the
       particular ground a fence or moat or whatever is required is
       the club? - A. Oh, yes.

    Q. And if by reason of there not being a fence or a moat there is
       a pitch invasion then what is the attitude the FA takes to
       that club? Does it regard that club as being liable to
       misconduct or what? - A. Yes, if there is a serious pitch
       invasion there is a possibility that the club will be
       disciplined and ordered to put fences up.

    Q. So in the first instance it is left to the club to take the
                          98

                                                  G . KELLY


     relevant responsibility? - A. Yes.

Q. How would the FA react to the suggestion that all forms of
   perimeter fencing and/or moats should be banned? - A. I think
   we would be very worried about that order, because experience
   has led us to believe that all the people can't be trusted all
   the time, and we would view the prospect of going back to a
   lot of pitch invasions as there were    10 years agowith some
   concern.

Q. A couple of other natters finally. Some suggestion has been
   made about the idea of having television screens at the home
   grounds so that fans don't go to the match, the Semi-Final,
   they watch it at their home ground. - A. Yes.

Q. Are you able to tell us about any experiments with television
   screens at any grounds in this country? - A. There have been a
   number of occasions over the years. This is not exactly a new
   development.  It goes back 20 years, but I don't think that it
   has been wildly successful over that time.  There have been
   technical problems.  It is a help.   It can be a help in
   relieving the demand on the match, but I don't think it is a
   panacea.

Q. In the last say 5 years have any clubs as far as you areaware
   employed a television screen for this purpose?

          MR. COLLINS:   It may be unfair to Mr. Kelly and to Mr.
     Dyson, but we do have some information about I think in 1988
     of a Liverpool match against Hull, a Cup match, I think, where
     a screen was employed at Tranmere Rovers for the purpose of
     showing the match to Liverpool fans who could not get there.
     We are seeking more details about it, but my understanding is
     that did happen and proved relatively successful. We are
     seeking further details about it, and I am afraid it was only
     drawn to my attention this morning because it so happened that
     the gentleman from Humberside who was involved in it was here
     this morning.

          THE WITNESS:   I have no doubt that is right.  I think
     you will find it was 1989, Mr. Collins.   It is a recent
     match.  It was a 4th or 5th round this year.

          MR. COLLINS:   Yes, you are right.   I think it was this
     year.

Q.       MR. DYSON:    Are you not able to speak from your own
     knowledge about other experiences of television screens being
     tried out and the extent to which they have been employed in
     the last say 5 years?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think rather than asking Mr.
     Kelly to come unrehearsed to this, there is a second stage
     which can be put on paper, no doubt.

Q.       MR. DYSON:    The only other I want to ask you about is
     the day in question, and just this. Do you remember late in
                                            G. KELLY


the afternoon of 15th April speaking to the media, and I am
sure you do remember that, but do you remember in particular
giving accounts to the media as to how this disaster had
occurred? - A. Yes, I remember it vividly.

                                              J. ASHTON

Q.   You saw police horses though, did you?   A. There were one
     or two police horses that I saw. There were only about
     half a dozen officers that I saw in total, and that may be
     generous, actually.

Q.   I think it is right, is it not, that your children joined
     the crowd of people going through the turnstiles but you
     chose not to?   A. It was too unpleasant. We got to
     within about 10 yards of the turnstiles and it was too
     crushed.  I didn't like it. I became somewhat claustrophobic
     and I withdrew. My nephew, who is 24, said that he was
     going in and it would get worse before it got better, and
     so he said he was going on. My two teenage boys insisted
     on going with their cousin, so I found myself withdrawing
     alone the first time. But all together I attempted three
     times before I went in.

Q.   And where did you go back to when you left the crowd of
     people?    A. The first time I withdrew, I just withdrew
     as far as the Landrover which had appeared at that point.
     It was about quarter-to-3 and there was a Landrover by
     the gates.

Q.   Would you look round, please, at where the pointer is
     showing? Was it in fact where it is being shown?
     A. Approximately that point, yes.

Q.   What was this Landrover doing?   A. It was doing nothing.
     Inside it, I think there were two officers.  This was the
     second time I withdrew. There were two officers in it.
     I knocked on the window and attracted the attention of one
     of the officers who was in the Landrover and I said to him
     "You've got to get a grip on this. The situation is
     totally out of control, there's going to be a tragedy"
     and he just looked at me in surprise.

Q.   Were there loudspeakers on the top of this Landrover?
     A. I didn't observe any loudspeakers. That's not to say
      there may have been.

Q.   Did you hear loudspeakers discharging messages to the
      crowd?    A. No, I didn't.

Q.   Could you see what those officers were doing, whether they
      were talking into any kind of microphone or anything?
     A. They appeared to be talking to each other.

Q.   I think you did in fact go into the ground      A. Could
     I just say that when I withdrew that time, I then went
     and stood by the wall on the other side of Leppings Lane.

Q.   On the river side?    A. On the river side, and I watched
      the whole scene until it eased off very suddenly about
      five-to-3 or 3 o'clock when I was able to go straight up
      to the turnstile and gain admission;   so I observed the
      whole events from 2.30 to 3 o'clock and I should like to
      say that I never saw any of the events that the officers
                          107

                                                   J. /ASHTON

     from the Constabulary have described in their evidence in
     the last week or so. At no point did I see some of this
     activity and behaviour in the crowd that was described by
     the officers; I want to make that point because I feel
     very strongly that that point needs to be made.

Q.   What are you talking about particularly? A. I am talking
     about the vandalistic kind of behaviour of the supporters.
     The supporters were pressing to get in the gates but I
     never witnessed any public drunkenness or violence or
     anything of that kind, and I was watching throughout that
     period from 2.30 to 3 o'clock.

Q.   Did you see people climbing over the turnstiles? A. Not
     over the turnstiles.   There were a number of people
     climbing up over the wall.

Q.   Did you see, during the time you were there observing it,
     the Police Landrover broadcasting messages? A. I didn't
     hear it broadcasting messages.

Q.   Did you see a line of police horses across the perimeter
     gates?   A. I never saw a lot of police horses.  The most
     I ever saw there were two police horses. There may have
     been more but I didn't see more than two.

Q.   Did you see anyone standing on the roof of the Landrover
      apparently talking into a microphone?   A.I can't
      remember seeing anyone standing on the roof of the
      LaMrover.

Q.   Did you   see any of the gates being opened, the larger gates?
     A. No.     The thing was I was watching from the other side
      of the road and there were a very vast number of people
      and then suddenly they had all gone in.

Q.   You did not see how they went in?    A. No.

Q.   Where were you standing exactly, Dr. Ashton?       A. Outside.

Q.   On the far side of Leppings Lane?   A. Yes, that's right.
     It's not very far.  I've just been there this morning and
     the scale is actually incredibly small.

Q.   So can we just have a picture of the sort of view you
     wsuld: have?   There is a bundle 'West Midlands 1' which
     may give us a clue. Do you see that there? A. I am sorry,
     which picture?

Q.   Look at the first picture. You will see a shot from
     approximately the position of the bridge over thfe river
     towards the corner shop --

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I am just wondering if he might
     do better with Composite 1, photographs 10 and 11, as a
     suggestion.

           The WITNESS: They are a bit too close up, I'm afraid.
     Is   there not one that has got a bit more  -

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I do not think he has got the
     right ones there.

          Mr. PHILLIPS:   When you say 10 or 11, sir --

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Composite 1.     I am sorry,
     16A and 17A.

          Mr. PHILLIPS:   And 18A perhaps.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   18A, yes.

Q.         Mr. PHILLIPS:   Look at 18A first of all, would you?
     A.   It's16A, actually.   It wasn't where I was standing,
     though.   I was standing further round to the left.

Q.   All right.   Look at 17 and 18A.    A. Yes, 18 is better.

Q.   Is that taken from a position that you were in? A. Yes,
     approximately.  I think I was a bit further back and to
      the left from there, I think.  Directly across from the
     shop there is a wall, a sandstone wall and I went back
     to the sandstone wall.

Q.   I think if you move to 19A you will find that that is a
     little bit further down the road.   A. Okay.   I don't
     know what time these pictures are but it was never as easy
     as that from the point of view of numbers of people.

Q.   We are concerned at the moment with the view that you
     would have, do you see?    A. Yes.

Q.   Does 19A represent the sort of view that you would have?
     A. I think more or less.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That is at 2.17, is it?

Q.        Mr. PHILLIPS:   It is a bit before you would have got
     there?   A. Yes.

Q.   Now, what time did you go through the turnstiles? A. When
      I eventually got through, it must have been 3 o'clock or
      just after.

Q.   Most of the people had gone?      A. Yes.

Q.   You had no trouble getting through at all?      A. No.

Q.   Did you see any of th^flarger gates open?      A.   No.

Q.   When you got through the turnstiles, where did you go to?
     A. Immediately I was a bit disorientated because the
      signing was very poor and I didn't know where to go. So
      I looked around to see where I should go and realised that

     to go the seating area in the stand you had to go to the
     right and up the stair there, but I went and bought a
     match programme - I think the booth was to the left of the
     entrance - and there were I think two policemen on the
     gate up to the stand itself and they were checking tickets
     again before people were allowed into the stand.

Q.   On your ticket it said which stand you needed to go on,
     did it not?    A. Yes, I have them here.

Q.   It said, in fact, that you were required to go on gangway
      Y?   A. That's correct.

Q.   And did you not see signs showing you gangway Y? A. I
      can't remember it specifically as that. All I can remember
      is that I found the gate to the stand.  It may have said
     Y, but I'm not sure. My memory in general is that the
      signing was very poor.

Q.   Can you just please look at this bundle of photographs,
     West Midlands 2, the larger bundle with the West Midlands
     logo on the front, and look at photograph 17?   A. Yes.

Q.   That, of course, is an empty yard,but do you see there
      to the left-hand side, X, Y and Z? A. Oh yes, I think
      thafet^ where I went up.

Q.   And that is the sign that    you were looking for, was it
      not?   A. That's it.

Q.   That is the sign?   A. Yes, and there was this gate, like
     a double gate across the stairway, yes.

Q.   And you had to go through there and up the stairway to
     the stand?   A. That's correct.

Q.   Now, when you got to the bottom of thestairway, did you
     have your ticket checked?   A. Yes.

Q.   Did anything happen when you were there?    A. Yes, there
     were two or three people ahead of me having their tickets
     checked and while I was there there was a man a bit older
     than me who appeared from my left, and I assume he had
     come out of the tunnel but he appeared from my left. He
     was weeping and very upset arid he said to one of the policemen
     on the gate "You've got to do something, there|s kids
     dying in there". The policeman just ignored him and
     continued checking tickets, checked my ticket, and then
     I went on up into the stand.

Q.   Did that policeman send the man off across the yard to
     others who were across the yard?   A. That's not my
     recollection of it.

Q.   You went up the stairway then, did you?       A. Yes.

Q.   And you went into the stand?      A.   Yes.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Did you take what the man had
     said seriously?    A. Yes, I was quite shocked and --

Q.   Did you say anything to the policeman?   A. I said "Don't
     you think you'd better see what the problem is". He wasn't
     actually --

Q.   You said that, did you?     A.   That is my recollection.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Yes.

Q.        Mr. PHILLIPS: You went up the stairs and I think
     looked for your seat. Was it congested in the West Stand
     when you went up there?    A. Well, I had now begun to
     worry because my two sons and my nephew had gone and I
     had realised that there was something going on. This was
     the first time I realised that there was really a problem
     as opposed to my anticipation that there could be a problem
     at quarter-to-3. So I hurried up the stairs and found
     that it was very congested at the top of the stairs,i that
     there were people in the aisle all the way back up to the
     top of the stairs, and that I couldn't make progress down
     to the row of seats where we had tickets booked, which was
     the second row from the very front.  I couldn't get down
     there because there were so many people actually in the
     stand.

Q.   When you got into the stand, were you able to see out on
      to the field of play?  A. Not immediately.

Q.   When you were able to look out on to the field of play,
     was the match still in progress?     A. No.

Q.   I think you   eventually managed to struggle   down to your
     sons and your nephew?    A. Yes, I went along the row
     adjacent to where I had come out at the top of the stairs
     because I decided that would be the easiest way to get
     down to the   front, and then I stepped down over therows
     down to the   second row to where they were and foundthat
     they were all right.

Q.   Can you say what time it would be when you got there?
     A. That must have been about ten-past-3 or just after,
     because the game had stopped.  I didn't even know the
     game had ever started, to be honest.

Q.   You would not have seen any of it at all, would you?
     A. No.

Q.   And what was happening at the front of the terrace? A. It
     was just chaos. The immediate impression there was of
     large numbers of people being; pulled up into the stand
     from the terrace. My nephew was involved in that. He
     was pulling up people with other people; and then you
     could see people on the pitch lying clearly very severely
     ill, distressed, some of them looking as though they may
     already be dead - one or two - at that stage.

                                              J. ASHTON

Q.   Were you able to see into the terrace from where you were?
     A. Oh yes.   Into the terrace?

Q.   Into the terrace. A. Only really towards the front.   I
     didn't really take in the terrace. My attention was drawn
     to the whole area of the pitch really.

Q.   What did you do?   A. My immediate concern was with the
     pressure that there was there at the front rows, because
     it was very squashed inthe front rows of the stand because
     there were so many people in there; and I wanted to get
     my own children back away from that pressure, so I persuaded
     my two sons to come back a few rows. My nephew, Carl,
     stayed because he was helping to pull people up. Then
     when I got back about eight or ten rows, you know, I was
     then able to appraise the situation in the stand and look
     across and see what was actually going on across the pitch.

Q.   These people who were being brought up into the West Stand,
     did they appear to you to have any injuries or to be
     distressed physically?    A. They were distressed. At
      that point there were no obvious serious injuries among
      those who were coming up. This happened last year as well,
      that people were brought up from the terrace into the
      stand. You could see them from where I was in the terrace
      last year; people were pulled up into the stand.

Q.   At what stage did it happen last year?A. I can't remember.
      It's a long time ago. But I remember seeing people being
      pulled up into the stand last year.

Q.   Could you say how many people were pulled up last year?
     A. I couldn't say.    I just remember noting it, you know.

Q.   Did you hear anything on the tannoy?   A. Yes, the tannoy
     was telling people to get off the pitch and get back into
      the ground, which I found in retrospect --

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Was it both, getting off the
     pitch and back into the ground?   A. To get off the
     pitch and back into the ground.

Q.   Pardon?    A. Well, they were saying to get off the pitch.
      I can't be certain about whether they said to get back
      on the ground. They said to get off the pitch.

Q.        Mr. PHILLIPS:   All right. Did you hear anything about
     doctors on the tannoy?   A. Not until about 20-past-3.

Q.   And what did you hear?    A. I can't remember the precise
      words but they tannoyed for maybe doctors and nurses; it
      may have been medical personnel.  It was to make themselves
      available to go down.



                                           /Q .   To where?
                                 J. ASHTON


To where? - A. Well they just said would they come out and
make themselves .... I can't remember the form of words
exactly.
Did you respond to that Tannoy? - A. Yes, I immediately
responded to that. I went down the back of Leppings Lane
Stand myself and leaving the boys for the moment just to
see what was happening and I met a Constable on the st&irs
at the top who was tending somebody who looked as though
they were moderately injured but were not critical and
I asked him who I should report to.

You spoke to a Constable? - A. Well I assumed he was a
Constable. He was a junior rank Policeman.

On the stairs? - A. On the stairs.

He did not know anything, did he? - A. He did not know.

So what did you do? - A. I went    down the stairs at the    back
into the yard and asked several P&licemen who I should report
to as I was a doctor, that I was answering the Tannoy, who
should I report to, and none of them had any idea who I
should report to.
Could you give us any idea of the sort of ranks these men
appeared to be? - A. After I had asked two or three I
assume Constables, I asked one of them who was in charge
of them, and one of them said: "I don't know but I think
he is" and he pointed to one of the other Policemen around
who had a different kind of uniform on so I went and asked
him what I should do.
What did he say? - A. He said: "I don't know.   I have just
arrived. Idon't know what is happening."

What was going on in the yard at this time? - A. There were
people lying in various places, a lot of people injured and
there were some people who were clearly dead already.

Could you see where they had come from? â A. Well I was not
clear at that stage. I assume they must have come from the
terrace somehow but the actual configuration of the area
was something which I only worked out subsequently.

Did you see people being brought through the tunnel from
the terrace? - A. Yes, some.
How were they being brought? - A. Through the tunnel. They
were just being carried manually by supporters mainly.

 Were not Police Officers also helping to carry them? - A.
 Well Police Officers were helping but also there were quite
 a lot of Police Officers just standing around.
                                   J. ASHTON


Were there others as well, supporters who were not engaged
in carrying out people, injured or dead people? - A. There
were but the impression you had was a lot of supporters had
got involved inceiWier carrying out people or trying to
resuscitate people.  It was very impressive how many supporters
were actually involved.
Did you   see any ambulances when you were down there in the
yard? -   A. Well at this stage I was aware of one ambulance
outside   the gate and I was also aware that people were being
carried   out of the gate into the lane at the back.

Can you tell us what time this was? - A. Well it must have
been about 3.30.
Did you not see a succession of ambulances at that time on
Leppings Lane at the back? - A. No. A succession of
ambulances did not materialise until it must have been
about a quarter-to-4.
 What did you yourself actually do? - A. Well having seen the
 situation I went back up and brought my two sons downstairs
 and put them in a safe place. That was the first thing I
 did. I then initially attended two people who were lying
 on the floor. I ascertained that one of them was not
 seriously injured and one of them was dead. Then I realised
 that because there was nobody in control of the situation
 there was no order to what was happening and the ambulance
 that was outside some of the Police were about to put people
 in it who were not actually critically ill/ so at that point
 I realised that what was needed was somebody to take an
 overview of the extent of the injuries and to actually speci y
 who should be taken away to the hospital as quickly as possible
 because there was no medical presence, there was no equipment.
 There was ndthipg one could do on the ground. People were
 doing the best they could just with normal resuscitation
 attempts but that was the limit of what one could do and
  there were a lot of people doing that, so the important
  thing was to make sure that the critically ill people went
  in a priority order to the hospital casualty department.

. Weren't the ambulance people doing this themselves? - A. Not
  really. I mean they did not seem to have very much in the
  way of equipment. There was just the one ambulance there
  at first as I say and then later on there were m o r e ambulances
  came and the emergency response improved very much towards
  I suppose 4 o'clock.
. When I asked that question, Dr. Ashton, I was asking about
  really whether the Ambulance people were themselves classifying
  people into priorities? - A. No, they weren't. I actually
  was instructing them who to take first and second. I actually
  categorised people into ones who could wait and ones who
  needed to go and the Ambulance people responded to me.

                                     3. ASHTON


Q. Various people you have told us in the yard there were
   making attempts to revive people who had been brought out
   from the terrace? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q.   These included what, Policemen? -A. Yes.

Q.   Ambulancemen? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you see any Firemen? - A. Not until later. When the
     Firemen arrived they seemed to have a much better idÂ©a about
     resuscitation than the Police did and they seemed to have
     much more equipment.

Q. They had oxygen, did they not? - A. Yes, they had proper
   resuscitation equipment.

Q. The Ambulancemen had equipment as well, did they not? - A.
   They did not seem to have very much though.

Q. Well what would you expect them to have? - A. There was no,
   I don't recall them bringing any oxygen cylinders out from
   the ambulances, for instance. There was no equipment either
   in the Lane or the terrace area to my recollection uatil
   the Fire Service arrived and an anaesthetist and I presume
   a crash team from the hospital turned up some time after 4.

Q. You see the Fire Service arrived I think it was 22-minutes-
   past-3 at that end of the ground which in fact seems to be
   before the period you are talking about? - A. I don't recall
   seeing the Fire Service there at that time at all.

Q. You say there was a lack of equipment. Can you just he^P
   us please by telling us what you would have thought ought
   to have been available at this Football Ground? - A. Well
   I think if you go back to a bit earlier, it would have been
   helpful if there had been proper stretchers. Apparently
   from what one could see there were only a very small number
   of stretchers available to take casualties off the pitch
   and the Liverpool supporters started to tear down the
   hoarding boards to use as an impromptu stretcher. So that
   is the first thing.
           The second thing is that in this kind of situation
     then there is a need to have tubes for intubation to ensure
     there is an airway and it is important to have oxygen
     available.
 O. Do you mean something like a Brooks airway or something
    more sophisticated than that? - A. Well even Brooks airways
    would be helpful in this kind of circumstance.

 Q. Because we heard this morning, you see, that intubation
    tubes are things which require quite a degree of skill
    to work? - A. I assume that the Ambulancemen are taught
    intubation.
                        115

                                       J. ASHTON


Q. Well we may hear differently. What else would you think
   should have been available? - A. Well oxygen and drip lines
   and salines.

Q. Drip lines and salines? - A. Yes.

Q. At the ground? - A. Well I think from my understanding of
   continental Clubs that the big continental Clubs have a fully
   equipped first aid post and casualty post at the grounds in
   Spain.

         Could I just add: it seems to me if there are 50,000
   people in one place that is like a small town and the normal
   kind of medical facilities should be there for a small town.
   I don't mean that in an extreme sense but there is likely
   to be events happening to people when you have got 50,000
   people in one place for several hours, the same things will
   happen. You would expect that some people will have a
   coronary; some people will have other things happening in
   the normal course of events, so there should be some kind
   of first aid post available anyway.

Q. There were first aid facilities on the ground of course at
   the far end of the ground. What perhaps we might like to
   know is what you think ought to have been there which
   would have been of some use out in the yard there where
   you were in fact having to deal with the people who were
   brought off the terrace. Do you see? - A. Yes.

Q. In that sort of situation what would you say .... You
   have mentioned of course I think the airways, the Brooks
   airway and the oxygen. Do you subscribe to the view, for
   example, that an Ambu-bag, a bag and mask would have been
   helpful? - A. I think it would have been helpful.  It is
   difficult to predict. You have very seriously injured people
   with crush injuries and suffocation.  It is very difficult
   to predict what possibilities there might have been to save
   lives if there had been equipment there, but the fact was
   there was virtually none available at all and it was impossible
   for people to do more than the bare minimum.

Q. Well there was the equipment that was carried on the Fire
   Engines and on the ambulances? - A. Yes. Well it was not
   in evidence. Where I was behind Leppings Lane it was not
   in evidence until later on.

Q, Well now do you think looking back on it and seeing what
   was there, that if equipment of this nature had been
   available it would have made any practical difference to
   the number of people who survived? â A. I think it is a
   very difficult question because of the nature of the
   injuries.  It seems to me that a lot of people were actually
   dead when they were brought out from the ground so we are
   really in the realms of speculation. What I would say is
i  if there had been equipment there then at least the various
/   '
                                116

                                             J. ASHTON


          medical and nursing people who were there and who became
          involved, many of whom have contacted me, could at least
          have had a go at .trying to do something with the equipment.

        Q. Well we have heard today that those people who were not
           breathing had something like four minutes before they weÂ»e
           going to be in serious trouble if not dead? - A. That is
           correct.
        Q. So that means whoever is there has got to act very swiftly
           and also has got to happen upon a person who is capable of
           being saved? - A. Which in my opinion shows thas need to
           have a properly organised emergency response at grounds for
           big events.

        Q. Do you think it would have made any difference if the
           request formedical staff, that is to say doctors, had been
           made any earlier. You put it I think at 2Q-past-3> didn't
           you, or thereabouts? - A. Well it seemed to me that given
           the fact that it was obvious that people were seriously
           injured some time before 20-past-3, it would have been a
           very sensible thing to have made an appeal earlier. It
           is the realms of speculation about what the intervention
           would have done, but I think the intervention should have
           been possible. There were clearly a lot of doctors and
           nursing and other paramedical staff at the^aatch.

        Q. I think you stayed in the concourse there by where the
           ambulances came along for some considerable time, didn t
           you? - A. What I did was to work myself around the casualties
           assessing them and participating in despatching and telling
           the Ambulance people and the Police who should go next
           until all the serious casualties had been despatched to
           hospital and then we were left with more minor injuries
           and people who were dead. That was by about 20-past, 25-past-4

        Q. Then I think you went over to the gymnasium, did you? - A.
           Well I gathered by this time that the people were being
           taken somewhere else as well because I had no way of knowing
           that, so I found my way to the gym. It was difficult.    I
           asked a number of Policemen and they did not know where it
           was and eventually I got myself round to the gym. and went
           in there and it was clear it was too late to be of any use
           because people were either dead or the gym. was cleared.




                                 /Q.   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you

                               117

                                                      J. ASHTON


     Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Can you just help me. The people
          you say you were helping to dispatch, there were those who
          were dead and there those with very minor injuries who you did
          not dispatch.   The ones you helped to dispatch, what sort of
          injuries did they have which you thought they were going to be
          able to be helped with at hospital? - A. There were things
          like clearly crush injuries to the chest.   They looked as
          though they had fractured ribs or they might have had a
          punctured lung.

     Q. But they were still breathing all right? - A. They were
        breathing, but they were obviously seriously ill. They
        obviously needed medical attention as soon as possible.    They
        needed to be got off to where that was available.

     Q. Was that the principal form of injury of the casualties you
        dispatched? - A. Quite a lot of chest injuries and some
        abdominal rigidity which might have indicated they might have
        ruptured intestines and that kind of thing.

     Q.         MR. PHILLIPS:   Did you find any deficiency in supply of
          ambulances to take these people away? - A. When I went down
          into that area at the back at half-past-3 there Â»as one
          ambulance there, a second one came shortly after, but they did
          not come in a constant stream into the area there until I
          would put it at about quarter-to-4.    I understand there is
          some dispute about this, but I am telling you that the
          ambulances were not there in Leppings Lane itself where they
          could be utilised until that time.   I don't know where they
          were.   They must have been stuck on the way or something, or
          in traffic.

     Q. You found when you got to the gymnasium that things had been
        pretty well cleared up by then? - A. Yes, they had.

     Q. And I think it was not long after that you left with your
        family? - A. Well, before that I went back to the Leppings
        Lane end to just finally check what was going on there.   I was
        asked to certify the dead by one of the Officers. So I began
        to certify the dead at that end.  There was a general
        practitioner who had been involved there as well was also
        involved certifying the dead.  The two of us carried out that
        task.  That was from about 25-past-4 for about 5 or 10
        minutes.  Then I thought presumably somebody will have a
        medical debriefing.  Presumably the people who were involved
        in this would all be gathered together and there would be some
        kind of debriefing.  So I went back to the gymnasium to seek
        that out. This time when I got to the gym I found it very
        difficult to gain entry.  The Police were excluding everybody,
        and the emergency people inside the gym had been told to go
        out, the people who had been helping, and the only people who
        were allowed to be in the gym were the Police. Somebody
        senior in authority of the Police had got all the Police to
        one end of the gym and was giving them some kind of
        debriefing, but not the medical people as far as I could see.
        I could see I was not wanted so I left.

          Then on my way back to Leppings Lane for the final time I
     met a Constable who was totally broken down and weeping and in
     tears.  I comforted him, and he said, "They are going to blame
     us now.  They will blame the Police.  They will say it was our
     fault, but it was the senior Officers' fault because they
     didn't take control and didn't organise things, and when they
     came they just got in the wayâ . That is what he said.

Q.   He said that to you? - A. Yes.

Q.   In your statement, Dr. Ashton, you say towards the very end
     something about this:

          "On Saturday I believe this belief about football
          supporters contributed to the apparently slow initial
          response by the Police to what was happening.   It seemed
          that they mistook the tragedy for crowd trouble".

     What was it that you saw that made you form that conclusion? -
     A.There are many things that happened  that day, but the one
     image that sticks in my mind is the image of that very large
     line of Policemen across the centre of the pitch at the time
     when they should have been helping people to get out of the
     ground.

Q. To get out of the ground? - A. To get out of the terrace. The
   assumption was that they needed to keep the supporters from
   going down to the other end.

Q. Could you see what was going on at the front of the pens, what
   other Police Officers were doing at that time? - A. I
   understand from reports I have read that the Police were
   involved in helping people, but I also understand and I have
   had a large number of eye witness accounts sent to me from
   people who were abused or pushed back into the terrace.  I
   have one person I have the account which I have submitted of
   somebody who had actually managed to get out and then was made
   to go back in again.

Q. So it is on the basis of that you are saying the Police
   mistook it for crowd trouble? - A. That is my impression.

Q. Yes.    Thank you very much.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. KALLIPETIS:

Q. Dr. Ashton, you are a lecturer?    Is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you also have a practice? - A. I am a public health
   consultant with Mersey Regional Health Authority and a
   lecturer at Liverpool University.

Q. That is not quite an answer to the question.  Do you also have
   a practice? - A. I no longer practice clinical medicine as
   such.  I am a community physician involved in public health.

         A. You may, yes.     I was a general practitioner until 1976.

    Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    From? - A. From 1974 to 1976.           I
         was a junior hospital doctor between 1970 and 1974.

    Q.          MR. KALLIPETIS:     So two years in general practice? - A.
         yes.

    Q. And then you went into - I don't mean it unkindly - the
       academic side? - A. It is not, actually.  It is quite a
       practical side.  I am involved in public health in preventive
       medicine, which incorporates a wide range of activities,
       including an interest in things like crowd safety and
       environmental protection and so on. So this area has some
       professional interest to me as well.

    Q. You told us what happened when you arrived at the ground and
       when you went through the turnstiles.  When you were about to
       go up the staircase that you have indicated to take your seat
       you told Us about this man who came out from the tunnel area
       saying, "There are kids dying in thereâ . My Lord asked you
       whether you took that seriously, and you said you did. - A.
       Yes, he was very distressed.

    Q. Did you mean what you said to my Lord that you did take that
       seriously? - A. Yes, I did.

    Q. You then told my Lord you said to the Policeman, "I think you
       should go and do something or find out about itâ . Is that
       right? - A. I said something like, "Don't you think you had
       better look into it?â , because he didn't respond at all. He
       just carried on inspecting the tickets.

    Q. What did he reply to you? - A. I don't think he replied.          I
       don't remember him replying.

    Q. You as a community physician with a great interest in
       community medicine and as a doctor, did you think you might
       go there and find out if people really were dying? - A. At
       that point my concern was to find out where my two sons were
       and my nephew.

    Q. The answer to my question is you did consider it or you did
       not consider it? - A. At that point I felt the balance of my
       priorities was to go and look and see where my two sons were.

    Q. Is the answer that you did think about it but you thought it
       was more important to go and find out where you sons were? -
       A. That is correct.

    Q. So you did think about going in there? - A. As you can see I
       didnât hold back later on in the afternoon.  I became
       involved.  It was throughout the afternoon I had this balance
       to strike between looking after my own children and becoming
       involved in the emergency situation, and it was very difficult
       because it was difficult to know what was happening.

                                                     J. ASHTON


      Q. These are the same children you let go into the turnstiles
         having described the crush situation which you preferred not
         to get into? Is that right? - A. That is correct, but they
         are not full grown yet, and one of my sonâs friends was one of
         those who was killed in the disaster.

      Q. When you got up to the stand, Dr. Ashton, had play started? -
         A. Presumably play had started and stopped, because there was
         no play going on when I got up there.

      Q. Were the players still on the pitch? - A. No.

      Q. They were not? - A. No.

      Q. You are certain about that? - A. I canât be certain because
         there were a lot of people on the pitch. There may have been
         players but I didnât see them.  I think they had left.

      Q. Again you told us you could see people on the pitch, some of
         whom were clearly seriously injured, and I think you said some
         of them were dead? - A. By about quarter-past I found myself
         saying to the person standing next to me, "There are two
         people dead there. There are three, four, five dead thereââ,
         because you could see from where I was, because it was very
         close to the front of the stand, not very far from the
         goalmouth from the vantage point down, people who were lying.
         They looked completely still and they looked as though they
         were dead. People had been trying to resuscitate them and
         leaving them. People at first were incredulous that this was
         what the situation was, but that was my impression.

      Q. Were they being administered to by St. Johnâs Ambulancemen or
         ambulancemen or Policemen or fans? - A. You have a much better
         assessment of that from the film, but....

      Q. I am interested in what you saw, Dr. Ashton, you understand? -
         A. The impression I had was there were not very many St.
         Johnâs Ambulancemen there on the pitch and a lot of the
         attention was being given by supporters.

      Q. Yes, supporters whom you had no reason to believe were
         medically qualified? - A. That is correct.

      Q. Again as a doctor with the concerns that you have, did you
         think it might be a good idea if you went down to offer your
         help? - A. There was no way out forwards.

      Q. I am sorry, I donât understand that. - A. I was in the stand.
         It was impossible to get forward on to the pitch.

      Q. The question was did you think it would be a good idea if you
         went down to offer your help? - A. Yes, I was considering it,
         and as soon as they Tannoyed for medical assistance I went and
         offered my help.

      Q. They Tannoyed for assistance just before 3.30. - A. I would
         place it a t ....

         Q. I think we can prove that, Dr. Ashton, just before 3.30. - A.
            Yes, I accept that.

         Q. So you waited for the Tannoy announcement before you went
            downstairs? - A. Yes. You assume that at large events people
            have got things under control and that there are emergency
            services and there is an emergency plan.

         Q.   Forgive me, Dr. Ashton, but you are telling us they were not
              there from your view in the stand. Is not that right? - A.
              Yes.

         Q. That assumption would not assist. So you waited for the
            Tannoy announcement before you went down? - A. Yes.

         Q.   So you arrive down in the yard some time about 3.30? - A. If
              the Tannoy was 3.30 then it must have been a little after
              that.

         Q.   I think it was just before 3.30. - A. OK.

         Q.   You would accept I am sure that your area of vision is limited
              to what is immediately in your vicinity at any one time? - A.
              At the game?

         Q. Downstairs in the yard. - A. Yes, the part for which I can
            speak is the area behind Leppings Lane stand and in Leppings
            Lane itself.

         Q. Your impression, and I am not in any way suggesting you are
            anything other than an honest witnesses, please understand
            that, but your impression is there was only one ambulance and
            no equipment, and I am not going to recite all of your
            evidence, but that is your impression that you have of this
            day? - A. Behind Leppings Lane end, yes.

         Q. By 3.30 at least four ambulances had already attended at the
            back of Leppings Lane. Does that surprise you? - A. Well, if
            they had been they had been and gone.

         Q. You don't seem to have catered for that possibility. One of
            them had been and gone and three were in position before 3.30.
            - A. Yes.

         Q. We can see that also on the video. - A. OK.  I accept that,
            but the ambulances did not arrived in the kind of numbers
            that were needed until later than that, when they started to
            come in a steady stream.

         Q. Dr. Ashton, you as an experienced community physician will
            understand that one does not have hundreds of ambulances
            sitting around doing nothing? - A. I think this does raise
            questions about how many ambulances are available.

         Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   How many do you suggest there
              ought to be available before a football match? - A. To be

                                                  J. ASHTON


     present at a match?

Q. Yes. - A. My experience is limited on these matters.

Q. I am asking for your professional view? - A. I think what is
   needed is that there needs to be studies of events. There is
   literature on events which I am not....

Q. Are you not going to be able to help me? - A. No, probably
   not.

Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS.-  How many ambulances do you think
     should have come to that event once it was realised the size
     of the disaster? - A. I would say there was something like
     40 seriously hurt people at the back of Leppings Lane. So
     it is the number of ambulances that were needed to take
     those people to hospital.

Q. Your   assessment is remarkably accurate, Dr. Ashton, because in
   fact   from the SYMAS records about 40 patients were conveyed
   from   the Leppings Lane end via ambulance to hospital. - A.
   That   is right, because I was involved in dispatching theÂ®.

Q. Well, are you saying all 40 you sorted? - A. I think what you
   are telling me is there were a number who were sent off before
   I became involved, and I accept that, but....

Q. Would you also accept that before you arrived on the seen
   those ambulance Officers had the training and intelligence and
   the presence of mind to remove patients who were clearly not
   seriously injured from the ambulances who had entered of
   their own accord, and put in patients who were seriously
   injured and needing to be taken to hospital immediately? -
   A. I am telling you what I found when I went down was that
   the Police were taking people to the ambulances not in order
   of priority of the severity of them.

Q. That may well   be so. My concern is for the ambulance people
   whom you have   described as unable to sort the serious
   casualty from   the less serious casualty. - A. I think you are
   trying to put   words in my mouth, actually.

Q. I have no wish to do that.  If I have got the wrong impression
   I shall be happy to be corrected. - A. I donât know whether
   they were able or unable, but what I know was that it was not
   happening when I went down there, and I began to do the
   sorting and to tell the ambulance people which ones to take,
   and they were very happy to go along with that.




                            /Q. Dr. Ashton, if we are at
                                         J. ASHTON

Dr. Ashton, if we are at cross-purposes, then we can cut
this short. Are you talking about the conveying of
casualties to the ambulances by the police or are you
t alking about the conveying of casualties by the ambulances
to the hospital?    A. You've thrown me now.

I am sorry to have done that. Are you talking about the
conveying of casualties by the police to the ambulances
when you said that there was no sorting of that priority,
or are you talking about the conveying of casualties by
ambulance to hospital when you say there was no sorting
of priorities?    A. What was happening was that the people
were being taken from the yard out by the wall in the lane
and they were being leaned against the wall or laid out
by the wall in the lane, in a long line, and the police
were taking people from one end of the line as the
ambulances came, to put into the ambulances, and the
ambulancemen were going along with loading them up in
that way; and what I said was "This isn't the right way
to do it. We need to actually decide who is the priority,
and in fact there are two people down that end who need
to go next, not these people here". That was the kind of
thing that I did.

Dr. Ashton, you will forgive me if I suggest that while
that might have been happening on occasions, it certainly
was not the pattern of the ambulance people that afternoon
and they were sorting casualties as indeed they are trained
to do?    A. Well, there are other medical witnesses who
you could call who would substantiate what I have just said.

And equally I could call every ambulance officeÂ®: who
attended if I thought it necessary. But will you perhaps
accept the statistic that of the 40 people who were
conveyed from Leppings Lane to hospital, only one was
found dead on arrival?    A. I think that that is a
vindication of the triage approach that was adopted.

So you say, Dr. Ashton, but you say by you, I say by the
ambulance --    A. Well, you know, I think it's not
helpful to try and apportion it in that way.   I think
that everybody was doing their best.

Precisely so.   A. But there was nobody in overall charge,
which is my point.

You say that the ambulances had no equipment.  Did you
inspect any of the ambulances?   A. There was no equipment
brought from the ambulances into the area outside the
ambulances. Most of the people were actually outside in
the lane and in the yard, so the equipment was needed
outside.

Did you not see ambulancemen with portable resuscitators
and bags and masks?   A. Not until later.

I suggest that you are wrong about that, and if necessary
you can look at a video and be corrected about it and see
them on the video actually using them at the back of Leppings
                                          J. ASHTON

Lane.    A.   Can you tell me how many?

As many as had arrived, Dr. Ashton. Each ambulanceman
carries with him his portable treatment bag, including
a portable resuscitator? A. And my point was that
between half-past-3 and about quarter-to-4 there were
only three ambulances during that time and it was after
quarter-to-4 that they began to come in a steady stream.

Dr. Ashton, I am not going to bandy words with you because
the evidence that we have heard comes from reliable
sources. Dr. Ashton, will you also accept that the
equipment on an ambulance is necessary to stay on the
ambulance to treat a patient while he is being conveyed
to hospital?   A. Well, yes, but sometimes it needs to
be used off the ambulance as well.

Of course, but the primary purpose of an ambulance is to
convey a patient as quickly as possible to hospital, is
it not?   A. It is the main purpose most of the time, but -

That is sufficient, thank you very much indeed. Were you
wearing a brown suit or brown jacket on that day? A. No.

Or a light coloured jacket?    A.   No.

You talk about the intubation treatment.  Have you ever
intubated a patient?   A. Yes, but hot for some time.

Would you risk doing one on that occasion?     A. In that
situation, I would, yes.

It is a matter of last resort, is it not?     A. Intubation?

Yes.    A. Are you talking about tracheostomy perhaps?

Well, you tell me what you are talking about.   A. I'm
talking about putting a tube to establish an airway.
I'm not talking about making a hole in somebody's neck
to establish --

That is a tracheostomy?     A. That is a tracheostomy.

But intubating a patient in the manner you have described
is more than merely putting an airway in the mouth, is
it not? It is putting a tube down the throat which then
inflates the trachea - is that not right?   A. To
inflate the lungs.

Are you familiar with that?   A. Yes, it is something that
all doctors learn as part of their training.

And you assume that ambulancemen are taught that?     A. I
assume so.

But you do not know, Dr. Ashton?    A. I don't know. I think
theise are some very interesting and important questions
about the training of ambulancemen and police that come
out of this.
                          125

                                               J. ASHTON

Q.   My Lord asked you what equipment you would have liked to
     have seen outside the ground to assist those patients who
     had been carried out. You described them as suffering
     from conditions of fractured ribs, possibly a punctured
     lung and some of them with abdominal rigidity, implying
     perhaps some form of internal organ having been ruptured
     or disturbed. What equipment would assist any one of
     those categories of patient?   A. Well, if somebody has
     got embarrassment of their breathing because their lung
     is penetrated, then it would be helpful to have an oxygen
     supply.  If somebody has had a ruptured internal organ,
     they are likely to be bleeding internally ami it would be
     helpful to have a drip and to be able to establish some
     kind of fluid replacement.

Q.   Anything else?   A. Those are the two main things that
     I would pick on straight away. Pain relief is obviously
     important. There was no pain relief available as far as
     I was aware.

Q.   Of course, Dr. Ashton, you do not know, but in fact each
      ambulance carries Antoxane which is for pain relief, is
      it not?   A. Well, you are telling me that.

Q.   Yes.   A. It was just not in evidence.

Q.   Dr. Ashton, you were reporting in the press making various
      claims. Have you seen those reports of yourself? A. I have
      seen some reports. Which did you have in mind?

Q.   The Independent and the Times and the Sheffield Star?
     A. I haven't seen the Sheffield Star.

Q.   They have quoted   speech from you, putting it into
     quotations as if   it were direct speech from you. Have
     you seen that?     A. I probably have. Would you like to
     tell me which it   is?

Q.   Did you accept, when you read it, that what they were
     reporting was accurate?    A. I was misquoted on a number
     of occasions, so it would be helpful to me if you could
     tell me what it is that I'm supposed to have said.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      You presumably were not
     misquoted wfafen you were speaking on television? A. Yes,
     that's right.
Q.        Mr. KALLIPETIS:     You said, according to two newspaper
      reports, that at 3.30 there were no medical personnel
      apart from one or two St. John Ambulancemen, no equipment
      and only one ambulance.    First of all, did you say that?
      A. That is what my impression was at the time and that
      is what I said.
Q.    And where were you talking about, Leppings Lane?   A. I was
      very specifically talking about the area behind Leppings
      Lane.
                         126


                                                   J. ASHTON

Q.   As a matter of fact, Dr. Ashton, by 3.30 four ambulances
      had already attended behind Leppings Lane and two
      ambulance officers remained assisting the injured by
      3.30 in the area of the yard there. You are not talking
      about any other part of the ground and I will not bore
      you with thfe statistics in relation to that. Secondly,
      you are reported to have said "I had to assume control
      of the casualty situation myself and carry out a triage".
      Did you say that?    A. Yes, I said that.

Q.   As a matter of fact, ambulancemen were there at 3.13,
      15.12 and 15.20 and each of them carried out triage
      before the casualties were conveyed by them to hospital.
      Do you accept that?    A. Well, that was not what I found
      at 3.30 when I went out there.

Q.   Very well. You also are quoted as saying that a full
      casualty team with resuscitation equipment did not arrive
      from the hospital until about 4.15? A. That's correct.

Q.   Where were you talking about?    A. In the back of Leppings
      Lane. All of the comments that I made during that period
     were specifically about behind Leppings Lane, but I know
      from the submissions that I have received aiid which I have
      forwarded to the Inquiry from various other medical and
      nursing personnel that much the same situation seems to
     have applied in other places.   I have suggested that they
      be called but I don't know whether they are being called.

Q.   What evidence is called is not a matter for me, Dr. Ashton,
      and I dare say that those who are concerned with it will
     take note of your comments. You are also reported as
      saying "No oxygen, airway tubes or drips". Obviously
     you have said that, because you have said it again today?
     A. That's right.

Q. Now sometime after that you realised that your medical
   abilities could be used? - A. Yes, it was about quarter-past-3
   when we saw what was happening on the ground, people were
   being carried on stretchers, so there was one of them who
   I thought was dead because of the way he was lying on the
   stretcher. He was covered up.   I spoke to the two friends
   with me and we said I think we had better go down and try
   to help.

Q. Does it follow from that, Dr. Curpen, that you did not hear
   any request over the Tannoy for doctors? - A. It was about
   20-past-3 we went downstairs.

Q. I think you spoke to Police Officers;   told them you were
   doctors and you were in fact taken to   the gymnasium? - A.
   Yes, we asked one of the Constables.    He directed us to
   go downstairs and we met somebody who   had a radio with him,
   I think it was an Inspector, I am not   sure, but he directed
   us to the gymnasium.

Q. I think by the time you arrived there there were already
   some dead people in the gymnasium? - A. Yes, in fact I was
   the first one to go into the gymnasium. One of the doctors
   he went to see somebody who was there I think with a broken
   pelvis. He went in an ambulance to the hospital. The one
   who was with me he went to another room.  I don't know where
   he went but I went to the gymnasium and I saw there were
   two dead bodies there.

Q. Can I ask you about a couple of patients in particular who
   were not dead that you tried to assist.  I think there was
   one who had some problem with his legs? - A. That is right.

Q. You noticed that one of his legs was blue all over? - A.
   That is right.

Q. Did you immediately know what the cause of that was? - A.
   To me it looked like he had a crush injury to his leg,
   but he was in pain. He was asking me to give him something.

Q. Were you able to help him? - A. I just talked to him and
   asked him to take deep breath in and out so that he would
   forget about the pain and it helped him for a while.

Q. Given the nature of his injury what equipment would have
   helped him? - A. Well I think probably just pain killers,
   you know.

Q. I think you also helped someone who had got crush injuries
   to the chest? - A. Yes.

Q. Again were you able to do much more than reassure him? -
   A. Just reassurance and talked to him.  I told him to
   breathe in and out slightly and that is all.

     Q. What would you have wished to have at that stage? - A. Well
        he was a case where I think oxygen would have been helpful
        and you know an I.V. line and intravenous infusion might
        have been helpful there.
     Q. I think whilst you were in the gymnasium certainly Firemen
        arrived with oxygen? - A. That is right.

     Q. Can you give ussome idea how long you had been there when
        they arrived? - A. I think probably about half-3 I would say.

     Q. I think you were also in the gymnasium when a team of paraÂ­
        medics arrived from one of the Sheffield hospitals? - A.
        That is right.
     Q. Did they have the equipment that you wanted? - A. When they
        came they were fully equipped so they took over and that is
        at the time when I went to the gymnasium where all the bodies
        were there.
     Q. Can I just be clear about this. Once the paramedics had
        arrived with their equipment was there in your opinion all
        the necessary first aid equipment that you would expect?
        - A. Oh yes, they had all the facilities there.  In fact
        they started I.V. line, intravenous infusion and some
        oxygen and they   were transferred to hospital    then.

     Q. And as you have   just mentioned at that stage I thinkyou
        were asked if you would transfer your attention to those
        who appeared to be dead? - A. That is right.

     Q. And you were one of those who took part in the certification
        of those who had died? - A. Yes.

              MR. GOLDSACK:   Thank you very much.

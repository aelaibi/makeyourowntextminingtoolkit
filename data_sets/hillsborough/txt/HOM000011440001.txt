Mr Bolton


       HILLSBOROUGH AND THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS



    Mr Patten decided on the basis of the advice in your
submission of 21 August not to respond to the letters in the
Times of Saturday August 19. The Home Secretary saw your
submission over the weekend.  He commented that he was not
happy to let such accusations lie unanswered indefinitely and
that they would probably appear next in opposition speeches.
He wants to consider this further at the internal meeting on
September 7.

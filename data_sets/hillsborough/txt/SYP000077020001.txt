               I am a married man and live at the above address with my wife and 18

               year old son,



               Although I support Sheffield Wednesday Football Club I would describe

               myself as a casual supporter - I go every now and then when the

               occas ion ar ises,

                                          she was able to obtain three tickets for the F.A Cuj

               Final     between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on Saturday 15th A p r il

               1989 <150489).           We arranged_JLo give A he se c ond ticket to my son

               and the third to a friend

               On match day                went ahead      the pub the local,                     on

                                    which is about   15 minutes to the ground ^1/Snd a quarter

               m i 1e s > .            and I joined at about      1320 hrs   (1320).   On our arrival
                                                                                                PAGE     2
                                                                                                S2-128

             - at the pub I was told by the doorman,            whose a local     lad, that   it was

              packed inside.         There    is a car park to the left of the pub which had

              cars and Liverpool        supporters      in, they were chanting but generally

              good-hearted.

              I went in with                 into the lounge - it was packed with Liverpool

              sup port ers.       I got my drink with                 We went outside and joined



              We just past the time of day watching the supporters                 in the car park.

              As time went on it was N o t i c e a b l e that the Liverpool       fans were

              drinking a lot pf h e /e r and lager.

              On the car park \w>afs a dark blue Ford QH>r tina which wasn't            in the best

              of order

              The three of us went and stoody6n the pavement which is slightly below

              the level of the car park.              We stood near to the boot of this Ford

              C o r t in a .

              We noticed a white man, about 40 y r% fold, 5*9 - 5"10 t a ll, stocky

              build,      he had dark brown b r ushed      £>ack hai r collar   1ength with a

              stubble type beard.            He was      ring a light brown leather jacket and a

              pair of fawn trousers

      M       I bel ieve this man owned the car I 'veprerttioned he was selling cans of

             . beer and lager from the bonnet of JC he car

  ^ 7 ^ C*    t ransact ion whi ch a Liverpool          fan made with this man 20 cans for £16

              which the fan readily paid.

              The seller removed his jacket and put it in the car - passenger front

              side.

              I think he did this because he was busy and it was a warm day and for

              the security of the money which he was putting in the jacket pockets.

              Time was passing by - this man was doing a brisk trade.                  I saw him on
                                                                                 PAGE        3

at   least two occasions go into the pub and carry out more packs that

is slabs of cans of beer and lager.          There were John Smiths Bitter and

Hofmister    lager in these packs.

The fans by now were getting      rowdy,    singing and chanting.

The fans were also getting annoyed with the person selling them the

cans at the car,      people were trying to barter with him,           they stated

the price was too high.

He said to one fan that h e *d have to go back into the pub to get some

more beer.     This was the second occasion he went            into   the pub.

A fan came out of the Liverpool      group went up            to that car took a key

out of his pocket      inserted into the front       passenger door     lock, waggled

it about and then opened the door.          I was so near I heard

the lock click.       He opened the door bent       into      the car and removed    a

tray of John Smiths Bitter,      it was a complete            slab of 24 cans,      he

pushed the door shut and      ran back to hismates with the drink,               a loud

cheer went up around the car park.

He placed the cans on the floor,         jumad back up and went back to the

car.   He opened the door for a second time and removed the blokes

leather co a t, pushed the door shut again - people were laughing.

We then went    into the pub for another drink,            it would have been about

1410 hrs    (1410).

When we came out we noticed the bloke who had                been selling the beer-

leaning on the bonnet of      the car looking       very disappointed but he was

wearing his jacket.

This would now have been about       1420 hrs      (1420).

We then made our way to the g r o u n d .

We left a lot of fans      in the pub - it was still          packed they were

singing and drinking.       I heard abuse between themselves ~ they were

very high-spirited,      if not drunk.     There   is two levels      in the pub - I

would say there was about 70 people on the pub ground when I l e ft .                    I

       » didn't see the kid who had stolen the beer again.

         I would him as a white male,         looked about 20 years old, a small        lad

         S'6 ish tall,     stocky build,     cropped fair hair.    I can't remember what

         he was wearing or anything else arbout him.

         On my way to the ground I saj* numerous Liverpool          fans drinking outs id e

         the horse and Jockey Puiy^and on route to the ground.             There was one

         youth whose legs hadygone and two of his mates were carrying him.

         I remember a bloke      inside the              Pub drinking a

         bottle of wine.     These fans were drinking as they were walking.             I saw

         some Policemen stopping this         by taking the drink off them.

         I d i d n ’t see any Forest Fans     like the Liverpool   fans   in relation    to

         drinking although I must qualify this by stating I had been             with the

         Liverpool      fans away from the    ground.

         In my opinion the majority of the fans         1 left behind at the

         Pub wouldn't have got to the ground for 1300 hrs           (1300)   kick-off

         time.       Some of them wouldn't have been in any state to watch the

         ma t ch .

         I'm making this statement as I believe that some of the Liverpool                fans

         aren't as white as the press are showing them to be.

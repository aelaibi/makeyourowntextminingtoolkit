Final at Sheffield Wednesday's ground between
Nottingham Forest and Liverpool on Saturday,15th.
April,19«V-
     X travelled as a car passenger and from the
outskirts of the town I noticed manysupporters
on foot making their way presumably to the ground.        ji
                                                          *
       I alighted from the car,at what I believe          T
was the area of the groundallocated to the Liverpoo
supporters,at approximately 2s25pm. while the
driverwent to Io o k for a park.
     . I waited in the area for about ten minutes,
waiting for the car driver,and I noticed that a
queue had formed for what appeared to be entrance
to the turnstiles.At least one mounted policeman
and others on foot were keeping the people
queuing in line with some difficulty but not
unduly so.
       The police had erected and manned a barrier
which appeared to be for the prevention of
unauthorised entrance to the area leading to the
main stand entrances.
       Duriner "V stay at this entrance I did not
see a n y gates opened except for the ejection of
one man.
       »hile there j. was approached by two separate
 youfi men who politely enquired if I ^ad a sp^re
 ticket.
        hs the car driver did not arrive I wap allowed
 through the police barrier and made my w a y round
 to the -irectors'*ntrance at the main stand where
 the car driver was waiting.

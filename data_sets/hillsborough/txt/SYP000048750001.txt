Dear Sir,


REQUEST FOR THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION

 I refer to your letter dated 22nd January 1991, concerning your client Mr Paul
 EDWARDS, and the request for a copy of his statement.

 The policy on the release of information is as follows

 The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police invited the West Midlands Police
 back in April 1989 to undertake the investigation into the Hillsborough Disaster.
 In fulfilling this investigatory role the West Midlands Police constitutionally
 were acting as the agents of South Yorkshire Police.

 The policy on the release of information has variously been determined by Lord
 Justice Taylor, later the Director of Public Prosecutions (in conjunction with the
 Police Complaints Authority), and the Coroner.  I now have to look to South
 Yorkshire Police, as principals of the information, for the policy in responding
 to your request.

 At the present time the policy of South Yorkshire Police directed to me is not to
 release any information to any party.  This is based on legal advice that has been
 given which indicates that information should only be released on the order of a
 court which could include that of the Coroner.

 I am sorry I cannot be any more helpful at the moment and as explained at the
 present time I must decline your request.

 Yours faithfully,




 J. Mervyn JONES,
 Deputy C h ie f C o n s ta b le .

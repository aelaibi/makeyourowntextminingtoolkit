Dear Member

HILLSBOROUGH FUNDING DECISIONS - 26 NOVEMBER 1999


I would advise you that following the issue of a Press Release announcing the Authorityâ€™s
decisions today concerning Hillsborough a letter was received from Ann Adlington, the
Solicitor to HFSG pointing out that reporting restrictions were imposed at the Leeds
Crown Court on 3 September last concerning the publication of the information that there
will be an abuse of process hearing or the date of that hearing.

In the circumstances I would ask that you do not discuss the decision until you hear from
me further.

Yours sincerely




Maureen Oades
Assistant Clerk and Solicitor

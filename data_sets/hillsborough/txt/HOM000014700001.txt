           Dear Miss Ransford

           Re;          South Yorkshire Police Authority/Mr Peter Wright
^          Thank you for returning my telephone call of Friday last and for
           your willingness to clarify the Home Office position.

           As you are now aware, the Hillsborough Family Support Group are
           appalled at the SYPA decision not to accept Mr Wright's resignation
           and may wish to seek to have it corrected,

           f    o     r    ®    rouP <and as a bereaved parent), I would ask
           tor clarification and guidance on the following:

           1            ^ iat' r*9hts of appeal do we have against the SYPA
                        decision and to whom/what body should they be addressed.
           2            What powers/avenues are open for the Home Office to
                        overrule the SYPA decision.
           3            What powers exist under the Police Act,


          As explained, there is a full meeting of the Hillsborough Families
          Group on Wednesday 23 August and a prompt reply I           ’amines
          ,    . Iwould be very much appreciated. If in your reply you can
          include any indication of the Home Secretary/Home office’s position
          (where decided of course) then that would be helpful.
          Thank you in anticipation,
          Yours/Tai^hfully




          Trevor Hicks
          Chairman - Hillsborough Family Support Group

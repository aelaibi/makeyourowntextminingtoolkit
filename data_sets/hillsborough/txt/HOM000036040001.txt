 Dear Sir,

           The members of the Thome & District Chamber of Commerce are
very concerned at the cost of the Hiilsborough Disaster Enquiry, which we
understand will have to be paid fox' Out of Tocal rates and police funding.

           ¥e would have thought that this would be paid for out of
Central Government funds, especially as at this time police funds are very
much needed for more man—power.                    **

           It is also the opinion of the members that policing of Foo&ball
grounds and sports etc. should be the responsiblity of the clubs concerned
leaving the police to do the job they are employed to do.

             Will there be any change in this policy?

             Looking forward to your comments,



                               Tours faithfully,                     &

    Thank you for your letter to The Home Secretary of 5th September
    1990 about COMPLAINT RE:DPP AND HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.




    After consideration, it appears that the matters raised are the
    responsibility of the Attorney Generals Office, so I have sent
    your letter there with a request that a reply be sent to you
    direct.

Dear Minister,

The Hillsborough Disaster.

     You are possibly aware that the DPP has said that
there is insufficient evidence to take out any prosecutions
against policemen, as a result of the Hillsborough disaster,
and the Taylor Report.

     Although I profoundly disagree with this conclusion,as
do the representatives of the many families and relatives
of the 95 dead in Liverpool, I can understand that there can
be differences of opinion about this.

     I cannot understand,however, just how many times the
DPP takes decisions of this nature, when the evidence is
perfectly obvious for anybody to see.

     There are cases when internal courts of the police, not
open to the public, act upon the evidence themselves, and
policemen are sacked.

     I think it is time that some enquiry into the working of
the DPP should be engaged in, as feelings are beginning to run
quite deeply,when the general public get no explanations of how
the DPP formulates its conclusions.

     I would welcome your comments.


                                          Yours sincerely

 Martin Flannery Esq MP
 House of Commons
 London SW1A OAA                                                     November 1990




 Your letter of 5 September to the Home Secretary has been passed
 to me for reply about the decision taken by the Director of
 Public Prosecutions not to institute criminal proceedings against
 any person arising out of the Hillsborough disaster.                        This is
 because I have ministerial responsibility for the DPP and the
 Crown Prosecution Service, my function in regard to the Director,
 who     holds     an    independent      statutory     office,   being     that      of
 superintendence.            I am sorry that there has been a delay.


 The decision taken by the Director followed a careful analysis
 of all the evidence assembled by the West Midlands police in what
 was      by     any    standards     a    thorough     and   detailed     criminal
 investigation.          That investigation had the benefit of the equally
 thorough report submitted to the Home Secretary by Lord Justice
 Taylor following his public inquiry.                 The inquiry had identified
 many factors leading to the disaster, ranging from the purely
 historical        (e.g.     the    layout   of   the    stadium),    through        the
 assessment            and   supervision     of   safety      requirements,           to
 shortcomings in the policing arrangements on the day.


 In relation to the Hillsborough decision you fairly state that
 you can understand that there can be differences of opinion about
 that.         There is pending in the Divisional Court an application
 for judicial review of that decision - I understand that it will
 be heard on 12th November - and you will therefore understand why
 it would not be proper for me                 to comment on the Director's
 approach here.
But you went          on to refer to the              "many times        the DPP takes
decisions of this nature, when the evidence is perfectly obvious
for anybody to see", and you referred to police disciplinary
inquiries leading to disciplinary decisions.                           It is frequently
the    case    that     complaints          of   criminal       misconduct    by    police
officers cannot be substantiated, yet the inquiry may well have
revealed the commission by the officer of a disciplinary offence
- the ingredients of which are different to those of the criminal
offence alleged - and disciplinary action may properly follow.
This    is    what     you   have      in    mind.        Similarly,     there      may   be
circumstances where            the evidence discloses               a minor        criminal
offence by a police officer and there is a considered decision
by the CPS that the public interest would be adequately served
by disciplinary as opposed to criminal proceedings.


I am always ready to examine and discuss specific cases which
colleagues raise with me, and of course will certainly do so if
you care to raise a particular matter.                     I cannot, however, accept
at     all    the    general        criticism       you   make    of    the   Director's
decisions.          On the contrary, I have full confidence in the care,
judgement and experience that he brings to the difficult matters
that continually confront him.


You may care to glance at the fairly recent report of the House
of     Commons       Home    Affairs         Select       Committee      following        its
investigations          into    the         Crown    Prosecution        Service,      whose
professional          head     is     of     course       the    Director     of     Public
Prosecutions.

Dear Peter,

The Hillsborough Inquest Verdict.

     Thank you for your letter of the 8th July 1991 regarding
the above.

      I found your last paragraph very interesting, as it is quite
clear   I believe,that there is an overlap such as you mention as
a result of the Taylor Report, and the coroner's verdict.

     I would be grateful if you would let me know what occurs when
your officials have consulted interested  parties about the issues
arising from the relationship between public enquiries and inquests,
and whether they have managed to see that solutions can be found.




                                     Yours sincerely

  Thank you for your letter of 11 April to Kenneth Baker about
  the Hillsborough inquest verdict.  I am sorry that you have
  not received an earlier reply.

  I should first explain that although the Home Secretary has a
  general responsibility for the law under which coroners work,
  he has no authority to intervene in or comment upon the way in
  which a coroner, who is an independent judicial officer,
  carries out his duties in any particular case.

  You suggest that the various verdicts available to a coroner's
  jury are not sufficient for cases such as the Hillsborough
  disaster. You seem to be implying that it should be possible
  for the coroners1 courts to have power to determine individual
  liability. However, this is not the function of the coroners'
  inquest. The law specifically states that the purpose of an
  inquest is to ascertain the identity of the deceased and how,
  when and where he came by his death. The Coroners Rules
  provide that neither the coroner nor the jury shall express
  any opinion on any other matters.  In addition, the rules
  specifically prohibit the framing of an inquest verdict in
  such a way as to appear to determine any question of criminal
  liability on the part of a named person, or civil liability.
  Any issue of civil or criminal liability is a matter for the
  civil or criminal courts and not the coroners inquest.

  One event such as the Hillsborough disaster can generate
  several different inquiries. The public inquiry, which
  reached various conclusions on the causes of the event served

Thank you for your further letter of 9 July about the
deliberations of my officials on the overlap between public
inquiries and inquests. I am sorry that you have not received
an earlier reply.

As I am sure you will appreciate, the issues involved are
rather complex and there is still a lot of work to be done
analyzing the problems and identifying possible solutions. I
do not therefore expect the work to be finished for some time
but I have noted your interest in the matter and I shall keep
you informed if there are any significant developments.

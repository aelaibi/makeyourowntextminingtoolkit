                   Mr John Cummings
               That this House condemns members of the South Yorkshire Police Federation, and
            representatives of the media, for their comments on the conduct of Liverpool fans at
            Hillsborough on Saturday ISth April in advance of the findings of the independent public
            inquiry; calls on these and others to refrain from such insensitive attempts to pre-judge the
            issue and assign blame; and further calls for silence at this sensitive time while the dead are
            still to be buned.

                      That this House strongly deplores unattributed second hand reports allegedly made by
                   senior South Yorkshire police officers from behind the cloak of anonymity, which attempt
                   to smear supporters of Liverpool Football Club present at the semi-cup final at
                   Hillsborough on Saturday 15th April; believes such collective libel to be deeply offensive,
                   and profoundly insensitive at a time of mourning and grief; calls on the media and
                   honourable Members to desist from making unsubstantiated, damaging and mendacious
                   remarks; and demands that South Yorkshire Police Force makes an unqualified apology for
                   allowing such provocative statements to be made by serving officers after the institution of
                   a judicial inquiry.

Police.

            A joint report of the Clerk and Financial Officer and the Chief C o n s ta bl e
            was submitted on the increased rate of uniform allowance payable
            co ns eq uen t upon a det erm in at ion of the Police Negotiating Board, the last

            The Clerk and Financial Offic er circulated an additional Report to each
            M e m be r present contai ni ng fuller details on the matter.

            RESOLVED - That the annual rate of uniform a l l o wa nc e payable under Police
            Regulations be increased with effect from 1st April 1989 from 1216 to 1231

9.          UNLEADED FUEL
            In accordance wi th M i n u t e 8 of 15th September 1989, a joint report of the
            Chief Co nst ab le and the Clerk and Financial O f f ic er was submitted setting
            out the detailed information requested by the C o m m i tte e as to the costings
            and e ngineering work which would be involved in c hanging t he existing
            Police Vehicle F leet over to using unleaded petrol e x cl usi ve ly at the
            present time.
            Of the authorised Fleet E s t a bl ish me nt of 544 units, 135 would require to
            be individually and c o m p r e h e n s i v e l y re -e ngineered at a cost ranging from
            130 0 to 1 1 , 0 0 0 per unit. These vehicles formed largely the older part of
            the Fleet and, together with t he cost of adapting the Force's fu elling
            centres, would cost in the region of 154,000 to convert. Ad di ti onally, it
            had to be borne in mind that the present taxation s u bs idy of lOp per
            gallon at retail pumps was not f u ll y reflected in trade prices, and th at a
            likely fuel co nsumption deteriora ti on of between 1 and 2 miles per gallon
            resulted fro m t he use of unleaded petrol.
            RESOLVED - That, in view of the detailed information now submitted, the
            Co mmi tt ee approve the poli cy of the continued a cquisition of s uitably
            engineered vehicles (including those equipped with catalytic converters
            wh er e appropriate) through the normal vehicle r epl ac e m e n t programme,
            leading to the introduction of u nleaded fuel to the South Yorkshire Police
            Vehicle F l e e t at some point during the 1990/91 financial year.

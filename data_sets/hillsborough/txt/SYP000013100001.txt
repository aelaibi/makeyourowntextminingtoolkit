THE TRUTH REGARDING LIVERPOOL FANS                                          ,

I went to Hillsborough by Amberline coaches, I think that there where
approximately 50 coaches going and that we were on the 1st coach, which
left at 10.30am.   Before,we left at 10.20am. Liverpool police boarded our
coach and told us that if (anyone had any alcohol we were to get rid of it
as they were going to search the coach, they said that if they found any
alcohol they would arrest the driver.      Before the police left we all
shared a joke with them, and they wished us the best of luck.


As we travelled the driver told us that the police had pre-determined the
route and that all coaches would travel in convoy.        As I've already
mentioned I was on the first Amberline coach to arrive in Sheffield so
how did the fans find the time to consume all the beer that the Yorkshire
police claimed they had drunk.    We arrived at the coach parks at 1.15pm.
from here it took us 20-25 minutes to go to the club with which we were
familiar.


At 2.30pm. we left the club and headed for the ground, as we walked we
started talking to a couple of Forrest fans.


2.45pm. As we walked down the Leppings Lane End the police where arm to
arm all the way.     These police could have been used to control the fans
leading up to the turnstiles.


2.52pm. Noticed seme familiar Liverpool mounted police who where incharge
of two turnstiles to the right of the Leppings Lane, this queue was very
orderly,    even though there was two queues about 16 deep with fans.
Within approximately 3 minutes of joining the queue we where inside the
ground.     Once inside the ground we went to the toilets where we saw only
 2 youths who looked 1the worse for drink1.


Reflecting on the events outside the ground prior to the kick-off, I did
witness to the left of me a policeman throw a punch at a fan, I don't
 know what for but the' fans were really crushed in this area.          The area
being the gate in question.
THE TRUTH REGARDING LIVERPOOL FANS PONT. ■■

                                                      ■
On leaving the toilets to take our place in the ground I saw no police
around the con jested areas.          Last year I was behind the goal, where it
was bad, on reflection the          same type of disaster could of occurred last
year.        Knowing how crowded that area got last year, we decided to go to
the right of centre this time, looking down the pitch.


After only a few minutes of play it was clear that something was wrong
behind the goal, yet there was no police there.


At first the police tried to push the fans back into the ground as they
tried to climb out.         It was only when larger numbers started to get over
did they realised what has happened, but surely being at the front they
would have had the best view point?


I was        in the ground till       4.15pm. as we were asked to stay by the
Liverpool Manager and co-operate with all officials.


Apart from one incident where a Liverpool fan ran the length of the pitch
in reaction to the Forrest fans taunts.           The police then formed a human
chain,       the width,   of the    pitch as they believed that there would be
trouble.        As soon as the Forrest fans realised what was happening the
taunting stopped, yet the police held their chain for ages, when their
time would have been put to better use giving first aid to the injured,
which is incidentally part of their training.


Fire engines and crew where outside the ground and all the fans thanked
them for all that they had done to help the injured.


After waiting -35 minutes to use a public phajne, we had to go back to the
coaches which were parked at the back of the Bass brewery.               When we
reached the car park I asked one of the police inspectors if I could use
one     of   the phone    lines    in the   headquarters which they had set up
especially for the match.          The inspector told me that there was no phones
inside, which I consider to be highly unlikely.           I saw approximately 30
police officers sitting around on chairs in the police headquarters.            I
can guarantee that I was not the only person to see this, hundreds must
have.    Why were they not helping the injured?

Dear Mr Mackrellf

I wish to apply for press accreditation on behalf of our football correspondent
Mr             for Saturday week's FA Cup final between Liverpool and
Nott'm Forest.

As we are a Sunday newspaper with very strict dealines 1 would be grateful
if you could accomodate         in the press box. I have applied to
you in writing but apparently the mail between Ireland and Britain
is as bad as it has always been despite what our Minister claims!

Many thanks for your help and if you have any queries I would be grateful
if you could contact me as soon as possible.
Best wishes and regards,

                    I am writing with regard to press facilities at the F.A. Cup sem-final on
               April 15th.
                    We have been approached by three newspapers for the use of our telephones
               situated in the press box, and it would be appreciated if tickets could be
               allocated to these papers as near as possible to the phone connection points,
               as follows: Wolverhamntnn Exnress & Star(l       connecting at seat Blj;
               Derby Evening Telegraph |                           connecting at seat C6); Sunday Telegraph <!
               connecting at seat A1;.                                                                    ^
                     For our own use, we are retaining        connecting at seat &2. We would
               be pleased to receive four press passes, one for A2 and the other 3 anywhere
               else in reasonable proximity to the aisle so that written copy can be passed
               to the reporter occupying A2.
                     The Press Association and Exchange Telegraph will be/sending their own
               reporters, using their own phones on B2 and B3.


                                                                             Yours sincerely,

                                            Dear Graham,

                         I am writing to apply for press accred­
itation at the FA Cup semi-final. We require TWO adjacent press-
box tickets for commentator

                         Radio Trent - the Nottingham station -
are using the IBA Broadcast Point, but two seats either side
of them would be fine. If you can possibly let me know the seat
numbers as soon as possible, British Telecom require them for
line installation.

                         Glen Kirton at the Football Association
has given us clearance to instal an interview point in a suitable
place in the dressing-room. If you are agreeable, the laundry room
next to the visitors' dressing-room would be ideal for us. We
were able to operate from there last year without getting in
anybody's way.

                         Don't hesitate to contact us if we can
help in any way. Sorry I won't be there - it's Villa Park for
me this time.

                                                                      Yours sincerely,

            Dear


            Further to our recent telejpfcone conversations and the 'saga of the
            missing press tickets’, the Post Office appear to have let us down
            this time as the passes for the Forest v Liverpool PA Cup semi-final
            still haven’t arrived.


            Just in case they still don't turn up by first post tomorrow (Saturday)
            morning, I would be grateful if you could FAX us some kind of letter
            of authorisation to at least get our two reporters into the ground,


            I assume they have been allocated seats and perhaps you could also
            let us know the numbers etc.


            Our two reporters are _________________            who is in fact the group sports
            editor of the Evening Posti and


            I realise how busy you must be this week and I apologise for the
            confusion over the initial ordering of tickets.


           Our FAX number for your letter of authorisation is 0602 484116.


           Thanking you in anticipation.

               Dear

               Further to our telephone conversation of yesterday, I would be
               grateful if you could despatch two press tickets for the FA Cup
               semi-final Liverpool v Forest on Saturday.


               We do, in fact, already have photographers1 passes from the FA and
               the other tickets sent to us from Hillsborough have now been
               directed to our circulation department.


               Thanks very much for ringing us and telling us about the confusion.
               It would have been a little embarrassing this end not having our man
               reporting the game!


               Yours sincerely,

could you please reserve for one press pass - or, if possible, two — for the FA Cup
semi-final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool at Hillsborough on Saturday April

        As Norwich City are playing In the other semi-final, it has been decided to
cover the match at Hillsborough as well so that we can give our readers an account
of the team that, hopefully, thejr team will play in the final,
           I look forward to your reply*

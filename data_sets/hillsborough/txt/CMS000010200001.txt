Dear Mr Mortimer


FOOTBALL LIAISON GROUP

Earlier this year Mr Sandford, Chief Executive of the Football
League, requested the setting up of a government steering group
with whom the League could discuss matters of common interest,
particularly those arising from the Taylor report into the
Hillsborough disaster. It was agreed that the Home Office and the
Department of the Environment would provide the kernel of the
group, with other Departments being kept informed and asked to
attend only if the football authorities wanted to raise something
which concerned them and which was also of wider interest.

Notes of the first two meetings are attached for information. The
next meeting will take place on 5 February 1991.

I am copying this note and attachments to Mr E McGivern (Inland
Revenue), Mr Gaw (Customs and Excise), Miss M McLean (Scottish
Education Department) and Mr T M Timlin (Welsh Office).



Yours sincerely




Maggie Sharp
(Fire and Emergency Planning
        Department)

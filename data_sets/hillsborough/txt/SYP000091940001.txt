              On S a t u r d a y   15th April   1989     (150469)       i was on duty and          involved      in

           2_ events      relating      to the semi      final   football        m at c h to be played at          the

              Sh ef fi el d W e d n e s d a y football   Ground.         1 he teams     playing were

              Li verpool       and N o t ti ng ha m Forest.      My duty on that date was Serial                      12.

              The Sei^geant in charge of the Serial was P o l i c e S e r geant                       1415

              time.      The m a j o ri ty of these       fans were        reasonably well         behaved

              a l t h ou gh some were      unruly and a number were               carrying      cans of alcoholic

         .S h o r t l y before 3       pm      (1500)          that date,        in company with the                    rest of

          Serial      3.2, I a t t e nd ed at the G y m n a s i u m of the H i l l s b o r o u g h football

          g round to stand ay for                        further deployment



          A p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 .05    pm      (1505)       the same       day 1 a t t e n d e d          the Leppings Lane

          end of the          perimeter           track,         together with Serial                     12, a report       of

          trouble       in that area.                    As   I a p p r o a c h e d this area the game was                   still       in

          play.       I saw a group of fans on                                   r   i   its   e t e r trac k and   corner o f t h e

          p i t c h to the S o u t h side of tjy^goal                          at Leppi n g s Lane              end.     It was     not

          possible to determine at #hi s                           time what              the      problem was.
          I                                          /


          As    I wal k e d along           t/ne perimeter track                 in front              of the N orth S tand         I

          saw a se Ti o r Po Ja ce Officer                       enter    the    p i t c h f roin the Le ppings Lane                    end

         wit h    his arrn,/fa i s e d and a p p r o a c h               the    referee.               The game was       in play

         at     that time and as a result                         of the officer                   speaking    to the     referee

          the    game was          stopped.



          As    1 got    closer       to the goal at the L e p pings Lane                                end    1 saw a number           of

          supporters          on the        pitch.            They a p p e a r e d d i s t r e s s e d and some were

          gasping       for breath and almost                      vomiting.                   I was unable      to see what        had

          occur r e d until          I got wit h i n a few feet of the goal and was                                      close     to

          the    perimeter          fence at /the back of the goal.                                  There were       numerous

         Police O f f icers at               tjfte       f e n c e and   I saw that fans on the                      terracing were

              rushed up against' the fencing.                            I could see                the faces of two women

          who were       side by side,                   their    faces were              purple and        I could tell          they

          were    dead.        I saw other                people     being      crushed ar o u n d them,                some were

k         vomiting,          some were         gasping for breath.                             I could see they were

          e x t remely distressed.                       1 was unable          to get to these                 people    to give any

          a ssis t a n c e    so    I made my way to the gate                             in the fencing            to the   left of

          the    goal when facinq                 the Leppings Lane                      end.       The gate was        open at this



r   Nr
time and there were              several       officers    present.      1 could see a number               of

people      laid    in the gateway and the               officers were      trying     to pull       them

out but were unable              to do so as they were            trapped by the force           of

crushing       from behind.           I could not give any a ssistance                here   due to the

amount      of other     officers who were a l r e a d y trying             to help these        people

but were unable -at that                time    to get them out.



1 went      back to the       fencing at the           rear of the goal         to see    if I could

assist.        I saw numerous           officers    shouting      to the    crowd to get       back and

waving      their arms      to      indicate     they should stop
                                                               pushing from behind.             I
                                                                 ' S ,JvV                        i.
then saw that officers                together wit h stewards and red cr os ^ p e r s o n n e l
                                                                                 ..........
had started          to get      some    people    out         were    laying   them on the          pitch

at the edge of the            track.         I assisted      in moving     these    people    further-

back     onto the     pitch      to make       room for more casualties.              I made sure

that     these     people were able            to breath and went       back to       assist with

more     casualties.         1 gave what a ss i s t a n c e where        I could,      remaining       in

the area to the           left and behind          the goal,     wit h the exc e p t i o n    of one

time       when a medical           officer who had been giving            treatment     to a patient

on the edge of the            pitch      requested a stretcher           stating      there would         be

one    in the dug out.              I went     with another      officer,    a S e r g e a n t who    I

cannot      identify to get this               stretcher and took       it back       to the male

casualty where          he was      placed on it,



I went a round the           injured      people    to see where        I. could give assistance,

I saw a number          of Police Officers,              red cross     personnel      and stewards

           assistance        to supporters         who were     on the     pitch.     Some   we re

         g m o u t h to m o u t h    resus c i t a t i o n and heart massage.          I then saw a

rale member        of the     red cross giving            both heart massage and m outh to

m outh    re sus c i t a t i o n to a m a n who was        laid on the      pitch at the       left

hand side of the           goal whe n        looking     from Pen i s t o n e Road.      I assisted

         * him with m ou t h to mouth as he did heart massage.                              It became apparent

    0/   th-ax our acti o n s were             not   reviving     this man and         we    checked for a pulse

            it we were unable             to find one.          The m a n ’s face was d i s c o l o u r e d

           .awards     purple.         It was     obvious      that he was dead and we were                unable        to

          do anything        further       for him,        I cannot      describe     the man and do not

          know where        he had been          prior    to my seeing         him on the      pitch,      I do not

          know the       identity of the             red cross man.



          I continued to give a ss i s t a n c e where                I could.        I saw a number           of

yC '     people    on the        pitch who were          obv i o u s l y dead.     Ared cross ambulance


%         came    round the         track and a number           of   injured      people were        placed        in

          the    back.      I then saw a S o u t h Yo r k s h i r e M e t r o p o l i t a n Am b u l a n c e    come

          across     the    pitch.        Several      people were       placed     in the vehicle and taken

          away.



          The Fire Brigade             had a rr i v e d and were ass i s t i n g with supporters where

          possible.         Some     of the fencing           had been torn down to assist               with

          releasing        the    fans.        A number    of hoardings        were   broken up and used as

          stretchers.            N u m erous    supporters      helped    to     carry people,      both dead and

          injured to the gymnasium.



          I did not        leave the                 of the    pitch.    When all     the bodies        had been

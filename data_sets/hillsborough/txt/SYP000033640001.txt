             YOU R REF

          Dear Sir

          Hillsborough

          As you are aware, we act on behalf of Sheffield                                                                                                                                       Wednesday
          Football Club with regard to the Public Inquiry.

          We enclose letters, most of which are originals, received by
          the Club Secretary.     Many of these letters are from eye
          witnesses and may be of use to the Police investigation team.

          We would ask that the originals be                                                                                                             returned                     following         the
          conclusion of the inquiry.

          We also refer to our clients providing your investigation team
          with the original of the Safety At Sports Grounds Act Safety
          Certificate for the current season. We do possess a copy of
          the   same save for the plans and we would be grateful if
          copies of those plans could be made available as soon as
          possible.                                      /  t__ _

          We look forward to hearing from you.
                                                                                                                                                                       / A-                /^    I j o o f /'c-

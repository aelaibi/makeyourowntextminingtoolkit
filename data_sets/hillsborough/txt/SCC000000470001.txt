                                       24th April, 19 89



     The Duke of Kent has asked me to thank you most
warmly for all the invaluable help you gave to him and
his party during our visit to Sheffield on Tuesday,
18th April.  His Royal Highness greatly appreciated the
trouble you took in welcoming him to the City in such
spontaneous and considerable style, and in briefing us
so thoroughly on the implications of the Hillsborough
Tragedy and on your response to it.

     The Duke was as you know shocked and horrified by
the disaster. He was however grateful to have the
opportunity to visit the scene and to meet some of the
people affected by the tragedy.  The Duke of Kent has
asked me to reiterate his deep sympathy, and also to
express his admiration for the fortitude and generosity
of spirit of the reactions of the people of Sheffield,
in which you are showing such commendable initiative
and leadership.

     His Royal Highness was touched and honoured by
your invitation to him to add your Headquarters to his
programme, and to sign your Book there.  He sends his
warmest personal greetings to you, together with his
very best wishes for the success of your Appeal and for
the City of Sheffield in the longer term, as you emerge
from these dreadfully sad events.

PERSONAL




Your Worship,

On behalf of our Operatic Society, I am writing to say that we were all
very sorry that you were unable to attend our production of "My Fair Lady"
on the 17th April, although we all understand that, under the
circumstances of the Hillsborough Disaster, you were not able to do so.

We were all very distressed about this and we felt that we should make some
effort to contribute towards your Appeal.

During the week of the show, before each performance, we placed collection
boxes in the Montgomery Theatre and, thanks to the people who came to see
our production, the cast and backstage crew, we were able to collect a sum
of £300, which we would like you to accept for your Appeal.

Please find enclosed a cheque for £300, which we send to you with our best
wishes.

Yours sincerely,




S e c r e ta r y

  The Ambassador said today "a friend in need is a friend indeed". He expressed
  his appreciation of the support the people of Sheffield had given to Esteli
  and to the Nicaraguan Hurricane Appeal. And he    said that there was     "a deep
  inter-relationship of solidarity" between the people of       both countries.

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

My Dear Lord Mayor

Re: The Hillsborough Disaster

I write to inform you that the Sunday before last, 16 April, no less than
seventy post mortem examinations were carried out here at the Medico-Legal
Centre between 9 am and 9.30 pm by teams of five pathologists working morning,
afternoon and evening tours of duty. The remaining twenty-four of the post
mortems performed here were completed during the morning of the following day by
slightly fewer teams. Thus within three days of the worst disaster in the
history of British football, Her Majesty's Coroner was able to open an inquest
with every body identified and photographed, every cause of death determined and
blood specimens taken from every body for further investigation.

I do not believe that this could have been done anywhere else in the United
Kingdom in that time. It was only possible here because of the unique
facilities provided in the Medico-Legal Centre which allowed no less than five
tables to be used simultaneously.   These facilities were commented on favourably
to me by visiting pathologists. The provision of a special small post mortem
room which could be, and was, converted into a cold room and used for the
storage of bodies which could not be accommodated in the main fridges proved
especially useful. The features designed and built into the Centre to cope with
an emergency of these proportions worked well and my main purpose in writing is
to thank the Council and their 1975 predecessors who sanctioned the building of
the Centre and also to thank the City authorities who maintain it and staff it
at a very high level of efficiency.

Great work is in the end done by people not by buildings, and it would be quite
wrong of me if I did not convey to you how well the mortuary staff, technicians
and assistants rose to the occasion - they worked until they were literally
exhausted.  They were helped greatly by the administrative staff,
and |            | both of whom, prior to the disaster, I believe, had never ever
handled a dead body. Both performed their grim task manfully and gave a lead to
the others.



                                                                                               continued/2.
                                                                           2



I would like to think the efficiency of Her Majesty's Coroner's arrangements and
the work done by his officers and all of the Health and Environmental staff at
the Medico-Legal Centre contributed a little to relieving the suffering of the
relatives of the dead and thus enhancing the reputation of the City of
Sheffield.

I enclose a personal contribution to your fund.

Yours sincerely___________________________

   To the Lord Mayor and

   The people of the Borough of Knowsley are deeply grateful to

   the Lord Mayor and Citizens of the City of Sheffield for the many

 1.   We have received a message from the President
 of the Uruguayan National Commission for Physical
 Education, Dr Julio Maglione, asking us to pass on
 his organisation's deepest condolences to the people
 of Liverpool and Sheffield for the loss they suffered
 and to sympathise with them at this difficult and
 painful time.

 2.   I wonder if I could ask you to pass this message
 on to the two city authorities on Dr Maglione's
 behalf. We have already expressed our thanks to him
 for his kind words.

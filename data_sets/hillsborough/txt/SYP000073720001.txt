            I have supported Liverpool                Football          C 1ub Sup po rt er   for about       ten

            years.       I attend all         the home matches at Liverpool                    and go to some           of

            the away matches.

            I got my ticket         for    the game at H i l l s b o r o u g h from a mate

                      I paid              si:-; pounds       for the ticket,          which was     for the

we t r av el le d together        in a van which]____________            drove,   we   left

Liverpool        at about 9.0 0 a m     <0900)   and t ra velled over the Snake Pass

to Sheffield.             We stopped at a little       village         for breakfast     this was

about      twenty miles       from Sheffield.       We a r r i v e d    in Sh ef fi el d between

11.30am (1130) and 12.00 noon (1200) midday.

We      parked the van on a stpep hill             this was about         twenty minu te s walk

to the ground.             By a vo iding   the m ot o r w a y we had a clear       run to

S h e f f i e l d and there was       no traffic    holdups

We all went          to a pu4    w h ic h we haa driven     past e          'er this was      further

on than where we            parked.    We all    had about     six      pints of beer e a c h .
                                                                                                                   PAGE        3
                                                                                                                   SI 798

         The    pub was        full     of Liverpool             supporters      because       it was    so hot and       it

         was    getting        quite     full    inside we all went and sat outside.

         About 2 . 15pm         (1415)       we all        left    to walk to the ground,               everyone    in the

         pub and outside was                 in good spirits              no one was      staggering about          drunk.

         I noticed that there was                    police        presence about as we wal ke d to the

         ground,      there were          allies          vans    going    past a nd officers           on foot,    but we

         were able to m a k e/our               own way to the ground,                  there was       no

         d i s t ur ba nc es    o f / a n y kind everyone was in good spirits.

         It was a b o u t 2. 4 5 p m         (1445)        when we a r r i v e d at Leppings Lane,               there was

         just a mass           of    people     stood around            the entrance       to the       ground.     I was

         concerned because of the time and the enormous                                   size of the        crowd that

         I w o ul d not        be able       to get        in.

         We ended up in the turnstile                        aiftrancs for the West S tand seating,                      we

         were    not able           to get    back        ouft because      of the      pressure from the          crowd,

         there was a moun te d               p o 1 ic eman       in front      of the turnstile who was             trying

         to force      the      crowd back,          but because           of the size of the crowd he was

         faced wi t h an impossible                  task.            E very time he tried to move               forward

         more    fans moved towards                 the turnstiles.

         I could see that               I was    not going            to be able       to force my way out

         because      everyone was            pushing and shoving.                     I realised that        I was

         being      pushed      into the        corner.           I m a n a g e d to   pull myself       over a steel

         fence      that   seperated the turnstij^e's the fence was about                                eight    feet

         I climbed over              the fence with                                      arm                          I was

Ik A     thankful      that         I m a n ag ed to       climb over       the fence because            I feared     that
    •v
^   .    I w ou ld have been crushed                   in the x*r'rowd.         I was    not the only one           who

         1 sat on top of the fence                     for about          five minutes,        I intended to        edge

         my w ay along          towards       the    roof of the turnstile,                there was a policeman

         on the      roof who was            pulling        people      over    into the ground.             I could see

           people         in the West S t an d turnstile w e r e being                     crushed X had a good

           view     because      I was      still    sat on the fence.

           A bloke         pulled himself          up to the fence and said,                      " D o n ’t panic they

           entrance         to the terrace,          the entrance                  still     packed with          people        but

           not so bad as the other turnstile.                           Jr w a l k e d    round to the gate          there

           were     four     policemen on horses               right    by the gates,             as we got       right     up

           to the         gate they    closed       it.       I was    still     with                               a nd



           The    police      horses moved towa/ds               us and the          rest of the          crowd,    we

           not going         to get    in, wi tm in turning             round and walking about                   five

     6>.   paces,         the other    concg^t i na gate             next to the West Stand t urnstile was

           opened.          I did not see who             opened      it,    I must       have    been one       of the

           first     ones     to go thro ug h        it.                             /

            'he three        of us met up with                               a n # we all walked over               to the

           tunnel         entrance.        I did    not see any         pol^re       in this area or any

           stewards.          I did not see any signs                  directing anyone                to the    terraces.

           E v eryone was       going       towards       the entr^tice         to the tunnel,           so we     f ollowed

           the    rest      of the    crowd.        I saw the/light             at       the end of the tunnel           and     I

           :ould see the top of the                  crossb/r         of the g o a l .       We wa lk ed at fast

           w a l k in g    pace and    into the       turVgfel there was             no    police       or stewards        to

           prevent         us from going       into the tunnel.                 I came to the end of               the

           tunnel         and hit    the    crowd    it was      just       like a wall          of    people.     There was

           plenty of         people    in the tunnel            but    if I had wa nt ed to              I would have

           been able         to turn round quite               easily and w a l k /b ac k             out a gain the game

            packed        in so tight,       1 tried to          pick my feet up but               I c o u l d n ’t because

            someone was           standing     on them,       the     crowd went         forward but my feat

           stayed         put.     I yanked my foot           up p e cause        I was       scared of goang        under

            I know that           I was    being     crushea,       there was a sudden surge                 forward and

            I e nded up          in the middle          of the      pen.     I lost sight          of '                      11

            could still           hear    his voice       because      he was        shouting.         I turned     round

           and s cr a mb l ed my way back towards                     him and        reached out to grab hold

           of him.          I kept hold of him and then met                       up with_

           w ou ld    be safer,          I reny^mber      looking     up and over             to the    right    into Pen 3

           was      in my mind to do the same thing.                         I could tell          that   s omething was

           d ra s t i c a l l y wrong      by the       look/of fear         on p e o p l e ’s faces.        I could hear

           his      legs    in order       to keep him upright.                 To     begin with       I thought     he was

           dead.          I began slapping           his face there was                no reaction        I leant    over

    hand hit the floor.               I reached out and -jrabbed him and                            pulled him up

    about    the same time                                      also      hit the       barrier and went

    down,    he hit    it with some           force we all               went    down we d i d n ’t a c t u a l l y        hit

    fence,    we were about           ten feet away from t h e                  fence,        I remember turning

    to my right and           looking    on the       floor          1 /saw a white           lad in his twenties

    he had ginger          h a i r, he had a red s hi r/ on which was                            up round his       neck,

                shouted,        " W e ’ll go out the back way".

    It was a scramble           to get back up the                   terrace       once we got half way up

    the    crowd seemed to ease            up,    I still           ha/f hold of                                   by his

    up to the tunnel           and    ran straight             ttayough the t u n n e l .

    The    tunnel    was     lined wit h       police      officers          who    seemed to be just stood

got    up and walked away-               There were       other    bodies   being brought           out ail

the    time.

A police man wearing a flat                   cap came over       to me and said to         leave him

he    is alright        just move       on.     I thought       to myself   that he was out of

order and the way he said                 it really a n g e r e d me because he            c o u l d n ’t

have known what           it was      like.      I gave him a mouthful           of abuse       1 was

then    pulled away.            The time would have             been about 3 .25 - 3 . 3 0 p m        (1525)

I sat down for a while                to th/ink about       things      I walked    back    in.       I saw a

line    of bodies        by the exit jgates.             I wa lk ed    in to the    court yard

stayed for about           five mi nJn,es.         I then deci de d to go back to the van

and wait        for ever/one.           I was    the    first    one there and everyone             turned

up s a f e .

I went    to the                fixture       last year at Hillsborough,,           it was      far

better    pol i cfrc/.     I arrived at the ground at the same time                        I had no

problem        in getting       in,   there were        proper    queues,   everything .^bout the

way    it was handled was             far better        in every      respect.     If Ir had known

how bad the size of the                 crowd was       going    to be this ygar and          the     total

lack of        police    control      I w ould have       <:e r tai n 1y jgo t to the g r ound

earlier.

with    proper       leadership and           control    they    could have yaone more          to assist

w ith the       injured.        There    seemed to be a total         jyac/i of communication.
                                                                     i.

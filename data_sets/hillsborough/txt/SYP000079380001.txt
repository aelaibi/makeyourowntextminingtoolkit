                   in the G w l e r t o n area.           I asked directions                 to the ground and w al ke d to

                   occasional        fans were         being     let    in as others              left.      I didn' t\ pother

                   trying     to get       in and      carried on to the ground.                        As   I wa lk ed to the

                   were     no queues at         the     turnstiles          so    1 handed over my ticket and

                   e ntered./      I noticed        that       police officers were searching                            supporters

                   outside      the ground and also               inside when they                 came out of the

                   turnstiles.           The    officers were           doing full           body searches.                   I was

                   When     I entered the ground                I ru?xiced that a gate                  to my left was                open.

                   This     seemed unusual          as    it          owed fans          to wander at will a ro u nd the

               becoming        quite    full.      B y /about 2.20       pm    <1420)    I noticed that          these

               the     rear.     By 2.40     pm    <1440)      the    pens thfie and four were                full   to what

               1 w ould say was very              close to      its    limiy.     S om et im e    between then and

               3 .00    pm    <1300)    I remember seeing a yo/th scurry across                         the top of the

               crowd     running across           their      heads and shoulders          from a position at             the

               rear to          a position at the front.               W hen the two football                teams   came on

               the     pitch     to warm up I           remember      seeing some        fans being       pulled up to

               the West        stand from the West             terrace    by otb4r       fans on the stand area.

               The m atch started and              I c o n c e ntrated my /attention on the game.

               After a while my a t t e n t i o n was drawn 2o the fencing behind the goals

               as     fans    had begun     climbing         over the/fence       from pens three and four

               onto     the    pitch.     Initially          I thought    they were       climbing        over to avoid

               some     sort of trouble.            A police officer            ran onto       the    pitch and the

               game was        stopped.      At this stage everything                  seemed     in confusion,         fans

               were     clambering       over     the fence and         police officers were              climbing      up

               the fence        from the other          side trying to          lift    people       over.     I saw

               people        that were    o b v io u s l y   injured being       lifted over the fence                by fans

               a nd    police,     others were         lying on the       pitch having           either      climbed over

               the     fence    or been     carried through the gates                  or fence.        I c a n ’t be sure

               which.         There were about          fifty or more          police    officers and St Johns

               a m b ul a n c e men a r o u n d the fence area.               I saw an elderly man being

               lifted over         the fence       that divided my section from pen three.                           He was

               lifted by fans           into my se ction but            I was    unable    to tell        if he was      hurt

                     early on in this              confusion       I remember seeing a young                     boy being           laid on

                     the     pitch in the          corner       of the West and S o ut h stand.                   I could see

                     that        he was    being    given       chest mass ag e and mouth to m ou th                   r es us ci ta ti on

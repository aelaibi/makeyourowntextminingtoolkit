              support Liver pool F ootbal1 Club.            I go to games quite often, although

              I d o n ’t have a season ticket for Anfield.



              On Saturday      15th April   1989 ( 150489), Liverpool were to play

             Nottingham Forest        in the Semi Final of the FA Cup at Hillsborough

              Stadium in Sheffield.         A friend had managed to get me a ticket for the

              Leppings Ln terracing.        This cost me £ 6 . 0 0 p.



              On match day I travelled with a group of friends               in a hired mini b u s .

              We all    put in about £8 each and this included hiring the driver.

              There were about thirteen of us going to the game in the coach and

              I understand that the Police are aware of the names of the passengers,
                                                                                   PAGE     2

One of the passengers      in the mini bus was a N i c h o l a ^ J O Y N E S .     I have

known Nicholas JOYNES for five or six y e a r s .              Every Monday for the

last three years a group of lads would get together and play

five-a-side footbal1 at                      High S c h o o l .   Ni cholas

JOYNES used to attend and play with us,



We met on match day at the                                                     for 1030

hours,     We left for Sheffield sometime after             1100 hours.       We met up

with some other lads who travelled from L/verpool                   to Sheffield in

cars,    at the ’S p o rt s ma n’ pub in Sheffield at about          1315 hours.     We

also met up with Francis MeALLI LTER /n this Pub.                   Francis was driving

his own c a r .   I've only known F         rtis McALLISTER for three years

I had a few drinks.       It was a warm,      dry day.



We left the pub all together about           1430 hours.          I got in Francis

McALLISTER *s car with him.        I c a n ’t remember who else was           in the car.

We all drove to the ’Beehive*        pub,    parked up and walked to the

football ground.



It took about fifteen minutes to walk to the football ground.                       I

walked with F rancis McALLISTER towards the gr ou n d.                  We were all close

by to each other.       It was very busy.          All the lads with tickets for

the terrace split up with the lads with stand tickets and we arranged

to meet back at the car y & r k     of the       ’Beehive ’p-ub.



Francis McALLISTER,      Nicholas JOYNES,         a couple of the other lads and I

tried to join the crowd for the turnstile outside the ground.                       There

was a lot of pushing going o n .        A mounted Policeman trying to

control the crowd rode past us about 1455 hours.                    This split our group

up and I found myself with Francis McALLISTER and Nicholas JOYNES
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             S3338

only.     The rest of the lads were being moved towards the front

turnstile,    but us three were being pushed backwards.          1 told Nicholas

JOYNES I was going to try to find another way in to the ground.

Nicholas shouted to me,       "           , where are you going?”

He knew me but didn't know Francis McALLISTER,           so I told him I was

going to try to find another way in ta^the ground.             Nicholas JOYNES

and Francis McALLISTER were standing in the crowd together outside

the turnstiles at Leppi ngs L ivj        This was the last time that I saw

either of them.     They            in no problem when I last saw them,      just

waiting    in a big queue.



I went off alone.        I saw a Policeman by a wall assisting      people

over the railings    into the area leading to the West Stand area.             I

went over in that direction.



I had got onto a wall, about 6 ' high or 7' high.            I could see

people surging towards the turnstile,          first one side of the terrace

and then at the other entrance to the ground.            I heard people shout

that the gates were open and that they were letting people

in .



I must have been on       that wall for about two minutes.       While on    the

wall    I looked into the crowd and saw the lads I'd travelled with,           but

not Nicholas JOYNES       or Francis Mc AL LI STE R.   They were still at    the

back I think,    quite    a way from the turnstile.



I heard a cheer go up.        I didn't have a watch on.       I did know it was

near kick off time.        People    in the crowd were saying that the teams

were out.

       I saw a surge of people running.             I couldn ’t see any gates open.       I

       had taken a while to ge^/out of the crush onto this wall,              so at first

       I just stayed on thsfr'top of the wall.

       Eventually, irfro pped over the wall,           up some yfit~airs and into the

       ground.    I never had my ticket checked.           I/asked a lad where I was in

       the ground because         I did not know.     I wj*s in the stand about the

       Leppings Ln t er rac e.



       The   play had started,       I went to some empty seats,      there was a lot of

       empty seats.       I   sat towards the middle of the stand about two or three

       rows from the front.         Within a minute or less of getting       into the

       stand I saw Peter BEARDSLEY take a shot at goal and hit the cross bar.



       All   I remember       is people getting onto the pitch,     fans this was,      and

       approach the Liverpool        goal keeper who was waving the fans away.            I

       saw a Policeman run from my left onto the pitch,             followed by ^another

       and the game got stopped then.



       I went to the front of the stand,            locked over   into the terrace below.

       I could see people being pulled j/nxX of the terrace.  As I wa tched I
       C A ^r / T O V^£TT) 5 1<VGr
       saw the hoardings being u e d are stretchers and people running about

       the pitch.     I d o n ’t rempmbejr people being pulled upwards from the

       terrace to the West Stajnd/that I was in.            I was too far over to the

       left,   towards the North Stand to join in with them.



       I saw people being given mouth to mouth and the Police and fans

       pulling at the perimeter fencing.



       It must have been about half an hour before             I saw three bodies    covered
                                                                           PAGE    5

up.     They were on the pitch.



 I left the ground on the announcement that the game was abandoned and

that people were requested to leave the ground quietly.



I met               and                   on Leppings Ln.     We went to a

’Kentucky Fried C h i c k e n 5 place nearby.    We then walked back to the top

of Leppings Ln, met a few of the others and walked to the ’Beehive'

car park.    We went    into a house with                              and

people were using the telephone.        I knew my parents would be out,       so I

had                    leave a message with his mother or brother to ring

my parents later,      to say I was okay.       I was not injured at all



As I came out this house a Radio Sheffield car stopped us and started

asking                 and myself some questions about what had happened at

Hillsborough.     I had seen Graham KELLY of the FA on TV in the house

I ’d just   left and had heard them say fifty people were dead at

Hillsborough.     I came home on the mini bus about 0230 hours the next

morning.     I later learned that Ni cholas JOYNES and F rancis McALLISTER

 both died at Hillsborough,

On page 2,    I say Nicholas and Francis were together,        they were about

twelve feet apart      in the crowd.

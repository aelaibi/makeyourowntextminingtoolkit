knaw 1 ed.ge concerni ng the shosi ng of horses .



I have      in the    past wo rk ed for seven years at Newmarket and would

describe myself as           having a very broad experience              of horse matters



On   1st March,       1988    <010388)       I commenced a contract with the S

Y orkshire Police Force as a farrier                    to' the horses   based at       the Niag ar a

M ou nt ed Stables      in Hi 1 Isborough,        Sheffield.        I also,    when    required,

visit    stables      in Barnsley.



?1y contract       is flexible        in that one week          it may be the horses are all

in order     but     I try to go down at          least every other          day to    check     the

horses.      On average        I probably work          nine    hours a week at the Niag ar a

Ground.      I know all       nine     horses    that are kept at the ground well                  and

have    on many occasions            shoed and tended them.



In oarticular        I have     reason to recall          one horse    known as Silverwooi

He   is a bay about          16 hands    high.     He    is a gelding with a wnite              blaiz<

down the     centre    of his        face.    He has a black mane and tail              and     in my

experience        of horses     he    is one of the most          placid horses       i. have    come
                        j-t
a cr oss.    PC                        who   I now know        personally,    has   been the       rides

of that     horse             months    at N i ag ar a    and    I believe    he used    to     ride

the same     horse when he was           s tationed      in Barnsley.



I recall     on either        T hu rs d ay or Friday       13th/14th April, 1989         (130489 -

140489)      (the exact       date w ould be      in a    book    kept at the stables).             i

had occasion to shoe Silverwood.                   On that day       i remember       nothing

unusual     about S il ve r wo o d who       like the other        horses was       in immaculate

condi t.i o n .
                                                                                                        P AGE           ;
                                                                                                        S 1 7h 4

    E arly    the    following week,         T u es da y    18th April,      1989    (180489)     I returned
*

    to the Niag a r a aware          that    the horses would            have    been utilsed at the

    Cup semi-fianl        m atch at the S h e f f i el d W ed n es d ay football               Ground.



    I can only say when           I saw S i l v e r w o o d I was        disgusted.       I,    in my 9

    years     experience with horses,              was      not   prepared for what         I saw that

    day.



    S i l v e r w o o d had numerous     burns?      consistent with            cigarettes      being    put

    out, on his       skin and    cigarettes         being m a l i ci o us l y twisted         into his

    skin.     The     burns w e re    p r e d o m i n a n 1 1y to his    b a c k s i d e , round his    tail,

    t o h i s 1e f t s iae o f the body.



    I counted fourteen distinct                 burns and         could see numerous           other    burns

    There were        burns    to the tail       itself.          A number      of the burns went

    b eyond    the outer       skin and      into the flesh.            Before      that w ee k- e nd you

    could a p p r oa ch S i l ve r wo o d and he would             not move,     when    I a p p r o a c h e d him

    that     day he flinched         in a manner           that was     clearly nervous.          I have

    snoed horses        on numerous         occasions       wit hi n my year on contract after

    football        matches.     I have      never    seen wounds         of that     nature before.



    I have     returned on other            occasions        since    that Tuesday and the horse                   is

    still     of a different         character       to how he was         before     that game.



    I w o u 1 a be prepared to att end an enqui r y .

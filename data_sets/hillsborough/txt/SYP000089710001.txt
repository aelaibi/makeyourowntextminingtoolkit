                    am a singie man anai I live at the above address



                On S a t u r d a y      13th April    1989   (130489),         1 went     to the Football

                A s so c i a t i o n C ha llenge Cup Semi-Final            game held at the She f f i e 1d

                W e d n e sd a y Football      Ground,, Hillsborough,             Sheffield.



                I am a supporter             of Lyeverpool Football            Club.       I have f ol lowed the

                progress        of the Club for man y years               through the newspapers and

                t el ev is io n but had        never    been to see them            play.



                The Cup semi-final             game at H i ll s bo r ou g h on S at ur d ay       15th April     1989

                (150489),         was     the first    football     game       I had attended.        I tra ve ll ed to

                the game wit h three            friends.
                                                                                                 PAGE    2

                        I for the game      from

                                                   pound ticket      for    the Lepping s Ln

t erraces       (standing area).         I paid face      value     for    it



The     three    friends      I travel).ed to the game with,              their    names and

a d dr es s e s are;      /                                                                  ^




All     four of us t ravelled to S h e f f ie l d        in my    private motor           car.     I

can't     remember what         route we    took.      None of us     in the       car knew the way

and     I got    lost a few times.         We ended up at one time                in Manch es te r

City C e n t r e .      We started our journey to S h e f f i el d at about 9 .00 am

(0900)     on the morn in g of S at ur d ay         15th April      1989    (150489).



We got to S h ef fi el d at about 2.00 pm               (1400),     we hadn't          stopped

a ny wh er e    on the way.        As we were driving       towards        the ground, following

the     rest    of the football       traffic we were held up in the slow moving

heavy traffic.            There were Police         on the m ai n    road to direct          the

football        traffic.      We   f ol lowed the traffic        driving        past    the Leppings

Ln entrance          to the ground and a little           further art there was a group

of shops w hich          I. parked the     car   by.    I c a n ’t remember        the    name of the

road we        parked    in but    it was only about       three     or four minutes walk

awa y    from the ground.           1 think we      parked the      car at about 2.20            pm

(1420).
                                                                             b u J b a J U &                 ™{|7         3

ye    left the        car and wa lk ed up a hill                 to the Gate wa y Superm ar ke t              where

we    bought       some    cans    of    lager.        The other         lads drank about            two    cans of

lager     each.        I don't      drink myself.              Other      supporters were also

drinking           cans of beer         but    I never      saw anyone who             I would     say was

drunk.         I never      saw any sort             of disorder.



About 2.30           pm,   (1430);, we         started walking            down the hill          following all

the other          supporters.          We     never had any Police               escort.        I never      saw

any Police          giving    directions,            a lt ho u gh there were P ol i ce m en about,

none of us had been to the ground before                                but we didn't bother asking

direc t i o n s we just           follow ed all         the other         supporters.

On our arrival             outside       the entrance tuo the ground all                    I could see was

a mass        of   people    in front          of thi^/ t e r r a c e   turnstiles,        this^mass

s tretching         back from the             tuWstiL^         and onto      the                n t i n t.e p p i n g s

Ln,      Thers> d i d n 't appear             to        iy/<<fueues,      just             mass     of people,

I could see one P o l i c e ma n on f w s e                  back stuck          in the middle          of this

mass     of    people.       It looked             like he was      trying       to    push people         into    some

sort     of queues         but he wasn't             doing any good because               there were         too

man y    people to organise.                   I can't say        if I. saw any stewards                outside

the     turnstiles,         1 wouldn't             have known what a steward               looked       like.



The     four of us joined onto                     the mass of      people and          in about      ten minutes

we had mana ge d to push, our way through the                              crowd and entered the

ground ty^o^gVt j S t \^rx\!s. t i 1 e , a turnstile                    situated       to the    left hand side

of the terrace             turnstile          block as you        look at the block from Leppings

          Ln.      Whilst    working       our way forwards       to the turnstiles         I was    being

           crushed but       not that       badly that       it w o rr ie d me „ There was also a lot of

           pushing and shoving             going    on but    I had been warned to expect            this at a

          Semi-Final.         I had no diff i cu lt y         in finding my entry        point.       It was

           clear    from the signs w hich were               the terrace     turnstiles.



           I handed my ticket          into the turnstile          operator as        I entered through

          the turnstiles.            All    four of us f ol lowed each other            through the

          tu rns tiles.



           I had not seen any u na ut ho r is e d entry being made                 to the ground.



          I had     not seers any gates            open or being opened other           than the     turnstile

          gates «



          W hen    I got    inside    the ground       I didn't    know where      to go,      I had never

          been     in a football       stad iu m before.         I c o u l d n ’t see any signs      to help

          me.      I saw some    stairs w hich         I said to the others           should we go up,         but

          one of my friends           said no because          the stairs went        up into the stand.



          All     four   of us just        f ol lowed all     the other    supporters             e rje    coming

           in thro u g h the turnstiles,             We followed      them    into 4 J^usfrj

were    packed together?              but    there was       enough    room to push through

people.       It took us about               two or three minutes           to work our way

very happy.                                    was with Gary.                  i ng no     longer      than

about     one minute,        I talked with Gary and                                We never had any

m o v ement   going      on aro u n d us which y               could only describe as               small

surges.       I had no       idea at        the t i / i e    what was       causing these          surges.         I

was    having     diffi c u l t y    retaining my            position.        I can remember taking

hold of a crush barrier                that/was         in front          of me,   a l t h ou gh   I could not

a c t u a l l y see   it.



At a time        that    I can only est^ifate w ould have                     been about £.5 0             pm or

front     of us because It hi/          m oved forwards                 down the terraces          towards

the    pitch and w i t h i n ^ a very short                 time    I        lost s ight of them,



T hese    surges      in the     crowd were          contyrfuing and          it was     becoming more

an d more     difficult        to hoi 1 our                        ff the    crush barrier



I did not see the game                kick off.             I am unable       to say how long we

were     stuck    up against         this     crush b a r r i e r ,. trying         to hold ourselves

E v e n t u a l l y with the       increasing       p resj/lre       from behind     1 was    pushed up

a gainst      the barrier,           I cannot       s§^ how      long      I was   in this    position but

my next       clear     rec ol le ct io n    is j f ooking     up and seeing a shot hit the

cross     bar at the othar                         the ground,          I think     I heard someone        say

‘‘Be ar d s l e y' s   hit   the   ciio<     bar



As    this    shot hit       the   cross     bar suddenly e v e r y t hing started to V i g h ten

up ar o u n d me and         I was    being      severely      cruj/hed,       with this     sudden

tightening        up I found         I was    being m o v e d / a 1ong the barrier            to my    right

t o w a r d s the d irection of            pen number        iJ&o.    My     legs then came     into

contact with the upright                   stantion           the end of the         crush barrier,        my

legs    went     from under me and u n d e x f t h e crush barrier and at the same

  .me people were            pushing       on myyfiack which           pushed my top half        forwards

and over       the     crush, barrier,          /E could feel          the    corner of the     crush

barrier       slicking       ii|to my struma eh.         I was       stuck     in this   position for         I

think about 2 or 3 \rni n u t e if■              I have marked          this    position as     number £

(2)    on the separate               la plan.



A m a n who      I couldn't        describe was         pulling at the back of rny jeans and

event u a l l y he m a na g ed to          pull me awa y f r/ffti and to the side              of the

crush barrier,



As    l was    pulled away from the                farrier     I s a w _____________       he was     by my

left    hand side and he was                col lapsing down           into the     c r o w d , I think

his    legs    had given way through exhaustion,                           I took hold of his         head in

an arm       lock to keep him Up,/ We were                    in this        position for a long time

I cannot       say exactly how            long bat     I would guess about ten minutes.

D uring      this   time     I was    still    being    crushed,    and we were        still       that

tightly       packed in we         just   could   not move.



I did not see anything                of what was occurring          on the      pitch,      all    I could

see was       people      climbing     up the fencing at the front               of t he     pen to try

an d get      out onto       the   pitch.



Whe n   the    number      of   people    climbing      over   t y f front    perimeter       fence       had

reduced,       I could see an a mbulance               on tj?§ other side        of the      perimeter

fence.        I could also         see that the          tch was    covered with           people.

back    up the      terracing        towards    the tunnel       to get   out,     the terraces were

still       packed.



I am now aware that during my tim^/1 n pen number three I was near to a

crush barrier          that     broke but at/that         time    I was   not aware         of any

               I did not       personally witn ess any deaths                but whilst     I was    in pen number

               three    in the       position mar ke d number         two    (2)    on the separate     grid       plan

               I saw t he f o 11ow i ng .

                                                                                                             JJL -

               At about       the t iitie            a nd          r e j o i ned me/ and            I saw some

               lads who were          hanging    over the      perimeter      fe/sce,    leaning down       into the

               front    of the       pan,    they were      roughly   in 1i /e wit h my position.             I saw

               these    lads       pulling a young       boy up out of/ the          crowd at the front, of the

               pen by the          perimeter    fence,      the body o/ this young          boy was all       limp.

                    think    he was    dead.     I d i d n ’t see t \j q    young    b o y ’s face as he was         side

A              on to me but          1 w ould describe        him a/i a white        boy aged about     11 or        12

               y e a r s , not very tall,        slim    in bui/d.         I c a n ’t say much more about            him

               other    than       I think    he was w eariryg jeans and a            ’I ’ shirt.

    N(vr^. ^   I was    not able myself          to assist w ith any of the dead or injured.



               We    event ua ll y m a na ge d to get out of                 terraces and went        back out of

               ,.the t u n n e l, there were a lot of people                running     back out through       the

               tunnel       carrying    bodies and              ig them down        in the a rea betw ee n the

               tunnel       and the    turnstile



               After    getting       through the tunnel we stood about                  for a minute       to get

               our    breath and then we          left      the g r o u n d yat about 3.4 0   pm.     (1540)



               !rhe only thing         I saw w hi ch     I thought was a factor            in the deaths and

               injuries was during my time                  ii^jen number      three     people at the front

                ere    screarning at the         p o 1 i ce/1o open the gate          in the fence     to    let

               people       out,                        3gen it

                  I live at the above address with my wife/and family.                      I have had

                  casual    employment as a turnstile opet^toi?' for the last                 14 years

                  approximately at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ground at

                  Hillsborough.           All this season I have had a static post as a turnstile

                  operator on gate                This gate

                             on the South Stand.

                  On Saturday 15th April          1989 (150489),         I was on duty at t h a/ tu r ns t i1e

                  gate No          'for the semi     cup final match between Liverpool and

                  Nott Tnqhau#
                       i ngharr^Fo
                                F r es t .     My turnstile was admitting Njzftts Forest                   fans on a

                  ticket only basis to South Stand centre s e a t i n g                I opened the

                  turnstile at approx          1200 hrs.    There were approx 5 policemen and 1

                  policewoman just          inside the turnstile.           They remained there until

                  approx    1455 hrs.        When I believe they went upstairs to some betting
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            S2909

  booths to look after them.

  At approx    1330 hrs two people with Liverpool accents approached my

  turnstile and offered me cash in order to gaivf admittance.           I refused

  and turned them away.      I was surprised to see them at my gate because

  the area outside     is normally barriered off at South/West Stand corner

     ^l"ie ground.   The barriers were there when I arrived because         I had

  to show my pass to get in to work,     other fans should have had tickets

 *to get past the barriers which were controlled by Police and stewards.

  The main crowd arrived at between 1415 hrs and 1450 hrs.           At about

  1445 hrs a youth again with a Liverpool accent          strod quickly over the

  turnstile without offering a ticket.         Almsot   immediately I saw a woman

  Police officer     (who I would recognsie but do not knew her name)        on the

  other side of the turnstile so he quickly strode back to where

  he'd come from.

  A short time later another     two youths again with Liverpool accents

  came right up to the turnstile at approx        1450 hrs.    They hacLn’t got

  tickets and offered me cash.      I refused and they went away/calmly.            At

  about   1500 hrs the Police   cover on my gate had left to go up to the

  betting booths on the South Stands.
              -W
  I first became aware of problems at about        1525 hrs.    When I was still

  at my turnstile.     I looked up and after my tickets had been chekced I

  completed my administration tasks and then at about          1535 hrs I went

  to the South Stand near to the West Stand corner.            I saw the Police

  lined up approx on the 6 yd line at the Kop End,

  they were streched across the pitch.         I also saw between 10 and     12

  Liverpool   supporters   on the pitch just    in frojpft of the terrace

fP sjyruting and gesticulating at   the Forest Fayfs who were on the terr ac e

 below me.     This was happening at the same lime as casualties were

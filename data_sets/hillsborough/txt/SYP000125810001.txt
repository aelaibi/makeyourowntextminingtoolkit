POLICE, THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. THE LIVERPOOL FANS SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT
WML. GOING ON, AND FETCHED BROADS AND SUCH LIKE AND RENDER FIRST AID TO THE

WAS HAPPENING UNTILL ABOUT 3.50PM WHEN KENNY DALGLISH ASKED THE CROWD TO
CO-OPERATE WITH THE POLICE, WHICH THEY DID.THE NEXT ANNOUNCEMENT WAS AT
4.15PM WHEN THE GAME WAS ABANDONED.THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER

IT WAS VERY LATE WHEN THEY ASKED FOR TRAINED MEDICS AND I AM A MEDICXAL
STUDENT AND I COULD HAVE HELPED. THE ATMOSPHERE WAS VERY TENSE. THE
INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICERS SEEMED TO BE DOING A GOOD JOB, BUT THERE WAS NO
ORGANISATION. IT WAS EVERYMAN FOR HIMSELF. ALSO THE AMBULANCE TOOK A LONG

THERE WAS ALREADY A SMALL OVERSPILL ONTO THE PITCH. AS YOU LOOKED ROUND YOU
COULD SEE THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THERE. I STAYED AT THE

VERY BAD ORGANISATION - I DIDN/T EVEN SEE A STEWARD. WHEN WE GOT INTO GROUND
AT 1PM WE COULD GO ANYWHERE TO STAND BUT WE WENT TOWARDS THE BACK. BY 2PM IT
WAS PACKED. WHEN THE PROBLEMS STARTED LATER THE POLICE ON THE TERRACE WERE
GREAT HELPING BUT OTHERS COMING IN AFTER DIDN'T SEEM TO DO ANYTHING. I WAS
WITH MY BOYFRIEND                                                  AND TWO
OTHERS - I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEIR NAMES

INFO      »  I ARRIVED AT THE GROUND AT A QUARTER PAST ONE AND THE ENTRY TO
    #        THE GROUND WAS EASY WITH NO QUEUES, BUT AS I WENT INTO THE GROUND
             EVEN AT THAT EARLY STAGE THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE BEHIND THE
             GOAL SO I DELIBERATELY WENT TO THE FAR END OF THE PENS AND ONTO
             THE EMBANKMENT. I WAS STANDING THERE FROM TWENTYFIVE PAST ONE. I
             STAYED THERE UNTIL THE GROUND CLEARED AFTER THE DISASTER.

I'VE BEEN TO THAT GROUND BEFORE ON TWO OCCASIONS, AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS A
GREAT DEAL OF CRUSHING HAPPENS AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END. I USUALLY GET A
STAND TICKET TO AVOID THE CONGESTION, SO THIS TIME I INTENTIONALLY MOVED AWAY
FROM WHERE I KNOW THERE WAS ALWAYS CONGESTION. I COULD SEE THE STADIUM CLOCK
OPPOSITE, AND AT TWO TWENTY THE AREA BEHIND THE GOAL WAS VERY CONGESTED AND
THER WERE ALREADY PEOPLE TRYING TO CLIMB OUT OF THAT AREA. I DON'T KNOW WHY
THEY WEREN'T DIRECTED INTO    THE EMPTY PENS WITH WIDE OPEN SPACES EITHERSIDE
OF THE GOAL, BUT THERE WAS   NO-ONE DIRECTING THE FANS. AT TEN TO THREE,AGAIN
T A SQUASHING WAS APPALLING AND IT SEEMED OBVIOUS TO US THAT THERE WAS A
PKSb LEM AND SURELY THE KICK OFF WOULD BE DELAYED TO THE WIDE OPEN SPACES
STILL EITHER SIDE OF THE GOAL. ALSO AT THAT TIME, A CHAP APPEARED BEHIND ME
AND SAID THAT IT WAS MURDER OUTSIDE AND THERE WERE THOUSANDS STILL WAITING TO
GET IN, AND HE HAD GOT IN WHEN THE GATES OPENED WITHOUT SHOWING HIS TICKET. I
WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE GATE WAS OPENED AT TEN TO THREE, NOT AS WAS SAID
ON THE NEWS. THE MAYHEM WHICH STRATED AT TEN TO THREE JUST GOR PROGRESSIVELY
WORSE. WE WERE QUITE ANGRY WELL BEFORE THE FINAL DISASTER THAT THE GAME WAS
KICKING OFF WITH WHAT WAS A BADLY CONGESTED AREA WHERE NO-ONE WAS DOING
ANYTHING TO GET PEOPLE OUT AND STOP THE BUILD-UP, ALTHOUGH I WASN'T AWARE AT
THAT TIME THAT PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY DYING.

PLAYERS THEN WENT OFF. IWAS NOW OVER TOWARDS THE LEFT HAND SIDE BUT THE MAIN
CRUSH WAS IN THE MIDDLE. I DID NOT SEE ANY STEWARDS WHAT SO EVER. I SAW NO
DIRECTIONAL MARKINGS. I SAW PEOPLE HAVING THEIR CHESTS PUMPS ON THE PITCH.
THE AMBULANCE DID NOT GET THEIR QUICK ENOUGH. MY MAIN POINT IS THAT
ORGANISATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER OUTSIDE. IF QUEUS WOULD HAVE
BEEN FORMED THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SO BAD.

I WAS WITH MY SON AGED 12 YRS                        WHO LIVES WITH ME

IT WAS SO ORDERLY LAST YEAR, WHICH WAS WHY I TOOK MY SON WITH ME.
LAST YEAR THE POLICE SEARCHED EVERYBODY FOR ALCOHOL ETC, THIS YEAR IT WAS
TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE - THE ENTRANCE IS WEDGED SHAPED AND THERE WAS NO QUEUEING
TO THE TURNSTILES, JUST PEOPLE PUSHING FORWARD - BY 2.45 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
A COUPLE OF THOUSAND PEOPLE TRYING TO GET. THERE WAS ONLY ONE POLICE OFFICER
AT EACH AT EACH TURNSTILE, AND THEY APPEARED TO BE IN SOME DANGER THEMSELVES
FROM BEING PUSHED WITH THE WEIGHT OF PEOPLE PUSHING FORWARD.
THK CRUSH WAS SO INTENSE I WAS SEPARATED FROM MY SON, I WAS PUSHED THROUGH
T ^ TURNSTILE, AND I SAW MY SON'S HEAD OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILE, THEN HE WAS
PUSHED THROUGH AND WE GOT TOGETHER AGAIN.
WE WENT TO OUT SEATS, AND WERE WITNESSES TO THE INCIDENT IN THE TERRACES
BELOW. I FIRST SAW A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WHO LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE JUST
CLIMBING OVER, I THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH INVASION. I COULDN'T SEE WHAT THE
PROBLEM WAS AT THAT TIME. THEN I SAW A SENIOR POLICE OFFICER, INSPECTOR?,
RUN TOWARDS THE REFEREE, THE GAME STOPPED AND WITHIN THREE OR FOUR MINUTES
THE PITCH WAS COVERED IN PEOPLE. FROM THE LEPPINGS LANE END TO THE MIDDLE OF
THE PITCH THERE MUST HAVE BE 1000 PEOPLE ON THE PITCH - BOTH CASUALTIES BEING
GIVEN FIRST AID AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAD MANAGED TO CLIMB OVER.
THE PA SYSTEM WAS VERY POOR, INFORMATION OF SOME SORT MIGHT HAVE HELPED, BUT
YOU COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING AT ALL.
I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT IN THE WEST STAND SEATED AREA, I SAW PEOPLE LOOTING THE
CAFETERIA - THERE WERE NO STAFF THERE, I PRESUME THEY WERE HELPING - THEY
MUST HAVE BEEN LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS UNDER 20 TO HAVE BEEN IN THAT END. I SAW
6 OR 7 OF THEM.
WE LEFT THEN, AND IT WAS TERRIBLE, ALL THE DEAD PEOPLE WERE THERE, BUT I
RUSHED MY LAD THROUGH QUICKLY.

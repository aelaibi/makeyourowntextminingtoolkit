RE: BRUCE GROBBELAAR'S STATEMENT

I refer to your recent request for certain timings from the match videos of
events referred to in Grobbelaar's statement.

From an examination of the video tapes (Ref. M.A.P. 1 and M.A.P. 7) it
appears that Grobbelaar's statement is both inaccurate and out of sequence with
regard to the following events

       (a)    No corner to Liverpool was forced early.    It was a free kick.

       (b) The two Nottingham Forest corners occurred almost immediately
            after the Liverpool free kick and some three minutes prior to
            Beardsley striking the cross bar.

       (c)    The only throw in to Nottingham Forest occurs at 15.02.28.10 and
               this is in Nottingham Forest's half of the pitch and to the right
               of Grobbelaar's goal. He is probably referring to what would have
               been a throw in at 15.05.20.06 which never took place due to the
               game being stopped.

The actual sequence of the events on video is as follows

Dated 11th May, 1989.



        a professional footballer and goal keeper for Liverpool Gity Football Club.

I have been with Liverpool City Football Club for eight years, prior to that I was

in Vancouver in the North American Soccer League which no longer exists. ' I have

been first team goal keeper for eight years consistently, since the season

1981/1982. My work has made me familiar with Hillsborough Football Stadium at ■ -

Sheffield.

On Saturday 15th April, 1989 I was selected as goal keeper for the team for the

FA. Cup semi-final match against Nottingham Forest that was to take place at

Hillsborough Stadium,; Sheffield.    I travelled to the Stadium with the team in

the team coach under Police escort from our Sheffield hotel. 'We' went'into the

ground past the Kop end -and got out of the coach behind the main stand where        "

the changing areas are.     We went into the dressing room for the team talk and

to be told the team. and. for usual pre-match preparations.' After this "a number

of us went out onto the playing area to get the atmosphere and my recollection

of things at the time was of- a normal cup semi-final build-up.      The atmosphere

was good, I went and waved to some supporters I knew in the West stand and

after signing a few autographs about the tunnel I went into get changed.         I

went out with a number of other players about 14.25 to 14.30 for the first

warm-up.     I stayed out about ten minutes at that time and I noticed then that

the crowd was building up well; the centre section of the Leppings Lane End

terracing was about three-quarters full and that the areas at each end were
 pretty empty; particularly the area away to my right as I looked at Leppings

 Lane that was the l e a s t I S T o f the lot.          I went back in and then about five or

 six minutes before kick-off the whole team went out, me with them, for final

 warm-up to the kick-off.

 I remsnber that I kicked the ball and it went over, missing the goal, into

 Leppings Lane end fences.                I saw^then haw .full it.was. I noticed again how the

 far end sections had plenty of space, especially the one away tojny right as I

 stood and looked at the terraces.                                       ■            ‘

  goal.        Kick-off happened and we got .into our- stride pretty, quickly - we forced a :

 -after that there were shouts and .screams from :the crowd just .behind me, it was •

  different; not the ordinary crowd.noise and I turned around to look. .What

'!Nafl^zed me first, was-the concentration and squash, of fans in'the centre'section,

  the end areas still had plenty of.space.                It was only then I became.conscious

• that the crowd was squashing forward and wasn't.-able to go sideways and that's-

               n o t i c e d   the fencing alongside them holding them in.   I. .   saw fans being

  "niil1ftd' uD into the-stand above, the terraces, I saw fans:climbing over into the

  emtpy areas at the side and J saw fans climbing, out over the .front onto the

  pitch which was particularly difficult because^of the spikes on the top of the                          :

  fencing but they were getting out.

     cleared our'bSTarea and as play was going forward^over the centre line IJieard a

     shout, "Bruce please help" - a desperate shout from a fan squashed up against
  the fencing to the right of my goal as I looked at Leppings Lane terraces.                                                                                                      He

  screamed, "Please get the fucking gate open" - "Help, help".                                                                                               All the people who

  right alongside the fan who had shouted to me and so I shouted to them, "Get the

  gate open".                        I was still trying to concentrate on play and was still having my

  attention taken by what was happening behind me - there were lots of fans on the

  pitch behind the goal area by them too.                                                                                          I called again to the policemen, "Open

^ A s ’^we went off, Graham Kel 1-y•was standing there in the tunnel, -one of-the

   allocations had been wrong and then we went to the dressing rocm.                                                                                                 The referee

   updated us at sane stage, we remained in there for about three-quarters of an

   hour until Mr. Robinson came and told us formally the match was abandoned.                                                                                                     My

   overriding feeling is that the ticket allocation was wrong and that we should

   have been allocated the Kop end, but I feel it was unfair that it was at
*Sheffield anyway having had the identical game at Sheffield last year.    The

venue for replay was at Manchester United.     I wonder why it couldn't have been

there in the first place?     I was in the team the previous year at the

semi-final, to me'as I recall it was such a smooth operation although there was

congestion at the Leppings Lane end then which tells me that the F.A. had got

the allocations wrong then.    The point I am emphasising in making the point

about having the semi-final at Manchester United Ground is the distance of

travel for the fans two years in succession.     last year they had to travel all

the way to Sheffield and Notts..Forest had the. short trip and-the F.A. did the

same this year which I think was unfair.

   cleared our box area and as play was going forward over the centre line I heard a

 screamed, "Please get the fucking gate open" - "Help, help".        All the people who

 corner.   It was a..Nottingham.Forest throw in, ,away-to my left,- the ball was out -

 of play and a fan .came, up to me on the pitch and said "Bruce, they're killing

 us".   I said "Who's killing you", and he .said ."They1re crushing us - our fans".

 I said "go and get, seme help", and then a Policeman came on and spoke-to this

 fan.- I don't know who .the fan was, and then he led him off. • It was about this

..time I saw a policeman running onto the pitch from my right across my box and .to

 -the referee who blew up,, recovered the ball and told all players to clear the

.pitch.~~|l had to go back into the goal to collect my glove bag, I -had to -go          -

 through one large group.of people .to get back to my goal and I saw-distress and

 crying, I didn't concentrate .cn anyone specifically .but I recall people lying on

 the floor and people.doing deep breathing on the ground.        I jogged back, through •

 the. groups of people and.went off the field cf play as directed by the referee.

 As we went off, -Graham Kelly was standing there in the tunnel> one of the, .               r;

 allocations had been wrong and then we went to the dressing room.         The referee

 updated us at sane stage, we remained in there for about three-quarters of an

 hour until Mr. Robinson came and told us formally the match was abandoned.          My

 overriding feeling is that the ticket allocation was wrong and. that, we-should

 have been allocated the Kop end, but I feel it was unfair that it was at
Sheffield anyway having had the identical game at Sheffield last year.      The

venue for replay was at Manchester United.     I wonder why it couldn't have been

there in the first place?     I was in the team the previous year at the

semi-final, to me as I recall it was such a snooth operation although there was

congestion at the Leppings Lane end then which tells me that the F.A. had got

the allocations wrong then.     The point I am emphasising in making the point

about having the semi-final at Manchester United Ground is the distance of

travel for the fans two years in succession.     Last year they had to travel all

the way to Sheffield and: Notts ...Forest .had the short trip and. the F.A. did the

^ame .this year which I. think, was unfair.              ..   ..                      ~

            On Saturday,       15th A p r 11 19S9    (150489)r I was detailed to work in a

            Coaches and private           cars began to arrive from early morning right up'L

            S.30 pm (1430)           in the afternoon.      Generally they were well      behaved?

            displaying high spirits and there was no public order                   problems.

            At 3.05 pm (1505) a call was received to attend the ground "Operation

            Support" and I was transported in transit to the ground.

            We arrived at about 3.30 pm (1530) a large number of emergency

            services vehicles           in Penistone Rd.      We were    instructed to standby.

            We received reports of the incident                   inside and were detailed for

            foot patrol     duties      in Halifax Rd near to C iaywheels Ln.         Our duties

        All   these fans were on the whole very subdued the occasional               fan was

        abusive towards me, apparently blaming the Police for what had

        ha pp en e d.

        I   refrained from comment as we had no information at that time.

        One group of four/five fans approached me and enquired if the local

        pub lie houses were o p e n .      These fans a 1ready s m e 1 1ed s t ro n g1y of dri

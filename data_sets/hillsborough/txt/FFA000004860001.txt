         1.
          ■6       Football        needs a dynamic approach towards r e g e n erating

  its image.          The game enjoys          a vast fund of goodwill.                 ^he p e r i o d

  since     1986 has s e e n mors peopla playing and watching the game.

  A n i n c r e a s e i n the length of suspensions has led to a reduction

  i n p l a y e r m i s c o n d u c t in Ths Football League.                W® must c apitalise

  on this        base i n the wake of Hillsborough,                     Yet again we have b een

  p r o p e l l e d i nto ths national         and international limelight and the

  2.    SEATING A ND FACILITIES



         2. \     Firsts     we need to gat more seats into our major grounds.

  ■The F irst D i v i s i o n is      33% seated.          Experience at Aberdeen and

  O l a s g o w Rangers      has    shown that,      if supporters           are treatsd well,

  ^hs y react well.            Seated customers            are aora safely controlled and

  sha t e n d e n c y to taunt and gesture is gradually lessened.                            Grounds

  b e c o m e b a t t e r places     to visit,       jspectators can stand and watch in

  safety,        but the ratio of seats             to standing a c c o mmodation must be

        2. 2      Saeond,     we need to improve our facilities                     at grou n d s .

 A n u m b e r of our top grounds             must become a ll-seater if we are gver

  again to be able to stage international                          events,

              2. 4     To s u p p l e m e n t thsss existing stadia we need,        however,

                  A.    W o r l d Cup,    w hich requires    a number of all-seatsr

      stadia.



             2,          5    T here are man y clubs that w o u l d welcome         ths opportunity

      of m o v i n g to areas that provide better communications-,                   better

      parking,         perhaps      s h a r e d use of facilities.   Many sp r i n g to mind

      as   candidates-.           The Bristol   clubs,    one of whom has no current

      home,       F u l h a m and Brentford,     Blackburn and Praston,        Bolton and

      Wrexham,         Stoks City        and Port Vale,     Huddersfield Town and

      Halifax,         W a t f o r d and Luton Town,     Enfield and Barnet.



             2.          6    Aa a first phase,        The Football A s s o c iation should look

      a g a i n at     the f e a s i b i l i t y study carried out in 198 3 based on a
■"N
      g r o u nd s h a r i n g    proposal.     The brief*    to provide a modal

      iivulti-purpose,            two-c l u b stadium,    on a green field sits.        Ths

      f i n a n c e would not ne c e s s a r i l y be out of the question,          given

      b i l l i n g partners        from ths areas ox contruction,          property

                      2,        S        Tharg is also the need for ready access                  to expertise in

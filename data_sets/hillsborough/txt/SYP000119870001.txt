              On Saturday,          13th A p r i l , 1989,        I , along with o the i* off i fprsr a tt ended

              the briefing         for the L iv erpool            v Notts Forest          football      m a tc h held at

              Hillsborough,             S heffield.       I was    in S er ge a nt F r a n ce ' s    serial      36, w i t h

              other R o t h e r h a m     officers.        At the    briefing        emphasis was         to be firm

              but      fair w it h the         supporters.

              After      the   b ri ef in g we all a s s e m b l e d at      the     rear of      the s tand          in the

               car park and         Inspector Ellis          told us our duties              in esc or ti ng          the

              Liverpool        special         train of only w h ic h one was a t t e n d in g at W a ds l ey

              Bridge Station.

              The      train was        coming at about          1.50 p.m.     and so we d ec i de d to walk                  the

              short d is tance           to the stat io n and wait at the                 r a i 1w a y s t a t i o n . M At

               this moment        it was about           11.00 a.m.       The weat he r       foi^Une         u imf or year

              was very good and                in itself felt       like a        s u m m e r ’s day w it h    clear        blue

              skies and the             sun shining       down.

              As we made         our way        to the s t at io n we were          passed by L iv e rp o o l

              suppo rt er s      going        in both directions.           A large ma J o tfi ty/        c    yt\e

              were      either    d ri nk i ng       from cans    of beer    or     carrying      packs w it h them.

              At this      time     1 saw no one          drunk    or shouting.

              There were about                five    or six of us stood a ro u nd near              to the s ta t io n

              an d we were        just        talking    in general      about      everything.          Again,,       I saw

football        suppo rt er s        walk in g   up the      road       past W a ds l ey Br id ge a wa y from

H i l l s b o r o u g h and    large     groups       con gr eg at in g    outside       the    industrial

estate outside H a l f o r d ’s store,                   d ri nk in g    from    cans and bottles.                This

flow of people              c on t in u ed for the        next    hour     or so.        I had my own

personal        radio w i t h me and heard for                   someone        to go an d      check       these

large groups           to make        sure every th in g was             in order.

At about        1.30 p.m.           the special         train a r r i v e d with the s u p po r te r s             on.

All    the suppo rt er s            1 saw were well          beha ve d and orderly w he n               1

e sc or t e d them from the              train towards L ep pi n gs Lane                 end of the          ground.

We a r ri v e d outside             the ground at about 2 . SO                 p.m.    and    1 saw    large

groups      of s up po rt er s walk in g aro un d              outside L ep pi ng s L a n e .           A    lot of

the    supporters were               sat on the bridge wall                drinking          from    cans and

bottles.         There were also              large groups          stood on the             pavement       drinking.

I heard        large    groups        of L iverpool         s up po rt er s walk in g         up an d down

saying,.       ’'Any spares          boys?"      This     request was           repeated       by as m an as

five    or six dif fe re nt             groups w al ki ng        up and down the              road.

I tried to move               some    supp or te rs      on but     I got the          reply,       “We are       not

m in er s ."     The time           now was about S . 40          p.m.     and    I could still             see a

steady stream of fans                   coming down thus road.                  1 here was a larg®            build

up at the t ur ns ti le s a nd               I could see horses                going    in to try and stop

the    fans     from pushing.               I heard over my             radio someone a sk i ng             for a

gate    to be opened to               reduce      the    numbers        trying    to get       inside       the

ground.

All    the time        1 was        outside      I could smell           the    stench of       int ox ic at in g

liquor      from all          the    d i sc ar de d   cans on the         road some half             full,    and

bottles        left    littered about             the    place.         Over    the air a g a i n      1 heard

someone        pleading        for    the gate        to be op en ed and the voice was                      gett in g

desperate.            The     next moment         I made my way           to L ep pi ng s Lane         t urn st il es

were    I saw      people w a lk i n g about             dazed and        confused.

I saw one man           coming        out    crying and some on e              shouted at m e , " Y o u       dick
                                                                                                              P AGf:!
                                                                                                              R348

  head you have          caused    this."        I saw other             supporters           trying    to hit.

  P o l i c e m e n outside     the ground and a g a i n              verbal         insults    came    out, such

  as,    "Bloody murde re rs ,          the b l o o d ’s on your             h a n d s . 1’   I saw people

  being    carried out          from Leppings Lane and                   laid         on the terrace at

  the    side of the ground.                 I saw    people       choking and being             sick      and

  people    being       carried out were semi -c on sc io us .                         Iran over        to this

  area and gave a s s i s t a n c e where             I could.           I could         see several bodies

  laid out with b la nk et s            over their          heads.         1 then r ea li se d that           there

  were    dead   people        being    carried out.             At    this moment            in time    I was

  unaware what had gone                off    inside    the ground or                 caused the deaths.

  Again,    fans    very t h re at en in g       came and shouted,                   “You fucking        dick

  heads,    what    good are you out here?"

  An    Inspector       came over and told me and                     other     officers        to k eep    people

  a w a y from the bodies.              Again,       fans     shouted,         "You useless          cunts."       1

  saw L i verpool        fans    trying      to assault Poli ce me n.                   I heard      not h in g over

  the    radio   but h eard a          loudspeaker          a n no u n c e m e n t   asking     for L iverpool

  fans    to move       back.

  After    spending       some    time at the back               of the ground,               1 r e - gr o up e d with

  Inspector Ellis an d went                  back with other             officers         to W a d s l e y B r i dge

  S t a t i o n while    the    special       train was        fi ll ed up wit h s upporters .                   After

  this    I returned       to C l ay w h e e l s L a n e .

HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY: ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

We spoke on 8 July in response of your letter of 7 July asking whether the Home Office
had in its possession any list of material that was submitted to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.
I told you at the time that I was not aware of any list going beyond that set out in
Appendix 1 of the published scrutiny report. My attention has however just been drawn to
the attached list which supplements that published in the report. I hope that this may assist
the proceedings.

Each     fire         tender          in         the    service           carries          cutting                 gear       and       comprisers

Ground        I would            estimate               is    about        10 m i l e s ,            we       were       able       to    t ravel         to

the    ground           direct           and       experienced                 very       little              obstruction                froin t r a f f i c

one    of     the       reasons              why       we    made     such       good          time.               We    arrived          outside          the

We    parked          the       tender            and       made    our        way    on       foot           and       as    a    crew       to    just

He    instructed                Sub-Officer                               to    take       his           crew       to       the    gymnasium             at

the    rear        of      the      North          Stand.           Each        of    our           crew          had    taken          specific

equipment             from       off         the       tender.            I had       taken              an       oxygen          resuscitation

We    then       made        our      way        as     a    crew     through             a main              gate       next       to    the

tunnel        brought            us      out       into       the     ground          and           into          some       enclosed          pens       at

the    front          of     t he     West         S t a n d , we         then       gained              access          to       the    pitch       itself

through          an     open        gate          in    the       fencing.            We       w a 1ked            along          the    pitch       to    th e

firstly        the    position             of    our    tender                when          it    was       parked       on    arrival             and

then    the     route       which          our    crew          took          through             the       ground       to    the

no    one    obviously           injured          or    dead.                 I did          notice          that       some       of    the

fencing        in    pen 4       had       been       ripped             away.              We    walked          through          an    open          gate

in P e n     3 and        onto    the       pitch,          I there                saw       numbers             of    people       lying          on

the    pitch        and    being       attended             to       by       police             and    ambulancemen.                    I don't

know    if a n y      of    these          people       were             de^d          we    just       walked          through          them          as   a

We    arrived        at    the    gymnasium             and          our          crew       went       inside,          I was          then

shouted        from       outside, /             c a n ’t       r e c a l 1 who              b y , it        may       have    been          a

policeman,           he    s a iii vth ey        needed          a       resusc itator                  on       the    pitch.           I then

left    t he    crew       and    walked          back          around             the       North          Stand       and    onto          the

pitch.         I walked          to    around          the       half             way       line       in    front       of    the       North

Stand.         I first          came       across       a       Liverpool                   supporter             lying       on    the          grass,

he    was    a white        man       about       mid       forties,                   he    had       dark       hair,       I can't

remember        what       he    was       wearing.              The          man       was       conscious             and    in a

distressed           state,       he       had    difficulty                      in    breathing                but    no    obvious             other

injuries.            He    was    being          tended          by          two       other          people.           1 then          gave       this

man    oxygen        to    assist          his    breathing.                       I gave             him    my       oxygen       mask          from

the    unit     1 was       carrying             until          an       ambulance                man       took       him    away.

A    short     distance          from       me    was       a    policeman                   tending             to    another          man       lying

on    the    floor.         The       policeman             summoned                   me    over.           The       man    was       in       his

late    teens,        he    had       blonde          short          hair          an$i w a s          wearing          a Liverpool

        short       of    breath.              Again          as     before       I gave              oxygen               which                 revived                 him,

        After       a    short       time       the       youth           got    up a n d            walked            away.

        I    looked       around          on    the       pitch           and    although                 there            were             people                  lying          on

        the       grass    they       were          all       being        attended                 to.          I then              returned                       to    the

        rear       of    the    North          Stand          and        joined      my            crew         in    the       gym.

        The       gymnasium          was       full       of        injured       and              dead         bodies           lying                  on     the        floor.

        Most       injured          who       needed          it     were       being              seen         to    by     ambulancemen                                and

        first       aiders.           We       stood          as     a    crew    in           the    middle               of        the               gym    and         I

        assisted          on    one       occasion             to        carry    an           i-fijured m a n               to       an               ambulance

        outside.           After          a    short          time        we             a         message            to      return                    to    our

        tender.           We    left          the    gym       having           been           of    little            use           as         most          of         the

        We    returned          to    iKeVender                     in L e p p i n g s             Lane         and     remained thereuntil

        being       relieved          at       about          1720        hours.

        When      we     arrived          at    the       scene           all    people              who         were        dead               or        injured                 had

        been       removed          from       the       pens        and       either              were         still        being                     treated            or       the

        were      of     limited          use       as    a    team.            I would              say         that        throughout                         I saw

        I didn't          see       any       abuse       of        any    service                 personnel                by       fans nor was                             I

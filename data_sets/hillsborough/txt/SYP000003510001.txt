                  In rny previous          statement          I have       des cr ib ed    getting    into Pen 3 of       the

                  As we entered           the    right       hand Pen,       pen 3     I was wit h my brother           in law,

                                          and his       two       friends            and

                  H ow e ve r when we e n te re d            the           at about 2 . 40-~2.45 pm 1 was             pushed by

                  the     crowd across          to my       rig        The pen at this          time was      packed.

                  I have ma rk ed a number                    ' on a plan of the L ep pings Lane                terrace       this

                  plan       (txh          ) (B'ef WCE/2)              At    this    time    I was    still   wit h

                                    but bVtTause of the             crush and       the o v er cr ow di ng w i th i n Pe n 3 we

                  had been sep ar at ed from                         and

5ueqp£s       At about j           >!::> pm at   roughly       the    time    the    players    came    out     onto      the
PiAtf.£iS
  O N                   there was a surge               f o rw ar d w i t h i n the    pen.

              I have        d e sc ri be d w i t h i n my     previous       sta te me nt a man being           pushed

              a g ai n st    the    barrier      on the       plan of the          terraces    I have m a rk e d a         *2*.

              This    shows         a position agai ns t a crush barrier,                      the second        set      of the

              barriers         from the      rear      of the t e r r a c e , on the       right    hand s e ct io n as

              you    look at the          pitch,       at a point       near       to the second upright             from the

              fence     between          Pej>tf^2 & 3. This was where               the man was.

              I b egan to J m            pushed up a gai ns t         this barrier and          put my        foot   up

              againaSr it to             stop myself from be i ng crushed on to                   it.         I then

                     ised that           I w ou ld not be able         to hold myself           off and the n ducked

              u n d e r n e a t h this    barrier.

              When    I ducked under             the    barrier       I became       sep ar at ed from

              who    remained on the             far side       of    it.     After    1 had ducked under              the

              barrier         I ended up for a few minu te s at a point                        I have m a r k ed       '3"      on

              the    plan.

              I was     pushed forw ar d by the                crowd and at about 3.1 0             pm I came          to a

              position         I have m a r k ed       ’4'    on the    plan.        At about    this time and

              poXition,          1 tried     to help the h efty ma n                in the white        tee    shirt who            I

              belie\ve died.

              I hav£        des c r i b e d this ma n        in my    previous       statement.

              At    th/is time       I also      pio-ked up the         broken       c r o y i '' ba r of the barrier.

              the ref ore X h r e w       it over       'LHe perimeter         fence    onto the        pitch.       W he n     I

              p i c k e d^/it up it was          not    bent    but    had no upright          sections a t t a c h e d to

              it.

              At    the time        I saw and       picked up the            bar    I did not see the upright

              sections.            Later whe n the           pens    cleared       I saw that one              the   uprights

              bar.

              When     I had been       pushed f o rw ar d          I had not     come    up against       the front

              b arrier at all.            It must        the re fo re    have    broken    prior   to my being

              pushed to this           point.

              I did not         see   it break and          cannot      say what    time    it had broken.           The

              bar     that     I threw over was about 6                 foot    to 8 feet    in length and

              looked      like a s ca f fo l di n g       pole.       It had no a tt a ch m en t s    to    it

              w ha t s oever,     and a p p e a r e d    to have     just      popped out of the       uprights.

              I do not         know the addr es s         of            or                           but    the   phone

Mr. C.F. Bone,
The Hillsborough Scrutiny,
Room 528,
50, Queen Anne’s Gate,
London, SW1H9AT

Dear Mr. Bone,
                                     Hillsborough

Thank you for your letter dated 15th October 1997 with its enclosures.

I have noted the Judge’s comments regarding meeting with the Hillsborough Support
Group and am obliged for these.

I am of course happy to be as helpful as I reasonably can be to the Judge. Please let
me have a note of the topics the Judge would wish to discuss. Please however bear in
mind that I retired as Coroner in 1991, do not live in Sheffield, and also am not
willing to re-immerse myself deeply in Hillsborough. I am also still working and for
these reasons as well as those mentioned in my letter of 26th August 1997 I may not be
able to deal with all aspects that the Judge might wish to raise.

As I am no longer a practising Coroner I think it would be sensible and perhaps helpful
if a representative of the Coroner’s Society accompanied me to the meeting. I have
spoken to Mr. Burgess and he agrees subject to finding a convenient date.

I confirm that I will be quite content to meet at your offices. I would be obliged if you
would arrange the meeting for a Monday as I am usually free on that day. I work on
the other days. Please give me a choice of dates. As the date would also have to fit in
with Mr. Burgess’ commitments could you let him have a list of proposed dates at the
same time so that a convenient date for all may be selected.

I look forward to hearing from you further in due course.

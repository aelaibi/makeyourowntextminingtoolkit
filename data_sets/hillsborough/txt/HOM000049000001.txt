 1                                             Tuesday. 7th October, 1997
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I have read the letter that you
 3         sent me on 27th August.      I have got in mind the points
 4         that you raise in that letter.      First of all is there
 5         anything that you would like to elaborate on in the
 6         letter?     Is there any point that you want to draw to my
 7         attention particularly?
 8   MR.   JONES:    Yes, there is.   As I started off the letter I said
 9         it's difficult to concentrate on solely what you class as
10         new evidence because we think that there has been
11         suppression of evidence rather than look for solely new
12         evidence.     I mean, how can we possibly present new
13         evidence when we have no access whatsoever.         It's only in
14         recent weeks we have been allowed access to statements, in
15         fact, even a copy of my own statement was not forthcoming.
16         So it's not the fact that we are presenting new evidence,
17         we think there has been an absolute suppression of
18         evidence.
19              We think the 3.15 cut-off was a good point on that
20         because when we were at the inquest we tried to raise â€”            I
21         mean you must appreciate there was no visible sign of my
22         son throughout the inquest.       We thought it was possible he
23         may have been a face in the crowd and on the basis of that
24         the sort of transcripts were made for the mini-inquest and
25         to be honest when we have now got a copy of that and we
26         have seen the evidence that was presented in the
27         transcript by the West Midlands police, I mean, the whole
28         thing was a total farce, to be honest.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Let me understand what you are
30         talking about.     Have you now seen a copy of the body file?
31   MRS. JONES:     Yes.
32   MR.   JONES:    We have got a copy of the body file, yes.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       When did you get that?
34   MRS. JONES:     Last week.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I am sorry that you have not had it
36         earlier than that.     Are you in a position, as it were, to


                                         2
 1         identify the points that arise out of that that you want
 2         to make?
 3   MR.   JONES:     Perhaps you better do that.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I hope you bear in mind        I have not
 5         seen the body file.
 6   MRS. JONES:      The body file is here with me at the moment so
 7         everything that I say I can show you proof of.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I will tell you what would be very
 9         helpful, Mrs. Jones, is if when you are making your
10         comments on it you can identify thewitness statement            you
11         are referring to or the page in the body file that you are
12         referring to or whatever it may be.
13   MRS. JONES:       I haven't actually numbered them, so they are not
14         numbered but before we received the body file we'd had
15         communication with the police.        On the day in question my
16         son and his girlfriend were at that match with our
17         youngest daughter, Stephanie, so we did have someone who
18          came home.     Stephanie came home and told us about what
19         happened on the day.
20                  Richard and Tracey both lost their lives and they had
21          attended Sheffield University, Tracey was in her last
22         year, Richard was a chemist and they lived together in'
23          Sheffield.        So the basis of everything that we knew was
24          from our daughter who was a survivor and was with them and
25          was crushed at the time.        So everything that went on from
26          then we learned from her, from her experiences going
27          through Gate C and her trouble arriving.
28                  So none of this that we tell you comes like from what
29          we may have assumed, it comes from somebody very close to
30          us who was there.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Can you pause there for a moment.
32          Did your daughter, Tracey, make a statement to the police?
33   MRS. JONES:       Yes, Stephanie.     Tracey died.   Stephanie made a
34          statement which we have.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          You have that statement?
36   MRS. JONES:       Yes, that was read out at the generic inquest


                                            3
 1       where Stephanie was a witness.       But once they went through
 2       Gate C and she came onto the terraces they got slit up.
 3       It was just that one went that way and one went that way,
 4       it was that her feet did not touch the ground, she was
 5       carried in that like a flow and she turned the other way
 6       round and found herself right at the front of pen 3.
 7             She was being crushed immediately from then on and
 8       she does not even know how she got out, it's as if.
 9       somebody said out of the darkness, "Here, girl", which is
10       a Liverpool expression, "come through here", and she
11       doesn't    even know how   she got out but there was a camera
12       trained    on her as she came out.
13             So   we actually know from Stephanie how she came
14       through    the pens, how   she came through from outside and
15       what happened to her after that.
16             So everything from then on we based on Stephanie and
17       we started to ask for information right from the word go.
18       Right from the mini-inquest we asked the question why
19       Richard, along with the others, never went to hospital.
20        This is well documented and the Coroner said he would try
21        and deal with this at a later date.
22             We raised this at the generic inquest, again it's
23       well documented, about the 3.15 cut-off.       Again, he
24        refused to answer and go past 3.15.      His comments were in
25        an ideal world they would have      all ended up in hospital.
26        That was no good to me.
27             We wrote to the Coroner, my husband wrote during the
28        inquest, which again is well documented, and said
29        irrespective of the outcome of      the inquest we would go     for
30        a judicial review if he didn'tgo past 3.15      because we
31        felt that this was important to us to know what happened
32        to our son.   He refused, again it is documented.
33             It went down to the judicial review.      Again, the same
34        question.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You were one of the 6?
36   MRS. JONES:    I was one of the 6.    Again, the same question was


                                       4
 1        asked, why did my son not go to hospital?       He had no
 2        injuries, he didn't have his head cut off.       He was
 3        just -â€”   he looked â€”   he wasn't even black.
 4             My opinion was that if he had been brought out of the
 5        pen in enough time and put in the recovery position he may
 6        have survived and at least he should have been given the
 7        chance to go to hospital.     That question has never been
 8        answered, I'm asking you now, really, I mean are you going
 9        to answer that question why he never went to hospital?
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Well, no, I am not sure that I can.
11   MRS. JONES:    There was 42 ambulances outside.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     How can I answer the question?
13   MRS. JONES:    It's a fair question to ask though, isn't it?
14   MRS. JONES:    I've been a first aider for 25 years and since 25
15        years ago when I first went to first aid I was taught
16        triage, you know, triage was never brought in, I just
17        can't understand it.     The most seriously injured should
18        have been the first ones in the ambulance and away to
19        hospital.    Out of the 9 6 who died I think there was about
20        13 ever got to hospital, none of the others got to
21        hospital.
22             We're not talking of an accident where there was
23        people lying with their heads cut off and stuff like that.
24        These people were mainly young people who had stopped
25        breathing and it was imperative they were got out of the
26        crowd quickly and taken to hospital.     Not only were they
27        not got out of the crowd quickly, and once again we blame
28        the police for that because if you look at the video
29        evidence they are still evacuating the pens at twenty five
30        to four, they are still bringing people out.
31             We can argue about what time there was a problem in
32        the pens, I mean, it's well known that at half past two
33        there was problems in the pens but if you even take ten to
34        three, according to the evidence given by the fire
35        officer, them pens under the safety certificate were due
36        to be evacuated within 8 minutes, just using the front


                                       5
 1         entrance.     If you had used the tunnels and the side pens
 2         they should have been empty quicker.        Why did it take 35
 3         minutes minimum to clear the pens?     Surely that was a
 4         contributory factor to the amount of people who died.
 5              We have seen pictures of 30 odd or 40 odd ambulances
 6         outside the ground, we hear evidence of the police turning
 7         ambulances away from the gate and refusing to let them in.
 8         We wonder out of all these people, most of them were in
 9         the ideal prime of life to recover, none of them ever got
10         to hospital basically.
11              People were declaring them dead at the ground.
12         People with no medical experience, they were just feeling
13         their pulses and saying they were dead.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The doctors were doing it, were
15        they not?
16   MR.   JONES:     No, they weren't, not initially, they may have
17         done in the gym later on but when they were first brought
18         out there is numerous evidence of policemen, the fans just
19         feeling the pulse and saying they're dead and covering
20         them up.
21   MRS. JONES:      They were putting cardigans over their faces and
22         saying they were dead.
23   MR.   JONES:     There was lines of bodies on the side    ofthe   Don
24         as we read the evidence, sort of lying there.        I'm quite
25         sure doctors had not seen them at that time, they were
26         taken into the mortuary eventually and the doctor
27         certified them dead and it's all things that should have
28         been looked into.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Where was that?
30   MRS. JONES:      By the River Don, on the bank.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      People were evacuated by the South
32         Stand, were they not, by the fire brigade?
33   MR.   JONES:     There was people taken round and putdown, placed
34         and covered up with, you know, whatever was available on
35         the side of the river until they were later taken into
36         mortuary.     Those people should have been away to hospital,


                                         6
 1         there's no doubt about it.
 2              We tried to present evidence from the forensic
 3         pathologist from Liverpool University, Dr. Burns, because
 4         the problem with the pathologist's evidence at the inquest
 5         the sort of scenario that was brought out at the
 6         mini-inquest, which we had no chance to question
 7         whatsoever, at the time we were told it was a possible
 8         criminal prosecution coming up and we were instructed that
 9         there should be no controversial questions.     So we had to
10         let this forensic evidence be given at the mini-inquest.
11         The general trend that come out; they were all dead within
12         a minute, you know.
13              We were assured that later on in the inquest we would
14         be able to bring this up.     When we tried to bring the
15         evidence we were told, sorry, that's after 3.15, you can't
16         have it.
17              We did eventually get a report from Dr. Burns, the
18         forensic pathologist from Liverpool University, I mean you
19         don't have to be an expert, although he is, it's fairly
20         obvious if you've got a crushing incident some of the
21         people will be crushed severely, some people will be
22         crushed less severely and there will be a range of
23         injuries.     He said there was no way you can say they are
24         all dead within 90 minutes.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think that must have been obvious
26         because some people were recovering on the pitch, some
27         people were recovering after resuscitation, some people
28         were recovering in hospital.
29   MRS. JONES:     The Coroner's version was that anybody who
30         suffered those injuries would die then, even if it was
31         brain damage.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      One has to be a little bit careful
33         about that.     What I think he was saying was that if you
34         were crushed continuously for--
35   MR.   JONES:    Who knows?   No evidence was presented to that
36         effect.


                                        7
1    MRS. JONES:      Who was crushed continuously when we have got a
2          movement of crowd, and the video shows this.       My daughter,
3          she was fainting, she was a crushed but the crowd eased
4          off and she got out.     She was faced the opposite way to
5          the pitch, her face was pushed up against a coloured boy,
 6         she could not breath, she     could do nothing and yet the
 7         pressure eased off and, thank God, she survived but three
 8         went into that ground and only one came out, so she was
 9         not lucky.        He was 6 foot, he was highly intelligent.
10         This was a boy who would have done anything for his sister
11         or his girlfriend, but that is probably to you irrelevant,
12         that is just something which is my grief and I have to put
13         up with, but what I don't have to put up with is a system
14         which I totally believed in before, I totally and utterly
15         believed that this system would support me.
16                 I told my daughter when she rang up and she was
17         injured,    "Go back to the football ground, love, tell      a
18         policeman what you've told me and he will help you."             Did
19         they?     No.   I didn't know at that stage that she came out
20         of that pen and a policeman tried to put her -back in
21         again.
22   MR.   JONES:     What we're trying to say is we did have faith in
23         the system.      I mean when West Midlands Police, for
24         instance, I know you've heard criticism of West Midlands
25         Police.     To be honest when West Midlands Police, they were
26         very nice fellows and I no qualms about it.       I didn't
27         believe all they told me to be honest, in fact I knew damn
28         well they were telling me little porkies, but I thought it
29         was for a reason.
30                 We tended to rely on them a bit but later on some of
31         the things that have come up later that we have evidence
32         before is just unbelievable.       For instance, in the initial
33         stages I asked West Midlands Police to find out who the
34         senior officer was who took statements off me in the
35         mortuary on the day.     They went I away and I had to
36         contact them three times, they kept on hedging their bets


                                          8
 1         and then eventually they come back and said:         "Sorry, he
 2         never signed his statement."        This man was totally, I will
 3         just say out of it, for a better word.
 4              I didn't look at the guy because if I'd have looked
 5         at him I'd have killed him, he was infuriating me that
 6         much. He made a statement and the statement, which he
 7         threw at me and told me to sign, was so incomprehensible
 8         there was mistakes on every line.         I kept on having to
 9         give it back to him to change it.        He was saying:   "Just
10         sign it", I said:     "No, I want to check it."      There was
11         mistakes on every line, which he had to initial, of he's a
12         police officer obviously.
13              West Midlands Police came back and said:         "Sorry, he
14         never signed the statement.         Even if you could accept the
15         fact that he never signed the statement there was two
16         young police constables there the whole time, who I also
17         give statements to, who must have known who the senior
18         officer was.     So it wouldn't have been a great deal for
19         them to identify the officer.         They came back and said:
20         "Unfortunately we can't trace him."         I knew in my heart
21         that they weren't telling me the truth.
22              That is the significance of the two statements from
23         the mortuary that I requested and I requested and
24         requested over months and months and now they've come back
25         and said: "The two statements are not in the file" and I
26         just cannot believe it.     The only reason they're not in
27         that file is because that officer did sign his statement
28         and they don't want me to know that they were telling be
29         porkies.     It is as simple as that?
30   MRS. JONES:      I'll clarify that.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We can look for any statements by
32         Mr. Jones.
33   MR.   JONES:     I only made three on the day; one for Tracey, one
34         for Richard.     Tracey wasn't my child but I identified her.
35         One for Richard and the overall statement was given last
36         to the senior officer.


                                           9
1    LORD
2           statements by you?
3    MRS. JONES:       There's one statement and that's the one for
4           Richard.
5    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What about--
 6   MR.    JONES:     Tracey's statement.
 7   MRS. JONES:       We haven't got that.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Have you got Tracey's body file?
 9   MR.    JONES:     No, we couldn't get Tracey's body file but they
10          said it wasn't in Tracey's body file.
11   MRS. JONES:       Tracey's mum and dad must ask for her body file,
12          not us.
13   MR,    JONES:     We asked them to check was it in Tracey's,
14          possibly there was a mix up and it went in Tracey's file
15          because I identified the two bodies and they said:        "No,
16          it's not in Tracey's file."
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Can you make a note of this, Chris.
18          We can check with Tracey's body file whether there is a
19          statement by Mr. Jones.
20   MRS. JONES:       The reason my husband wanted that because we also,
21          doing everything by the book again, we put in police
22          complaints.     We put in four police complaints; one against
23          Peter Wright, who was the Chief Constable of South
24          Yorkshire, one against Marshall, one against Duckenfield
25          and one against Greenwood and the other one we wanted to
26          put a complaint in about the officer in the mortuary, who
27          was absolutely appalling to us, absolutely appalling.         You
28          had to be there.     We'd just identified two bodies and he
29          was â€”      I would say he was drunk but I don't know.
30                  Those three statements and when he asked West
31          Midlands because we wanted to make a complaint about this
32          man they said that that's when the statement wasn't
33          signed.      So we know that they had the statement at that
34          time.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        We will see if we can lay our hands
36          on i t .


                                          10
 1   MRS. JONES:    What we go on from there is and which we think is
 2         new evidence anyway, that these complaints that were made
 3         was a private thing between my husband and I and the
 4         Police Complaints Authority it was read out at the court
 5         when Marshall was giving his evidence, it was in the PACE
 6         statements.   It was as though we were vindictive in
 7         bringing police complaints about this man with an
 8         unblemished character.
 9              This was a private thing between my husband and
10         myself and the Police Complaints.    It had no right in the
11         inquest. It shouldn't have even â€”    The Coroner, who we say
12         was prejudicial, knew about that beforehand because he had
13         access to all statements.    He knew what was in that.    He
14         ruled it out afterwards but he knew what was going ahead
15         and he allowed that.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I think that is a matter which was
17         ;
           â€” was that a matter which was subject to the judicial
18         review?
19   MRS. JONES:    No, it wasn't, we raised the point at the judicial
20         review about the Coroner receiving his salary from
21         Sheffield when that was the complainants but we didn't
22         raise the fact of the PACE statements at that time.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can just I say something which I
24         think may perhaps seem a bit technical to you but I am
25         afraid is the law.     I think I said to you yesterday that I
26         cannot act as a Court of Appeal from the Divisional Court,
27         I am sure you understand that, I may be a member of the
28         Court of Appeal--
29   MR.   JONES:   I asked you question which you never answered.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: But I do not have jurisdiction to
31        hear appeals from the Divisional Court and so I cannot
32         reverse the Divisional Court's findings.     I can only look
33         to see whether there is what in my opinion is fresh
34         evidence which will affect or might affect the decisions
35         of the Divisional Court.
36              Because there was a judicial review proceedings any


                                       11
 1          points of complaint should have been raised at that time
2           and if they were not raised and they were known about then
 3          I am afraid the courts will not subsequently entertain
 4          them, unless it can be shown that there is in this
 5          particular case fresh evidence which bears upon the point.
 6          Do you understand?
 7    MR.   JONES:    I understand.
 8    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It is. a rather technical rule, it
 9          is something which the courts consist of because otherwise
10          litigation never comes to an end because there can always
11          be points that people can bring up which they should have
12          brought up at the time and did not.       I think it may be
13          hard to bear but I think you must accept from me that if
14          there are complaints which could and might have been dealt
15          with at the judicial review then there is nothing much
16          that I can do about that unless I am satisfied that there
17          is fresh evidence which might affect the decision.       Do you
18          understand that?
19'   MR.   JONES:     I understand that, yes.   Could we get back on to
20          the body file.     We said we'd had problems with the body
21          file.    When the body file come through in the last few
22          weeks we assumed the police officer they were talking
23          about, who in the statement said he was with my son for 16
24          hours or more, early in the afternoon until 3 o'clock
25          Sunday morning, was the guy who was there when we
26          identified the body and who took the statement from us.
27          We assumed that was correct.
28                  We didn't really question that but when we got the
29          body file through this guy, who has been with my son all
30          this time, said the only thing he remembers about the body
31          was that he had grey pants on.       My son had blue jeans on.
32          There was no way that he was with my son.       My son was a
33          giant, he could pick me, all up my 18 stone, and
34          immobilise me.     He was built like a brick horse.    You
35          would have spotted him a mile away he was so powerfully
36          built.     The guy never mentions this at all, he says he's


                                         12
 1          got grey pants on and that's the only thing he remembers.
 2          He was obviously not with my son.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Was there a police officer with
 4          your son at the time you were identifying him?
 5   MRS. JONES:       Yes, P.C. Bromley.
 6   MR.    JONES:     We asked who the police officer was and this is
 7          the photograph we got back.
 8   MRS.   JONES: They said that this man        was with our   son in the
 9          temporary mortuary and was with him when we identified.
10          We have no doubt that when we identified Richard the
11          policeman was there but this man we don't think was with
12          him for the whole time.
13   MR.    JONES:     How am I supposed to identify the officer on
14          there, the head is cut off.
15   MRS.   JONES: And how are you supposed to identify          your son?
16   MR.    JONES: We think it might be my son.
17   MRS. JONES:       That photograph is absolutely appalling.       It's on
18          a piece of black polythene and just dumped.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        This, I suspect, is taken from the
20          police video taken in the mortuary.
21   MR.    BONE:    Yes,   it plainly is.
22   MR.    JONES:     Surely the shot taken in the mortuary would be to
23          identify the body or the P.C. who was with the body and it
24          amazes me when I sent it off to find the identification of
25          the officer who was with us and it comes back, he's got no
26          epaulettes on, as we can see, he has got no head.          It's
27          ridiculous.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I am not sure that that was the
29          purpose.     We can look at the video and try to and see.
30   MRS. JONES:       We asked for clarification of the officer, who we
31          don't believe who was with our son.         So we said: can we
32          have a look     at a picture of this officers with     our son and
33          that's what     we get back.     How do I know that's Richard?
34   MR.    JONES:     I basically accept the fact that I think there was
35          a lot sort of tidying up done and I accept a bit of that.
36          I can understand they've got to say: okay, you were with


                                            13
 1         the body at such and such a time and it makes everything
 2         neat and tidy.     I accept that that may have gone on but
 3         there's no way this guy was with my son.
 4   MRS. JONES:      The statement that he signed was witnessed by the
 5         West Midlands Police anyway and it was dated in May.
 6   MR.   JONES:     As I say, we had confidence in the West Midlands
 7         Police.     We thought it's an independent force and
 8         obviously they've been appointed, they're going to a grip
 9         on things.     But later on when we find tapes had gone
10         missing when they were in their control it is just
11         amazing.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That is an important aspect of the
13         case which I am going to--
14   MR.   JONES:     They're in a locked room as I understand it.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I know there are a lot of rumours.
16         I think that I shall get to the bottom of that.
17   MR.   JONES:     There is a statement off one police officer, which
18         I had early on, I can't even identify him, which said that
19         he was instructed by the one of the senior officers at the
20         end of the day to take the tapes to I think it was Neptual
21         Street.     He did take them back and made two copies of each
22         tape.     So even if one tape had gone missing there the
23         other one should be there.
24                 The officer in charge, he was obviously one of the
25         video men who was working the cameras that day, must have
26         put it in his statement that he went back and did the
27         tapes.     Surely if there had have been tapes missing at
28         that time he would have noted it down on his log or
29         whatever or in his statement.     I just find it absolutely
30         amazing.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The question of these video tapes
32         is quite complex but I am looking into it.     I am confident
33         that I shall find out what happened about these tapes and
34         that I shall be able to reach a conclusion about them.        So
35         I do not think I really need to trouble you about that
36         because what you know about it is, if I may say so,


                                        14
1          probably a third-hand, if not fourth-hand.
2    MR.   JONES:   Yes.
3    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    There have been a lot of rumours by
4          flying around about these tapes, many of which are, I have
5          to say, I think unfounded.        But I am confident that I
 6         shall get to the bottom of that problem.
 7   MR.   JONES:   I asked you a question yesterday, and I know it
 8         was stuff from the judicial review, but the judicial
 9         review it didn't surprise me when the Law Lords or the
10         Divisional Court rejected the judicial review.        I expected
11         no less after what we'd been through.        But what amazed me
12         at the judicial review, and I asked you for your comments
13         yesterday and you didn't comment, when written evidence is
14         given, witness statements to the fact that the police have
15         been attempting to coerce witnesses I find it absolutely
16         staggering that the two judges in the case could dismiss
17         it when there was â€”    the West Midlands Police had had
18         ample opportunity, they had had 18 months they'd had the
19         documentation and could have attend to dispute it.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You are talking about Mr. Bruder
21         and Deborah Martin?
22   MR.   JONES:   Yes.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am looking in to that question.
24   MRS. JONES:    That comes from the judicial review.       We are
25         criticising the judge for saying, "Who's to know what to
26         believe?"   This is a system that we are supposed to have
27         total faith in and we go to one of the highest courts in
28         the land and they say, "Who's to know what to believe?'*
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You have to look at the reasoning
30         of the court as to why they said that.
31   MRS. JONES:    I would have expected at least that they would
32         order an inquiry into why it was, I didn't expect them to
33         say, yes, we believe you, or we believe you.        I would have
34         expected an inquiry into it.        If you produce evidence that
35         police officers are coercing witnesses then at least I
36         would have expected them to say we will look into it.


                                        15
 1         That, at the end of the day, is all we ever asked them.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can I assure you that that is one
 3         of the aspects of the matters that I am looking into.
 4   MRS. JONES:    That is part of the judicial review and you are
 5         going to look into that.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     No, I am looking into the question
 7         as to what extent those witnesses were coerced into
 8         changing their evidence.    I regard that as an important
 9         part of what I am doing and I shall be hoping to make
10         findings about that.
11   MRS. JONES:    What credence do you put on the fact that this
12         police constable, whose name is PC Bromley and his
13         statement is in front of me at the moment, his statement
14         is witnessed b y ________ and            was the police
15         officer from the West Midlands who came to my house and he
16         made two statements.    The following one is by John Killock
17         and he was the West Midlands police officer who came to my
18         house and you might say, how do I know this?     Because I
19         still get Christmas cards off these 2 officers.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I have not got the point on this.
21   MR.   JONES:   What we can't understand is, I am in a security
22         job myself, what I can't understand is I'm quite convinced
23         that the police when there is a major incident normally
24         they would be told they have to make a statement before
25         they leave duty.    I can understand because of the major
26         disaster that occurred and the long hours they worked they
27         may have been given leeway to make a statement the next
28         time they were on duty.     I do understand, personally.
29              The other statements we have seen off the police, all
30         the statements we requested off the police are dated June,
31         May and later.     The statements in April are never
32         forthcoming.     I firmly believe that they were instructed
33         to re-do their statements at a later date and the obvious,
34         the best statement would be the one nearest to the date
35         and the April statements have never been forthcoming.        I
36         think that that is disgraceful.


                                       16
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Have you not got any April
 2          statements there?
 3   MRS.   JONES: No.
 4   MR.    JONES: These     May statements    are done by    the West Midlands
 5          police, theyhave    beenwitnessed     by the West       Midlands
 6          police and to me it stinks of a cover-up again.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Can I explain to you how I think
 8          the question of statements were dealt with?
 9   MR.    JONES: Yes.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       The police officers who were
11          involved on the day were told to go away and write out in
12          their own words or type     out in their         own     language what
13          they recalled of the day.     Those statements were then
14          submitted to other police officers in the South Yorkshire
15          police.     In some cases what was thought to be comment,
16          opinion and irrelevant material was cut out.
17   MRS. JONES:       Stuff like--
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Just bear with me.           I have looked
19          at some of those statements.        I propose to look at all of
20          them before I am finished.        I can, I think, say with
21          confidence that the ones that I have looked at the
22          alterations are trivial, with one or two exceptions, where
23          matters of comment and opinion have been cut out.              Opinion
24          and comment is not admissible unless it is from an expert
25          witness.     These were all witnesses of fact.
26                 What I think then happened was that those statements
27          formed the basis of the statements which were taken by the
28          West Midland police and in many cases, of course, they
29          dealt with the whole of the police officer's activity
30          across the board and there may have been a great many
31          things that he did or says he did during the course the
32          day.
33                 What then had to happen was that the West Midlands
34          police had to try and identify a particular police officer
35          who dealt with a particular person and the way they did
36          that was to show them very often pictorial evidence, video


                                         17
 1         evidence and so on, and they asked them to go back and
2          identify where they found people and so on.
 3              So over a course of time you get a series of
 4         statements, probably May, June, and so on, which very
 5         often say, "Further to my statement", of this that and the
 6         other, "I now look at a photograph", whatever it is, "I am
 7         shown and I can identify myself as that police officer
 8         there."
 9   MR.   JONES:     That was normally put on as an addendum on to the
10         original statement.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That is basically the way it
12         worked. I think that it may be that you did not get the â€”
13         I think you should have had the original statements.
14   MR.   JONES:     It was impossible to.get them.
15   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH:   Certainly the body files that I
16         have seen have got the original statements.
17   MRS. JONES:      I've got mine here and it's not the original
18         statement.
19   MR.   JONES:     I think, to be honest, I mean I don't like saying
20         this but I think we can put another aspect on what you
21         have said.     You said that they were given them to take out
22         personal comments and stuff like that, I can show you
23         later statements of police officers with loads of personal
24         comment in that was not taken out, so I don't believe
25         that.     What was more to the point I think they were told
26         to make reference, because this was the case at the time,
27         to make reference to anyone they seen drinking alcohol and
28          stuff like that and I think that that is more relevant to
29         the point.
30                  I mean, I know you have might have a different view,
31          I don't know, but that is the other side of the story and
32         that is why I think it's significant that we should be
33          looking at the earlier statements, they are the most
34          accurate.
35   MRS. JONES:      What is more sinister than a police officer saying
36          it was a ticketless fan?      How would he know unless--


                                         18
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Who was a ticketless fan?
 2   MRS. JONES:   You will see statements where they said there was
 3        ticketless fans by the bridge.     How will they know?     It's
 4        all supposition, it's opinion, isn't it?
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Yes, I suppose it may be.    I think
 6        there was a great deal of evidence from various people
 7        that there were people that were asking for tickets.
 8   MRS. JONES:   There always is at football matches, you are naive
 9        if you think otherwise.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Of course.
11   MRS. JONES:   There was how many people thousand at that match?
12        You have my son's â€”     you know how much he drunk.     I've had
13        three children that were all working, one's a biologist,
14        one's a chemist, the other works for solicitor.       My
15        husband and I both work, we're a hard working family, you
16        know, I've got nothing to hide.        If the fans had had any
17        part in my son's death I would be standing there and I
18        would be saying so.     But what I don't like is people from
19        the very beginning telling me lies about my son and
20        treating me as though I'm an absolute idiot.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can I say something about this and
22        it is really also relevant to what happened yesterday and
23        the unfortunate remark that I made to Mr. Hammond.         The
24        position is this, I tried make this clear yesterday and I
25        already made it clear when I saw the legal representatives
26        last week.   Lord Justice Taylor was confronted with a
27        serious issue, a controversial issue as to why the police
28        lost control of the crowd outside.        The police version, as
29        you know, was that people arrived late, a lot of them were
30        the worse for drink, they were determined to get into the
31        ground at any price, a lot of them without tickets, et
32        cetera, et cetera.
33             The alternative view which was put forward by the
34        supporters was that there was a failure of proper
35        policing.    That issue was resolved by Lord Justice Taylor
36        in favour of the Liverpool supporters.


                                       19
 1   MR.   JONES:     Rightly so.
2    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Iagree.
 3   MR.   JONES:     I have got loads     of fans statements.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Please let me carry on because this
 5         is quite important, it actually bears upon the suggestions
 6         that I am biased.        That issue was resolved by Lord Justice
 7         Taylor and I do not propose to attempt to review that
 8         decision.      So far as I am concerned it was properly
 9         supported by evidence that was given to Lord Justice
10         Taylor.      I have read all the evidence that was given at
11         his inquiry.     No one has, so far, suggested to me that
12         that issue ought to be re-opened at all.
13                  Therefore, in so far as I have made up my mind about
14         anything I have made up my mind not against the Liverpool
15         fans on that point but in their favour.          Namely, that that
16         finding of Lord Justice Taylor is not to be disturbed.
17                  The fresh evidence, or what is said to be fresh
18         evidence which I have been invited to look at, has got
19         nothing whatever to do with          what happened outside the
20         ground before 3 o'clock.         I have heard nothingabout       that
21         all.
22                  If the inquest were re-opened it may be that there
23         would be other evidence about that.          I am anxious that
24         that should not happen.        I am anxious that that issue
25          should be resolved, as it has been, by Lord Justice Taylor
26          and that nobody should question it.          I certainly do not
27          question it and so far from being prejudiced against the
28          Liverpool families on that particular point I accept what
29          is said by Lord Justice Taylor and I have made up my mind,
30          at any rate at the moment in the absence of any other
31          evidence being put before me, that that finding stands.
32                  As I have pointed out the only evidence that I am
33          looking at is what happened within the ground, namely the
34          video evidence, which may be very important, and the
35          problems which arise on tracing the deceased from A to B,
36          where they were dealt with and so on.          That has got


                                           20
 1         nothing to do with why the police lost control outside the
 2         ground.    That is a closed issue as far as I am concerned.
 3   MRS. JONES:     You could even narrow the gap further than that
 4         and say when the officer in charge that day gave the order
 5         to open the gates and there was a delay in that, as you
 6         already know, if he'd had a little bit of thought behind
 7         him and placed 2 police officers on the tunnel that would
 8         have stopped any of this happening and that point alone
 9         should have warranted a manslaughter charge.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is the crux of the case.
11   MR.   JONES:    Can I bring up on Taylor, I think you obviously
12         know we accept Taylor to a large extent but I don't know
13         what Mr. Taylor's remit was but-â€”
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It was a very wide remit.
15   MR.   JONES:    The problem on the 3.15 cut-off, although the
16         Coroner refused to accept anything basically to do with
17         Taylor, he didn't want Taylor involved in the inquest, the
18         problem with the 3.15 cut-off, I think Taylor's remit was
19         to find what caused the disaster.    He found quite quickly
20         that the police were lacking control.
21              The time after 3.15 where you got to whether the
22         medical services â€”    I think he skimped over it.    I know he
23         says in his report that he accepts the fact that there was
24         no criticism of the rescue services, except from a couple
25         of doctors and stuff like that.
26              I d o n't know whether you have got a copy of the
27         Hillsborough medics report, which was sent to the Home
28         Secretary, it was in the judicial review as well.      They
29         did make severe criticisms of the medical facilities and
30         stuff like that, but, I mean, I can understand Taylor's
31         remit was to find out what caused the disaster and as part
32         of the medical rescue that was not part of what caused the
33         disaster and maybe his remit was a bit tight, I don't
34         know, but it presents problems for us.
35              We really, firmly, and I have always believed from
36         day one, and I have always been questioning from the


                                       21
 1        mini-inquests that what happened after 3.15 was a further
2         disaster and it definitely, without a shadow of a doubt,
3         had an effect on the amount of people that were killed at
 4        Hillsborough and Taylor and in a way blocked that because
5         the Coroner rightly said, you know, he didn't want to go
 6        pass 3.15, they were all dead at that time and Taylor
 7        supported that in a way.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: He did not say that.
 9   MR.  JONES: Well, he said--
10   MRS. JONES:   That you'd sustained your injuries at that time--
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I think we are going to break off
12        very soon.
13   MRS. JONES:   We haven't raised any new evidence for you, is
14        that what you are saying?     I'd like us to be honest here.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    That may be so but I am obviously
16        going to investigate what you have told me.        I shall look
17        into these complaints that you make about the police files
18        and so on.
19   MRS. JONES:   How about the PACE statements being brought up at
20        the inquest?     That was not raised at the judicial review,
21        are you going to look into that?
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Which?
23   MRS. JONES: The PACE statements on Marshall where he talks
24        about the poll-tax riots and he brings up the police
25        complaints.     Are you going to look into that?
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     No, I do not think so.
27   MRS. JONES:   Why?    It wasn't in the judicial review.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is a complaint about the
29        conduct of the inquest by the Coroner.     It does not depend
30        on fresh evidence.     It was a complaint which could have
31        been made at the judicial review if it was thought there
32        was any substance in it and if it was not made then, for
33        the reasons that I sought to explain to you earlier, no
34        court will entertain that kind of submission now.
35             I think you have to realise that if I think there is
36        fresh evidence which bears upon the inquest verdict I will


                                       22
 1          have to recommend the Attorney-General to apply to the
 2          Divisional Court to set aside the inquest verdict.        That
 3          is the machinery which will take place.       It is not for me-
 4
 5   MR S . JONES:   Don't you think if the jury, which took a long
 6          time reaching their verdict and it wasn't a majority
 7          verdict, it was--
 8   MR.    BONE:    It was 9 to 2.
 9   MRS.   JONES:   Yes, it was 9 to 2.       Don't you think if they'd
10          have heard what had happened       after 3.15 there would have
11          been a different picture anyway?
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I do not know.
13   MRS. JONES:     It's all submission anyway, but surely they should
14          have been allowed to hear.        I've asked you the question
15          why didn't my son go to hospital.        It's irrelevant to you
16          but i t 's not to m e .
17   MR.    JONES:   It's very important.
18   MRS. JONES:     It's very important.      Why were declared dead at a
19          football ground?
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I did not say it was irrelevant to
21          me, I said--
22   MRS. JONES:     But it is to you, isn't it?       It's nothing to you.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I said that I do not think we shall
24          be able to discover.
25   MRS. JONES:     Why not?
26   MR.    JONES:    I don't think we will able to discover but the
27          case for it still stands.      Why did all the major injured
28          remain at the ground?     It was fairly    obvious to anybody
29          with any sense they should have been       away first in the
30          ambulances. I appreciate that there was a good deal of
31          panic at the time but there was ambulances standing
32          outside the ground. There was loads of people injured
33          inside, surely some of the major â€”        we were talking 13 out
34          of 96.    I mean it just beggars belief to be honest.
35   MRS. JONES:      Somebody played God on that day with by son's life
36          and I want to know who and I won't get any peace until I


                                         23
 1         find out.     Because at the inquest they raised a point in
 2         which he      said, and it was a pathologist, that without a
 3         cardiogram you could not tell in a crushing incident by
 4         the pulse alone, you had to put a cardiogram on him and
 5         none of those were given that chance, and my son â€”           even
 6         if one had been saved by going to hospital.
 7               The     other day there was a train crash and what did
 8         they do?      They had helicopters and air lifted them out.
 9         They didn't even get a chance to see a paramedic at
10         Hillsborough.     They sent the dogs.   "Oh yes, we'll have
11         some dogs in, there might be a riot here.         Let's forget
12         about the dead."
13               We didn't receive any compensation.     There was no
14         compensation.     The police put out that the families
15         received loads of money.      There was no compensation.
16         Richard had independence, he was working.         All we received
17         was           for funeral expenses.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Did you not make a claim for
19        bereavement?
20   MRS. JONES: How could you?        They wouldn't even explain what
21         they were giving us the one
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That is a matter between and your
23         lawyers.
24   MR.   JONES:      In actual fact it's cost us thousands ofpounds.
25   MRS. JONES:       It's law, isn't it?
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I am sorry, I cannot really help
27         about that, you should have I think had damages for
28         bereavement.
29   MRS. JONES:       The law is .if that you are over 18 and you have no
30         dependants there is no chance of getting it.        Mrs.
31         Thatcher changed that law and it was changed in,           I don't
32         know when but it was a recent law.       So the majority of
33         people at Hillsborough were in that category, they were
34         over 18.      I hope you find what you're looking for.       We
35         think there's enough to grant it.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Thank you very much.

     1   MR.   JONES:   Thanks for hearing us anyway.

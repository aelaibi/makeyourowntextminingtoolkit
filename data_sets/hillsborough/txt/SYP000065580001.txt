pulled up and              unloaded       both of our              patients.          'ihere was        staff

there      ready to take            the       patients.            A doctor a s s e s s e d       injuries

and we took           both     patients         into     the       r e s u s c i t a t i o n area where         the

doctor         had told      us to go.           1 had        no     idea what        h a p p e n e d to the         17

a description              of the       condi t i on of each of the                   patients         to

the    doctor       in resuscitation.                   We    u n l oaded      the    patients

onto     resuscitation             trolleys        and then          took      our own trolleys                back

to the ambulance,,                 We    could hear           control         sending       other

“It was obvious that the game had started when there was one particular loud roar from inside the
ground, there was a big surge forward towards the turnstiles” (P.208) changed to “there was one
particular loud roar from inside the ground which caused the crowd to push even harder which could
have been when the teams came onto the pitch at 14.54".(p.215)

  distance          to go as       such ad v i c e was            disregarded.              I remember          one                 ie

  particular            request       for d i r e c t i o n s     to G r e n o s i d e    Working        Mens       Club,           Ly

  which      is all        of two m iles           away,     they      still      set     off walking.

  Just     prior        to the     special         trains a r r i v a l       at a b o u t     13.50 hours            I heard

       report      of a d i s t u r b a n c e      in a T r a d i n g E s t a t e        off H a l i f a x R o a d just

 a bove     our      location.            I attended with other                   officers         and    saw that a

 gr^s^d^ar^ea              in the       v i c i n i t y of G a t e w a y s    Supermarket           was. crowded with

 L iverpool          supporters          d r i n k i ng from       cans a n d     b o t t l e s.      T here     was    no

 disorderly behaviour                    and we were            told    to    resume.         I o nly got           to the

 entrance          of     the T r a d i n g E s t a t e area        but      that mus t       have       contained          in

 excess       of     1,000 f o o tball          s u p p o r t e r s all      sitting       drinking.            The

 special        train a r r i v e d        just a f t e r       1400 hours        a n d we were          told that           in

 fact     it c o n tained o n l y 440 L i v e r p o o l                supporters.            As they       left the

 t rain we m a r s h a l l e d        t h e m as     per    instructions,                the first       thing        that

 struck me was that                 t here were          none of        the    usual       (idiots)       among        them.

 They were all              decent       orderly       people,         who    seemed       s u r p r i s e d at the

 amount      of Pol i c e a t t e n t i o n they w ere                 recei v i n g .      As     soon as we got

 them     in a g roup we            b e g a n to e s c o r t t h e m to the S t a d i u m en route th«
in the Lee         side of the m.tal               gate.         I then       b e g a n trying        to prevent

 people      f rom e n t e r i n g    this a r e a but         it was       useless.           A Poll;: L-r.d

Rover arrived and               loud s p e a k e r s     u s e d to try a n d get the                 fans to me

 back     f rom the t u r n s t i l e s .        I saw       I n s p e c t o r E l l i s w i t h a h and held

 loud hailer            get on the        roof     of a L a n d R o v e r         requ e s t i n g   the fans tc

 get    back.       By this       time     it was       obvious           that    the game       had kicked of

 a n d there w a s ' t h T n no         r e asoning w i t h         the     crowd as they            pressed

  f o r w a r d t o w a r d the t u r n s t i l e s .     S u p p o r t e r s w ere      going       under the

  my P o l i c e anorak.             Due to      crowd noise          it^was        very d i f f i c u l t    to pic

   be ca u s e    of the a m o u n t      of    people       using        it just before             kick off.     I

   th e n h e a r d a v o i c e      on the air         saying        •■There's, going to              be a

under      control       by m o u n t e d       officers.

t u r ns ti le s     they s h ou ld use.              They were           running        up to me and showing

supporters approaching                      these     fans      shouting          “Have y o u got any

when a woman            came      back      to me an d        t old me         that     there was        another woman

Leppings        Lane      entrance.             I went       to the       metal       gates at        the N o r t h side

of L e p p i n g s Lane a n d saw a m o u n t e d                 officer         just    outside        the gates,

people from entering this area but it was useless.         A Police Land

Rover arrived and loud speakers used to try and get the fans to move

back from the turnstiles.     I saw Inspector Ellis with a hand held

loud hailer get on the roof of a Land Rover requesting the fans to

get back.     By this time it was obvious that the game had kicked off,

and there was then no reasoning with the crowd as they pressed

forward toward the turnstiles.     Supporters were going under the

bellies of Police horses to get through.         I was in possession of a

personal radio which I had in the top pocket of my tunic underneath

my Police anorak.     Due to crowd noise it was very difficult to pick

up messages.     Only officers working inside the ground had been issued

with ear pieces.     Some of my officers who are Community Constables

with their own radios had extension mikes clipped on the lapels of

their jackets and appeared to have picked up more radio traffic than

I did.   The only messages I can clearly remember hearing was a

request for all traffic to be stopped from entering Leppings Lane

because of the amount of people using it just before kick off.          I
            0
then heard a voice on the air saying "There s going to be a

catastrophe".

I have no knowledge of the gates being opened just a sudden

realisation that the crush had eased.

The Liverpool supporters had obviously been drinking, their mood was

boisterous but reasonably good humoured.

As every Police Officer knows it is difficult to reason with someone

who has been drinking.     There was one particular loud roar from

inside the      ground which" caused the crowd       to push     even   harderwhich

could have      been when the teams came onto        the   pitch at     1451*.

I have never seen mounted officers so helpless in controlling a crowd

 situation,     and on foot we were just useless.

The next message I received on      the radio        was   for   all available

    I went         towa r d s     the front             of the West S t a n d an d              if I ’had felt useless

    o ut s i d e    the     ground,         it was         noth i n g      compared         to what      I was        to

    experien ce.              I a p p r o a c h e d the         central          North      standing     are a of Leppings

    were     pushed         right       up a ga i n s t       the     perimeter          fence.

    At this         stage       there was a b s o l u t e l y n o t h i n g              we    could do to help them.

    There was          noth i n g       they       could doT but             they     expected        us to do

    something.              I have       never          felt as       helpless        in my life.               S ome      of the

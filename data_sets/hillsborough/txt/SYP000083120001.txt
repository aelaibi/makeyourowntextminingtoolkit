             I am a Police Constable serving with the South Yorkshire P o l i c e ,

             presently stationed at Woodseats Police Station,                           Sheffield.

            At 7.50 am <0750)             on Saturday 15th April                1989 <150489),   I arrived at

            Woodseats Police Station in order to commence duty at 8 am                               (0800)   in

             relation to the FA Cup Semi-Final at the Sheffield Wednesday Football

            Ground at Hillsborough.

            A short    time later, along with other officers,                         I was conveyed to the

            Police Driving School                 situated on Brightside Ln, Sheffield,                where we
                                                                                    PAGE      2
                                                                                    S2738

were briefed as to our duties by POL SUPT B R O U G H A M .

I was directed to work a ^traffic            point with POL DC 1364 FEARNEOUGH at

the junction of HalifrdixRd, Penist^ne Rd, Saj^g'^Box Ln and Wheg'l' Ln,
                     *                     [/                J i/
These crossroads are governed by automatic traffic signals and our

duties involved working these         lights manually as the traffic flow

increased along Halifax Rd towards the football ground,                   so avoiding

the build-up of traffic on that             road.     This was to be the route that

the Liverpool supporters were to arrive at the ground.

At about    10 am   ( 1000) , together with POL DC FEARjy(foUGH, I was             conveyed

to the traffic      point.   At this time the Iraff jfc flow was              light and the

traffic    lights were   left to run their normal           sequence.

During the next two hours the traffic flow increased considerably and

we then ’worked'      the traffic    lights manually allowing the flow of

traffic towards the ground to take precedence.

The flow of traffic towards the ground was at its height between noon

(1200) and    1 pm <1300)    that d a y .

On numerous occasions,       POL DC F E AR N EO U GH and I were asked by the

occupants of the vehicles,        who were Liverpool            supporters,   where they

could park their vehicles and where the nearest public houses were.

There were also numerous        passengers seen to be drinking            cans of what

appeared to be beer.

At about 2 pm <1400),        the traffic flow towards the ground decreased

and the automatic traffic, signals were again left to run their normal

sequence,    as we monitored the flow.

At about 3 pm <1500 ) , POL DC FEARNEOUGH and myself were                 collected and

conveyed to Brightside Ln for meal.                 En-route,    we collected other

officers from their traffic points.

Whilst    in the transit,    we heard a radio message to the effect                that an

accident had occurred within the ground and numerous ambulances had

been directed to attend.
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    S273S

         Together with POL      DC FEARNEOUGH,   I alighted the transit and made      my

         way along Penistone Rd Nth towards        its junction with Leppi r/gsLn.        It

         was at this junction that I was instructed to direct ambulances,             by a

         Police    Inspector,
                           which I did so for the next two ho^ijHs. I also tried
                                                             J
         to persuade the Liverpool fans who had left via the Leppings Ln end to

         move off the road as the ambulances approached at high speed.

         Leppings Ln was blocked with Liverpool       fans making their way out of

         the ground,    seriously impeding the route via which the ambulances were

         travelling to the ground.

         As I directed the      ambulances along Leppings Ln and warned the

         pedestrians who were     in the road,   numerous Liverpool    fans who passed

         me were very abusive,     ’blaming the p o l i c e ’ for the incident,   of which

         I knew very little about at this time.        Many of the Liverpool       fans

         making their way out of the ground asked for directions to the buses

         into town and they were directed to Halifax Rd.

         At about 6 pm (18QQ), I attended at Claywheels Ln, S h e f f i e l d , together

         with other officers.      We were   released from further duties and

         returned to Woodseats Police Station where        I b oo ke d- off duty at 7 ptij

         (•1900) that day.



                                                                      Ann Price SIGNED

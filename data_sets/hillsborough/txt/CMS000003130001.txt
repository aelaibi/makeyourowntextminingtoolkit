DEALING WITH DISASTER : HOME OFFICE GUIDANCE
You will recall my letter of 31 August enclosing a copy of
'Dealing with Disaster1 and requesting that comments be sent to
me by 5 November.    This deadline has now passed without any
response from you and I will therefore assume that unless I am
contacted prior to 15 November, you are content with the guidance
as it stands.

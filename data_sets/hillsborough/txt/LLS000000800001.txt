MERESYSIDE WILL SAY AS FOLLCWS:-


I was born on 26th July 1967 I am               of Gary Philip Jones and make
this Statement in connection with his death at the Hilsborough Stadium of 15th
April 1989.




On Sunday 9th April 1989 I travelled from Spain to Toulouse to visit my
Boyfriend who lives in Toulouse and I was in Toulouse on Saturday 15th April.


At about 5.00pm (British time) I was listening to the French news on the radio
and I heard that there had been trouble at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forrest
game and that sane people had died.     I knew that Gary had gone to the game
because my Mother had told me this over the telephone earlier in the week.


I was concerned about the position and I continued to listed to the radio.
After a short while the radio announced that the dead persons were Liverpool
Fans.   I then rang home and spoke to my Father but he did not at that time
have any news about Gary.     I rang back a couple of hours later but there was
still no news of Gary.


I rang again at about 9.00pm British Time and I learnt that my Parents had
travelled over to Sheffield.    One of my aunts spoke to me and told me that
they had had a description of a boy answering Garys description who was
unconsious in Hospital.     I was very worried about what had happened to Gary
and did not sleep at all that night.    The following day a friend came round
and said that a total of 80 people had died at Hilsborough.    I immediately
rang hone again and then learnt that Gary had died.    My parents told me that
they had already made arrangments for me to return home on a flight that day.
I flew home later on that day from Toulouse to Paris and changed planes to
come through to Manchester and I arrived home at about 9.00pm.   I returned to
Spain about two weeks later on 30th April,   j

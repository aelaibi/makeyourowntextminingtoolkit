        was    just a total r^a\s of              people.    We joined the mass           of    people       to

        o bv io u s l y try and get         in.     I was   in the     company of about          eleven other

        falokes and      the    rest   of the       people who had t r avelled up with us had

        gone their       own way.          More   people    joined     in behind us enc o m p a s s i n g          us

        in the     crowd.       I must      have moved two yards            in about     twenty minutes.

        Ev e ryone was      pushing and shoving and                1 noticed there was           no Police          in

        the    crowd or stewards.             I had my hands          held up against my             chest    to

        protect myself,         but    still       I kept getting         pushed and shoved           in the

        chest and back.  In the m a y he m my friends and I got separated.

        At about five to three ^Mq.e crowd was still as intense as before and                                           it

        was at this       time that '^sPoli'b^man opened a concertina gate w hich wai

        si t uated to my left as you                look on at the turnstiles.                 Two   or three

        other Policernen then he'Y'lNgdpush the gate                       fully open and the           people

        including myself          flooded         in through this gate.           The   opening        of this

        gate    eased the       pressure as         it had been getting           so bad that         people were

        very d is t r e s s e d aro u n d me.

        As    I had been standing waiting                 to get    in outside       the turnstiles           I saw

        fans    getting up over the wall and being a s s i s t e d up by a P o l i c e m a n who

        was    standing     on top of the wall,             which was       to the    right of the gate

        that    I went    in.

        Once    through the       c o ncertina gate,         w hich    I entered      through along with

        hundreds      of other      fans,     I went ar o u n d the side and made my way                     to the

       straight        to the e n t r a frs^o f      the North Stand.              I knew where          to go as          I

       went, to the        semi-final        1as^fe-v^year at the same ground.

       As     I climbed the stairs         to the'N/North S t a n d “ I saw one steward at the

       top of the stairs.              I then made my way to my seat which was in line

       w ith the       half way      line and seat          no.   20 something.            It was at          this

       stage     that    I met up with the            rest    of my mates and we all                   sat    in the

       same     area.     The time was         now about          two minutes       past three and the

       m at c h had alre a d y started.

       A few minutes after             this    I saw a young             lad run onto        the    pitch toward;

       the    referee.         A pol i centnan grabbed hold of tK<= ladN^nd                        pulled him

       the goal       ashere I saw that         the    pens were         full   and      people a p p e a r e d to be

       getting        crusnfed.

       I then saw a P o l i c e ma n         run onto the          pitch and up to the              referee and            i'

       was at this stage             tnat   the'Sgame was         stopped.

   Q   over     the    pe^ri meter fence.       I could see policemen and fans pulling

       people     out of^tn>v two           centre    pens and up and over                the   perimeter           fenee

       onto     the    pitch.     I could also         see fans          in the West Stand, leaning                  over

       an d   pulling      fans up and out of the                 terraces.        After     possibly five            or

       ten minutes a few Liverpool                   fans    ran over to the Notts Forest                      end of

       the    ground and they were             pushed back and             prevented from getting                   to the

       Notts Forest         end by a couple           of Policemen.             It was at this           stage that

       more P o li ce me n      came onto      the    pitSch and formed a line across                        the    pitch.

       Fans a lr e a d y on the        p i^TeTfN^h e n starred           to pull    down the a d v e r t i s i n g

            a r d i n g s and take    them to behl’nd the Liverpool                   goal.        It was at         this

       stage as fans           ran back and forth across                  the   pitch     carrying       dead and

       injured        people    on these      hoardings       that       I realised the horrific                   extent

       of the happenings             behind the goal.

            About      twenty minutes           after    this a mbulances             started        to arrive         on the

            the    coach.          I then   returned home along with everyone                           else who        had

            tra v e l l e d up on the         coach.

            and    the      injuries     that    I received were obv i o u s l y due to being                          pushed

            and jostled whilst wait i n g                outside       the turnstiles.

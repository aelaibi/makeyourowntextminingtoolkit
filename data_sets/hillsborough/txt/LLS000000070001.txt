                     SUGGESTIONS/SUBMISSIONS OF STEPHEN JONES

                                             OF

                             II               PRESTON . LANCS,



1_.______ GROUND SAFETY - All perimeter fencing should be removed before the
start of the next football season.      Also partioning fences which sub divide
enclosures in to small pens.      There is no doubt in my mind that the layout
of the Leppings Lane end contributed to the high death toll.       Had we been
able to spread out we could have accommodated those coming in late.       Please
note also that any terrace which is entered from the rear is a potential death
trap.   More and better club stewarding is required.      I saw none atHillsborough
and consequently my wife and I went on to a part of the terrace which later
became overloaded while adjacent pens were unfilled.       S.W.F.C. had no regard
for the safety of spectators and as such should be prosecuted to extinction.


2 .______ CHOICE OF VENUE - The criteria by which venues are chosen for the
semi final of the F.A. cup should not be influenced by club Chairmen having
friends at Lancaster Gate.    They should include the ground being up to safety
standard, geographically suitable for both clubs, and those responsible for
policing the event having the experience of controlling big crowds.       Hillsborough
met none of these.    Old Trafford was a much more suitable location.     It is
a pity it took 95 deaths for those in authority to see it.


3j______ TICKET ALLOCATION - In future the majority of tickets should go to
the club with the highest average home gate. L.F.C.'s allocation would only
cover their season ticket holders and so it obvious a large number of ticketless
fans travelled on the day adding to the confusion and crush outside Gate C.
Also to stop ticketless fans travelling on the day, touting should be illegal
and the streets leading to the ground sealed off.       Anyone wanting access to
the ground should be asked to produce a ticket.       This was the case at the
Parc de Prancs stadium in Paris which I attended a European cup final.       It
can be done here.    I would also recommend that tickets are printed with the
rider that spectators should be in their places at least half an hour before
the kick off.   I wonder how many of those who seem so knowledgeable of events
outside Gate C were swilling beer when respectable fans were in the ground.
  ;------ ALCOHOL - All pubs in the vicinity of the ground should be closed
for the reason mentioned above.    Any alcohol in the possession of fans should
be confiscated.   Any fan arriving at the ground drunk should not be allowed
entry.



i ------ gfgM E N C Y SERVICES - No provision was made by S.W.F.C. for a major
disaster.   How many of our people would be here now if immediate medical
attention had been available?   The response of emergency services was slow
and hampered by both the ground's location and Police incompetance in failing
to assess the seriousness of the situation.

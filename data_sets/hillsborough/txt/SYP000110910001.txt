        An   instruction was         given to      clear everyone             from that area,           and the

        m a j o r i t y of the youths were        escorted out of the Leppings                      Lane

        incident     of a p a r t icularly serious          nature           had occurred and           it was

        noted that a lot of the officers                  there        let a lot of the youths                 leave

        the area that woujrd have           been a r r e \ y e d       for    public order         offences

        I was then d i r ected        by PS 2822 K en ne dy            from    *C     Div.    to a c c o m p a n y    him

        and other     officers       into the      refreshment          area at       the    rear of the

        seating area        in the    1st floor      of the West Stand and to try to

        persuade     spectators      who were mill i n g         about,        to    leave the ground and

        go back    to their      respective       transport and do head counts                      to asc e r t a i n

                      spoke    to were     shocked and      readily ag r e e d      to do this.        I remained      in

^      <2>i4' *       company with PC 2 735 Wade whilst                it was ann o u n c e d   that    the game had

o bt     M   ( /? )   been a b an do ne d and for everyone            to   leave    the ground.        The m a j o r i t y of

                      the    people     left   this    part of the,-stand in silence            others     thanked the

                      officers     for their       help w j m s t   one    or two    c 0 TitjU>*fed to be abusive.

                      Once    the stand was        cleared along w i t h PC Wade          I went    into     the seating

                      a re a and with other           officers,     conducted a search for          property with

                      negative      result.

                      I then left        the ground and met          up with the      rest of my serial          outside

                      the Leppings Lane           entrance,    where we were         called     into the main stand

                      for    the de- br i e f .

                      Whilst a w a iting       for a de-brief        I heard an      inspector     say that he had

                      been kicked w h i 1st giving          somebody m outh         to m outh and that another

                      officer     who    had been      checking     for a pulse      had been kicked         in his hand.

             the      PARLIAMENTARY Al-U-EABTY FOOTBALL CQMMLUEE,




    Im proved safety criteria and technology

    2 6 The Football Committee is aware that as a direct result of recommendations of the Taylor
    PAoort the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (The Green Guide) has been amended to
     produce stricter safety measures, particularly with regard to such issues as crowd density on
    u, races. It is clear thattfy adherJn£>to the amended conditions in the new Green Guide,
    terracing at football stadiaQS now^an appreciably safer option than at the time at which Lord
       Justice Taylor was compiling his Report.

        2.9     The Football Committee agrees with this view, and believes that such a considerable
        programme of improvements in ground safety and conditions will undoubtedly lead lo better
        condilions for supporters, and provide an environment within which good behaviour and order
        can flourish. Whilst not in any way falling prey to complacency, the Football Committee
        believes that such improvements in stadia conditions justify a reassessment as io whether the
        full-scale implementation of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations represents the most
        effective and beneficial use of the scarce resources available lo clubs

            4 2 Of particular worry to smaller clubs playing
            supporters paying at the gate on the day of a match. The ICC Report shows that small time
            dubs particularly in the Third and Fourth Division, derive on average more than 60% of their
            receipts a t the gate, resulting in a more difficult cash flow situation, Season ticket sales
            account for an average percentage of 13% and 8% for these two
            result of this is that these 'small' clubs are over-dependent on w e e k -o n -w e e k takings at the
            gate an almost !hand to mouth' existence* ' The Football Committee believes ^ u n d e r
            such circumstances any policy which would force smaller clubs lo increase ticket prices and
            S S lf d e t o         ZcJL           supporter - as would the insistence upon a c o m p u te *
            conversion to all-seated accommodation - would be unwise and possibly fatal for many clubs.




                4.8 The Football Committee supports the view of the Home Affairs Select Committee that a
                ndw formula for policing football matches, based upon varying percentages of a club's gato
                takings, should be introduced. Nevertheless whatever formula is introduced for policing
^ JO            football, the fact remains that clubs ^ re la c b 5 )a substantial and in many cases intolerable
                increase in their bill for policing. The Football Committee believes that the introduction of full
                economic charging - a policy which was not recommended by Lord Justice Taylor, who
                merely argued in his Final Report that police charges should be *realistic* - has made, for
                many dubs, the introduction of all-seated accommodation an unrealistic and inadvisable call
                on scarce resources.

            3 9 This apology notwithstanding, however, it remains the view of the Football Committee that
           fthe determined etforti)of football clubs lo gel to grips wilh the implementation of the Taylor
            Report were severely hampered in this vital early stages by the absence of the FLA lo offer
            guidance lo them. This view was underlined by the findings of a survey of League clubs
            carried out during the summer of 1990 by the Football Committee, which revealed that 66%
            of clubs had been unable to carry out any work during the close season and 86% had no
            plans lo do so during the forthcoming season. One respondent summed up the view of many,
            when he said 'The delay has reduced the impetus of Taylor's recommendationstU.

         3 11 The Football Committee noles the findings of a m^ior survey carried out by the Royal
         Town Planning Institute in May 1991 which identified(34)cases of clubs wishing to move to
         new locations.18 When one considers that since 195^7 there have been only two League
         clubs which have completed moves lo new stadia, the scale of the task facing football is clear.

            6.4        It Is the Football Committee's view that the strict deadlines for conversion lo all-seated
            stadia, that is the start of the 1994/5 season at all malches at grounds in the first and second
            divisions of the Football League, the Premier Division of the Scottish Football League and at
  ^         national stadia, and from the start of the 1999/2000 season at all malches at all other football
            grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 are impossible to meet.
            These proposals should be replaced with (^sym pathetic framework and timescalj? for
            developing modem stadia facilities,                            "       ——                r



            6 .5 A s ^ a rt^ o jth is framework the Football Licensing Authority should be permitted by the
            Secretary of State tcCenter into discusslonj>vith individual clubs as to the most cost-effecth/e
            and realistic way to achicvethe highest possible standards of safe, modem accommodation
            for spectators. Within these discussions, the option of developing upgraded terracing for
            standing supporters should be available, subject to the overriding requirements of safety. ■



            6 6 In the interim the Football Committee believes that for clubs who are willing to specify In
            the terms of their safety certificate that no more than 10,000 spectators are to be admitted to
            the ground, the Government should accept the recommendation of the Home Affairs Select
            Committee Report on ■Policing Football Hooliganism*, that these clubs should be allowed to
            retain some measure <jfsa^5anding accommodation. Furthermore every area of the ground
            should have its own specific crowd limits and should be individually monitored for numbers
            entering that area.

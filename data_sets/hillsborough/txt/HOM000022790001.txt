         WORKING PARTY ON THE GREEN GUIDE - IDENTIFICATION OF AREAS

         POSSIBLY NEEDING IMPROVEMENT



           (Joint Notes from Messrs. Carter and Bush)



           CHAPTER 10 - ROOFED STANDS WITH SEATED ACCOMMODATION



           Preliminary Note         This chapter deals with two matters which are not

           always confined.        The title would best read 'Covered Standing and Seated

           Accommodation'.



           There is also a whole series of paragraphs dealing with temporary stands

           nii-i other structures, which is not within the heading of the chapter,

           T; s subject ought to be placed in a chapter of its own.



           Introductory Paragraph            Pursuing the criticism that both the titif- »>i

           this chapter and the introductory paragraph fail to clarify what exact I*

            is being dealt with, it is suggested that the words "stands are" be

            eleted from the first line of this paragrah and substituted by the worj*

           "covered standing and seated accommodation1'.            In addition, it would be

           helpful to add to this introductory paragraph the following                  "or other

           hazards, bearing in mind that many such spectator areas are located in

           more complex buildings, mixed with other uses and may often be without

           direct access to of from the pitch."



            120.        This is considered superfluous.       Instead, at this point ■’ would ho­

                         useful to have a paragraph emphasising the need for extra at t«i<r i

                         to safety where standing or seated acc^mraodv ’on i s covered ;«.d

                    therefore constitutes a building, which may provide little extra

                    risk in its simplest form, but may provide a much more complicated

                    and difficult to manage situation where the spectator accommodation

                    is part of a building having other uses, either during a certified

                    use or at other times.     Attention should be drawn to the need to

                    ensure co-ordination of safety features and arrangements for the

                    general (week-day) uses with those for the match-day use of the

                    building as a whole*     This aspect of modern stand buildings is

|                   complicated by the fact that different authorities may have

                     statutory control over different activities involved*



          121.      The last sentence is superfluous, and the first part might be

                     better at the start of para. 123.



          *22.       In addition to the cross-referencing given in para. 122, reference

                     to the recommended standards given in 'approved documents' issued

                     in relation to Building Regulations, ought to be made.



          J.23.      The principle of this paragraph is more important than the fixed

                     dimension given for travel distances, and it is suggested the

                     paragraph be rewritten.    It should relate travel distance to the

                     possible hazard, and also clarify that the need is to get the

                     spectator area cleared into protected escape routes within an

                     appropriate travel distance, and not necessarily to an exit from

                     the stand building as a whole.



          128.       This strength requirement is excessive.     3.4kN/m is adequate.       A
                     minimum height ought to be specified, agreeing with Paragraph 78.

               (Joint Notes from Messrs. Carter and Bush)



               CHAPTER 14 - CROWD CONTROL



      i        Introductory paragraph : The whole of this Chapter tends to concentrate on

               the negative side of crowd control, accepting that violence and

               misbehaviour are a natural occurrence.       The latter is possibly only true

               to a very limited extent, and needs to be provided for, but since disotO

               can arise on a larger scale from a lack of effective crowd control, it.

               seems preferable for this chapter to address the subject more

               constructively from a positive stance.       The need to assist and direct

               spectators intelligently and clearly as to their movements, activities

               etc. in sports grounds, ought to be emphasised here as the basic element

               in maintaining good order.      Consequently, this chapter needs fairly

               extensive redrafting to that end*



               202.     This appears to be superfluous and ought to be replaced with a

                        paragraph on the help and direction which ought to be given to

                        spectators as a basic ingredient of crowd controlt both within and

                         immediately outside the ground*    That should include reference to

                         the need for an effective public address system (both within and

                         outwith the ground) and the sectional use of it to address more

                         directly the areas of need*    It should be possible to cut into the

                         whole or any section of the public addreiit ‘-.ystem from both the Club

                         and the Police control points.

                          In this connection, safety announcements are often marred,

                          particularly in an emergency, by a lack of articulation on the part

                          of   those entrusted to make them.     Written forms of safety

                           announcements should be drafted out, agreed and catalogued.            It

                           should be understood which of these will be made by the Club and

                           which may be made by the Police with or without consultation with

                           the Certificate Holder.     Such announcements should be clearly

                           identifiable by bein;     receded with a distinctive tone over the

                           public address system.



                204.       The first part of this paragraph up to the word "safety" in the

                           middle of the sixth line, belongs to the proposed new paragraph

                           The remainder is satisfactory so far as it goes, but having regatd

                           to Recommendation 4 of the Judge’s Interim Report, it ought to

                           include reference to the need for a very clear understanding on

                           division (if any) of authority and responsibility, between the

                           ground management to the Police.



                 20S>.     The principle of this paragraph is         accepted, but a positive

                            attitude by reference to the need to secure effective crowd control,

                            is preferred in the first sentence instead oi the words "countex.

                            potential crowd disorder",



                  206.      This is a subject which has been touched upon at previous working

                            party meetings.   The writers of these notes are in positive

                            disagreement with the concept of sub-dividing spectator enclosures

                            anv more than is necessary to segregate home and away supporters and

                            spectators paying different entrance fees tor the beners,

           207.      This paragraph becomes part- of 206.



           208.      Where home and away crowds are segregated, a stex'ile area is helpful

                      unless a tall imperforate fence, incorporating crush barriefS along

                      its length, which does not obstruct the view of the pitch, is

                      provided.    The last five words of this paragraph should be deleted.

                      In addition, there         Id be some reference to travel arrangements

                      for admittance to the ground.       Also, but possibly in a separate

                      paragraph, adequate sate provision for spectators to queue in an

                      directions) without the danger of crushing from being trapped

                      re-entrant boundaries.

                      carefully.    The paragraph ought to relate the provision of

                      the enclosure concerned.      Wherever possible, evacuation of

                      enclosures by well-distributed exits, having sufficient total width

                      to clear the permitted number of spectators, within a safe period o i

                       time, without using the pitch, should be provided.         This should take

                       into account the realistic possibility oi one or more of those

                       ordinary exits being blocked by the emergency incident.          The

                       evacuation period required should also take realistic account of the

                       hazards likely to arise in the area concerned.          If that provision

                       proves impracticable, then access to the pitch needs to be readily

                       and safely available, simply to the extent of that deficiency.

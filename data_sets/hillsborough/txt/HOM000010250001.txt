                            FIRST AID MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS AT
                        SPORTS GROUNDS: VIEWS OF ST JOHN AMBULANCE


           I thought that you should see a copy of a recent letter which I
           have received from Commander Derek Fenton, together with a copy
           of my reply in which I undertook to draw his concerns to the
           attention of the officials and Ministers directly concerned with
           this matter.

           2.   I realise that you are well aware of the views of St John
                Ambulance on the need for some statutory provision for
                 first-aid medical arrangements at sports grounds.

           3.   In the aftermath of Hillsborough, the political climate for
                 the discussion of these issues has obviously changed
                 drastically.  I would welcome a word with you on your views
                 of how the Home Office should respond to those concerns of
                 St John Ambulance, particularly in the interim period until
                we receive Lord Justice Taylor's report.   There is clearly a
                 risk that if the Government stonewalls completely St John
                Ambulance will find ready listeners amongst the press and
                 the public.

            Co
I was most grateful for your letter of 19 April, in which you
inclosed some very useful background information about first-aid
medical arrangements at sports grounds.      I have read these with
great interest.   Obviously, Lord Justice Taylor will have the
opportunity to consider the provision of first-aid medical
arrangements at sports grounds as part of his enquiry into the
Hillsborough disaster.


I have drawn your points about the possible provision of interim
guidance to the Ministers and officials at the Home Office who
are dealing most closely with this.    In the meantime, I would be
very grateful if you would keep me in touch with the views of St
John Ambulance on this subject.

   To s u m m a r i s e the h i s t o r y and the v a r i o u s d i s c u s s i o n s , the rep ly
   I h ave r e c e i v e d is that the r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for d e t e r m i n i n g the
   level of first aid r e q u i r e m e n t s has b e e n d e l e g a t e d to the local

   p a r t i c u l a r l y s in c e the 1987 Act came into b ei ng , as it gave the

TO:     ALL (XMM^ERS/GOMMISSICNERS



The enclosed up-grading of first aid requirements at major sports grounds was
recommended to the Hone Office in June 1988 but was not implemented.

As a guide it is now recorrmended that direct approach be made by Carmanders/
Caimissioners to all League c'o 'ps


Further consideration has been given to:

(a) SIZE OF ROOM: Minimum size should be                                     -
       200 sq. ft. for grounds with a capacity of 10,000
       250 sq. ft. "      "     "   "    "     " 25,000
       300 sq. ft. "      "     "   "    " above 25,000
       (50 sq. ft. for storage & coats)
        Where there is not direct accessibility to a single roan a second rocm
        must be provided as a permanent first aid post. It is still essential
        that emergency roans be designated and made known to statutory services
        and club officers.

(b) PERSONNEL:     Actual requirements must be left to the discretion of
     Carrnander/CaTmissioner/Surgeon/Mursing Officer of the County. As a guide
     this should be on the basis of 1 per 1,000 (minimum of 2 under this figure)
     up to 10,000 in attendance.
        Above this figure 1 per 2,000 should be generally sufficient.

 (c) EQUIPMENT: The question of equipment, which must and should be provided or
      paid for by the Club should include:-
        Main First Aid Post:
        At least 12 Furley type stretchers
        1 scoop stretcher
        2 carrying chairs
        Trolley stretchers - 2 in situ with screens, plus
                              2 for general use at larger grounds: 1 at smaller grounds
        24 wool blankets
        12 Cellular blankets
        6 Pillows with plastic covers
        Disposable paper sheets
        6 Snatch Bags
        Buckets
        Bowls
        No Smoking signs
        Cupboards for stretchers
                                                                                                     /Ccntd.
                                                              2 -
             Cunboards for blankets
             Cupboards with formica top for dressings etc.
             4/6 Electric Points
             Paoer c u d s and Dispenser
             Paoer towels & Dispenser
             Supply of black plastic bags for normal rubbish
             Supply yellow plastic baqs for medical waste

Neil Thome, Esq., OBE, TD, MP,
House of Commons,
London SWlA OAA


Dear Neil,

Derek Fenton has shown me your letter to him of 5th December
together with the letter to you from Mr. Mason, the Assistant
Private Secretary to Lord Ferrers.   I have the following comments
to make on the penultimate paragraph of Mr. Mason's letterx-

Section 6(2) of the 1975 Act is quite clear in empowering the
Secretary of State to make regulations for safetyaat sports grounds.
Indeed it gives him very wide powers. It reads
  "S6(2) The Secretary of State may by regulations make
   provision for securing satiety at sports frounds."
By the 1988 £S£5XS25) a new section is inserted into the 1975 Act
i.d. 10B. Sub-section 2 of this new section makes it mandatory upon
local authorities to act in accordance with such guidance as the
Secretary of State may give them.    Unfortunately the only guidance
I can find is in the Summary of Management Responsibilities issued
by The Home Office in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds. If
I were still in local government I would interpret this as guidance
within the Act, but I am not sure if a Court would uphold this.
Anyhow, the guidance is minimal in that it says "To provide first
aid facilities and first aid staff".

I enclose a note I prepared for Derek Itat July which may be
helpful.  (You may already have a copy.)

I really do think the Home Secretary is in an exposed position if
there is unfortunately a tragedy at a sports ground and I would
respectfully suggest that Lord Ferrers be asked to look at the
matter again.

Yours sincerely,




Dan Regan

I forwarded your Assistant Private Secretary's letter
of 24th November to Commander Fenton at St John Ambulance
and in reply have received the enclosed letter      dated
11th January from his assistant, Dan Regan.

Is it possible that the Home Office could find itself
in an exposed position in the event of some future
tragedy ?   Perhaps you could ask your officials to give
some positive guidance about this aspect of the matter
as you can see from Derek Fenton's letter of 24th January
and the accompanying     schedule.

I fully accept that the Government does not wish to nanny
local authorities but I am concerned that standards vary
so widely, and many see opportunities to economise in
areas of safety when quite clearly they should not be
allowed to get away with it, particularly as it is usually
the Government which gets the blame when tragedies occur.

     Our Ref:   FFP/88 12/130/1(S)




     Lord Ferrers has asked me to thank you for your letters of 5 and 21 October
     with these from Commander Derek Fenton and Assistant Commander Dan Regan of

•    St John's Ambulance following the meeting about the provision in safety
     certificates for First Aid.

    ^?u_?over^ a               area. We fully took your point about the importance
    of F jrst Aid at major events. We think your main concern was that local
    authorities were not always well informed on First Aid issues and that the
    voluntary sector did not have the resources to help.

    Af.L°r? Ferrers explained, it is the local authorities, not the Home Office,
    which have responsibility for setting the terms and conditions in safety
    certificates. In so doing they have to assess what is reasonable given the
    circumstances of each particular ground.

    General principles for securing safety at sports grounds are set out in the
     Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds'. The advice in the guide, available to
    both management and local authorities, reminds them of the need for first aid
    facilities. In view of your concern we shall include in the Guide information
    on the provision of First Aid facilities, based on that given by St John's.
    The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (1975 Act) and the Fire Safety and
    Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (1987 Act) do not empower us to issue
    mandatory guidelines of the sort suggested in Mr Regan's letter.
    In our latest guidance to local authorities on Part III of the 1987 Act we
    have again referred to First Aid as a reminder to them of its importance. We
    do not believe it would be right for us to go further by attempting to direct
    local authorities on what, after all, is their statutory responsibility.

    Nei1 G Thorne Es a OBF TD MP
SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN FOLLOWING BRADFORD FIRE


1. In view of the first aid facilities at the majority of
   major sports grounds being totally inadequate I forwarded
   suggestions to the Popplewell Committee.     Many of these
   were included in the interim report.

2. Immediately these were published I had a meeting with the
   Chief Licencing Officer and Medical Adviser of the G.L.C.
   and agreed what is generallyknown as 'Para. 26' which was
   intended to be incorporated in all Safety Certificates to
   be issued to major football grounds, rugby, cricket & tennis.

3. This "standard" was accepted by all London Boroughs which
   later became Licencing Authorities.

4. We have kept in close contact with these Licencing Officers
   and many ask for our attendance at Safety Meetings at various
   grounds and also our general advice regarding the requirements
   for particular grounds and occasions.

5. Cambridgeshire, as a result of correspondence and telephone
   calls, are adopting our standards, it being appreciated that
  common sense must always prevail.

6. Although we in London have made considerable progress in the
  last 2 \ years there is still much to be done, e.g.
  Selhurst Park   -   Meeting next week with Chairman, Eon Noades,
                      and Licencing Officer from Croydon concerning
                      larger First Aid Post with better equipment.
  Millwall            Visit next Saturday with Local Authority.
                      Size of First Aid Room reduced despite
                      promotion,

  Brentford           Inadequate First Aid Room.   New room ready
                      next season.
  Arsenal             Rain comes in and inadequate drainage facilities.
                      A visit being arranged with London Borough of
                      Islington.

  Action we Recommend:

  Our prime concern is that patrons who attend functions prescribed
  by the Act do have up to date medical facilities with properly
  trained (HSE standard) first aiders in attendance.         Although the
  Act was intended for protection in case of fire and general
  safety the present day problems of hooliganism give the first
  aiders a major involvement.
                                              ,/Cont......
                         -   2   -



Therefore:-

1. In view of the fact that the standards required around
  the country, including Wales, do not come up to those
  achieved in London we feel that the Home Office should
  favourably considerr-

  a) Could memorandum or regulation be issued to all
      Licencing Authorities stating that all grounds
      which have a licenced capacity of                minimum
      should have a mandatory inclusion in the licence
      (similar to London licences) together with attached
      guidelines as more detailed brief.     Consultation is
      recommended with St. John Ambulance, B.R.C.S, or other
      authorised body providing first aid cover.   For grounds
      subject to Licence under this figure it is still
      important that adequate provision for first aid is
      made, including HSE standard first aiders.   Licenced
      capacity is the criteria not the average weekly
      attendance.



  NOTES;


  ?   Overlapping responsibilities between licencing
      authority and HSE.

  ?   Inclusion of guidance in Part 3.

  ?   Inclusion of guidance in Green Book.

TO: COMMANDER

26th July 1988


FIRST AID & SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS -
SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

There is no direct reference to first aid in the Act, neither’
in the FIRE & SAFETY OF SPORTS ACT 1987.

However, the 1975 Act, Section 2(1) empowers a local authority
to include in a safety certificate such terms as it considers
necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety of the
stadium*

Thus a local authority is responsible for what goes into
a safety certificate BUT

S6(l)Xa) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations
for the procedure for issue ....... of safety certificates
WHILE
S6(2) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations
for the provision of securing safety at sports grounds.

The 1987 Act, S25 deals with enforcement. Under this Section
(10B(2)) local authorities SHALL act in accordance with
such guidance as the Secretary of State gives them.

In the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (which provides
voluntary guidance) , but which is^ guidance issued by the
Home Office, Item X on page 14 - Summary of Management
Responsibilities - states "To provide first aid facilities
and first aid staff".

It can be argued that local authorities are under a legal
 obligation to include in safety certificates for sports
grounds a requirement that first aid facilities and first
aid staff are provided, they can specify further details
but there seems to be no statutory obligation for them to
do so, this I see as a weakness, but it could be covered by
further guidance.

In my opinion first aid has been a minimal consideration in
the legislation and guidance (I know of no Regulations issued),
but it can be argued that it is covered (but covered very deeply
to be unearthed!).      The matter is worthy of clarification
by the Secretary of State.

Dear Commander Fenton

SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

Thank you for your letter of 6 June and enclosure about First Aid facilites
at sports grounds.

The terms and conditions of a safety certificate must, under the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975, be necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety.
This depends on the individual circumstances existing at the sports grounds in
question.  What is a reasonable requirement for one ground may not be right for
another.  It is therefore the local authority, not the Home Office, who
determine (subject to the right of appeal to the courts) what is reasonable
for each individual ground which is to be subject to a safety certificate - for
this reason we cannot provide "standard" terms and conditions which, in some
instances, might not apply at all, or, alternatively, might require substantial
adaption.  We shall however keep in mind your helpful advice for any future
revision of the "Guide to Safety at Sport Grounds" and if lcoal authorities
approach us on the ideal first aid provisions at large sports grounds.

                                                                       Yours sincerely

 SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

Thank you for your letter of 20 April and enclosure addressed to Mr Stevens.  This
has been passed to me for reply as this department has responsibility for the
legislation covering safety at sports grounds.

You may by now be aware of Lord Ferrers' reply to Neil Thomas M P , who wrote to the
Home Office on your behalf in March.  The position is that safety certificates issued
under the safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 are entirely a matter for the local
authority, who must include terms and conditions which are necessary to secure
reasonable safety for spectators.  Local authorities were reminded in 1985 of their
power to include terms and conditions relating to the provision of First
Aid facilities and we shall consider including a further reminder later this year
when we issue guidance on the safety certification of stands under Part III of the
Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987.  The subject of First Aid
is also covered in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds, which gives advice
both to ground management and certificating authorities.

                                                                       Yours sincerely

                                                                         Department

                     29th April 1988




Thank you for your note and for sending me a copy of
your letter of 20th April to Mr Stevens at the
Home Office.

I have now received the enclosed letter dated 20th
April from Lord Ferrers, the Minister of State at
the Home Office.   You will see that he maintains
that it is.unnecessary to amend the 1975 Act and
goes on to say that he thinks it is not necessary
to remind local authorities about the inclusion in
safety certificates of terms and conditions for
adequate First Aid facilities.   However, he then seems
to contradict himself by sayinp- that they will
consider doing so later this year when they issue
guidance on safety certificates for stands under
Part III of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places
of Sport Act 1987.

I wonder whether it would be advisable for St. John
Ambulance to prepare a model programme that they would
like to see implemented by Act of Parliament for
various kinds of public assembly needinp- F.irst Aid
facilities? I could then ask for a meeting for us to
discuss the question with the appropriate Ministers
in the hope that it can be incorporated in some future
legislation.

Best wishes,

Thank you for your letter of 25 March to Douglas Hogg on behalf of Commander Fenton
of 3t John's Ambulance who is concerend about the adequacy of First Aid at football
Srounds outside London. I am replying because the operation of the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) falls within my area of responsibility.

The issue of a safety certificate under the 1975 Act is a matter for the appropriate
local authority.  The terms and conditions of a certificate must be necessary or
expedient in order to secure the reasonable safety of spectators at the ground.

As Commander Fenton already kncws, most, if not all, safety certificates already contair
terms and conditions requiring First Aid facilities.   Our understanding is that the
certificates for the grounds, which are used by both Derby County and Nottingham Forest
include such terms and conditions, but it is for the local authority to determine what
is a reasonable provision.

In response to the Popplewell Inquiry's interim report, we specifically reminded local
authorities to consider the inclusion in safety certificates of terms and conditions
for adequate First Aid facilities.  The need for such a provision was also included in
the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds, which was revised in October 1986 and which was
issued to many football clubs and local authorities.

It is not, therefore, necessary to amend the 1975 Act.  I do not think that it is
necessary to remind local authorities again about the inclusion in safety certificates
of terms and conditions for adequate First Aid facilities.  We shall consider doing so
later this year, when we issue guidance on safety certification of stands under
Part III of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987.

       Dear Mr Regan

       FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987 : FIRST AID
       PROVISION

       Thank you for your letter of 12 January about the provision of
       First Aid facilities.

       As well as amending the Fire Precautions Act 1971, the Fire
       Safety and Safsty of Places of Sport Act also amends the Safety
       of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (which applies to outdoor sports
       grounds) and the entertainment licensing legislation which is to
       apply to indoor premises used for sports entertainments.   For
       outdoor sports grounds the main mechanism for securing safety of
       spectators is the safety certificate issued in respect of a
       designated sports ground.  It is the appropriate local authority
       who are responsible for the issue of such a certificate and for
       the terms and conditions contained within it in order to secure
       reasonable safety for spectators.   Such terms and conditions may
       include provision for First Aid. We plan to introduce a similar
       system of safety certification later this year for stands at
       undesignated sports grounds which are able to hold 500 or more
       spectators under cover. Here again it will be for the local
       authority to determine the terms and conditions which should be
       included in the safety certificate.

       As far as the licensing of indoor sports entertainments is
       concerned, this is also a matter on which the licensing authority
       has discretion and it can set those terms and conditions which it
       considers appropriate to the particular case. Although therefore
       the 1987 Act does not require the provision of first aid
       facilities as a condition of a licence, it does give the local
       authority the power to impose such a condition if it so wishes.

       As you mentioned, it is our intention to let St John Ambulance
       have a copy of our circular on indoor sports licensing when it is
       issued (probably in March this year). That circular will remind
       local authorities that first aid provision is a condition which
       they have the power to impose in suitable cases, but the circular
cannot, of course, be taken as a statement of Government policy
on the provision of first aid: that,like any of the numerous
other conditions to which a licence may lawfully be subject, is a
matter for the discretion of the licensing authority.

I am afraid I am unable to send you a copy of the 1987 Act but
copies are, of course, available from HMSO, price £4.80.

                                             Yours sincerely

PARLIAMENTARY UNDER
SECRETARY OF STATE


Our Ref:   FEP/87 12/233/1 (S)




Thank you for your letter of 8 October.

As you know, Lord Caithness wrote to Hugh Dykes on 30 January in response to
the suggestion from Commander Fenton of St John Ambulance that indoor leisure
centres should be required, as a condition of their licence, to have a
properly equipped and staffed First Aid room.  Lord Caithness concluded that
he did not think it right for this to be a statutory requirement, and that the
licensing conditions should be set by the local authority.  He did add,
however, that he would consider bringing this point to the attention of the
licensing authorities.  I responded in similar vein to your question in the
Commons on 24 July.

We intend to issue a Circular to licensing authorities, copied to others, in
good time for the Commencement date of Part IV of the Fire Safety and Safety
of Places of Sport Act 1987, and have already sent the draft to the local
authority associations for comment.  I think this is the consultation process
to which you refer.  The fraft Circular includes a paragraph reminding local
authorities of their powers to impose conditions on the provision of First Aid
facilities.

I am, of course, very mindful of the great services that St John Ambulance
renders at sporting and other events, but I hope you will not find it amiss if
I say that I do not think it appropriate to include St John Ambulance in the
process of consultation.  It was never our intention that the Government
should determine the conditions and restrictions under which local authorities
should issue a licence.  There is, of course, a statutory duty on the
licensing authority to consult the fire authority and the chief officer of
police, but we have not felt it right to consult even these bodies
separately.  Our view is that local authorities (who have already been
licensing boxing, wrestling and some other indoor sports events for years),
are best placed to judge what conditions should attach to a licence for any
indoor sports entertainment.  Ho doubt in many cases they will require the
provision of First Aid for indoor sporting events, and they may well wish to

discuss the licensing regime with St John Ambulance.  My only point is that I
do not think it would be right for the Government to do this.  I would, of
course, be very happy to add to St John Ambulance to the circulation list for
the Circular when it is issued.

I will write to you separately about the points raised in Commander Fenton's
letter to you of 6 October (your letter to me of 12 October refers).

EDWARD ERNEST STANLEY MacKENZIE                                                                  R 98



Police Constable 1368



At 8.00 a.m. on Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty in uniform at Barnsley

Police Station.

I was briefed by Police Sergeant 2379 Swift who was the Sergeant in charge of my

Serial No.    16. We were informed that our duties would consist of public order

patrols at the Midland Railway Station, Sheffield.                    All officers of Serial 16

then went by transit van to West Bar Police Station, Sheffield for briefing at

9.00 a.m.

We were briefed by Chief Inspector King in West Bar Gym at 9-00 a.m.

Afterwards we were issued radios, one between two officers.                     I was paired up with

Police Constable 2185 Cooper who took charge of the radio.                         We left West Bar

about 9-^0 a.m.     Our Serial arrived on foot at Midland Station at about 9-50 a.m.

There we joined two or three other Serials who were also deployed on public order

duty.   The   instructions      given to us at briefing were to the effect that all

Liverpool    and   Notts    Forest   supporters     would   be     directed     from   the   trains   to

separate ends of the station, where they would board special buses which would

transport them to Hillsborough.             Officers would accompany them on the buses to

the ground and return on the empty bus to repeat the journey.

Our Serial,    however,     did not get involved in this particular duty as we were

instructed    to   take    control   of    the   station   exits    and   try    to establish which

football club supporters were             from their respective clubs.           The senior officer

giving this    instruction was Chief Inspector King who attended at the station

personally.

It was apparent that not many supporters were travelling by rail, either from

Liverpool or Nottingham.

Those   that   did   pass   through    theticket     barriers   were    good   humoured     and coÂ­

operated fairly well with Police instructions and guidance to the relevant buses.

There were some, however,          that avoided stating that they were in Sheffield for

the semi final match.

I did not witness any public order incidents at the railway station.                       I did not

see   anyone   in    a   drunken   state   or   in   possession    of    any offensive      weapons,

prohibited articles or alcohol.

I did not conduct any personal searches of people at that location.

At 2.40 p.m.,       myself and Serial      16 officers     boarded a Sheffield city double

decker bus,    together with other serial officers. We were then instructed to leave

the railway    station and attend at        the Hillsborough Football Ground, again to be

given further instruction.

As we travelled from the railway station through the city and out onto the main

roads towards Hillsborough, traffic was moderate at that time and an odd football

supporter could be seen making his way on foot towards the ground.

I observed a few supporters in possession of cans of beer/lager. They appeared

good humoured.

As we got closer to the ground,            say around the Middlewood Road area, near to

Hammerton Road Police Station,          I saw large groups of supporters,            some of whom

were obviously drunk going towards the ground on foot.

They were walking        on both sides     of Middlewood Road,         some    wandering   into the

roadway. At this point there was quite a heavy traffic build up.                  We moved slowly

towards the ground and turned right into Leppings Lane. As we did so I could see

a large gathering of supporters heading for the ground.

There was a lot of shouting and singing.             It was at this point that the big match
EDWARD ERNEST STANLEY MacKENZIE                           - 3 -                                   R 98

atmosphere became obvious. As we drove towards the ground the driver of the bus

had to take great care as people filled the roadway.

As we neared the Leppings Lane end of the ground, I could see Police Officers on

foot and two mounted officers near to the large blue gate by the Leppings Lane

turnstiles.       There appeared to be hundreds of supporters at that location, all

obviously waiting         to get    inside    the   ground.    There   was   a lot of   shouting,all

supporters      seemed    to be making their way towards that small area outside the

ground.

I remember commenting to a colleague that they would never get that lot in the

ground.

As we passed Leppings Lane we were continually confronted by supporters making

their     way   towards    the     Leppings   Lane    turnstiles.      These   must   have    numbered

thousands by this point and again the driver of our bus had to take great care to

avoid any pedestrians being knocked down.               Some of the fans punched the sides of

the bus, some shouted abuse, others just chanted and sang.

I remember that while on public order duty at the Railway Station,                           all radio

transmissions      appeared      controlled     and    calm.    A   noticeable   change      in   radio

transmissions became apparent from about 2.45 p.m. onwards.

A lot of the transmissions were connected with the situation outside the Leppings

Lane end of the ground as calls for further assistance were made.

I do not recall exactly what was said at that time or by which officer(s).

As we got to the small roundabout at the junction with Penistone Road, I could

still see hundreds of supporters making their way to the Leppings Lane end.

Then we turned right into Penistone Road and right again into the ground by the

North Stand.

There we all entered the gym to await further employment.
EDWARD ERNEST STANLEY MacKENZIE               - 4 -                         R98

After only a couple of minutes or so I remember hearing a radio transmission

requesting any available sergeants to report immediately to a senior officer at

the gym.

I then saw Police Sergeant Swift approach a senior officer and almost immediately

I heard the officer say something like all you lads to the West Stand.

We then walked out of the gym and all our serial walked onto the track in front

of the North Stand.    I could see that the ground was packed with supporters. The

kop was full, as were both North and South Stands.

In front of me I could see that West Stand.      I saw Police Officers lining the

perimeter track. I could not say how many but I was able to see onto the pitch.

At that time the two teams were on the pitch but the match had not started. This

would be about 2.55 p.m.

As I passed the North Stand and turned left to walk towards the West Stand, I

could see a small number of officers stood away from the perimeter fence which

enclosed the standing area beneath the West Stand.

Myself and other members of my serial walked up towards the goal mouth area on

the track.   As I walked in front of the fence, I could see that the supporters

behind it were squashed and packed in like sardines.

The evacuation gates from this area were all closed at this time.

I stopped behind the goal and faced the fans.     With me at that time was Police

Sergeant 2379 Swift,   Police Constable 42 Hooson, Police Constable 3198 Akred.

There were other officers but I cannot recall their names.

I recall saying to Police Sergeant Swift we've got to get these gates open and

let the supporters out.

No instruction was given to open these gates, but it was obviously the correct

course of action, therefore with the above four named officers we opened the gate
EDWARD ERNEST STANLEY MacKENZIE                         - 5 -                          R 98

at CN4.

As I arrived at that location        (CN4) I could hear loud cries to 'get us out'.           I

have never seen as many people       crammed into an area such as that.

I recall seeing a lad of about 8-10 years of age at the very front of the fence

near the wall bottom.      His face was squashed up against the fence.          He could not

move or speak.      A supporter stood directly behind him, spoke to me in a calm but

terrified manner "Get this little lad out."             I appeased him briefly and together,

after talking to the lad and this supporter, we got the boy away from the fence

onto the floor where we managed to wedge him between this man's legs by sitting

on the floor under the metal framework supporting the fence.              I believed he was

at   the   safest   possible   place for   the   time    being.     I then startedto   pull

supporters from the crowd       through the narrow gate at CN4.

The crowd were packed so         tight that we could only get them          out oneat a time.

Some managed to climb on top of their mates and roll over the crowd and fall out

head or feet first.      All the time the crowd were shouting, get us out, tear down

the fence and also abuse towards the police officers.

I also remember some supporters shouting 'stop the game' repeatedly.             It was only

at that time that I realised the game had started.

As I looked into the same crowd I could see people wedged between others who

looked apparently dead.

After a few minutes of working to get people out I recall the first man we got

out who appeared dead. We laid him on the ground behind the goal.             He was a white

man approximately 25 years, 5' 9" - 5' 10", heavy build, tee-shirt, jeans (short

hair).     I assisted two other      officers (names/numbers unknown)in an effort         to

revive him but he looked        dead. First Aid Officers then took over. I returned to

Gate CN4.     Again I assisted officers      Akred, Swift and others. Another youth was
EDWARD ERNEST STANLEY MacKENZIE                           - 6 -                                   R 98

passed through the      gate.     I took this youth ontothe pitch with another               officer.

As we laid him down I saw the ground covered with bodies. All apparently                     dead.

People were walking around crying, screaming, panicking, hysterical.

I remember noticing that this youth had been sick.                   I laid him down and assisted

another officer with mouth to mouth and heart massage.                      We managed to pump more

vomit out of his stomach.          We were assisted a short time later by a civilian who

stated he was a doctor.           I could not feel any pulse on this youth.                I remember

the doctor had sustained a cut to his head as blood was running down his face.

The doctor assisted myself and another man who appeared on the scene. Apparently

this second civilian was also a doctor.

After a few minutes I felt a weak pulse apparent in the youth.                     Heart massage and

mouth to mouth were       continued      and eventually two fire officers appeared with

oxygen equipment.

Other   supporters    came   to    our   aid   and   it   was     decided   that   this   youth    could

possibly be saved.      We then placed him on one of the billboards, ripped away from

the side of the ground by the supporters and others, to be used as a stretcher.

The youth was laid on the board and we carried him towards ambulances which were

stationed in the passageway between the North Stand and Spion Kop.

The youth was there left in the care of the doctors and ambulance staff.                           I can

describe this youth as about 18-20 years,                 white male, 5' 6",        slim, fair hair,

light trousers,      t/shirt.     I then returned         to the West Standand again assisted

colleagues to evacuate supporters.

By the time I returned I would say about a quarter of the pitch was occupied by

dead bodies or persons seriously injured.

I have no idea of any times during this event but when I returned I                           noticed

Police Officers at      the back of the supporters that remained inside the                  standing
EDWARD ERNEST STANLEY MacKENZIE                               - 7 -                                 R 98

area of the West Stand. Gaps began to appear and some supporters were able to

leave as they entered, back through the tunnel from Leppings Lane.

I recall shouting to the supporters, go back, look behind you, you can get out.

But a lot took no notice at all.              They simply panicked and kept pushing forward.

One    supporter was      wedged    between     the   floor    inside   the    standing    area and the

track.     His legs were trapped under the volume of bodies and his torso was half

out of the gateway. Eventually we got him out. All efforts were hampered due to

the fact that the gates were too small in both size and number.                               I saw some

supporters and police officers literally tearing and kicking at a part of this

fence    in order    to   get   a   female      fan   out.     The    fence   wire   eventually    became

detached from its mounting frame and numerous fans clammered to get out.

I never saw the little lad mentioned at the early part of this summary again.                              I

don't know whether he got out or not.                 I was approached by an officer later and

informed    that    the   youth     we   took    to   the     ambulance   had    come     round   and   was

conscious.

I recall seeing a cordon of police officers later spread across the centre of the

pitch.

When the area at the        West Stand had eventually been cleared I noticed all kinds

of personal property        lying around on the floor, shoes,                 coats, scarves, jumpers

etc.     I remember being approached by two supporters while sat on a wall near the

West Stand.    They personally bore no blame on the police.

I recall other incidents involving hysterical supporters screaming at the other

officers on the pitch.          I did not witness any assaults on Police.                  I suffered no

physical injuries.

As I stated earlier         I do not recallparticular times                   in relation to specific

events after entering the ground.

I recall returning with Police Sergeant Swift,            Police Constable Akred,       Police

Constable   Hooson   and   Police   Constable   Cooper   to   the   gym   area   where we were

supplied with a drink.      From there we all went by transit van to Claywheels Lane.

I believe we were then transported to Barnsley Divisional Headquarters where I

retired from duty at 6.30 p.m.

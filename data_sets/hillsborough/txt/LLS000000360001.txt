I attended              the         Liverpool             V Nottingham                   Forest        F .A . C u p         Semi-final          on     Saturday

15th     April          1989 .

I went        with         my       father          Anthony          Barnbrock             Snr     of                                          Liverpool

and    Stephen             Barnbrock                (aged                 also       of                                           Liverpool.

I drove          us     over          in      my    car.

We    eventually                   left       the       car    in    Sheffield             at     about          1.45       pm.

I think          we     parked             about         2 miles          from       the       ground.

All    3 of        us      had       tickets             for       the    same       enclosure            i.e.         Leppings          Lane,       standing:

mine     is      7-56          -    L22.

At    about        2.15pm            the       3 of       us       got    to       the    outside        of       the       Hillsborough             stadium           in     '
                                                                                                                                                                              !
Sheffield.

As    far     as      I can          recall             there       was       only       one     gate/entrance                from       Leppings          Lane

itself        actually               into          the    grounds             of    the    stadium           -    say       wide       enough     to    get      a

car    through.                    The     r°ad         itself       was       packed          with     people.

There       was       no       control             as    such       over       the       movement        of       peoplein             Leppings        Lane      itselJ

other       than        about            50    p.c.s          stopping             people       going        down       side       roads       and     taking           ;

a l c ohol.           However,                the       three       of    us       managed        to    get       through          the    gate       but    we       were

confronted              by         a mass          of people             waiting          to    get     into          the    ground.

^e    could        see         a letter             "b” about             6         inches       high above             one       of   thet u r n s t i l e

entrances               (of         whichl          believe          there          was    about         4 in          total).

Three       of     us      therefore                made       in    the       general          direction              of    turnstile          "b".

We    only       saw       one       "b"       not       2 "b"s          in    entrances.               At       this       point       the    surrounding              '

crowd       was       extremely                tightly             packed.

I was       in     front            of     Stephen            who    was            in    front       o f my      father.

We    were       making             no     progress            t o w a r d the       turnstile           and          Stephen          was    getting         crusheC

between          me     and         my     father.             At    this          point       I was     standing             with       a corragated                Iron

blue     gate         right          next          to    my    left       side       and       about     2 yards             from      the     turnstile             " b ”/

Momentarily                a       small       gap       appeared             and    a male        near          to    me    pressed          against      his        mate

and pu ll ed            Stephen               upwards          .     which          point       the     gap       dissappeared                leaving      Stephen

held     up      in     the         air, b e h i n d          me    with       his       knees     on    my       shoulders            and     the     sheer

pressure           of p e o p l e             keeping          him       in    the       air1.
        ,30/9 /NS T/ SC.
                                   .

within       a      couple         of        minutes             the     3 of       us    managed              to g e t      through          turnstile                   "b"


(at    least          I think               it    was).

The    stub         of      my    ticket              was       collected.

I think          Stephen               and       my    father          gave       the         whole       of    their        tickets            in     - the       pressu!

to    get      in      through              the       turnstile              area.            It    was    about        2.40        pm.

Once     through             the        turnstile                 the^        was        an    open       area     concreted               with        2 caravans              s<

programmes.

At     th is     point           the        area       was        not       packed        but just             people            milling        around.             We    war

a minute              or    two        to    get       our        breath          back.

We      then          saw        a concertina                    gate marked              ’1 ’ o n t h e        diagram opened                   and        about        5 pc

got     through             the        gate       from           the        outside.

Whilst         they         came        through                 about       150     fans       also       got     through            the      same       open       gate

whereupon              2 mounted                 police           stood        at    the       opening           of    the        gate     (and        on     the     outsi

of     it)       to    allow           the       pc's           inside       to s h u t        the       gate.         It    was       open          for a b o u t       30     s

Whilst           watching              this           in    the        shaded area             on    diagram           my    father           spoke         to     a Pc       ne

to     him       and       told        him        about           the       crowd        pressure          outside           the       turnstile.

Th e    PC       said       he     wasn't              moving          because           he'd been               told       to     stay       where         he was.

My          father          suggested                  he       radio for         assistance                     but        he    d i d n ’t h a v e               one!

 At         th is      time        there           were          m a n y (s ay      a b o u t 50) P C ' s         in    the s h a d e d          areabasically

 standing             watching               the       turnstiles.

 People          were        standing                 on    top        of    the t u r n s t i l e s       screaming              about              the c r o w d       press

 on    the       other           side        of       the       turnstiles,               showing          their tickets                 to          t h e P C ’s a n d        as

 to    be      let         in.         The       PC's       were       basically               refusing          entrance              'over         the    top'      3^dic

 react         in     any        way        to    the       information                  they       were       receiving            about        the       crowd         press

 The     3 of          us    walked              down       a tunnel              into        the    standing           area        of     the       stadium.             It       v

 the     normal             extent           of       crowd        pressure              at    this       point.

 We     intended             to w a l k           straight               down       to    the       front       behind           the     goal        and      then       walk

 a l o n g t h e f r o n t to                    the        left       hand       side        where       there        was       lots      of    room.

 H o w e v e r as we w e r e                     walking            down       my    father          noticed           a fence           to     our      left       st oppi)

 us     going          into       the        far           left     hand       side       of       the    standing           area        behind          the       goal.

  (m a r-ked          between           M and              J on     diagram).

 We     then          decided           to       go        to    the     front       and       stay       there        behind          the      goal        because           at

  that       time          there        was        room.            We      did     this       and       got     to    this        destination                at     about

     about       2.50       pm.

     Stephen          stood        right              up    against           the     front         railings           and        my. f a t h e r       and      I were

     standing            about         1 yard              behind        him.

By    this       time       the      Liverpool             team       were       on     the    pitch          and       kicking            int o         the     goal


by    us .
At    this       point        I felt        a push             f r o m .behind a n d              stumbled              sideways           as       did     my      dad.

I c o u l d n ’t t u r n            my    body       to    see       what     was       happening             behind           me.         I was          pressed

against          a lad         in    front        of      me    who    was        inturn          pushed          against           the        front          fence.

I c o u l d n ’t s e e            Steve      at      this        t ime.       I notice             a gate           (marked           *2       on     the      diagram)


There we r e              several         P C ’s w a l k i n g        up     and      down        behind           the       goal.

Peop1e «ere                 screaming           at     t h e m ‘to      open        the       gate.          They        looked           at     us      as     if    we

w e r e n ’t t h e r e         and       basically              ignored       us.

I discovered                 Steven         against             the    fence.           Bruce          Grobbelar               then       collected                a ball

 from       virtually             in     front       of     Steven.              He a p p e a r e d       to       look        at    Steven           and        looked

 shocked.              B. G.      then      started             shouting           at t h e P C ’s           to     open        the gate.

 A blonde             WPC     then       opened           the    gate       in     front          of    me -S t e v e n        got        out       as         d i d my

 father.              About         12   went     through             and    as       I was        about          to    go     through              a male          PC     shut

 the       gate       - reason           unknown           - then         a couple            of       seconds           later       the        same        WPC      pulled

 the       gate       open        again     and        I pushed            2 or       3 kids           through           and    then        as        I was         half     way

 through             the     gate        I got       stuck        there       for       a    few       seconds           and    eventually                    pulled

 myself          through            with     another            blokes        arm       in    so       doing        his       face        was       cut       on     the    fe nc

 I then          helped           the     WPC     pull         people        through           the      gates           and    over        the        top      of     the

 fence.              At     this     time       several           P C ’s w e r e        now       trying           to    pull        people           ou t.          However

  a lot         of     the     P C ’s on        the       walkway           around          the    pitch           at    our        end    were          just        ambling^


     around .

     I went          down    to     the     left       hand       corner           of t h e p i t c h :             S t e v e a n d my' d a d w e r e                 there

     St    Johns       Ambulance            took          Steve       for    treatment              at       the       other        end     of      the        pitch       by

     the    Notts          Forest        fans:         I followed.                I was        with          2 young           kids       (about           10 y e a r s         old

     from       St    Johns         Ambulance             were       trying        to    keep       this        man       on    a    stretcher.

     The    PC'S       were         still       standing             watching           and    in       fact       their        alsatians                 were       snappin;


     at    us    (a b o u t       20).
                                                                                                                                                                                      s



     An    ambulance              then     arrived             and    a PC        told       him       not    to        drive       on     the       pitch!


     I then          went      with       a PC       to    this       end     and       proceeded             to        give    assistance                    and     picking

     up    boards           and     fetching           and       carrying          injured             f ans.           At    this        point          there        was    a

      line      of     PC's       across        the       pitch.            The    tannoy          was       telling           people           to       clear        the

      pitch !

I recall,         falling              over     whilst         carrying             someone       on    boards.                 However        generally

I recall          a pain          in      my    right         arm.         I therefore            continued                carrying          people          on    a

board      and        the    pain         worsened.             I therefore                helped       to          pull    people          over      and     thro

th e    fence         - by     which           time      the    fencing             was    being        cut          open.


I pulled          a gi rl          out       and     tried      to        give      her    the    kiss          of       life    - she       was      dead.

A similar             girl     - presumably                   her    sister          was    lying       by          her    side.

Whilst          all    this       was        going       on    only        a minority            of    P C ’s w e r e           assisting            ( say    1 in


The    younger             PC 1s w e r e        helping         but        the      older    ones,             generally             were    not      - not        ev

The     medical            people         consisted            of    young          kids    from       the          St    Johns       Ambulance.


At     this      point        I was           overcome         by     the      whole       thing,          I started             crying        and     was        sat

to           depressurise              the      stadium          where           people were             packed       in.

It w a s            just       a sea        of people.

opened              to    try       and     filter         people          through           rather           than c ause        a rush.

of           the    situation             or    if    they       did       grasp        what       was    happening             then    they         did       not

positively                    or    at a l l     to    deal       with          the     situation.

v-           I may       have       been       standing          in    front          of     the    barrier          that       I believe            went       dc

Possibly                 the. b a r r i e r      was       not    at       the       required         standard         to       deal    with         the       sit

wide           and       clearly          there       were       not       enough           gates     and/or         the     gates      were         not       wid

enough              to    allow       escape          in    such       situations.

WILL SAY:


I    went      to     the      semi      final     match           between       Liverpool    and          Nottingham      Forest    at

Hillsborough.               I was in the middle section of the Leppings Lane End.                                          I started

off     near     the      back     but      as     time    progressed I was pushed nearer                            to the middle

and by five minutes before kick off I had been pushed right near to the front.

I    was     having       difficulty           breathing,            was    feeling       faint       in    the crush.           I fell

to the floor on top of somebody else.                                     My legs were trapped.               I lost my trainers

as    I scrambled to get away.                        I was eventually pushed towards the side alley-way

and     lifted        over     the       fence     into        a    middle       gang-way.        The        Police    then      lifted

me    onto     the pitch.              I was       sitting on the pitch trying to get my breath back.

I then made my way home.                       My jeans were all ripped.

The next day my neck and ribs were sore and I went to my G.P.                                                   on the following

Monday.         My G.P.           is Dr.                   of                                Liverpool         25.     He diagnosed

internal        bruising.             My    legs      were also very badly                 bruised.           He also said that

I    was     suffering            from      mental       stress.           I had     kept    going          over     the   events    in

my     mind.          I   could       see    the people             on the floor below me                   shouting and         crying

to     get     out.         For    that      first       night        I    was    awake    all    night.        I took      six days

off work        altogether.                I work for a                                                         of

               Liverpool.          My      net     pay    is       £56.00     per    week    but       for     that    week      I only

picked up £26.56.

I went         back       to   the      G.P.     on      the       24th    April,    1989.       He    said     there      was    nothing

he could prescribe for me and it was a question of time.

When I did eventually go back to work I panicked when I got in the crowd

at Central Station after getting off the train. Also, I cannot bring myself

to go to a football match.

My claim is as follows:

1.     Injuries
\
     I
    2. jLoss of earnings
         i
    3.       Pamage to clothing as follows   :

Trainers Reebock Royale 12 months old - lost £30.00.

Married,

WILL SAY:

I attended the F.A Cup Final between Notts Forest V Liverpool on the 15.4.89 at

Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

I drove a car to the match with 3 passengers i.e.                       3f

                                            ( no. unknown) and           of

      ( aged

We arrived in Sheffield at about 12.50pm parking in Willis Road/ Dixon Road junction

about      Vz   mile from Hillsborough   Football Ground.

We had no alcohol to drink.          We ate sandwiches walking to the ground.

We walked from Leppings Lane through the 1st turnstile on the left ( gate B)

and through the tunnel on the terrace behind the goal.

We were searched 4 times by the police in Leppings Lane itself and when we got

through the turnstiles.

 There were a lot of Police officers in Lepping Lane and next to the turnstiles

 ( after entry).

We went          through the turnstiles at about 1.10pm.

 I noticed a lot of people congrating outside by the turnstiles drinking coke

 and cans of beer.

 We thought there would be a queue the way it was building up so we went into

 the ground.

 On coming out of the tunnel there is a blue fence forcf.ing you to go left or

 right.

 We went left and stood behind a crash barrier behind the goal but slightly to

 our Jeft.

 Nothing untowards happened until about 2.40 - 2.50pm.

 You would normally expect a bit of pressure but over the course of a few minutes

 the pressure got worse and worse.

 I then decided to get under the barrier and stood it front of it.

 My friends managed to pull me under the barrier.           I was facing away from the

 goal - it was so tight I couldn’t             /e r- ’nd.
 I was then facing a man who was being crushed against the crash barrier: I was

 trying to push people back to assist him.

 In the general justling I managed to face the front (      from    the corner of my eye

 the man behind the barrier went down and that was       the last   I saw of him).

 We were getting pushed nearer to the front      face.    We were   trying tostand our

 ground and keep breathing { at about 2.50pm there       was a sudden push.

 At one point I passed out and I then recall a stranger slapping my face and my

 mates kept me on my feet.

 At this point I and everybody were shouting to the police for assistance and

 asking for the gate to be opened.

 I recall one PC was bald/ balding with glasses - he was shouting " get back you

 dickheads - get back you animals".

I don't recall ever see any players on the pitch.

In the justling I thought I was standing on a knotted scaf, I looked down and

I discovered I was standing on a male.

We were just standing, breathing our best as possible and trying to survive.

By about 3.15pm people had been getting out of the enclosure and making the situation

less packed,

Wepicked up a girl who had footmarks all over her: she went a dead weight in

our hands,

When it became easier to move bodies started dropping to the floor, we were helping

to pass them to the front.

Bodies were lying everywhere.

At about 3,50pm we managed to walk back through the tunnel,

I was in total shock screaming*

I told a bobby I'd just killed somebody by standing on them*

Another P0 tried to put me in an anbulanee - It was packed: I refused because

I had ro drive my friends h o m e .

There were dead people lying in the tunnel and the courtyard between the tunnel

and the turnstiles.

People were crying and screaming.

The police wer    ,-arrying   people out and-just throwing them into the courtyard.

We were try      to assist people,

I helping a girl who was distressed.
Men were shouting and fighting with police to try and help their; friends still

inside.

It was total chaos        and frightening,

A PO refused to allow one back into the ground to see                  &I       who was on

the pitch.

At about 4,20pm the fire bridgade arrived at which point everything seemed to

get organised,

I went into the seating above the goal and saw the devastation*

We shouted to            and         fjh o   me us outside.

We headed back to the car, we went into Intrim Hairdressers and phoned home,

I then drove home in a d a z e ,

{ I did not notice any delays on the road to Sheffield through Stockport),

I was not aware of any one around who did not have a ticket,

I gave a full signed statement to West Midlands Police on 29,4,89,

GP Dr             at                Liverpool saw him on 17.4,89 and he gave me some

slepping and nerve tablets*

WILL SAY :

I   am    consulting             you     regarding          the     Hillsborough               tragedy.           I    went        to    the    ground

with                              of                               Liverpool             27    and her boyfriend

(address         unknown).              We    were       standing        in the Leppings                   Lane       End,    directly          behind

the      goal.         I       don't    know        how    far     away       from       the        pitch       I was because                I am not

very      tall       and       when     I    got     into    the        ground       I     simply          couldn't          see where          I was.

The    crush         started       and       I was        pushed    towards       the         fence        running       along          the central

aisle      of       the     terraces          and    I got         lifted       over       and       made        my    way     down       the    aisle

and      was     then       lifted          over    the     main        perimeter          fence          and    onto    the           pitch.    I was

in a very            distressed             condition.           I couldn't catch                    my    breath.       My chest and back

were      very       badly        bruised.           I     didn't        seek    medical            attention           then because             I was

in a state of absolute shock.

I came         straight home                and    the     following Monday                I saw my             G.P.,        Dr.                at the

                    Health        Centre.           She    prescribed           pain       killers.              I had       also had trouble

sleeping         and       was     having           nightmares          but     she      wouldn't           prescribe              sleeping      pills

for m e .

I   will       be    going        back       to my G.P.           this week because                   my        chest and back               pain   are

still        persisting.                I    cannot        sleep.         The     Doctor            has     said       that        I    am   mentally

exhausted and suffering from anxiety attacks.

I     work      in    an                                         Li I                                Off                                     Liverpool

25.       I     am    a care           assistant.           As yet,           I have          not    had        time    off work because               I

have      wanted          to    keep        busy    but     if     the    pain        in      my     back       doesn't        improve          then   I

may need time off.                     It depends what my Doctor says when I go to see him again.

I   would        also       add    that       the     Police        from      Hillsborough                 came       last    Sunday         and took

my ticket and I gave                     them a full             statement.           They were there for about V /z hours.

I should like to claim compensation.

                We all      travelled      to ge th er     on an E a s e w a y Cojfech w h i c h we         caught    in

I don't        know the exact address.                          The     coach s t o p p e d at a service

s t a t i o n on the M 6 2 just               prior     to the Ml for a b o ut                   15 m in u te s and then

c o n t i n u e d to S h ef fi el d.            We e n c o u n t e r e d        no    real    delays     until    outs id e

S h e f f i e l d w h er e      the    police were             s t o p p in g    the, coaches a nd         checking for

alcohol        and tickets.                 However,      our       coach was           not    stopped.



Just      before       the g r o u n d       I saw a number               of     people d r in ki ng       beer outs id e

pubs.         However,          none       of the    people         I saw were           drunk.

We a r r i v e d    in S h e f f i e l d at a bout               1.30pm - 1 .45pm              (1310 - 1345)         a nd the

ground.



I saw nor          re ce iv ed        no    police d i r e c t i o n s          or e sc or t     other    than at      the

where      the     police were m ak i n g              coaches,           i nc lu d in g      ours,    turn a r o u n d and

d ro p off       their       p a s se ng er s     furt he r a w a y from the ground.



I witnessed            no f i g h t i n g     d i s o rd e r    or d r u n k e n e s s       b et w ee n the g ro un d and

w h er e we were           dropped          off by the           coach.          T he re was a lot of singing by

the    fans      but    it was all            good natured.                We a r r i v e d at the e n tr an ce           to

the g r o u n d     in L e p p i n g s       Lane    b et w ee n 2 p m - 2 . 1 5 p m          (1400 - 1415).

W h e n we a r r i v e d at           the g ro un d there was a large                         crowd of     people

outside.           T here w ere            no signs     that        I saw d i r e ct i ng you to your

particular          t u r n s t i l e a n d no       police         d i re ct io ns .



At first we made                 our w a y to wa r ds           the t u r n s t i l e s       for the West S t a n d

s e at i ng    by m i s t a k e       and    it took      us a b o ut           five m i n u t e s    to get w i t h i n the

outer gates.               We    then f o un d that we had gone                         into the w ro ng         s e ct i o n of

t u r n s t i l e s a nd     it took a bo ut a no t he r                five m i n u t e s      to push our w ay back
                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                 S 182 3

to the      t er ra ce     turns ti le s.         I was       the     last     of m y 'group of frie nd s

and    they had to           pull me       round the          corner        of the f en ci ng        b et w ee n the

West S t a n d a nd te rr ac e           t ur ns t i l e s    b ec a us e    of the         crowd of       people.



It took a bo ut           ten m i n u t e s    to get from the outer                   gates to the

turnstiles          be ca us e   of the        push of        people        near    to the outer            gates.

As soon as         I had e n t ^ e d      P en 4 I r ea l is e d        it was   crow de d a n d    I was

immediately         separated       from my friends who                 I lost sight      of.      As    I took

up the      posi ty<n      I have m a r k e d      '1 * on the        grid,    I real is ed     it was        too

I knew there was a gate at the                      back       of the    pen because      I had gone

through      it    last year       but    because      the      crowd of      people c o ul dn 't       see    it

all      I could see on the far               left side w er e          people   climbing       over the

side      fence    into the       next    pen.



I then tried to            push my way back             b eca us e    I thou gh t   it w o u l d   be better

t here a nd also          out    of the sun because              of the s hade      t hr ow n by the s tand

above.



At first         I couldn't move          back,     but    then      I push ed   back wa rd s w i t h my

face      to the    front a n d the        people      b eh in d just m o v e d a r o u n d me taking up

the space         I had    left.



EJy the     time    I had got a few yards                 from the       back wall the    crus hi ng          was

that      bad.     I had s ta r t e d     to feint.            Some m en   b eh in d me then g r ab b e d me

as    I started      to go down and             pushed me up.           Som/'body then        lent down

from      the s tand above,         took      hold of me as           th«r ones below     pushed         me up,

and      pulled me up into          the West S t an d aboyg.

When       I had    looked a r o u n d       for      them    I had       l o ok ed over            into the    next          pen,

pen 3,       and s een        people     pushing         t he m s e l v e s    up and on top of others and

then       rolling       down on trip of the other                    people,          over     their heads          to the

I cannot        say w h e t h e r   I w i t n e s s e d any deaths,        but as     I was       pulled up

into the West S t a n d a number               of    people a r o u n d me had b l ac ke d out.                  At

the     time    I did not think          they were       dead,      just    fainted,        but    cannot    say

one way or the           other.



Once     in the West S t a n d there w ere a number                   of     people    p ulled out who

w ere    lying     on the     floor     trying      to get    their     breaths.



O nce    in the West S t a n d        I couldn't       get my       b r ea t h for a long time and

had to sit         down.      Q u it e a few     people      t ri ed to help me a nd see              if    I was

alr ig ht .      By the     time     I had    r e c o v er e d my   b r ea t h the front          row of the

West    S t a n d was    c rowded and        I couldn't       get    near     to help anyone.



1 think        the m ai n   reason for       the deaths a nd          injuries was          the     lack    of

signs a nd d i r e c t i o n s      within   the ground.            Whilst     the two       centre    pens

w ere   over     c rowded and        crushing was        t aking     place the        two    pens   either

side had        plenty of space;          people      s h ou l d have      been d i r e c t e d   into these.

the      pens     s topped       people      leaning       in a n d     pulling        out the people           right at

the      front.        I saw one         boy    in p a r t ic u la r who        had been        passed down to

the      front     but    had gone           u n d e r n e a t h the   o ve r ha n g    on top of       peoples head

out.



I d i d n ’t see a n y t h i n g         I     consider        to be a criminal o f f e n c e .



After       the game had             been      s to p p e d only a few         poli ce o f fi ce rs       helped,       a

w h e n m ore      could have helped.                   I then saw         poli ce at the front t e ll in g

people          to m ove back         but they        c o u l d n ’t b ec a us e we were          being      crus he d at

the      back as well           as    the      front.      I p e r s o n a l l y o nl y saw one a m b u l a n c e

come       onto the       pitch a nd           thought there           s h o u l d have been more.



O n ce     up    into the s t a n d          itself     it was      b e c o m in g    over   c ro wded

It s t a r t e d to become              very     crowded       in the West            S t a nd so one man a s ke d

this       s te w a r d to open the gate to                   let   people out          into P en 7 to give

more       room for those             t rying       to help but the S t e w a r d w o u l d n ’t.               I then

saw a number             of    people        climb over         this    gate         into P en 7.



I cannot          say what        time       I left      but    it was      s o m e t im e a fter an

announcement             that     the game had been a b an d o n e d .                  W h e n this, a n n o u n c e m e n t

came a          lot of people all              t ried to get           out at        once a nd so      I sat and

waited          till   the m a j o r i t y     of    people had         left the West S t a nd and then
                                                                                                     PAGE       9
                                                                                                     S 18S 3

left via the stairway.



O nce    I had       come down the        stairs,     into the y a r d    behind the t ur ns t il e s          I

f ound my f r i e n d s ; I was         the    last   one to j oi n e ve ry on e      etc.      No one

else     had been h u r t .



The     others       had   c ol l e c t e d the banner    before     I got     back and we then

r e t u r n e d to the      coach.



The     only other         points    I w o ul d   like to add      is that the        pr/Oblem could

have     been e ased        if there      had been a larger          police     p r e s e n c e m ak in g

p eople    gueue       for the t urnstiles.            I also    b el i ev e   tbfat football         grounds

s h ou ld have        large    p arking    facilities within          easy 'reach of the ground

w h i c h w o u l d have e ased the           c o n g e s t i o n at the t ur nstiles.



If there are           pens at S h e f f i e l d t hen they m us t       be roonitore/f by P o li c e

or S t e w a r d s    so that w h e n     they are     full   they    can be      c 1oyed a nd fans

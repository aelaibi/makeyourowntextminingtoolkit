                1 have been employed by                                                            as a transport

                clerk, and work at the main booking office,

                                                  for the past two years.

                On Monday 10th April               1989 (100489),        I was working             in        aoove

                office dealing with people booking tickets for the ?:

                football       match between Liverpool and N o t t i n g h a m Fo

                was      to be played at Hillsborough,               Sheffield,          on 1y                    ( 150489)

                The      tickets    I was       issuing   to these     people were                           on       oa c n .

                It    is the      policy of the       firm that when           people      1 jok seats,      we write

                the      telephone       number    of the    person booking            on I "ie copy w h i c h is kept

                by the firm.             The    reason for this      is that          if f.\ are    is any

                a l t er at io ns we      can contact       the people « id i nr1

                I identify a photostat ticket shown to me

                having been written fay me,         I identify the handwriting.   I cannot

                remember who I issued this ticket to, and at the present time the

                original       book is not available to see,    the contact telephone number

                I wrote down.

                I have dated and signed the photostat          copy of the ticket which is

                On Saturday,                 15th April             1989,        ( 150489)        I was      on d u t y     in     company with

                other      officers             involved            in d u t i e s at       the F.A.          Semi-Final            football

                match      at      the       Hillsborough                Football          Stadium,       between Liverpool                    F ,C .

                a n d N o t1 i n g h a m F o r e s t F C .

                I was      part         of    serial          34    under        the s u p e r v i s i o n    of P S 2 2 4 8        Sherratt.

                At    1 0 0 0 am we           all    attended             a briefing             in the      grounds        North        S t a n d area.

                At   1100 am            serial       34       & 3 5 w e r e b r i e f e d by our c o m m a n d e r                 Inspector

                At    1115 am           we al l      took          up    our    positions          on C l a y w h e e l s     Lane,       I was

                allocated           th e      duty       of    recording            the     details       of all        the      buses        which

                were     parking             in t h i s       location.             Each     bus    t h at     a r r i v e d was        met    by

                officers           in    our     two      serials          they      were        directed       to     drive       to    the    end     of

                this     particular              road and               there      turn a r o u n d      and    return        to    park

                alongside           our       serials.              An    officer          from    our    serial        greeted          each       coach

                and     they       were       all    directed             towards          the    football        stadium.

                These     buses          contained             a wide          c r o ss    section       in a g e s     of L i v e r p o o l

                supporters              and     I can         state       t ha t    from     this     section          of   supporters

                whilst        they were             in    t h is        location          they    appeared        to    be w e l l       behaved

                and     in g o o d       spirits.

                At    13 45       hrs    Claywheels                Lane    was      completely           full     of    supporters             buses,,

                                                                                                                                             R 4 A3

I recorded            a total          of    52     b us e s    and 2 mini                buses       at    this             location.

At    1 42 5    hrs we          were       further        deployed          to    the        junction            of C l a y w h e e l s               Lane

with Penistone                  Road       North.         We w e re      positioned                outside               a    public          house

named       the G A T E         and    our        duties       were    d e f i n e d as          supervising                      the

arriving          fans      who       were        walking       down Halifax                Road        towards               us.         We w e r e

intruded             to    form a filter                 lane    of    officers              and      to    inform                the

supporters            that       all       alcoholic           drinks       would          be    left       at       t hi s        lo c a t i o n .

From       this      position you                 can see       a good       distance              up t h i s            Halifax             Road

and    as      far    as    the       eye     could       see    I saw       that          there        was      a       continuous                flow

of L i v e r p o o l       supporters              in g r o u p s     approx.             10 a b r e a s t       on          both       sides         of

the    carriageway.                   The     majority          of    these       were          males       in t he               lo w e r    age

bracket,          it w a s       very apparent                 to me     that         a    l a r ge     amount               of    alcohol

had    been       consumed            by    the     v a st     majority          of       these       men.           A       large        number

of    them were            still       drinking           on    their       way       towards           the      ground              and a

l a r ge    number         of    them       were        halted and asked                   to    le ave       their               intoxicants

at    t hi s    location.              Some        of    them    left       their          drinks          others             insisted             on

consuming            them       at    this        location.

Generally            they were             a ll    of    good    behaviour,                they were             drunk             but       not

incapable            or    disorderly.

From       me a n d       the    other        officers          taking       up       this       position                the       thing        that

became         most       apparent          to me       other        than    their           drunken          states               was       how

late       thousands            of    them        had    left    it    to    go       to     get      into       the          ground.

This       heavy      mass       of    persons          continued without                       any     significant                     gaps

appearing            until       about        1510      ho ur s.

Around         1455 hours             I observed             officers        from my             serial          go          into       the G A T E

public         house       and       then     eject       a number          of L i v e r p o o l           fans          who       ha d

obviously            consumed          a    large       amount        of a l c o h o l .

Our    serial         then       returned           from       the    public          house        to      our       point.

About       15 10     I went          with        other      officers        into          this       same       public              house         as

a    request         for    assistance              from PS S herratt,                     inside          the       public             house.

                                                                                                                                            R 443

I saw       there       were        approximately                  15       persons          inside          these        premises           st ill

in the       process           of    finishing               their          drinks.           These          persons         were        ejected

from     these         premises          and       we    then          went       to    the       p o in t    we     had     been

al 1 o c a t e d .

About       1515       hours        we   were       able          to    consider             resuming          from        this        location

due    to    the       street        now      being          clear          of    supporters.

Inspector            l'ownend t h e n          informed                us    that       the       radio was              containing

messages          of a n       incident            inside          the       ground          requiring              an    ambulance            to

be    brought          onto     the      pitch.              We    were          then       informed          by PC        Goss        that        all

available            staff      had      to    proceed             to       the    ground.

Our    serial          then     proceeded               to    the       ground          entering             vi a    the     large          gates

adjacent          to    turnstiles             77       to 88.              It w a s        there      that         I s a w an

ambulance,             parked        in the         corner             close       to       the    S p i o n Kop,           I, s a w     that

two    persons          were        deposited            beside             t h e m at       t h is    location who                had       their

faces       covered and              were      obviously                d ead.

We    received          instructions                from          Inspector             Townend          to    go        into    the

walkway        besides          this       location               and       attempt          to    prevent           Forest        fans

seeing       the       deceased          persons.

I was       Chen a p p r o a c h e d          by    two F o r e s t              fans       with a medical                  background

who    offered          their        assistance,                  I then          liaised wit h PS S h e r r a t t                       who

went     for      further           information,                   PS S h e r r a t t         returned              almost

immediately             and     shouted            for       all       of    our       serial         and any medics                   to    come

and    join       him.         We    then went               to    the       top       of    the      walkway            between         the

North Stand             and     the      Kop       stand.

It w a s     at      t hi s    t im e    that       1 saw          large          mumbers          of L i v e r p o o l         f a ns      a nd

either       dead       or     badly       injured.                They          were       being      carried            out    on

advertisement                 hoarding         boards.

I was       then       instructed             to    go       o nt o     the       pitch and assist                       in a n y w a y        1'

incident,           there      were      literally             hundreds        of     people          littering             the

playing        surface,           there       were       numerous          bodies         of    persons          on      the    gr o und,

who    were      requiring          assistance.

I t h e n w e n t to a n u m b e r of t h e s e i n j u r e d p e r s o n s a n d h e l p e d a s best I

was    able,        along      with      a    number         of   other       officers           we w e r e         then

instructed            to    form a       cordon across                the     halfway           line       and      to    prevent

anyone      coming          through.            This         proved      to   be     difficult              as      persons       were

being      brought          through          it w h o        were     requiring            assistance.This                  cordon

remained         in    position          until          an a n n o u n c e m e n t    was       made       t ha t     the      game   was

to    be a b a n d o n e d .

With     Inspector           Townend          we    then       left     the    ground and                  r e t u r n e d to

C l a y h w h e e 1s Lane         and    there          we    visited       each      bus a n d            i n f o r m e d the

drivers        of     the    emergency             telephone          number.

Liverpool           fans     returning             to    this      location          were       on    the     whole         very

subdued        but     a number          of     them were           venting          t h e ir    anger         towards          the

polite      officers           present          w i t h me.

Gradually           the     buses       began       to       disperse       and      we    continued             to      get

enquiries           from w orried             supporters.              We     gave        them       the     emergency            number

and    indicated            them    to       the    location          of    nearby         telephones.

Eventually            we    were    left        with         approximately                four       buses       at this

location         so we       returned           to C l a y w h e e 1s P o l i c e          garage          for      standby        dutie

I took      no      further        part        in this         incident.

While     at     the       junction          of C l a y w h e e l s     Lane      and Penistone                  Road       I noted a

lot    of L i v e r p o o l       supporters             asking       for     spare        tickets.

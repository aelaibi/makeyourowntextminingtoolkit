            I am a married man and live at the above address with my family,



            On Saturday 15th April        1989 <150489)             I attended the FA Cup Semi Final

            between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC at the Hillsborough

            G r o u n d , Sheffield,



            I travelled to the match with three                   people         h*f subsequently died*'in
                                                                  r-*\

            TRAYNOR and David ^ ^ e o n a jm T H O M A S . Christopher was a .friend of mine

            having known him for about six m o n t h s , and the others were/'             /

            We stopped just outside Sheffield on the way to the match* at/a Pub.
                                                                                PAGE

         ■1300 hours.    We watched the Television     in there and I spent most of

         the time with Christopher and Mart i n TRAYIMOR.      We all three had two

         and a half pints of lager,         1 am not sure how many the others drank

         but it was less than us.



         We eventually got to the ground at about        1      urs, as a group ana we

         arranged to meet back after the match at a larnpost with a traffic

         turnstile and the others,     Martin,   Christopher and David all went

         towards their turnstiles from the terrace and I had no further         contact

         with those three and was not involved in any subsequent        identification

             I have today been shown v > « e / a n ^ p h o t o g r a p h s ,             relating to the

             Hillsborough Disaster,               by Irf^e cHi»r LAYTON and Sergeant KILLOCH of the

             West Midlands Police.

             In my original          statement dated 22nd June                 1989,     I refer to attending

             the Hi I Isborou^fh Ground on 15th April                    1989 (150489) with David Leonard

             2.      (R E f DM IR 2 / 9)   (E h         ) I have        identified a pe r son who strongly

             resembles David Leonard THOMAS.

             The face of the person is not fully shown on the photographs and it

             is not possible to say that                it definately           is or is not David.

             I have     indicated this persons position with a coloured dot.

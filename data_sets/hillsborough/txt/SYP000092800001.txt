All        officers               of my serial            were      present and were aware                    of their       duties.

From around                     10.00 am        <1000)      my officers were engaged                       in escorting            the

my officers were                        either at          the ground or were                   on route       to    it,.    I

remained at the                        rail     station to escort a small                        number       of fans who

clear and the fans                          left    the bus and made                    their way through the

turnstiles                     into the       ground.

                                                                                                 S3'706

I then entered          the ground and went        straight       to the gyafn&sium.

1 had been        in the gym n a s i u m a matter       of momenta wh^yn a senior            officer

(identif ication          not known)    came    into the    gyra and      instructed everyens

to make     their way to the          playing area as        "there was      trouble       on. the

pitch,"      With other       officers we went          to the    ramp at ths Kop end.                 The

m a t c h was still       in play,     1 looked up the field and saw                fans    climbing

over    the fence at the West Stand.               I instructed all          the officers

present     to m ake      their way to the West Stand.                 We made    our way along

the    perimeter     track    towards    the West Stand and as we did so                   I recall

the m atch being          stopped,     On arr 1 va>,,'^at~the west S tand          I saw fans

climbing over        the fence on to tKe          track and       I also    saw that       the

perimeter       fence     gate,   to the/right     of the goal when facing             the West

S t a n d was o p en and     peopla/wers       spilling    out.        1 saw youths    being

lifted     into    the se^teci/area above         the    stand.

Soais fans were         now-ifying on the grass,           I started to move          one of the

y ouths   towards       the edge,      1 formed    the opinion that he was             intoxicated

As    1 did this vi'-ore and more        fans were       spilling       out and    coming    on to

the    pitch,      I looked       closer at the     crowd and saw that            there was a

a huge amount        of    p e o p 1 e in the stand ™- people we r e obvious Iy try! n g t o

get out of the          crush.     As more     people    came    out    1 tried to direct          them

to the     right    hand side to       prevent    the escape       route becoming          blocked,

I was     joined by other         officers and tried to orqaru.se a/funnel                   at the

gate    to keep     it clear.        At this    point a youtri was         carried out and

placed on the grass           I saw he was       lifeless.        I checked for signs             of

life and found none,               I looked at his eyes and saw that                they were

cloudy.      He was ob v i o u s l y dead.

At this     point    I changed my       radio    cnanel    t,/ nuffiber 25.        I identified

m yself arid twice         requested    urgent me d i/fa . 1 a s s %s t a n c e t o t h e Wes t

Stand,,     1 received no          reply and    1 cmxld    not hear any radio          traffic.

I then     continued to assist w^'th yirst aid as more                     injured and dead
                                                                                                         PAGE          4
                                                                                                         03706

were    brought     out and to keep the               immediate/firaa clear to facilitate

the escape       of more        people.

I then recall          the Si Johns ambulance" at t e n d i n g at the west Stand,                            cut

fay this    time    there wars        crowds     on the sateh and              1 lost    sight      of    it..

Some    time    later Fire Brigade OffiCiH^s attended,                         X d i r e c t e d them to the

a rea behind the goal?             and asked them to send for oxygen..

A S o u t h Yorkshire       a m b ulance    then made          its way up the          pit c h.     The

a m b ulance at t e n d a n t a sked me for Police P r o t e c t i o n as he stated                       that

he had a lre a d y been attacked.                1 stayed with the arfth^'ance for a short

while    until     it was       driven further a long              the     pitch.

At this     point      the bodies and         injured         persons were          being swiftly

removed by supporters              and Police         officers          on m a keshift    stretchers =

The area was        then    cleared of        casualties and               I started     to make an

effort     to move      fans     to the edge       of the        pitch.       A nuirsbsr of suppor t e rs

became aggrssive and abusive.

At this     point      I regrouped as many /f my serial                       apossible           and took up

to keeping       the    road     clear for e m ergency             vehides

Finally     I escorted a PSV            containing N o t t i n g h a m Forest fans                to Midl a n d

as   due to the nature            of the     incident         I found myself          detached from my

            I am a Detectivce Constable in the South Yorkshire Police Scenes of

           Crime Department at Ecclesfield Police Station, Sheffield.



           At 4.30pm on Thursday 20th April 1989,                 I was on duty in the Scenes of
                                                                                   c
           Crime Department, at Police Headquarters, Snig Hill, S h e f f i e l d ,                at

           which time I subjected a threatening letter to an Electrostatic

           Document Examination.                 Following the examination 1 examined the
           *-                           -   -

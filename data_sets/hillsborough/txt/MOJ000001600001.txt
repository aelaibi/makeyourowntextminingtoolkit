                       GROUNDS ON WHICH RELIEF IS SOUGHT


1.   T he issues in this case are :



     (a)        w hether the R espondent w as in error in law in resolving on 5th February 1999

               that it had no legal po w er to provide financial assistance to David Duckenfield

               o r B ernard M urray in relation to their costs and expenses o f defending the

               private prosecutions brought against them by the H F S G by inform ation dated

               10th July 1998 and in determining that any previous decision o f the Authority,

               o r any officer acting under its authority, to m ake such assistance available was

               null and void ;



     (b)      w hether the R espondent w as w rong in law in resolving that it had no legal

               pow er to provide financial assistance to David D uckenfield and B ernard

               M urray in relation to any judicial review proceedings in respect o f th e private

               prosecution brought against them ;



     (c)      w hether the R espondent has vires to provide financial assistance as and when

               costs are incurred in defending the private prosecution or w hether p o w er is

               limited to m eeting any costs incurred and not recovered from o ther sources.



     (d)      w hether the R espondent has vires to provide financial assistance irrespective o f

               the availability o f legal aid.



2.   As to the A p p lic a n t:



     (a)      T h e Applicant is the C hief Constable o f South Yorkshire. As such it is his duty

               to secure the enforcem ent o f the law in his area and he is responsible for the

               disposition and control o f his force.   David Duckenfield and B ernard M urray

               are form er police officers w ho w ere acting in the course o f their policing duties

               at the time w hen it is alleged that they com m itted criminal offences.         The

               decision in question is o f very real consequence to the Applicant.          I f it be


                                                 4
              correct in law that a police authority has no p o w e r to grant financial assistance

              to police officers w ho subsequently face a private prosecution arising from their

              conduct w hen acting in the course o f their duties, it will have very significant

             repercussions with regard to the recruitm ent o f police officers, discipline and

              effective policing. T he Applicant m ade representations before the R espondent

             before it m ade the decisions in question.        In the circum stances, the Applicant

             has a sufficient interest.



     (b)     T h e Applicant has no alternative remedy.



                                              THE FACTS


3.   O n 15th April 1989 the Hillsborough Stadium D isaster occurred.                 B o th David

     Duckenfield, then C hief Superintendent Duckenfield, and B ernard M urray, then

     Superintendent M urray, w ere on duty at the Stadium that day. They have both since

     retired from the Force on medical grounds.



4.   T here have been tw o inquiries in respect o f the Disaster.        L ord Justice Taylor was

     appointed to carry out an inquiry into the events o f the disaster on 17th April 1989.

     His interim report w as m ade public on 4th A ugust 1989.           Then in June 1997 L ord

     Justice Stuart-Sm ith w as appointed to conduct an independent scrutiny as to w hether

     there w as any new evidence relating to the disaster.              His Scrutiny R eport was

     presented to the H ouse o f Com m ons on 18th February 1998. H e concluded that there

     w as no basis for re-opening L ord T aylor’s Inquiry, nor did he consider that there w as

     any m aterial which should be put before the D P P or the Police Com plaints A uthority

     which m ight cause them to reconsider decisions already taken.



5.   In 1990 and 1997 the C row n P rosecution Service considered w hether there was

     evidence to support any prosecution arising out o f the H illsborough D isaster and

     decided against any form o f prosecution.          Plainly they did so on the basis that there

     w as no realistic pro sp ect o f conviction.




                                                    5
O n 10th July 1998 a private prosecution w as brought by M s Adlington, a solicitor

representing the H illsborough Family S upport G roup (an association o f families who

suffered bereavem ent in the disaster) against David Duckenfield and B ernard M urray.

T he officers are charged with the m anslaughter o f John Alfred A nderson and Jam es

G ary Aspinall, tw o o f the deceased from the H illsborough disaster, and also w ith wilful

neglect to perform a public duty.            Further, M r Duckenfield faces a charge o f

intentionally perverting the course o f justice in lying about the circum stances in which

G ate C at the Stadium cam e to be opened.



Criminal proceedings w ere initially com m enced in the South Sefton M agistrates’

Court. B u t as objection w as m ade on the basis that the offences w ere not com m itted

within the area nor did either defendant live in the area, and the objections w ere

upheld.        An order w as m ade for the paym ent o f the defendants’ costs from central

funds, b u t the Clerk to the Justices has since queried the claims for costs on the basis

that the R espondent had originally agreed to fund their legal representation.



O n 27th February 1998 in the light o f threatened private prosecutions against officers

involved in the Hillsborough D isaster, the R espondent considered the general question

o f w hether financial assistance should be granted to the officers concerned.           It w as

recognised that actual decisions about financial support could only be m ade on

individual application. The R espondent resolved as follow s :



          “1.       That in the light o f the findings o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's
                    inquiry and his comments on the outcome, members do not
                    believe there is any new evidence to cause them to reconsider
                    the Authority's previous view, and remain o f the opinion that
                    the officers acted in goodfaith.


          2.        That the Authority agrees to authorise the Clerk and Treasurer
                    to consider applications fo r financial assistance from officers
                    (serving and retired) in accordance with the provisions o f
                    Home Office Circular 77/87, Financial Assistance to Police
                    Officers in Legal Proceedings”.
9.    In M arch 1998 an application m ade by M r Duckenfield for financial assistance w as

      approved. In June 1998 an application m ade by M r M urray for financial assistance w as

      approved.



10.   P ursuant to the said decisions, those acting for M r D uckenfield and M r M urray in

      defending the criminal proceedings have done so in the expectation that their costs

      w ould b e m et by the R espondent. V ery significant sums have been incurred by w ay o f

      defence costs.



11.   D uring the A utum n o f 1998 the D irector o f Public P rosecutions considered w hether to

      intervene in the private prosecution following a request m ade by the form er officers

      that he intervene and term inate the prosecutions.      On 18th D ecem ber 1998 it w as

      announced that the D P P w ould not intervene either to term inate or conduct the

      prosecutions.



12.   T h e private prosecution is proceeding swiftly, pursuant to a tight tim etable, to a fixed

      com m ittal d ate on 19th April 1999.



13.   A t an interlocutory hearing concerning the private prosecution at Leeds M agistrates

      C ourt on 21st D ecem ber 1998 those acting for the tw o form er officers indicated that

      they p roposed to apply for judicial review o f the decision o f the D P P not to intervene.

      They sought to extend the tight tim etable im posed by the M agistrates’ C ourt leading

      up to the fixed d ate for committal.          They w ere unsuccessful.     The stipendiary

      m agistrate acceded to the submission m ade by the prosecution that it w as essential that

       the prosecution be proceeded with speedily.



14.   O n 22nd D ecem ber 1998 and 23rd D ecem ber 1998 respectively M r M urray and M r

      Duckenfield m ade applications to the R espondent to extend financial assistance to

       cover the proposed application for judicial review o f the decision o f the D P P not to

       intervene.




                                                7
In   D ecem ber     1998    and   January    1999    the    private   p rosecutor   m ade   written

representations by w ay o f letter to the R espondent complaining about the provision o f

financial assistance to the officers and suggesting that in providing assistance to the

form er officers the R espondent had acted unlawfully.            Further, com plaint w as m ade

about any proposed funding o f an application for judicial review o f the decision o f the

D PP.



In the light o f the complaints about funding from the private prosecutor, the

R espondent sought legal advice and then held a m eeting on 5th February 1999 to

determ ine w hether or not it had pow er to grant financial assistance to the form er

officers. Reluctantly, on 5th February 1999 the R espondent resolved that it                had no

pow er. M o re specifically, it resolved as f o llo w s :



         “1       ...   the Authority has no legal power to provide financial
                  assistance to M r David Duckenfield or M r Bernard Murray in
                  relation to their costs and expenses o f defending the private
                  prosecutions brought against them               by the HFSG,         by
                  information dated 10th July 1998, and that any previous
                  decision o f the Authority, or any officer acting under its
                  authority, to make such assistance available is null and void.


        2.        In the light o f legal advice, including advice from Leading
                  Counsel, members are recommended to resolve that, on
                  balance, the Authority has no legal power to provide financial
                  assistance to M r David Duckenfield or M r Bernard Murray in
                  relation to the costs o f any judicial review proceedings
                  brought by either o f them : whether relating to the decision o f
                  the Crown Prosecution Service not to take over the conduct o f
                  private prosecutions and discontinue such prosecutions, or to
                  any decision o f the Clerk to the Sefton Magistrates ’ Court, to
                  challenge the payment o f the officers’ costs o f proceedings
                  before that court from central funds, or to any other decision
                  o f any court, authority or body arising from such prosecutions
                       ;   and, accordingly,     to reject the applications o f Mr
                       Duckenfteld and Mr Murray fo r financial assistance in
                       relation to such proceedings.


              3.       In recognition o f the fa ct that the legal advice provided to the
                       Authority is that it remains arguable that power exists to
                      provide the assistance referred to in 1 and 2 above, to take
                       such action as the Clerk and Treasurer, in consultation with
                       the Chief Constable, the Authority’s legal advisers and the
                       Chairman o f the Authority, may decide as appropriate to have
                       the decisions referred to in 1 and 2 reviewed by the High
                       Court and to expedite such review with a view to clarifying the
                       Authority’spowers in this regard. ”


17.1   As is evident from the third resolution m ade by the R espondent, the R espondent

       accepts that the question o f w hether there is pow er to grant financial assistance is, at

       the very least, arguable.



17.2   T he R espondent does not oppose an application for leave to apply for judicial review.



                                           THE LAW


18,    P ursuant to section 6(1) o f the Police A ct 1996 :



               “Every police authority established under section 3 shall secure the
              maintenance o f an efficient and effective police force fo r its area. ”


19.    P ursuant to section 111(1) o f the Local G overnm ent A ct 1972 :



               “Without prejudice to any powers exercisable apart from this section
              but subject to the provisions o f this Act, a local authority shall have
              power to do any thing (whether or not involving the expenditure,
               borrowing or lending o f money or the acquisition or disposal o f any


                                                 9
               property or rights) which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or
                   incidental to, the discharge o f their functions. ”


20.    P ursuant to their duty under section 6 o f the Police A ct 1996, and its predecessor

       section 4 o f the Police A ct 1964 which is in very similar term s, police authorities

       nation-w ide have as a m atter o f practice over m any decades granted financial

       assistance to police officers to defend legal proceedings in appropriate cases.



21.    As long ago as the R oyal Com m ission on the Police 1961-1962, the practice w hereby

       police officers w ere granted financial assistance, when proceedings w ere begun and not

       after the case had been heard and decided, in order to m eet and defend private

       prosecutions w as recognised and no recom m endations w ere m ade to alter the practice.



22.1   T w o H om e Office Circulars have purported to offer guidance to police authorities in

       deciding w hether or not to offer financial assistance to police officers to defend

       litigation b ro ught against them in respect o f their conduct when acting in the course o f

       their police duties.



22.2   H om e Office Circular N o 77/87 includes the following passages :



            "...   Also acting in pursuance o f its general statutory duty to maintain an
           adequate and efficient police force fo r its area, the police authority has
           discretion to meet expenditure incurred by officers in all kinds o f legal
           proceedings where the officers have acted in good faith in pursuance o f
           their duties, or the interests o f the force as a whole are involved,   ..




           The central principle which should guide consideration o f individual
           cases is that, where a police authority considers that an officer has acted
           in good faith in pursuance o f his duties or that the interests o f a force as
           a whole are involved, the officer should have the support o f the police
           authority to ensure that he has the services o f a lawyer and that he
           should not be out o f pocket.




                                                   10
           A police officer should be able to carry out his duties in the confidence
            that, i f he acts in good faith and exercises his judgment reasonably, his
           police authority will support him. I f in a case where a member o f the
           public brings a prosecution against an officer, the authority is satisfied
            that the officer has acted in this way, the authority should provide or
           fu n d legal advice and / or representation. ”


23.3   H o m e Office Circular 4/1998 includes the following passages :



               “1.     It is important that police officers should be able to carry out
                       their duties in the confidence that, their police authority will
                       support them, if they act in good faith and exercise their
                       judgment reasonably. ....


               6.      It is fo r individual police authorities to decide in the
                       particular circumstances o f a case, and on the basis o f legal
                       advice, whether to make financial assistance available to
                       officers in criminal proceedings. ”


24.    In R v D erbyshire Police A uthority ex parte W ilson and D alton The Tim es 8.8.89 the

       Divisional C ourt considered an application for judicial review       o f the decision o f the

       D erbyshire Police Authority, in the exercise o f their discretion,   not to pay any part o f

       the legal expenses o f tw o police officers with regard to an auditors inquiry.           The

       Divisional C ourt proceeded on the basis that section 4 o f the Police A ct 1964 provided

       the statutory basis for the paym ent o f m oney to the police officers w ith regard to legal

       expenses. A lthough it w ould appear that there w as no specific argum ent as to w hether

       th e A uthority had p o w er to grant financial assistance, the source o f the A uthority’s

       p o w e r w as considered by the C ourt and not found wanting.      R alph G ibson LJ stated

       that “ section 4 o f the Police A ct 1964 .. defines the duty o f the police authority and the

       purposes fo r which the authority may spend the m oney provided, namely, to secure the

       m aintenance o f an adequate and efficient police force” .




                                                11
25.   Further, in W ilson the status o f a H om e Office Circular w as considered. The C ourt

      referred to and endorsed w hat w as said by Scarm an LJ in Bristol District Council v

      C lark [1975] 3 All E R 976 concerning the status o f H om e Office Circulars to the effect

      th at they are a g o o d indication o f the purposes to be served by the relevant statute.



26.   B o th H o m e Office Circulars recognise the im portance o f the principle that police

      officers should be able to carry out their duties in the confidence that their police

      authority will support them if they act in g o o d faith and exercise their ju dgm ent

      reasonably. The earlier 1987 Circular is plainly put on the basis that there is a pow er

      to grant financial assistance.       The later 1998 Circular does not suggest that it is

      im proper to extend financial assistance to officers facing criminal proceedings and

      suggests that there is pow er and justification for doing so.



27.   T here are very strong public policy reasons as to w hy it should be open to a police

      authority to provide financial assistance to police officers facing litigation, and m ore

      specifically as in this case a private prosecution, arising out o f his or her conduct acting

      in the course o f his or her police duties. M uch is asked o f police officers in acting on

      b eh alf o f a Force.     They have to m ake difficult decisions, often in the heat o f the

      m om ent, w here lives are at risk or individuals exposed to injury.        Further, they are

      daily dealing w ith the unscrupulous and situations o f conflict. Police officers, by virtue

      o f their duties, are liable to be m ade the subject o f litigation and, indeed, litigation

      w ithout p ro p er justification.   It is essential to effective policing that police officers

      police officers know that if they m ake m istakes, o r face litigation arising from their

      w o rk on b ehalf o f the Force that they will receive financial support w here they have

      acted in g o o d faith.



28.   In this case the form er police officers face a private prosecution w hich is brought in the

      nam e o f a solicitor w ho is said to represent the H FSG .     On som e three occasions the

      D P P has declined to prosecute these officers.        This m ust be on the basis that the

      prospects o f success do not justify a prosecution. Y et the private p ro secu to r is subject

      to no such restraints and the prosecution continues.          It is contended that the public




                                                  12
       policy interest in providing financial assistance to officers w ho face prosecutions w here

       there is no o r little realistic prospect o f success are overwhelming.



29.    In summary, it is contended that the R espondent has p o w er arising from section 6 o f

       th e Police A ct 1996 to grant financial assistance, which has been recognised in tw o

       H om e Office Circulars and by the Divisional C ourt in W ilson.



30.1   It is u n d erstood that the R espondent’s concern about w hether or not there is p o w e r to

       grant financial assistance to police officers in these circum stances arises from the

       provision at section 88 o f the Police A ct 1996 (originally section 48 o f the Police Act

       1948) w hich provides for the liability o f the chief officer o f police in respect o f to rts

       com m itted by constables under his direction and control.         A t section 88(4)(b) it is

       provided that a police authority may pay out o f the police fund any costs incurred and

       not recovered by an officer in respect o f an action in to rt brought against him.       It is

       said th at as a m atter o f statutory interpretation, it should be inferred from the presence

       o f this provision that Parliam ent intended only to provide for the recovery o f costs

       incurred by an officer in these circumstances.



30.2   It is contended by the Applicant that this suggested interpretation o f the 1996 Police

       A ct cannot be correct, for am ongst others, the following reasons :



       (a)    T here is no express suggestion in the A ct that section 88(4)(b) w as intended to

               fetter the p o w er arising from section 6.   Section 88 does not purport in any

               sense to preclude assistance for non-tort claims.           It does not deal with

               assistance in non-tortious claims at all.



       (b)    Section 88 exists to provide for vicarious liability in respect o f actions in tort

               on the part o f the chief officer o f police for his officers and to ensure that the

              paym ent o f dam ages and costs will be m et by the police authority and not the

               chief constable.   Sub-sections (2) and (4) are necessary to relieve the chief

              constable o f th e ordinary civil consequences o f bearing the dam ages and costs.




                                                13
       (c)    It is evident from the Royal Com m ission R eport on the Police 1961-62 that

               there w as never any recom m endation that the m aking o f section 88 (originally

               section 48 o f the Police A ct 1964) w ould fetter the practice o f m aking

               assistance available in non-tort claims.



       (d)    It is apparent from the H om e Officer Circulars that it has never been suggested

               by th e H om e Office that the presence o f section 88(4) should limit the p o w er o f

               a police authority to provide assistance.



       (e)    It w ould be contrary to public policy to interpret section 88(4) as limiting the

               p o w e r which a police authority has under section 6.



31.    A t the Police A uthority m eeting on 5th February 1999 those acting for the R espondent

       indicated that they considered t h a t :



       (a)    E ven if the R espondent had pow er to grant financial assistance to Duckenfield

               and M urray to defend the private prosecution, it w as limited to m eeting costs

               not recovered at the end o f the proceedings.



       (b)    T he grant o f financial assistance w as dependent upon the form er police officers

               exhausting alternative sources o f funding including legal aid.



32.    It is contended that the pow er arising from section 6 o f the Police A ct 1996 to provide

       financial assistance is neither expressly nor impliedly fettered in the m anner suggested

       and th at any such conditions are inconsistent with the duty o f the R espondent to

       m aintain an efficient and effective police force.



33.1   On 5th F ebruary 1999 the R espondent resolved that it did not have pow er to grant

       financial assistance to the form er police officers so as to allow them to seek judicial

       review o f the D P P ’s decision not to intervene in the private prosecution.



33.2   It is contended that the R espondent has p o w er to grant financial assistance to police

       officers facing litigation as a result o f its duty pursuant to section 6 o f the Police Act


                                                  14
       1996 to maintain and effective and efficient police force.         In the event that the

      R espondent has p o w e r to grant financial assistance to a police officer facing a private

      prosecution, such assistance cannot properly be specifically limited to simply defending

      th e private prosecution and to exclude the sort o f steps which a legally aided defendant

      in criminal proceedings w ould properly ta k e on legal advice extending beyond the

      specific criminal jurisdiction.



34.   The R espondent has m ade clear representations to the form er officers that their costs

      and expenses o f defending the private prosecutions will be m et by the Police Authority.

      O n this basis m any tens o f thousands o f defence costs have been incurred. The form er

      officers have not sought funding from elsewhere. The private prosecution is now at a

      crucial stage.   It is contended that they have a legitimate expectation that they will

      receive financial assistance.



35.   In th e light o f the above, the Applicant contends that the R espondent w as w rong in law

      in resolving that it had no pow er to provide financial assistance to the form er officers

      bo th w ith regard to defending the criminal prosecution and in respect o f any judicial

      review application arising therefrom .



                                        EXPEDITION


36.   Given (a) th e proposed comm ittal date o f 19th April 1999 (b) the tight tim etable

      im posed upon the parties in the run up to the com m ittal date (c) that those acting for

      Duckenfield and M urray seek to apply for judicial review o f the D P P ’s decision not to

      intervene in the private prosecution (d) that if the form er officers are to be w ithout

      financial assistance from the R espondent in defending the private prosecution they need

      to seek funds from elsewhere (e) the form er officers currently find them selves suddenly

      w ithout any source o f financial assistance to defend the private prosecution, this

      application m ust be heard and determ ined as a m atter o f extrem e urgency.



37.   It is recognised by bo th the Applicant and the R espondent that this application m ust be

      determ ined as a m atter o f extrem e urgency.




                                               15
38.   B o th David D uckenfield and B ernard M urray are currently receiving medical treatm ent

      as a result o f w hat occurred at the H illsborough Stadium. Thus far, they have acted in

      th e expectation that the R espondent will support them financially in defending the

      private prosecution.   They need to know as soon as ever possible w hether they can

      continue to receive financial assistance from the R espondent, or w hether they will have

      to try to find funds from elsewhere.

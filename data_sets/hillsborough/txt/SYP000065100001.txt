After    a few more minutes                  I saw what a p p e a r e d 'to be an Inspector              run

0 n to t h e pitch a n d           stop       th e ma t c h     I thought      ’Thank God* .      The

pressure       seemed toease a little and                     I was h o rrified         to see people          on

the ground.          1 picked a young:,                semi   conscious man off the floor and

took    him to the fence                to my    right where         he was    dragged o v e r .       I turned

round to a lot more                   space and at the front             of the terraces          b y the

fence?     I saw a pile of about                 ten people      of w hich si;; were a p p a r e n t l y

lifeless and blue.                    I tried to pull a young male out from under the

dead bodies         but he         was       trapped    by his legs.

  was a s s i s t e d by another               man.      I started trying to move               dead bodies

from on top of him.                     As    I did this,      I saw a grey old man             in a brown

coat    laying across             the    top of the       pile face up?         his face was        close      to

the    fence and a St J o h n ’s am b u l a n c e man was                blowing on his face

I hro u g h the fence.

He said,       " H e ’a n o t ”

1 qave mouth to mouth,                   struck his       c h e s t , in an attempt          to revive      n i m ,,

He did    not      respond.         Ever y t h i n g was      happening       so quickly.

1 decided       I could not spend time                   reviving      him as    l   thought     he was

dead arid others           could be saved.

I pushed the         pile of dead bodies with ail my strengtn and                               then    the

person     pinned was          pulled        clear.      I picked him up with the neip of

another and again he was                     passed over       the    top of the       right    hana fence.

I went    back down the terracing                     to see a young w oman            pieaaing     for help.

She was     trapped by dead bodies.                      Wit h help she got out and              1 iifteu

her    on my back.         She      looked       particularly sick and               I oecided     i t, w ouid

quicker     to c a r r y    her out          through the tunnel          but    it was still        crowded

and    I was    getting        tired?        so we a gain      put her    over       into    cue r iytiv itand

section.        I took off my jacket and threw                        it over    the fence.         A Police

            We were      situated at the D a p pings Ln end s l i g h t l y around the                            corner

            from     the turnstile          entrance     next    to a Police        cordon and a blue                folding

            d o u b 1e door.                   \
                                                                ~r/s^     c^r,
            I could      clearly see several             thousand Liverpool            spectators          trying       to

            get      into the ground via approx               four    turnstiles.           The   crowd was          good

            humoured,       a l t h ou gh   it d i d n ’t appear      to be making          progress       through the

            turnstiles.

            In the general          area     I could see approx            four m o u n t e d Police Officer and

            a handfuI       of foot 0 fficers.

            After     a few minutes          the m ood of the         crowd    changed with           people

            realising       that    they might         not get      in the ground.
                                                                                              PAGE           2

At the Leppings Rd end I could see wrought                        iron gates w hich      remained

open throughout          the     incident,,   allowing      fans access to the area
                                                                    \J N Au
i m m e d i a t e l y before   the turnstiles.           Several fans were climbing over

walls      to get     into the ground and wer^e being              ejected    from the ground by

Police Officers.               I was   suprised by the\.lack of Police Officers

outside       th^Vtirnsti l e s .

The    blue    folding doors w h i ch were           to my   right,    were   p e r i o dically   being

o pened and      closed to a l 1ow Senior Officers                into and out of the

 'round and also         to a llow the ejected fans out.

At    TSjje gate when opened,          I could se'e
                                               see a few O f f icers and Stewards.

At a p p ^ o 1440 h o u r s , the gate                  opened to eject aboul, six' fans           from

the    ground.        At this     po i nt ^alfrajjt one hundred and fifty fans           rushed the

p a rtially opened gate,             o ve r p owering    the Police and stewards.           The    gate

was    event u a l l y shut,      with approx       fifty fans from the surge           still     in

the    ground.

The    remainder       plus approx       two hundred more         fans were    standing     outside

the    gate.

At    this    point    the m o un te d Officers         realised what was happening and

joined by two other m o un te d Officers,                  who   came along    the back     of the

S o u t h S t a n d mana g e d to    clear totally the are a from the             cordon to

approx       thirty yards       towards Leppings Ln.             The area was under        total

c o nil
                     Sat
At approx       1430 FuJtw^,              and myself were         still   standing agai n s t      the

cordon when the blue              folding doors were         opened.      As the door opened,            I

could see       immediately         b^Kjnd a man who a p p e a r e d to be a steward and a

cou pTe^o^^RQ^i c e Officers .                large jrrowd realised what           had happened

and    started       to walk     thro u g h the <

          and myself     joined the       crowd and went         through the gates.

On the       other    side     of the gates     I was     very s u r prised to realise        that we

had    in fact       been a d mi tt ed to the ground un c h e c k e d at any         point.

In this area of the ground was a large open space ^H^th the turnstiles

to    5^    left and the            back     of the South S t a n d to rny r i g h t K                Immediately
                                                       Co                       T cwlU        •
m     fro\t      of me        I could see a tunnel                through w h i c h all        people a p p e a r e d

to    pass     through,

I could see            the ground          through the tunnel.

Also       to my      immediate        left and         right     1 could see two staircases                   w hich

appeared         to    lead to the higher                   tieXs.    These       gates were ma n n e d by-

stewards and               I did not see anyone                use \these entrances.

I was a gain s u rprised to see that                           this whole area,           a l t h o u g h a wash with
                                                              Oa rJ
'Liverpool         fans had only a handful                     of Police Officers,             who dicfc^not

d irect      fans.

ws. stewards were                on the other           entrances and the            largest         entrance,      the

t u n n e 1 was       unmanned.           It seemed the obvious                place    to head for.

We both headed for                  the      tunnel         and entered the ground en mass.                   As we

got    onto     the terracing                   I noticed how full it was.                 It was approx
            A o e t r€i>      Pen 3
     55 hours.             A l t h o ug h the    section full,          I     was still    forced about          half

way down the terracing                     by fans behind me.

           said to me,           "Let's move           left."

I said,        "No,        w \ c a n ’t go      right,       t h e r e ’s space    over there."

He star t e d to mode               right,       but    I was     forced down a couple more                   steps

and             was        forced up and          right.         1 this     point a l t hough         I had

a t t e n d e d many        crowded matches             before,       I was    scared and feeling              tired

at all       the exertion.                I could hear           people     s c r a m i n g , "Let    us out" and

there       seemed to be two               fans trying           to get out        the other         trying    to

get    in.

I noticed a man screaming,                        " I ’ve got a kid here",              and then        I saw a

young       girl      of about        eight years            old being      passed over our            heads    to the

front       of the         crowd.      I did not see her again.

I managed          to turn to                    ind force my way up to him,                   as     I thought we

As    I got near        I fell       onto the floor after             tripping    on the    barrier.

Luckily        enough    I was       strong    enough to g a i n          footing w ith the         help of

two    other     fans.        When    next to              I was    pinned to the barrier          by my

side.         It was    impossible       to move,           The    pressure was    becoming       intense.

I thought about              getting    over    the top of the barrier             but decided

agai n s t     it,

A middle        aged fair       haired man on the other                side of the barrier          turned

to me and        put both hands          on the       barrier and said,          “Here   son,     get

under."         I forced my under             the    barrier      and emerged on the other              side

in the'^tiace he had made.                    If he had not done

barrier and screaming.                  After       this    I lost him.

I noticed that the a r ^ we had been trying                            for was    fenced off,

During        tRl's^time the teams            came onto the         pitch and once a gain there

was a large           surge    forward as more             people   tried to get onto the

terracing.           E v e ryone was     screaming at the Police O f f icers who were

stood on the fence              looking       in.

I saw        people manage       to get over          the front X e n c e   but they were          led back,

into    the ground.            1 noticed after a while a wPC                near the       front    gate

start        shouting,       “Back,    back",       but    it was    impossible    to move at this

po i n t .

Immediately           in front       of me two       people went       down and    could not get          up.

I could not move to help them,                        I screamed at the Officers             to    let us

out.         I even got my warrant             card out and held          it up and shouted,             "I am

a Po l i c e Officer,          let us out now.             There are two     people      on the     floor

here    dying        now."

I didn't        see the two men again as the                      crowd was moving       from side       to

side and up and down.

I could see a lot of a c t ivity                    down by the       exit at the back,         but no one

was    being allo w e d out.

                  After      a few more minutes                    I saw what a p p e a r e d to be an Inspector                      run

                  onto     the     pitch and stop the match.                           I thought        "Thank God'.           The

                  pressure         seemed to ease a little and                          I was      h o r r i f i e d to see    people on

                  the ground.             I picked a young,                   semi     conscious man off the floor and

                  took     him to the fence                 to my          right where        he was       dragged over.         I turned

                  round to see a lot more                       s pacSt and at the front                   of the terraces           by the

                  lifeless and blue.                   I tried to pull a young male                          out from under           the

                  dead bodies            but he was           trapped by his               legs.

                  I was a s s i st ed by another                     man.        I started      tryi'nfc^to move dead bodies

                  from on top of h i m / S A s                  I did this,            I saw a grey old man                in a brown

                  t hro u g h the        fence.

                  I said,         "He    is dead."

                  He    did not         respond.        E ve r y t h i n g was         happening       so quickly.

                  I decided            I could not spend time                       reviving    him as       I thought        he was

                  dead and others            could be saved.

                  I pushed         the    pile of dead bodies                       with all my s t r ength and then the

                  person         pinned was       pulled           clear.           I picked him up with the help of

                  a n o t h er   and a g a i n he was              passed over          the top of the           right hand fence.

                  I went         back down the          terracing             to see a young w oman             pleading        for help.

                  She was         trapped by dead bodies.                           With help she got          out and        I lifted

                  her on my back.                She    looked             particularly sick and I decided                     it would

                  quicker         to    carry her out through the tunnel                             but    it was still        crowded

                  and    I was         getting    tired,           so we a gain            put her    over    into the        right    hand

                  section.             I. took off my jacket and threw                         it over the        fence.        A Police

                  Officer         caught    it.        As     I did this             I could see several           Police O f f icers

still     shielding       faciN^g^the       crowd.     I did not       see a Police Officer                  in

the area of terracing              I. w a s in. I could hear          someone      shouting at me,

"Use your        strength to get           them

out,"      1 was    starting       to get weak myself.

On the floor a bit            further       up I saw a young          dark haired male            on the

floor     holding what was a               ladies    black    handbag. Isaid,           "Give       rne your

arm",     but all     he did was           stare at me,       clinging onto        the h a n d b a g .       I

pulled     it off     him to get a grip and             lifted him to the back of the

terrace     .    He a p p e a r e d ^ o    be in shock,

I left him on the Xtai.rs si\t i ng down.

I .1ooked up to see a noNi^er pile of bodies                        by the front        exit with a

number     of Police Offic er s            pulling    them off.

T hings    seemed to be happen ing                slowly,

I went     over and a s s is t ed         two PCs.    After a short while             I felt myself

b e ing d ra g g e d away,

I turned        to see a Senior           Police Officer       who    said,    "Get away."

I said,     "I am a Police Officer",                 but the Officer          said,     "Fucking         get

lost    or y o u ’re in trouble."

He   passed me onto another                PC who forced me away.              I tried to explain

to him who        I was    but    I could not speak,            I got my warrant            card out

a g a i n and stooped down and started to                    cry.

After     I mana g e d to     pull myself          together    I went around the goal                 m outh

waste       ground             behind          a       tyre       place       bemind       the       North Stand/and                       we w a l k e d

together          to       the       back          of       the    Leppings          Ln s t a n d ,           it       would       be a b o u t          2.20

pm,(1420)             I    can’t          be       completely              sure      of    the       time          t h o u g h ^ As we

approached                the     turnstiles                     I saw a         very     large       crowd             of/fans,           I

would       estim ate             the      crowd a t               being         three     to     four         hundred,              probably

more,       one       thing          that          struck          me w a s       that     they       w ere/in               a rtass       rather

than an       orderly                queue,             I    think       there       were       four          mounted P . C . ’ s

attempting                to     push      the          crowd          into      some     sort       of       prdered             queue.           The    fans

weren’t        pleased               by b e i n g            pushed about               by t h e      horses,                the     crowd was

well    behaved,                we    had          joined          onto       the    back       of    the          crowd a n d become

split       up f r o m                     and          hisfriend.

        and       I       decided          that             we w o u l d      leave       the     crowd and                  go    into        the

g r o u n d when t h e y              had a l l              gone       in,      we w a l k e d      round             the    right        hand

corner       of       the       Leppings                Ln e n d        there       were       police          crash          barriers              there

and    there          were        P.C .’s              on    the       barriers         checking              passes,             I think           for

the    executive           boxes.

I stood       talking        to          the    P .C .’s            on       the       barrier          and    told        them       that          I was

a   police     officer           at       this       point          I       couldn’t             see    the    aforementioned

crowd,       people        kept          arriving          at       the       barrier             saying       that        it    was       hell          in

the    crowd     round       the          corner.

Just    next     to    the       barrier             there          was       a    large          blue     folding            gateway,              this

was    slightly        opened at                times          and          police       officers             were       walking           in       and

out,    I saw a b o u t          five          fans       climb             over       the       wall    and       be    ejected           a       few

minutes       later        through             the       gateway,             I    don’t          think       that       it     was a          case          of

people       attempting              to    get       in without                   tickets,             just    that        they       were

concerned       about        not          getting          in,          to    see       the       kick    off.

By t h i s    time     it    would             be a b o u t         2.40          pm ( 1 4 4 0 ) ,       I saw two P . C . ’ s

carrying       a young           lad       of    about          8       or    9 yrs          round       the       corner        towards                me,

he a p p e a r e d    as    if       h e ’ d hurt          his          arm       in    the       crowd       crush,          he was

followed       by a b o u t          ten       young       lads             saying       that          they    were a l l            his       mates.

The    hurt    l a d was         taken          into       the          ground          through          the       gate,        the       others

weren’t        let     in.       The       lad       was       white          with       short          fair       hair       I think              he    had

a   blue     pair     of    trousers              on and a L i v e r p o o l                      top    o n , c a n ’t              be    sure.

One    thing     that       I noticed                was       the          di/tiW t             lack ^ f      police           officers                at

this    point,        t h e re we re            the       mounted             o f f i e e r y about            3    or     4 foot          officers

covering       the     ground             round          the    corner             a w       6    officers          on t h e         barrier

was    standing        by.           I    can’t          remember             seeing             any    stewards          at     all       near          to

the    ground        but    I did          see       a    couple             of    stewards             on t h e        folding           g a t e . At

one    stage     the       gate          was    openec^afgaTn                     to    eject          someone          and a b o u t          15Q

fans    ran a t       the    gate          and       forced             their          way       in,    only       about        50    or       so       got

in,    two    extra        horses          c a me a n d         cleared                this       group       of    fans        from       the

area,      after      the    area          was       cleared                the    gate          was    opened a g a i n             and       left

open,      there      appeared             to     be      only          a    couple          of    P .C .’s        and a        couple             of

stewards       inside,           I       presumed          that             the    area          inside       would        give       access             to

some    further        turnstiles                 or      some          other          form       of    ticket          checking,              a    large

the        barrier             and    provided             a   space          for       me,     I slid             under          the    barrier               and

into           the       space.                  attempted             to      climb           over          the    barrier             and       had      his

A W.P.C.                 at    the    front          gate      was     shouting                to       get     back,         it    appeared               to       me

that           someone          had       fallen          to   the     floor,            but        I    can't          be    sure,          then       all         of

a    sudden              she    stopped          shouting.                I    don’t           know wh y.

the    bag          from h i s        hands and                 threw          it    onto          the       floor,             I    picked          h i m up

and    lifted             him t o         the       back        of    the       terrace,                I    left          him s i t t i n g           d o wn o u t

I    noticed          two P . C . ' s           pulling              at       the    bodies             on t h e           pile        next       to       the

exit       door       in    the       front             fence,        they          appeared                to    be       in       shock,        I went

over       and       helped,          I    cannot              describe             these          bodies             or    any        of      the     other

bodies          in    the       pen a t         all,           after          a short             time       I    felt          myself           being

pulled          away,       I       turned          and        saw a          senior          officer             I    don't           kn o w w h a t        rank,

he    said          'Get    away*          I said              'I'm       a    police             officer'             he       said        'Fucking             get

lost       or       your    in       trouble*              he       passed          me o v e r          to       another             P.C.         He       then

turned          to    help          with       the       bodies.

It    struck          me t h a t          he     (the          senior          officer)             was          in    a state              of    shock,          I

tried       to       explain          to       the       P.C.        who       I was          but       I    couldn't                speak        at       all.

I    fell       to    the       floor,           I started                crying             at    this          point,             I was        very

annoyed             and    couldn't             do a n y t h i n g ,            I managed t o                     pull              myself        together,

by t h i s       point       there          were       dead and             injured           fans       all       over          the       goalmouth

area.

I went          over    to    a middle                aged male             and a t te m p te d           to       revive             him,       he    was

dead,       I    cannot       describe                him a t         all,       I then          met                   on t h e        pitch,          I

bumped          into    him       in    a    daze,          we w e n t          round        together             trying          to       assist

fans     but      they       were       already             dead.

On t h e / p i t c h ,       just       outside             the       penalty          area        I s a w a man i n                   his       late

£Q*s,       he    had on dark                trousers                and a       denim        or    sim ilar            coloured                shirt       on

with     no      shoes,       I went             over       to       him,       he wa s       obviously                dead,          he was

very     blue      in    the       face,          I    decided             to    cover        h i m up        I    started             to/open

his    shirt       and       put       it    over          his       face.       I    couldn't           do       it    so       iX ore          it

open,       two    fans       cam e u p t o                me a n d a s k e d          what        I was          doing/f         I    told       them

and    they       went       away.          As    I    tore          his    shirt          open h i s         wallet             cam e      out,       I

put    it       on him s o         he       could          be       identified,              I'd    put       his       shirt          over       his

face,       thinking          about          this          now t h i s          ma y h a v e       looked          like          I was          looting

the    dead.       I walked             over          to    where          my c o a t        was and          I    picked             it    up,

everything             was    still          in       it,       the    senior          officer          who        swore          at       me    c a me

over    and a p o l o g i s e d             to    me,       I accept             this,        I stayed             on t h e           ground          for

at    least       another          half          an hour.

We w a l k e d     out       of    the       ground             of    my own           accord,           I did see L iverpool                          fans

shouting          at    police,             and       photographers                   on t h e      pitch          but       I    didn't          see

any    violence          or a n y t h i n g            of       a    criminal              nature.

I    think       that    a    contributory                      factor          in t h i s    incident                 was t h e           fact

that    Liverpool             were a l l o c a t e d                 the    small          end     of    the       ground and                   this       was

far    too       small.

I    had met                  and       his       friend             inside/the              ground and                they       were          okay,

Other       contributory                factors             a reY ^ a /f a p p a r e n t           lack       of       police          manpower

and    organisation                outside             the          ground,          the     fact       that       the       gate          was    opened

allowing          the    crowd t o               suddenljy            fill        into       the    stadium             and o n ce

the    gate       was    opened a                complete             lack       of    directions                 from       the       police          or
                                                                                                                                                    PAGE 10

         stewards          and    no s i g n p o s t s              to       direct      fans         to   ojfner    parts          of    the

         terracing.              I feel             that       the       police        and       stewards         failed        to       respond       to

         the    problems          in       time          and    I    don't          think        that      the    gam e s h o u l d        have       been

         started,          also       once          the    gam e w a s          started           I    feel      that     there          was a       lack

         of    c ommun i c a t i o n .

         The    emphasis          after             the    tragedy             had o c c u r r e d         seemed        to    be    placed         upon

         preventing          crowd v i o l e n c e                  rather          than a s s i s t i n g       with         first       aid.

         As a     result         of    the          incident             I    received

                             I    didn't                receive          any m ed ical            attention.

         On Mo n d a y      17th       April             1989       (170489)           at    my hom e a d d r e s s            I wrote          do wn my

         have     a more         clear          view       of       what       happened,              I wrote       these

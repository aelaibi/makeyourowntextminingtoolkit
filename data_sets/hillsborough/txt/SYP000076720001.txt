            believe      my ticket was             not    checked was             because            the steward was         trying

            to get     people        in, and he was a c t u a l l y               c ontrolling            the turnstile.

    go    into the stands.



    It was at this time,               I looked to my            left a nd saw that a c on ce rt in a

            I then     came out of the              toilet with                   a n d went     to proceed out           of

            the    stands,      we   saw a y oung          Pakistani      lad,     sitting      on the floor        down

            below,     he a pp ea re d to be          in pain,       because      he was       crying.



                      and    I a p pr o a c h e d   him,    it was obvious          that his      leg was     injured

            a n d he was      in pain,        he was       very d is tr e ss e d and       informed us he had             been

            separated        from his friends,              he was a p p r o x i m a t e l y   12 years    of age,

            black     short hair,         slight      build,      I think       he was wearing        denim jeans,

            and a     ' T ’ shirt,       1 c a n ’t remember any further                 details,




sv                    and myself a s s i s t e d       him by giving            him a    chair    lift,    and     carr ie d

            him out      into L ep pi ng s Ln,         we were       c on fr on te d by a p pr o xi m a t e l y   forty

            P o l i c e m e n standing      nearby and we a sked one of them where we should

            take     him.     One d ir ec t ed       us to a group of            people who were          being

            attended        to by St J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e , sitting          outside      the ground,        we

            sat    him down nearby and he was                   then a t t e n d e d to.



                      and myself        then w a l k e d towards          the    coach park,       leaving on ipur!
                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                   S2098

            own accord,             asking      people    on the wa y      if we    could use the       phone.



            We    e ve n t u a ll y got      back    to the      coach    park,    everyone    in our   party was

            a c c o u n t e d for and we          b egan the journey          back   home.     It was   on the way

            home     via the           radio,    that    I was    fully aware       of the    people    that had died



            Dur i n g my time at the                ground,      I saw no     criminal       offences   being

             committed,           and no fans        behaving      badly,



             I w o u l d say that           there are      two m a j o / factors a s to why the tragedy

            happened,            one    bei ng that      the Footjptil A s s o c i a t i o n was w ar n ed    by

            Li ve r p o o l      Footbal 1 that         the end Jbf      the gr ou nd given to the L iv erpool

            fans was            i n a d e q u a t e , they w e re /a ls o w a r n ed about   the   number    of    farts
            r                                                    /

            The      second major           factor was the         poli/ing,       that was    not as    good as the

            year     before,           and the gate that w a s / o p e n e d was       responsible      for       the

      to    the    ground         by    car,      from my          h o me    to    the       ground.         We       encountered              a

      minor       delay      en    route         and    I believe            this       to    be     due    to    the       sheer       volume

      of    fans     travelling             to    the    ground.




      My    son and        I intended             to    stop       on the         way    to     go    to a       public          house,

      high    spirits,            they were            all    standing            drinking           from    pint          glasses.            At

      this    p o int      however,           there      were       no      signs       of a n y      disorder,             as    we    got

      c l W r      towards         the      ground,          by    now      on    foot       haVing        parked          our    car     some

      three       qtfarters        of a m i l e         away.           I noted         a p p r o x i m K t e 1v 5- per           cent        of

      the    supporters            travelling            towards            the    grounds           were    c:arr-r^y i n q a n d

c-r   I noticed whilst                  walking         down a          considerable               amount        of    urciacfceptab1 e

      they    were      not       discreet         in w h a t       they were            doing.            I saw       other       youths

      who    were     obviously             drunk.           In     my opinion            again       their       behaviour              was

      unacceptable.                Getting         closer            to the g r o u n d .          I saw a        number          of     Police

      cans    before         going         on,    pri o r     to    noticrsw            the    Police        I remember                passing

side     and      searching,              I think            these         fans    felt       it was          these       Police

    son a nd about              t h is        time,       we     saw a f r i e n d           who       I h a v e n ’t s e e n        for

    sometime                                                   wh o      lives      m                                                     al 1

    three        oKjis        stood       talking             u nt i l    the    players            kicked         off.



    Whilst        we     were       standing             talking          I noticed              t h at     each     time      a Police

^   pfficer         came       by    some       o ^ the          i/lans s u r r o u n d i n g          us    hurled abuse             at       them,

    their        language           was       obscenK^'id                offensive,              I witnessed             something             I have

    never        seen     before,             there       was      hatred        in t h e i r          eyes       and    they       hurled       the

    a b use      w i t h s u c h v e n o m , the               b e h a v i o u r o f t h is            s rna 11    section,          a b o u t si x

    or     seven       I found           disturbing              and appalling,                   they were             so   violent.            I

    would        describe           these       people           as      males      of     different              ages ,      there       was

    approximately               seven          of    them        in t o t a l       sitting            around        us at         points       they
                                                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                                                     S2080

were      between approximately                           40    to 5 0 y e a r s          of    age,       th is      fa ct     also

surprised            me,       because         although           t h is    behaviour               is    not      expected          from

anyone,         I        would certainly                  e x p e c t it   less        from      these        older        men.       One

fan was         a        youth screaming                  "City Guard".




The    match         started           on     tiirhsyand a f t e r          three         to    four       minutes          into      the

game      I noticed             that        some     fansXhad           spilled           from       the     terraced area               o nt o

t he   surrounding               area         of    the     pitcnSv         I noticed               prior       to    t hi s    about       the

time      of    kick       off       there         was    a surge          of    t   4^ is m o v e       forward        in the W e s t

S t and     t e r r a c e , I made             no a s s u m p t i o n at             this      time       t ha t     the    surge       and

the    spillage            of    fans         was    c o n n e c t e d at        a l l,       but    I thought             it m o s t    odd

that      the       match       was     allowed           to    proceed with                  f ans,      sitting          and milling

about       the          pitch area.                I noticed              when       the      football            match       play went

towards         th e      end        n e ar    to    the     West Stand              that      the     fans        w e r e right      on      the

touch       line.




The    first         thing       I recollect                was     a St J o h n ' s           Ambulance             person,

escorting            a    c a s u a 1 1y w i t h         a n a p p a r e n 1 1y        broken        arrn.




The    next         series       of      events          was    that       the       g am e    was       suddenly          stopped       and       I

saw    fans         spilling           onto        the    pitch,        s ome        fans      were       being       pulled         back     up

into      the       West       Stand        seats,        the     players            began      to       le ave      the    pitch,       and

the    Police            came    onto^she            pitch        and      formed         a    cordon along                the N o r t h

Stand       from         the    Spion         Kop \o        the     halfway            line     and across             the      pitch       to

the    players            entrance,            the       Police      h ad       done      this       because,          as      the    fans

spilled         out       the    Nottingham               F a n s Ihi^xan c h an t yng a n d                 this      spurred          s ome

Liverpool            fans       to     ru n    towards          the N o t t i n g n a m         Forest          end.        One m a n       in

particular               got    to     the     other        end    he was            a middle            aged man and             I later

saw    him      outside          the        ground,         flat     on     his       back      asleep          and    obviously

           The      fans         I mentioned, earlier,                      the     six        or    seven again                hurled     abuse         at

            The    area          in f r o n t      of    the       West     S t and was             t ot a l    chaos,          it was     a sea         of

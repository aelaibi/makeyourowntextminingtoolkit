Dear Sir/Madam

RE: JOINT HILLSBOROUGH STATEMENT

I enclose for your attention a copy of a Statement which has
recently been signed by the leaders of Liverpool and Nottingham
City Council and the Chairman of Liverpool and Nottingham Forest
Football Clubs concerning the established causes of the
Hillsborough Disaster.  The Statement is a formal response to
allegations recently made blaming Liverpool supporters for the
Disaster and may be of interest to Members of your Authority.

Yours faithfully




Ken Corns
Head of Committee and Members Services ^

            JOINT STATEMENT BY LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB
          NOTTINGHAM FOREST FOOTBALL CLUB AND LIVERPOOL
                   AND NOTTINGHAM CITY COUNCILS

WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IN THE PAST YEAR CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS HAVE
BEEN MADE BY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS TO DISMISS OR DISTORT THE
FINDINGS OF LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR WITH REGARD TO THE CAUSES OF THE
HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER BY PLACING BLAME ON LIVERPOOL F.C.
SUPPORTERS, DESPITE THE OVERWHELMING CONTRARY EVIDENCE GATHERED BY
THE JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION;

THEREFORE ON BEHALF OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO STILL SUFFER TODAY AS A
RESULT OF HILLSBOROUGH AND WHO HAVE NEEDLESSLY BEEN CAUSED
ADDITIONAL PAIN BY THESE GRATUITOUS AND OFFENSIVE COMMENTS WE
CHOOSE TO RENEW THE SPECIAL BONDS FORMED BETWEEN THE TWO CLUBS AND
THE TWO CITIES FOLLOWING THE DISASTER BY PUBLICALLY PLACING ON
RECORD OUR JOINT ENDORSEMENT OF THE CONCLUSIONS OF LORD JUSTICE
TAYLOR AND HIS IDENTIFICATION OF THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPAL FACTORS
WHICH IN COMBINATION CREATED THE TRAGEDY OF APRIL 15TH, 1989:-

    1- THE LAYOUT OF THE LEPPINGS LANE END
    2- LACK OF FIXED CAPACITIES FOR THE PENS
    3. LACK OF EFFECTIVE MONITORING OF THE TERRACES
    4- BUILD-UP AT THE TURNSTILES AND INADEQUATE TURNSTILE
       FACILITIES
    5. THE BLUNDER ON OPENING THE GATES AND FAILURE TO CLOSE THE
       CENTRAL TUNNEL
    6* THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE BARRIER SYSTEM IN PEN 3
    7. THE CRUSHING IN PENS 3 AND 4 WAS NOT RECOGNISED
    8. THE SLOW RESPONSE OF THE POLICE
    9. THE PERIMETER GATES WERE TOO SMALL

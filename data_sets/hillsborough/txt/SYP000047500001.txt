  Mr K S Anderson
  Assistant Chief Constable
  South Yorkshire Police

  Dear Mr Anderson

  I enclose a letter received from the Solicitors representing Mr Edward
  Spearritt whose son Adam aged 14 years died in the Hillsborough disaster.

  You will be aware that Mr Spearritt has made an earlier complaint
  specifically against Police Constable 417 Illingworth.  I have read the
  content of this current letter and can provide you with the following
  information.

  Firstly after receipt of his original letter of complaint dated 18
  September 1989, Mr Spearritt was interviewed by Detective Superintendent
  Beechey on 29 September 1989. A formal statement of complaint was made
  which only concerned the actions of PC Illingworth. Mr Spearritt was asked
  if he had any other complaints to formally make. He did not do so.

  It is correct to say that in general conversation with Detective
  Superintendent Beechey the matters referred to in the letter now sent were
  discussed but there was no suggestion of a complaint being made.

 I also enclose a copy of the transcript from the Inquest of 20 April 1990
 which makes reference to this matter.  In addition to assist I enclose
 copies of the statements made by Mr McNiven and Mr Curran that refer to the
 day in question.

 I have spoken to another solicitor with the firm, Mr Woods, in the absence
 of Mr Fraser and explained the content of the letter and any action deemed
 necessary is in your hands.


                                                                    Continued...




  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
                                     2   .

If I can be of further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me at
Nechells direct on 021 359 1742.

Yours sincerely




M J FOSTER
DETECTIVE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT

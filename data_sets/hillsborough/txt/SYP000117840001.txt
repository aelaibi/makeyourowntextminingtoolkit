Immediately             following             the     briefing          we    were        issued with                a    pack meal

At    t ha t    briefing           I asked          him what          our     duties           were       in    case       of a n

the    area        of    the       North        Stand          and       the L e p p i n g s        Lane       sections          were

almost          deserted.                I had       expected              that        for    such an          important          match

that       people        would           be a n x i o u s        to      gain     a good           vantage          point       and

schedule           their          day     to    arrive           fairly          early.

I had        been walking                 between             the      barriers          doing          general       patrol          duties

and whilst              taking           to    officers             on     the     barrier          at    the       Leppings          Lane

end    there        did       not        appear          to    be a n y         obvious           problems          although          I was

informed           t ha t     some        people          were         not      exactly           pleased       to    be    denied

access          through           the     Sterile             Area       and     required           to w a l k       around       the

ground          in o r d e r       to     get       to    the       South Stand.                   In f a ct        any    families

who    found        themselves                 in the          wrong          area were            escorted          through          the a r e a

at    fairly        frequent               intervals.

At    approximately                    2.30     pm       (1430)          Detective            Superintendent                McKay,

instructed              me    to       s t a n d at a           p oi n t      between         the       two    barriers          and    to

keep       an    eye     on       th e    behaviour              of      th e    c r o w d at       the L e p p i n g s         Lane    end.

He    f e a r e d at         t h at      time       the       officers           on duty           there       might       be    overrun

and    require           immediate              assistance,                     I was        to    render       assistance             if

required,           and also              to    inform           other          officers           if    the    situation

warranted           further              reinforcements.

up to        the    barrier,,                 1 could          see       immediately               that       the    officers          th e r e

were       under        pressure.               There          were        hundreds           of    people          outside       the

turnstiles              and       I could           see       th a t     some      people          in    civilian          clothing          ha d

taken        refuge          behind           the    barriers              and     were       obviously             distressed          by

what       was     happening.                  The       situation was                  extremely             tense       and    the m o o d

of    the       supporters               was    one       of     hostility              and anger             towards       the       Police.

People        were        shouting               and    swearing              at     us a n d all           in all          things

appeared           to     foe r a p i d l y           getting           out     of      hand.         It s h o u l d        be    pointed           out

that     I could              not        se e    directly           onto        the       turnstiles             at    Leppings           Lane,.

a)                     because            of     the    volume           of     supporters             and

b)                     because            the        wall     at    that        point         turns        sharply          r i gh t     thereby

                       denying            any        view     of    the       turnstiles              themselves.

I heard           people            demanding           entry           to    the       ground        and    shouting             and

screaming.              1 could             see       people        climbing              up th e      perimeter             wall        to    gain

access        and       although                on    the     perifery             of     the    crowd       I could             feel     the

resentment              and         anger        t he r e .        I could also                 see a n d        feel       fear.         I

myself        was       very         apprehensive                  and       feared        for       the    safety          of     people

trapped           at    the         front        of    the     crowd          at     the      w al l s .

refer        to    events            before           or a f t e r       the       kick       off     from       this       point        on.

I think           came        through            the     sterile             area and           into       the    crowd          in a n       effort

to P o l i c e         the      people           back       from        the     turnstiles             and       therefore             relieve

th e    pressure              at     the        walls.         The       large          blue     g a te     immediately                in f ront

of me        opened           fractionally                  to a l l o w        a Police             Officer          either        to    e n t er

or     l eave      the        ground and               I could           se e      about        three       Police          helmets

immediatley               in        front        of    it.         The       crowd        forced       the       gate       open       further

and     spilled           in        to    the        ground.            1 left          the     barrier          and    ran to           the

front        of    the        gate        to     try     to    hold          the     f a ns     back.        I was          brushed aside

and almost              trampled myself.                           A mounted              officer          arrived          and     he    forced

the     crowd          b a ck       allowing           the     gates          to     be    shut       again.           As    I returned

to     the    barrier               Liverpool            supporters                were       shouting           and    swearing              at

us.      A number               of       people        came        to    the       barrier           and asked          to       be a l l o w e d

into     the       sterile               a r e a as     they were               obviously             very       frightened              of w ha t

announcement                 to    the          effect          that       the     start       of     the       game         had    been

delayed        by       15 m i n u t e s             and       that       it w o u l d       not    start         until        3.15       pm       (1515)

This     seemed          to       have          a    little          calming         effect         on     the      people          outside             but

the     numbers          did       not          appear          to    be     going       down and            in f a c t        others

appeared           to    be a r r i v i n g               all    the       t i me.       A number            of     these          late

arrivals           were       obviously                   s o m e w h a t the       worse      for          drink and              I was          amazed

at     the    behaviour                of       these           people who seemed                  to       think that              they          could

arrive        at    a football                      ground       15 m i n u t e s        before           the     scheduled            kick            off

and     people          were       becoming                more       agitated           and       distressed.                 It w a s

obvious        to me          that          if       the       pressure           was    not       relieved           in s o m e       way         then

we     would       be    facing             a       serious          public        disorder             situation with                 an

excessive           amount             of           casualties.             I did       in fact             see a n u m b e r          of         people

who     were       nursing             some          minor           injuries such            as     injured             legs       etc       at       that

Suddenly           the       gates          in       front       of       the     barrier          were      opened           and     the         c r o wd

were     allowed             unrestricted                      entry.           I remember              passing          a    comment             to

another        officer             to       the       effect          that        I feared          the      consequences                 of       t hi s

because        n o ne        of    the          people          now       streaming           inside         ha d     been         searched             and

there        was    no w a y           of       knowing          what        weapons          had       been      taken        i nside.

1 saw        one m a n        walk          towards             the       gate     carrying           a    can of            beer.        I

stopped        him and             took             him    to    one       side      and      removed           the      can       from       him.

I poured           the       beer       away and                threw        the     empty         can     into       the      sterile

area.         I began             to    search             hi m a n d        he    handed          me a n o t h e r          can a n d        s a id

The    volume         of     noise          from       the     ground         suddenly            rose a n d         I l o o k e d at my

watch       to    see      th e      time     but        discovered              that       I had       earlier         removed            it       in

anticipation               of     trouble,             but     someone           t o l d me       t h at     it w a s      a 3       o'clock

(1500)       and      I realised                  t h a t the      start         of     the      g a me      ha d    not      been delayed.

This    gave a d d e d            impetus           to the           f an s   still          outside          to     hurry       to get

inside       and although                   there        was    not      a surge            as    such,       many      peoples

Suddenly          the      front        of        th e   a r e a at L e p p i n g s          Lane       was     e m p t y , it

move    away and a                number          of     critical           comments             on    the     behaviour             of    both

the    Police         and       the     supporters              were        made.           Comments           s u c h as       "Those

available          officers             were        to    go    to     the       pi t ch .        I ran,        together             with

others,          through          the       sterile          area      to     the      gate       situated           n ex t    to     the

requirement             but       as    I made           my way        down       the       steps       towards         the      pitch          I

Leppings         Lane       and       I could          see       officers          helping          people         to    sit    down

heard      him       says      " W e ’ re       talking          fatalities             in t h e r e . "      and       1 looked

properly         at     the      scene          for    the       first        ti me.         I can      only       describe              what        I

s a w as     horrific            and appalling.                     1    saw an         emergency            gate,       which           wa s

open,      and       the    offices             there      were         helping         people         out    of     the     terraces,,

bu t   the      area       immediately                in f r o n t       of    the      g a te    was     packed         solid           with

what    appeared            to      be     fallen          bodies.            People         were      climbing          over        the

perimeter            fencing          and       in the       process           were      actually            standing          on t h o s e

in f r o n t     at     th e     wire.           I saw young               people        in the         ma i n ,     pressed

t ightly        up a g a i ns t          t he f e nc i ng .             !iy e y e s     rested         on a y o u n g       girl          who

was    pinned against                    the     wi r e .        She       was     blue,      her      e ye s w e r e      staring

blankly and             vomit         was       stuck       to    her      face.         The       fence      appeared              to    bulge

with    the w e i g h t          of      the b o d i e s     pressed             against         it.      1       knew     then        that

people       were       either           dead         or   seriously              injured         in that crowd.                I    saw

people       actually            climbing             on    top    of      others        in o r d e r        to    reach       the        fence

and    climb         over      to     safety.              I initially              f e lt    a n g r y at        them     because

they    did      not       seem       to    care       that       their        actions           were     contributing                   to     the

crush      at    the       front         but     the       faces        were      so    scared         that       .1 r e a l i s e d      they

were    only         trying         to     find       safety       for        themselves.               I climbed           onto          the

avertising            hoardings             and       began       to     help      the       people      over        the     fencing,

but    it w a s       difficult             because          their         clothing           was      being       snagged          and

they    were         cutting          themselves             on the           ends      of    the      wires.           1 managed               to

climb      on to        the      top       of    the       fence        and      I lay a c r o s s       the       top     facing             into

the    crowd.           Another            p er so n ,      I think           a Police           Officer          held     onto          my

legs    to a n c h o r         me.         As    1 looked           into       the      crowd       I saw         the    density              of

the    fence           and      climb        out       themselves.                     I did         not        want        anyone          else       to

stand        on    the       girl       at     the         front       of       th e    fence           although             I    knew           in m y

mind    t ha t         she      was     already             de ad.          1    d o n ’t k n o w w h y                th at      was        the

I remember              shouting             at     the      people             further            back         to     go    bake       out       of       the

terracing              but      th e    noise          was       so    great           and        in t h e i r         panic       1 d o n ’t t h i n k

looked        into        hi s         face       and mouthed, "Hang                        on,       hang        on"       but     I don't                know

what     eventually                    happened             to    him.         1 d o n ’t k n o w           h ow        1 was       feeling                then

X was        too       busy      to     feel        anything               I expect.                 1 think            that       everyone                at

that     wire          was      just     desperate                to       either           get      out        themselves              or       get

others        out.           There       was        certainly               no       t i me       for      thinking              about       what          w as

going        on a r o u n d        me.         As      I helped             someone               o v er    the        fence       I slipped

back    and        fell         off     the       fe n ce ,       thankfully                  onto         the       perimeter              track          and

another           officer              took       my       place.           Im o v e d        a    little            f u r t h e r up a n d            I

climb        b ac k     onto       the       fence          top an d            leaned            over      into        the       crowd again.

1 was        shouting            at     th e      people          to       go    back         and       I eventually                   saw       some

appear        to       ease      significantly.                        1 do          not      know         how       long        I remained                on

the    fen ce .           I don't            even          know       if    1 did           help anyone                 over       or       if    1 j u st

spent        the       t i me    shouting              at    people             but     eventually                   1 either           slipped             off

or    climbed           off      and     found myself                      on    the        perimeter                track        and       I could

see    people           all      around           me       dazed       and       distressed.                     Some        were       lyi n g        on

the    grass           and      were     not        moving.                I looked               into      the        crowd a gain               and       saw

anywhere.              There         were      several                people          kicking             at    the       fence       and    I

looked       back        towards           the      pitch and                   saw a y oung               Policewoman                giving

artificial             respiration                 to a y o u n g               lad of a b o u t               13 or       14 y e a r s .            A

St.    Johns          Ambulanceman                 was       assisting                with       cardiac             massage          and    the

P o l i c e w o m a n was         obviously              distressed                   and       was       crying.

I went       to       them and          told        the P o l i c e w o m a n               that          I would          take       over       to

give     her      a    rest       and      I carried                  out       mouth       to m o u t h         resuscitation                   on the

came     across          and      told        us    he w a s           a doctor             and       he       certified          the       lad

dead .       I looked             around           and       saw       that        people         were          being       pulled          out- of

th e   area       where         the     emergency                 gate          w a s , and       I went             to    the    gate       to

assist.           It w a s        a scene           of       utter          despair             and       frantic          purpose          and

people,         both      t he       dead      and       the          living          were       being          passed          out    along             a

production             line.           I carried                 one m a n        to    the       grass          behind          the       goal          area

and    laid       hi m    on      the      ground.                I    felt       for       a    pulse and                thought          that          I

could     detect          a slight             movement                and       with       the       asistance             of a S e r g e a n t

Sergeant          did m o u t h         to m o u t h             for       a time       then          a    lad w h o        said       that          he

was    a medical            student            asked             if he          could       help.              I told       him       to    carry             on

with mouth             to m o u t h        resuscitation                        whilst          I continued                with       the    cardiac

massage.              Another          man     came          by a n d           1 asked          him       to t r y        to    fetch       some

oxygen.           He     c a me      ba c k    with          a    cylinder             but       even          that       placed       on    the

casualty's             mouth         did      nothing.                 He       was    also       certified                dead       by a d o c t o r .

eased.          The      fence         had     been          ripped             away    from          the       supporting             columns

and    not      cut.        A     number           of    firemen were                   entering                the       ground       and       1

cannot        remember           exaclty          what    I d i d at        t h is    point.           1 vividly          recall

that     at      one    point         during       the    time       I was       either         giving       cardiac

m a s s a g e , or      just      afterwards,             1 looked          towards         the       pitch and          saw a

l arge      number         of    people       running          towards       the S p i o n Kop»                That      was    the

time     I really            felt      fear,       because          I honestly           believed         that      there       was

going       to    be a m a s s         riot       between       the L i v e r p o o l       and N ot ti ng ha m           Forest

fans     on the         Hop which            would       have       resulted         in h u n d r e d s      of    casualties.

Fortunately,               someone          had    taken       the       appropriate            action       and    Officers

were     taking         up      position          between       the       fans     and managed            to      stop    the

rush.         The      Liverpool            fans    were       obviously           frantic        with       distress          and

anger       and     t he     chanting         of    the F o r e s t        fans      obviously          caused        them

further          offence         with       the    consequent             results.          The       fans     were

shepherded             b a ck    towards          the    Leppings          Lane      end    of    the     ground,         and       some

of    the m o r e       astute         amongst          them wit h         other      officers,           started         to     tear

at    the     advertising              hoardings          to m a k e       stretchers            to    carry       people        off

the    pitch.

As    far as        I could           see    the    injured, a n d          the      dead were          being       attended            to

and    I j us t        went      to    injured          fans    asking        if     I could          help.        One    lad was

laid     out      on    the      grass       and    1 initially             thought         t ha t     he was       dead       but as

I approached               him    he m o a n e d a n d         I bent       down      to    him.        He     opened      his

eyes     and      began         gasping       for       breath and          1 loosened            his     clothing         for

him.        I remained            with       him whilst             he    recovered         his       breath       and    then

helped        him      over      to    the    goal       area and          left      him    in the        care      of    a St.

           state        they       took    great         offence             at    this .        I don't           think       the     m a n wa s

           really        smiling,          it w a s        more         an    expression           of     embarrassment                 than       of

           abuse        and    1 went         to    him and             spoke       to    him.         Hi s    friends          began       to

           complain           to me       t h at    he     had       done         nothing        and    I asked           him     to    l e av e    the

           Stand        for    a while          and      return when                thi ngs       had     cooled          down a        l it tl e .

           He    h ad    the       good    sense         to       t a ke m y a d v i c e         and    the        s i t u a t i o n was

           alleviated.

           Shortly        afterwards               I wqnt          to a n o t h e r       m a n , an      elderly          on e      this     time

           who    had a p p a r e n t l y          been       heard          shouting        abuse        towards          some        of   the

           Liverpool           supporters             on      the       pit ch .         Even     the F o r e s t         fans       were     agitated

           by    him and           he w a s     advised            in no          uncertain        terms           what    the       consequences

           of a n y      continued abuse                   would         be,       both     to    himself           and    to     the       situation

           g e n e rally.

           Even     now       I cannot          understand               th e      actions        of    those?        section          of    the

           Liverpool           fans       who      turned          up    late       at    the     ground           and    demanded          entry         in

           s u c h a way.            The      hostility              generated            there        was     unnerving             and     they       d id

           not    seem        to    consider          the         instructions              of    the P o l i c e         to    be     of   any

           consequence.                There        was       a    complete          and     utter        breakdown             of     law a n d

           order        and anarchy             ruled         instead.              Even     whilst           on    the    fencing          trying

           to    get     people        out,        we,     the       Police         were     subject           to     constant          abuse       and

           missiles           were     t h r o w n at         us,,       I cannot           believe           that       people        would       do

           that    at     a time          when      others           were         dying     and    obviously              seriously           injured.

 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL



 Dear Sirs,

 Our solicitors, Freshfield, have requested that all those
 Council Members who attended the above Semi Final,
 Liverpool V Nottingham Forest, should submit a report
 including any information which you may consider
 relevant, i.e. timings, any personal comments that were
 made to you and your own observations.

 I would stress that at this stage these reports will be
 merely to provide further background to the solicitors
 and if it is felt that any of the information received
 should be included in any presentation to the enquiry,
 you will be contacted and a statement will be prepared
 for your approval.

 This information is required as soon as possible.

 In the event you did not attend the match but obtained
 tickets for somebody else who has any relevant comments,
 we shall be pleased to receive these.

 Your assistance in this matter is appreciated.

 Yours faithfully



                                                                                      c.c.    Freshfields

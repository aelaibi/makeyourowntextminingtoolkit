    the      other        one    had       his    face     covered and               I believe           he was        dead.         I

    cannot          remember          anything        else about               either        of    them.       I know         his        f ac e

I continued              to w a l k    around        trying        to    help     ot h e r s .     I did       notice          the

the     different             actions    of     the P o l i c e .         Some       were     standing         in a       line

desperately              to    get    people       out.




I didn't           know what          happened        next.         I do       not    remember          helping         anyone

else a nd          I do n ' t    even    remember           leaving        the       ground       or    how    I got       out       of

th e    ground.           I was       very worried about                                                      who       I had    come

At     no    time     did      I see a       surge      in the          crowd     in the L e p p i n g s           Ln    standing

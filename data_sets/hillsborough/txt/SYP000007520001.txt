       am    (Saturday             13 A p r i l       1989)       at    Southport              Railway         Station             from m y           home

       address                                                        my m o ther         g ave     me    a    lift          in her         car.

       We    all       caught       th e      8 .5 0 a m    train       from Southport                   to L i v e r p o o l          Centre,            we

       walked          over       to L i m e     Street          Liverpoo 1 and                caught         a train          to S h e f f i e l d

       arriving             about       12.13pm.

       I already             had a       ticket        to     the m a t c h        obtained             from my             brother         who       is a

       Liverpool             Season        ticket          ho 1 der     a n d as        such       entitled automatically                                 to a

       Semi-Final             ticket.            He    could          not    go    to     the      match       so       he    s o l d me         this

       ticket          for    its       face     value       of £ 6 . 0 0 ,        th e      ticket       was          for    the      terraces

       standing,             Leppings           Lane       End.

       When       we    got       off    the     t rai n at           Sheffield           the re w e r e           a    lot    of P o l i c e

       about,          they       searched         those         of    us w e a r i n g        baggy      clothes             and      carrying

       ba gs.          They       told     us    they       were       searching             for    inflatable                to ys      as      these

       would       not       be a l l o w e d      into       the      ground.            I was         surprised             at    this         p o int


rr®-   as    I expected              they were             going       to    check        to    see      if we          had     tickets           as

       they       had       done     the      year     t>ef o r e , w h e n        if y o u        d 1 d noI           have    a t :i.c k et          you

       were       not a l l o w e d        to    go    to     the      ground.            After         the    s e a r c h we          were       put       on

       a    specially             organised           double          decker       bus       which       t oo k        us    directly            to       the

       ground,          there        were       two    uniform          Policemen              acting         as       escorts         on     the         bus

       w it h u s .

       At    no    t ime      from       my arrival              poin t      in S h e f f i e l d        and       the       ground         or    indeed

       once       inside          the    ground        did       I witness             any     disorder,               fighting          or

       d ru n k e n e s s .

       The    bus       dropped          us     off    at    the       Leppings           Lane      e n d at           about       12.30pm            I

       could       see       the    turnstiles              from my          drop       off     point         and       at    t h is     time         the

       queues          were       pratically           non-existent.

       There       were       a    lot     of P o l i c e        about       at    t his       t i me    and       they       told       us      to

       either          go    straight           into       the    ground          or    h ave      a walk          around,          we      were          told

       not    to       hang       around        the    ga te s .        We    decided           not      to    go       into       the      ground

       and    as       it    happened           one    of m y         friends                                           wanted         to met

s om e o n e at            the N o t t i n g h a m Forest         end      (SPION KOP > .          We made         our way

there,             on route we we re s t o p p e d a bout                   four times          by the Police and my

bag was              searched,         the Police were             however         very friendly.

We       eventually             ended up in a Park                to the         rear    of the S o u t h Stand and

spent             sometime       sitt i n g around.             We then w a l k e d           back to L e p pings Lane

a r r i v i n g at about               1.3 0 p m ,                                 left us at this                junction        he

had a ticket                   for    the S P I O N K O P .

On m y arrival                  back at L e p p i n g s       Lane        there were          quite a few          people

m i l l i n g ar o u n d         but the a r e a ar o u n d the t u r n s t i l e s were                    relatively

clear.               There were          still       quite a few P o l i c e m e n about                including
rs.-..,— ..


O ff i c e r s         on horses.

We        decided          to go straight             in and as we a p p r o a c h e d            the      turnstiles,       I

saw at              least      two Po 1 i cemen searching                  supporters.            In fact         they

a c t u a l l y a r re s t e d a lad just                  in front         of us,       h e ’d dropped           something       on

the            floor    just        prior    to his      turn to          be searched,          the Police          saw this

and            ret r i e v e d what      he dropped.            I presumed          it to be drugs.                 The    two

Policemen               took     him away and a girl                  that was w ith him.

I then went                 through the           t u rnstile and handed my ticket                          in,    the stub

was            r e t urned to me as            per the       proper        procedure.

Once            thro u g h the        turnstiles         there were          some more P o l i c e m e n and              I was

s e a r c h e d again,,               It a p p e a r e d to me that more                 or    less everyone was

being             s e a r che d .

We        then made            our way       to the      tunnel      which        leads       to the terrace area

directly               behind the goals.                 I always         go behind           the goals at football

ma t c h e s         and    I ’d been        to H i l l s b o r o u g h    before       so    I knew exactly where                to

go            h ow e v e r I   d i d n o t n o t ice any s i g n s d .i.r e c t i n g         p e o p Ie   to specific

match             viewing       points.

Th e r e was            no Police           or steward d i r e c t i o n          in this area,              I then walked

quite             freely a long         the     tunnel      towards         pens    three and four.                 At the       end

of the             tunnel       I went       to the      right of          the    central       barrier       separating

at    this     time was          fairly empty and              I had a choice             in my viewing

postiion.            I stood wit h m y two                 f r i e n d s . I did not witness any fights

or d i s t u r b a n c e     at the time            of taking        up my m a t c h      viewing       point.

Everything           was a l r i g h t       up until       about 2 . 3 0 p m w h e n       it sta rted to f i l l

up.      T h e r e were       some minor            incidents        such as       people      being        pushed up

a n d down the terrace                  involuntarily.               Some    people       lost thei r shoes               in

the    pushing and shoving and my friend                                                        ^ 6 1 his arm

s tuck    betw e e n       two     other      people.           In my opin i o n at          this      time Pen 3 was

full     no more        so than one w o u l d have                   e x p e c t e d for the occasion,               it

w a s n ’t w o r r y i n g    but    it was         tight.

At about 2 .40 pm some                  of    the    s upporters       star t e d      playing about wit h a

b each ball          throwing        it to each other.                 This       obv i o u s l y    caused some

pushing        and shoving           and made me            realise        it was      getting a bit too              full

in fact        I started           looking a r o u n d          me for youngsters,                  I had to be

careful        I d i d n ’t push         into       them.          I was    not    p a r t i cuarly w o r r i e d for

myself        at    this     junct u r e      but    I was     for    the youngsters.

I am used to being                  pushed      up and down at football

come     to    expect        it,    however at about 2 . 5 4pm                 there w

f o rward and         I rnoved i nvoluntai r 1y i n a ma11 e r of se conds                              f r om pos i t i on

1 as m a r k e d      on the gird to                position 2.            I then tried to turn ar o u n d                     to

move     back       up the       terrace as          is normal        in a match.             1 just        could    not

move,     1 could          not     turn around,            I was w e d g e d      tight     facing      the    pitch.           I

could turn my head an d                      I saw two young           girls       to my      right,        they were

cryi ng .          Thie crowd then started to shout at                            the Po 1 i ce on the          pit c:h,

to get        the    girls       out,    they were          then     lifted       by the      crowd over        the

front     fence       to the Police             on the Pitch.               All    the    time this was             going

on the        pressure was           building            up on my back.            Up until          this    point    1 had

not    been un-~du.ly worried.                      I had e x p er i e n c e d this         kind of thing            before.

As    the    pressure        continued           to build up            1 noticed a n old man               literally

pres s e d    tight    up a g a i n s t         the f e n c e .         He was     directly        in f ront of me

w i t h one guy w e d g e d         in between us.                 He    looked to me as though he had

passed o u t , he was              very       pale.        I think       the m a t c h had        probably kicked

off    by now but        I could              not see       the   pitch be cause           of the Police and St

Johns Ambulance              people           o b s t r u c t i n g my view.

I w a n t e d to     climb out           but     could not         because       I was w e d g e d     so t i g h t ,

even    if this wa s n ' t          the       case    I d o n ’t think         I w o u l d have       been able         to

get    out    because        I was       to     close      to the       fence,     and the overhang would

have    prevented me from doing                       so.      It was      possible         however      for    people

who were       behind me to              climb out and             indeed      I let them          climb on my

s h oulders and head               in order          for    them to do so.              The first        few that

tried this            were    pushed back             off     the fence     into the          crowd     by the

Police.         I     must    stress however                that this       was at      the most the first                 one

or two and the           police          only      pushed      them back         because         they feared a

pitch       invasion was           taking        place.

By this       time     the old ma n             in front       of me was         going      blue      in the face,

the St Johns A m b u l a n c e             man on the             pitch was        shouting, ’T h e r e ’s        one

here    going        blue”.        The        police     o b v i o u s l y then      realised the       s eriousness

of    the    sti u a t i o n and     started          to help       people       over      the    fence.       I think

t h e ma t c h was      still       i n p r ogress a I this               t irne ,

The St Johns A rnb u 1a nee w h o w a s s h o u t i n g t h e n t r i e d to give                           t h i s o 1d

the m esh of the fence.                       1 m a n a g e d to get       hold of the            old mans      head on

the    instructions           of the St Johns A m b u l a n c e man and                       pull    his    slumped

head    up to free           his airways,             unfortunately            I could only get              one arm

free and a r o u n d         the    person w e d g e d         between       us,     who    could not        help

because       he      himself was being                 forced down towards             the      ground and      could

not    breath.          There was no-one                 to    put the mask          on the old mans            face.

                  The St J ohns        Ambulance           man then        pulled     the mask back            thro u g h the

                  railings and         pulled the m o u t h p i e c e         off,    he     then just         pushed the        pipe

                  back   thro u g h the          railings        so he     could guide          it    into his mouth,          I d o n ’t

                  up.      I think     it was because             there was        no oxygen           in the bottle,         he must

             ^    ytvs: gate    in the          fence     to the    pitch was        opened.           T h e c r o w d be h i n d t h e

                  gate   pushed       through        on to the          pitch f o l l o w e d    by the       people     behind     them

                  this     caused the           people     to the       sides     to be    pushed        further     to the      sides

                  towards      the    corner        of the       pen,    as a result        of this        the    pressure was

                  further      increased and a lot more                     people     started having             breathing

                  problems      myself          included,        however      because      the old man had died and was

                  slumped      over,       my    chest was above            the    crowd so          it w a s n ’t too    bad.     The

                  man that was w e d g e d           betw e e n me and the           old man had drop p e d further

                  t owards     the    ground        his   head was        facing     downwards.            I knew he was          dead

                  because      later whe n          the   pressure        eased s l i g h t l y       I did    lift his head up.

                  I saw that         his    face was        blue and        I did    pinch his ear with my fingers

                  to bring      him    round but          there was         no    response.

                 black       out because all              of a sudden           I felt         someone       pinch my ear and

                 either        spit     or    water    came onto my face                  from the dir e c t i o n of the

                 pitch.         This was        o b v i o u s l y done     to bring me around.                       I sudd e n l y    came

                 to my s e n s e s , I was            s l u m p e d over      the old m a n .            I reached and grabbed

                 hold of the            railings       and    I pulled myself                  up.

                 I looked         to my       left an d saw a young
                                                                      _             lad a ged about 9yrs we d g e d

                 o b v i o u s l y off       the g r o u n d between two             people          one of whom a p p e a r e d       dead.

                 I saw a policeman                climb onto         the      railings          and    reach over        to    pull    this

                 young       lad out,, he         could not        reach him,             e v e ryone       else    then tried to get

                 hold     of    the P o l i c e m a n s    arm but       it was          obvious       the P o l i c e m a n felt      he

                 had to help the young                    lad befause           he co n t i n u e d      to struggle          to try and

                 reach him.             I then w i t h       someone       behind rue m a n a g e d           to    reach over and

^     -- —       grab hold of the back                  of this       lads      belt and             lift   him up a few        inches

    , ,„         so the      p o l iceman       could     grab hold of him.                    The     policeman then          pulled

V.^>-            him out        over     the    bar r i e r , then       the P o l i c e m a n        jumped back onto           the

    cr'vMk   ’   barrier        and     tried to get me            out,       my    legs were          stili. stuck         firmly he

                 could not            p u 11 me out       so he started             pul ling         othe r pea pie out.

                 I then bee came aware                 of a m b u l a n c e s      corning onto          t h e p i t c h , people were

                 still       pinching         ears to      keep    people awake and                   it was       just a matter        of

                 waiting        till     I became         free    in order          to get       out.

                 The area a r o u n d the             exit    gate    onto         the    pitch was          by now fairly       clear

                 but    I a nd the           p e o pie a r o u n d me we re st i 11 trapped                   in by the

                 unconscious            injured and d e a d people,                      The    police St Johns and

                 su p p o r t e r s    were    g r a d u a l l y work i n g     their wa y towards me getting                     these

                 people        out.      We were       telling       them w hich ones we had seen                        last    talking

                 so they        could decide who              to help or treat                  immediately.

I eventually          got      free an d went           out   thro u g h the gate           onto    the      pitch.

Two    people      then hel p e d me            over    to the w a 11 by the South S t a n d near                           to

the    players      t u n n e 1.      A St Johns A m b u l a n c e         lady gave me a glass                   of

w ater a n d       I sat there         for a few moments              but       the N o t t i n g h a m Forest
       i
s u p p o r t e r s were    still      shout i n g      for   the m a t c h      to go on and one or two                              ;

fights       broke out         b e t w e e n the two sets of fans.                    The N o t t i n g h a m Forest              ,j

supporters         o b v i o u s l y did not        realise what           had h a p pened and         this made                  '^

some    of the L i v e r p o o 1 fans angry.                  The    police        then put a cordon across                           I

the    pitch.        I got       up and     started to walk aro u n d                 our half      of the         pitch

trying       to find rny friends.

I saw one or two L i v e r p o o l               fans argu i n g w i t h the Police                on the         pitch,

the    fans were       obviously           upset,       all   sorts       of    rumours were        rife      that          it

was    the    fault    of the Police.                  I would      like       to say     in the    circumstances

the Pol ice         behaved quite           properly and            seemed        to be trying        to     cairn the

fans       down.

I w o n d e r e d ar o u n d     for about        twenty minu t e s            e v e n t u a l l y ending    up by the

Liverpool          end goal        posts.          I. then felt       someone         tap me on the shoulder,

I turned around and                 saw    it      was my Uncle who              I did not even        know had

gone    to the matc:h.

I then stayed w ith my Uncle and about                              twenty minutes            later about              4.

15pm my mates           came       over.        The y told me they had a c t u a l l y m a n a g e d to

get    out    the ground at about 3 . 2 0 p m they did                          not   tell me how they got

out    of the Pen but              I presume        it was     either          back   out   through         the    tunnel

or they were          lifted        up on to the          seated area.

At 4.30prn we were               told we        could    leave      the    ground my Uncle            gave        us a

lift       home    in his      car.

I would       like to say that              there       seemed to be a lack of o r g a n i s a t i o n                      by

all    the official            bodies      concerned          although          inthe    circumstances             I

d o n ’t really blame anyone.                       There also        seemed to be a distinct                     1ack       of

m edical      equi p m e n t .

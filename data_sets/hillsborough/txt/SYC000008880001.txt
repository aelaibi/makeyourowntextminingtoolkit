1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
     inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
     with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
; cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                      Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.

3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
       C.D. died from natural causes.
       C.D. died from the industrial disease of
                                                                            Re

       C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
       cm drugs.
       C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

       (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
       suggested that the following words may, where
       appropriate, be added:
       "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                    Cause of death
I      care/self-neglect1).

    b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
      infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
      of the following forms be adopted:

       C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
       C.D. was killed lawfully.

 Dear Sirs,

 Re-. RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


 If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
 of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
 on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
 due course.

 I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
 evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
 coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
 inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

 Subject to the Co ro n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the Co ro ner s’ Rules, the Inquest is
 under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
 witnesses who wish to give evidence.        I am at present engaged in considering
 this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

 Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
 to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
 appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
 consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

 May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
^attintr6n r ‘t'6"'Beaic                                                                   ..

 X also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
 names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
 to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

 I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
 heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
  submit.

  Yours faithfully,




g kZ.colfMti'

Dear Sir,


PAUL BRIAN MURRAY (DECEASED)


Thank you for your letter of 29th March 1990.      We are grateful
for the information supplied    and confirm that our Clients will
be attending on the first day of the hearing.         Three people
will be attending, those being Mr. Anthony Murray, Mrs. Edna
Murray and a Social Worker.     All three will also be attending
the specific Inquest into Paul Brian Murray's death.

 We can inform you that it would be inconvenient for the Inquest
 into Paul's death to take place on either 19 th or 30th April
 or 3rd May and we would be grateful if you would endeavour to
 avoid these dates if at all possible.    We look forward to hearing
 from you further in this respect in due course and in the meantime
 could you please clarify whether the first day of the Inquest
 will be 17th or 18th April.     Our Clients seem    to be under the
 impression that the first day will in fact now be 18th April.

 Our Clients wish to                                   raise three questions                                        at the Inquest which
 are set out on the                                    annexed  form supplied                                       by  the Hillsborough

QUESTIONS (please keep these
brief and confine them to
matters arising from the
Summary and Post-Mortem
Report only).

1*         The Pathologists report refers to Paul Brian Murray
as measuring 5'9" (176 cm) in height.   Mr. and Mrs. Murray believe
that Paul was not in fact this tall.   They are confident that
Paul's height was somewhere between 5'4" and 5'7".   Our Client's
question is therefore, is the Coroner quite sure that the measurement
indicated in the report is accurate?

2.          Apparently our Client's were notified of Paul's death
at approximately 1.45 a.m. on the morning of 16th April 1989.
Our Clients cannot understand why it took so long for the Police
to identify Paul when he had an autograph book on him containing
his name and address.    In this respect paragraph 6 of the Summary
indicates that Dr. Edward Anthony Birkby examined Paul at
a temporary Mortuary at 4.40 on the afternoon of 15th April
1989.   Our Clients question therefore is why did it take from
4.4 0 p.m. on 15th April 1989 to 1.45 a.m. on 16th April 1989
to inform them of their Son's death?


                                                                  Question 3 continued



If you have queries to raise please ensure that this form is returned to us
and copied to H.M. Coroner, Medico-Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield as
soon as possible and in any .event no later than 10th April 1990.
Question 3 continued




3.         The fact sheet on the front page of the Summary refers
to a blood alcohol analysis carried out by Dr. Forrest which
in fact produced a nil result. Mr. and Mrs. Murray wish to
know why it was felt necessary to carry out an alcohol analysis
on a fourteen year old boy in any event?

Dear Sirs,

Re: PAUL BRIAN MURRAY (deceased)..

Thank you for your letter of the 21st of March. The position
with regard to Bay 1 of the proposed resumed limited Inquest
is as follows

      a.     The scope of the evidence on that day will be within
             the parameters Bet for the Inouests as a vhole.

      b.     I intend in order to make things easier to take
             some evidence in respect of all the deceased. For
             example, we will probably be asking the Vest Midlands
             Police Officers to explain their methodology of
             identification and to deal with the coding of
             references and so on in order to try and ensure
             that the Jury, myself and everybody else who will
             be there for any length of time understand the ground
             rules of the language which will be used.

             It is also my present intention to ask Sr. Forrest
             to attend on the first day and to formally -Drove
             his evidence (which is related on the vhole to the
             clinical chemistry)and in particular the alcohol
             levels. The purpose of this is to avoid him having
             to come to every single Inquest during the subsequent
             days.

(Bn that sense your clients are right about the opening- day
but it seems to me that they are sonewhat mistaken as to the
scope.

 I hope that this assists you.

 The summary will contain reference to the alcohol levels if any
 are applicable aiid should be with jrou shortly.

 I am obliged to you for confirming that Mr. & Mrs. Murray will wish
 to be present at the Inciuest into the death of their son.

 I want to make it quite clear that if your clients wish to be present
 on Day 1, they will of course be entitled to be there and I vould not
 want you to feel that I am in any way discouraging them from coming.

Dear Sir,


OUR C L IEN TS - MR. ANTHONY JOHN MURRAY, M RS. EDNA CATHERINE MURRAY
AND MR. PAUL BR IAN MURRAY DECEASED                    '
LIM ITED RESUMED INQ UESTS - HILLSBOROUGH_______________________________________


Thank you for your letter of 14th March 1990.

As you will be aware from your records we act on behalf of Mr.
Anthony Murray and M r s . Edna Catherine Murray who are the parents
of Paul Brian Murray deceased who died at the Hillsborough Disaster
on 15th    April 1989.     We have considered your letter of 14th
March 1990 and the recent Bulletins from the Hillsborough Steering
Committee and are fully aware that the purpose of the resumed
Inquest   is to bring     out very limited information relating to
the location of the deceased and time of death etc.      Our Clients
however have gained the impression, we believe from a recent
meeting of the Victims Support Group, that on the first day
of the Inquest you may be opening the resumed Inquest with more
general observations/comments on the Disaster itself.        We have
to say that this is not our understanding from your letter but
our Clients have asked us to clarify the situation with you
because if wider issues are going to be mentioned on the opening
day of the resumed Inquests then our Clients would like to be
present.   Our Clients understand that the opening day discussion
will be over and above the obviously very limited presentation
of individual case summaries as the Inquest proceeds.         Perhaps
you could clarify the situation for us.

In addition tothe above     we have, as  advised by the Steering
Committee, obtained a copy of the Post Mortem Examination of
Paul Brian Murray.   The final page of the report indicates that
a sample of Paul's blood was retained for analysis.   The results
of theanalysis are      not attached to  the Pathologists Report
provided to us.    Can you inform us whether the results of the
blood analysis will form part of the summary which we understand
is going to be passed to us shortly or whether we should be
applying direct to the Coroner for this?


                                                                                                                 Continued

Continuation Sheet   ONE

v




     Finally, you ask in your letter of 14th March 1990 for information
     upon any Clients who definitely do not wish to attend the Inquest
     relative to their loved one.     This is not the case with regard
     to Mr. and Mrs. Murray who will wish to attend the presentation
     of the Summary relating to Paul's death.

     We apologise for troubling you and   look forward to hearing   from
     you at your earliest convenience.

     Yours faithfully,
     KNIGHT & SONS

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
ma.-ht.P-r will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,

  Mr. Murray.

  At the moment our Client does not wish to attend the adjourned Inquest and does
  not propose instructing us to attend either. Would you please inform us whether
  or not you will require Mr. Murray to attend and if so, upon what date?

Dear Sirs,

Re: PAUL BRIAN MURRAY (deceased)


Thank you for your letter of 11th May 1989, I note your request that
we should write to you instead of your clients.

That is in fact my normal practice but I feel it only right that I
should reserve my rights to communicate with the interested parties
direct if I feel that it is appropriate to do so.




Yours sincerely

by now have received notification of the listing date
which I believe fits in with jour wishes.

Your clients are correct, we are starting on the 18th
of April.

Thank you for the copy questionnaire. Soae of the questions
do not appear to fall within the ambit of the Inquest. No
doubt your client's representative will put any relevant
questions to me at the Inquest.

 Dear Sir,


 PAUL BRIAN MURRAY (DECEASED)


 Thank you for your letter of 29th March 1990.      We are grateful
 for the information supplied and confirm that our Clients wil
 be attending on the first day of the hearing.         T h r e e ^ people
 will be attending, those being Mr. Anthony Murray, Mrs. Edna
 Murray and a Social Worker.     All three will also be attending
 the specific Inquest into Paul Brian Murray's death.

  We can inform you that it would be inconvenient for \he -Enquest
  into Paul's death to take place on either 19th or 30th April
  or 3rd May and we would be grateful if you would endeavour to
  avoid these dates if at all possible.    We look forward^to hearing
  from you further in this respect in due course and in the meantime
  could you please clarify whether the first day of the I ^ e s t
  will be 17th or 18th April.      Our Clients seem to be under the
  impression that the first day will in fact now be 18th April.

  Our Clients wish to                                  raise three questions at the Inquest which
  are set out on the                                   annexed form supplied by the Hillsborough
  Steering Committee.

    QUESTIONS (please keep these
    brief and confine them to
    matters arising from the
    Summary and Post-Mortem
    Report only).

               The Pathologists report refers to Paul Brian Murray
    as measuring 5 ’9" (176 cm) in height.  Mr. and Mrs. Murray believe
    that Paul was not in fact this tall.   They are confident that
    Paul's height was somewhere between 5 14" and 5'7".  Our Client's
    question is therefore, is the Coroner quite sure that the measurement
    indicated in the report is accurate?

    2.         Apparently our Client's were notified of Paul's death
    at approximately 1.4 5 a.m. on the morning of 16th April 1989.
    Our Clients cannot understand why it took so long for the Police
    to identify Paul when he had an autograph book on him containing
    his name and address.   In this respect paragraph 6 of the Summary
    indicates that Dr. Edward Anthony Birkby examined Paul at
    a temporary Mortuary at 4.40 on the afternoon of 15th April
    1989.  Our Clients question therefore is why did it take from
    4.40 p.m. on 15th April 1989 to 1.45 a.m. on 16th April 1989
    to inform them of their Son's death?


                                                                      Question 3 continued



    If you have queries to raise please ensure that this form is returned to us
    and copied to H.M. Coroner, Medico-Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield as
    soon as possible and in any .event no later than 10th April 1990.
Question 3 continued




3          The fact sheet on the front page of the Summary refers
to a blood alcohol analysis carried out by Dr. Forrest whic
in fact produced a nil result.  Mr. and Mrs. M u f ^
know why it was felt necessary to carry out an alcohol ana y
on a fourteen year old boy in any event?
No 16.   Paul Brian Murray.

 a. Summary . Para 5. I am not keen on the word "cursory" as to me it
has an innuendo. It does not occur in the statement and it would be
better deleted.

b. Plans awaited.

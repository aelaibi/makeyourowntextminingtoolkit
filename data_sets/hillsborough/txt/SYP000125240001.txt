 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 M      CIAL INQUIRY*

 WITH REGARD TO THE CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL THE CROWD OUTSIDE,      IT APPEARED TO

 ME THAT SOME PEOPLE HAD BEEN IN THE PUB FOR A DRINK,      I DID NOT SEE ANYONE

 WHO WAS DRUNK-^QR DISORDERLY, BUT THIS CONSUMPTION MIGHT HAVE MADE SOME

 OF THE CROWD EXCIT^SLE.

 OTHER RELEVANT POINTS AS PER THE ATTACHED L E T T E R .
                           \j             -
 THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CROWD, AND THE AUTHORITIES I KNEW

 MORE ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING FROM SOMEONE STANDING BEHIND ME WITH

 A RADIO,    RATHER THAN ANYTHING BROADCAST OVER A PA SYSTEM.

 NO,    I DIDN'T SEE ANY SIGNS DIRECTING WHERE TO GO.   I SAW THE TUNNEL AND THE

Q29

YES, ON EMERGING FROM THE TUNNEL INTO THE STANDING PENS,      IT WAS AS THOUGH

Q14

 Q40

 l^E    YOU SUBJECTED TO ANY EXCESSIVE CROWD CRUSH AT THIS TIME,    IF YES BRIEFLY

 EXPLAIN.

 AT THE TIME WE ENTERED PEN 3 AND CHOSE OUR VIEWING POSITION,      IT WAS

 EXTREMELY CROWDED AND I WOULD THINK ALREADY FILLED TO ITS CAPACITY.        WITH THE

 NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE,    IT WAS DEFINATELY CRAMMED AND

 UNCOMFORTABLE.

 Q4-1

 WHO WERE YOU STOOD OR SAT WITH?

 I WAS STANDING WITH

 TAKING UP YOUR MATCH VIEWING POINT?

 NO.

 KICK OFF TIME 3.00PM     <1500)

 Q45

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,      IF SO DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT?   (BRIEFLY)

 I WAS CAUGHT UP WITHIN A CROWD SURGE.       PEOPLE WERE PUSHING FROM THE LEFT

 (PEN 4 AREA) QUITE SEVERELY AND ALSO PEOPLE WERE PUSHING FROM THE BACK.             IT

 SEEMED TO BE CAUSED BY OVERCROWDING AND TOO MANY PEOPLE ENTERING THE ”3 AND 4 ‘

 ENCLOSURES.

 WERE YOU INJURED,    IF SO DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

 NO.

 Q47

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 YES,   I SAW A MAN LYING NO MORE THAN 3 FEET AWAY FROM ME WHO APPEARED D E A D .

 APPEARED TO BE PILES OF UNCONSCIOUS OR DEAD PEOPLE LYING BY THE BARRIER

 D E E D I N G THE TERRACE FROM THE PITCH.

 NO.


Q17

 049

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR       IN THE DEATHS OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE MAIN THING WAS THE LACK OF POLICE/STEWARDS AT THE TUNNEL WHO SHOULD HAVE

 BEEN DIRECTING FANS TO ALTERNATIVE STANDING ENCLOSURES RATHER THAN EVERYONE
                                                                                               PAGE     S

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER,                    A STEWARD,      A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

G18

 G52

 £^l YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I THINK          IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES,   AFTER THE MATCH HAD BEEN STOPPED,            EVERYONE DID

 THE BEST THEY COULD,          I D I D N ’T SEE ANY STEWARDS BUT THE POLICE AND THE FANS

 ALL SEEMED TO WORK T O G E T H E R .

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 jl J^i c i a l   INQUIRY?

 THERE WAS A GENERAL LACK OF FOOTBALL            STEWARDS AND POLICE ORGANISATION WITHIN

 THE GROUND, ESPECIALLY AROUND THE TUNNEL AREA.                 I SAW THAT THERE WERE BBC

 CAMERAS AT THE GROUND AND ALSO FOOTBALL CAMERAS POSSIBLY RUNNING AND VIDEOING

 THE GAME.          IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE ALARM COULD HAVE BEEN RAISED EARLIER BY THE

 CAMERAS AND HELP COULD HAVE BEEN ORGANISED.              ALSO THERE IS ONLY ONE SMALL EXIT

 GATE THAT OPENS FROM PEN 3 OUT ON TO            THE PITCH.      THE EXIT IS SO SMALL THAT IT

 ALLOWS ACCESS FOR ONLY ONE PERSON AT            A TIME   (IN NORMAL S I T U A T I O N S ) .

 T i ^ S P E C T A T O R S THROUGH OUT THE GROUND OF WHAT WASvOCCURRING AND WHAT TO DO.

 THE FIRE SERVICE AND AMBULANCE SERVICE APPEARED TO TAKE QUITE SOME TIME

 TO GET TO THE SCENE IN PENS 3 & 4.


Q'19

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.     I THINK THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED,     AS I FEEL THERE WAS A GENERAL

 FEELING THROUGHOUT THE CROWD AS THAT THEY HAD TO GET IN QUICKLY TO WATCH THE

 KICK O F F .
                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                       QSN9

2.     LESS PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO CROWD AROUND THE LEPPINGS LANE

TURNSTILES BY THE POLICE BY SIMPLY FORMING A CORDON OF SOME KIND IN

LEPPINGS LANE.

3.     I FEEL THAT ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE FIRE ENGINE OR THE AMBULANCE,              THE FENCE

SHOULD HAVE BEEN PULLED DOWN USING THESE VEHICLES,              I FEEL THIS WOULD HAVE

SAVED LIVES.

4.     THE TWO POLICEMEN MENTIONED EARLIER OUTSIDE T U R N S T I L E S ^ I T O   16 WERE AND

COULD NOT SERVE ANY USEFUL PURPOSE.   I AM AWARE FROM J^f-iAT ONE OF THEM_SAID
                                   C/vi    C o m M j    /4V T _
IN OUR PRESENCE THAT THEY WERE NOT EQUIPPED WITH PERSONAL RADIOS AND WERE

THEREFORE ISOLATED FROM COLLEAGUES,          FROM THEIR /O SI TIO N AT TURNSTILES THEY

COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE SHERE AMOUWT OF PEOPLE WAITING TO ENTER

THE GROUND.      WHERE AS ONE OFFICER ON HORSEBACK EQUIPPED WITH A RADIO

WOULD HAVE HAD A COMMANDING VIEW AND BEEN ABLE TO RELAY THE SITUATION TO

OTHER OFFICERS.        I SAW MOUNTED OFFICERS AT REAR OF CROWD BUT FEEL THEY

SHOULD HAVE BEEN NEAR THE TURNSTILES WERE VISIBLE TO THE CROWD.

5.     A TEMPORARY CROWD BARRIER WAS POSITIONED AT RIGHT ANGLES TO TURNSTILES

1 TO 16 IN AFFECT SEPARATING THE TURNSTILES INTO TWO HALFS.                 DURING THE

CRUSH OUTSIDE NEAR TO THIS BARRIER PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF WE^E' PUSHED

AGAINST IT CAUSING THE BARRIER TO BEGIN TO TOPPLE O V E R . ^FORTUNATELY THE

WEIGHT OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE PUSHED IT BACK U P ^ G H T .            I COULD NOT SEE

T®T     THIS BARRIER WAS SERVING ANY REAL USEFUL PURPOSE.
                               e r r                  /
6.     I FEEL THAT THE OPENING OF THE GATES W A S y R I G H T THING TO DO AT THE TIME.

OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES,        THE CRUSH WAS GETTING WORSE AND THERE WAS A FEAR OF

DEATH AMONGST THE PEOPLE WAITING TO GEn^jMROUGH THE TURNSTILES.

WHEN    I GOT THROUGH THE TURNSTILES I SAW THAT THE AREA BETWEEN THE TURNSTILES

AND THE TERRACES WAS VIRTUALLY EMPTY, AND WAS BIG ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE ALL

THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE.        HOWEVER   IT APPEARS WHEN THE GATE WAS OPENED EVERYONE

RUSHED TOWARDS THE TERRACES.

7.     AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE PA SYSTEM WAS NOT USED ENOUGH TO INFORM

THE CROWD OF THE SITUATION.          WHEN IT WAS USED THE SOUND QUALITY WAS SUCH
                                                                      PAGE   10

JUDICIAL         INQUIRY?

AS    I LEFT THE MOTORWAY ON THE APPROACH TO SHEFFIELD,                                       I SAW A        GROUP     OF    POLICE

OFFICERS HAD STOPPED A MINI                    BUS CONTAINING FOREST FANS,                           IT H A D    BEEN SEARCHED

          A LARGE     P I L E OF B E E R   CANS WERE NEXT TO THE VEHICLE^                            I QUESTION WHY THE

THE STAND AND VICE VERSA,                     THEIR     MOTIVES WERE NOT CLEAR,                      ALTHOUGH       I SUSPECT

E L E M E N T S OF    HOOLIGANISM WERE           INVOLVED.          THEIR       SUPPORTERS HAVE AN ARROGANCE

PUBLIC ORDER OFFENCES    (TWO DRUNKEN LIVERPOOL FANS STOOD IN FRONT OF THE MAIN

POLICE.

<353 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

JUST PRIOR TO LEAVING THE GROUND I SAW TWO PEOPLE, OBVIOUSLY DEAD,          LAYING ON

THE GROUND NEAR TO THE MAIN ACCESS POINTS FOR THE EMERGENCY SERVICES.           IT WAS

NOT UNTIL THIS TIME THAT I REALISED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION.           THE

S^UATION    IN THE NOTTM FOREST AREA WAS CALM.      BUT ON LOOKING ROUND I COULD

SEE THERE WERE ONLY THREE SMALL ESCAPE GATES BEHIND THE GOAL.          FOLLOWING

SPILLAGE OF FANS ON THE PITCH AT ONE POINT THEY MASSED, AS IF TO CHARGE,

FORTUNATELY THE POLICE GUICKEY WENT ONTO THE PITCH,        NEAR TO THE HALF WAY

LINE, AND PREVENTED THEM APPROACHING CLOSER TO THE NFFC FANS.          THE MEDICAL

FACILITIES WERE OBVIOUSLY NOT EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH A TRAGEDY OF SUCH

PROPORTIONS,    ALTHOUGH POLICE,   FIRE AND FIRST AID PERSONNEL APPEARED TO DO

WHAT THEY COULD IN THE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS.        THERE WAS HOWEVER A TOTAL LACK

OF COMMUNICATION FROM THE AUTHORITIES IN THE GROUND,        AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL I

SAW PEOPLE LAYING DEAD ON THE PITCH AS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED THAT            I

REALISED THE DANGEROUS POSITION WE WERE IN IF THE LIVERPOOL FANS CAME TOWARDS

US.   PANIC WOULD ENSUE AND THERE WOULD QUITE SIMPLY BE NOWHERE TO GO.          WE

THEREFORE     LEFT WALKED ALONG    THE AISLES WHICH WERE C L E A R , AND LEFT THE GROUND

Q54 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEE IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

THE PLANNING OF THE POLICE OPERATION APPEARED TO RUN VERY SMOOTHLY EN ROUTE

TO THE GROUND.     WE PARKED QUITE EASILY,    WALKED <15 MINUTES)   TO THE GROUND

AND D I D N ’T EVEN SEE A LIVERPOOL SUPPORTER.    OFTEN SPECTATOR CONTACT EN ROUTE

CAN LEAVE ONE FEARING FOR ONES SAFETY BUT ON THIS OCCASION THE ROUTE TO THE

GROUND WAS ENTIRELY TROUBLE FREE.       I FEEL THERE IS A NEED FOR FENCING WITHIN

         •                                                          QSN&’A

FOOTBALL GROUNDS BUT OBVIOUSLY FITTED                    SO THAT QUICK RELEASE MECHANISMS CAN BE

OPERATED IN EMERGENCY.          FACILITIES WITHIN FOOTBALL STADIUMS HAVE REMAINED IN

POOR REPAIR,        FOR DECADES WITH LITTLE OR NO FACILITIES IN SOME.                THE MONIES

THAT ARE MADE BY FOOTBALL CLUBS THE FA AND MONEY RECEIVED FROM GOVERNMENT

SOURCES DOES N O T , AND NEVER HAS, BEEN SPENT                IN ANY AMOUNT OF    IMPROVING

FACILITIES FOR THE FANS.

 I WOULD ALSO SUPPORT THE IDENTITY CARD SYSTEM,                     I FEEL THAT THIS WOULD ASSIST

 IN PREVENTION OF OUTBURSTS OF VIOLENCE WHICH ARE SO OFTEN SEEN.

FINALLY MY SINCERE HOPE IS THAT FOLLOWING THIS INQUIRY LEGISLATION                      IS

 INTRODUCED THROUGH PARLIAMENT WHICH WILL PREVENT IF HUMANELY POSSIBLE A

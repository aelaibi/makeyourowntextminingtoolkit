Dear 1tvc y

                              re: Hillborough Appeal Fund

      I have  had a long discussion with Derek Morris, the Chairman of the Trustees
of the Fund.    It may be helpful if I put into writing some of the matters which I
have gleaned as it should help us and the Finance Committee in the distribution of
the proceeds from the F.A. Cup.

      1. The Fund presently stands in excess of £5,000,000 after an initial
distribution has been made. The Funds still awaits proceeds from amongst others
Glasgow Celtic, the Daily Mirror and the Pop Record.

      2.   He recommends that the money to be paid to the Fund should be paid into
the Charitable Section as this will give tax relief. The Inland Revenue Department
concerned is based at Bootle and he can put our auditors in touch with them before
any payments are made either to the Fund or to other local charities who have assisted
us after Hillsborough.

      3. TheTrustees have power to erect a memorial and would be pleased                                                              to be
consulted about this.  It is their intention to have one at Sheffield.

      4. There is likely to be a substantial surplus after the needs of the bereaved
and injured have been met.  Some of the organisations which they are considering, include
Liverpool Cathedral (who spent £30,000 on the memorial service), the hospitals and
St. John’s Ambulance.

      5.         Approximately 160 persons have registered claims. This figure does not include
the next         of kin.  I am pleasantly surprised at the small number.

      6. Clearly, we must not make any distribution before discussing the position with
our accountants who may wish to meet the Inland Revenue direct.

      7. I know you will understand that this information has been given to me in
confidence.  Obviously, it will be in our interest to keep open an avenue of discussion
with the Trustess as the matter proceeds.
                                                               Yours sincerely,




                                                                                          n

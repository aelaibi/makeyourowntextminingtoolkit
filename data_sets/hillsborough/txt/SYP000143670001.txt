I arrived at Hillsborough at 2.30 pm (1430 to do a duty at a semi­

final match.

I was stationed at the Leppings Ln stand where   it meets the south

stand with other members from my division.
                                                                          PAGE              6
                                                                          D747

The first time that I knew that something was wrong was about 2.55 pm

(1455) when two of my colleagues       having come back from the toilet told

us that something was happening at the middle terraces of the Leppings

Ln stand.

They went back with an Adult member to see what was wrong.            By this

time fans were coming over the Perimeter fence.          They came to sit by

us most of them were just breathless.         The match had started by this

time.    Then I noticed a Policeman going up to the referee.          At this

point I got a       casualty who was having an asthma attack so I took him

to the first aid room Sleft him to the adults who were there.             When I

went back I noticed that there were a lot of fans on the pitch,

most of them lying down.      A colleague & I went      from fan to fan

checking that they were alright.        Most of them    that I saw at this

time were just shocked and breathless.         It was   difficult to decide who

to treat    I went from fan to fan asking them if       they were alright.         If

they answered my questions S they looked alright         I left them because

they w e r e n ’t seriously hurt and others needed me more.       Most of them

were    in the recovery position.    The Police had put them straight         into

it even if they we re just s ho eked or breathless.

We then got a fan with cuts to the abdomen.         We took him to the first

Aid room.     At, this time I noticed the first Ambulance going onto the

pitch.     Having   left the casualty at the first Aid room we went back on

to the pitch to see what else we could do.         We got called almost

immediately by a policeman to a fan with a suspected spinal           injury.

My colleague tried to find a stetcher but all she got was abuse.               I

got called at this point to a man with blood coming out of his ear.                     I

left a policeman & my colleague with the spinal         injury.   One of the

ambulance    cadets was with the fan with blood coming out of his ear &

together we diagnosed a skull       injury.   There were no stretchers       left

so one of the stewards got us one of the hoardings to use.           We got the
                                                                                          PAGE   7
                                                                                          D747

          casulty onto it & the coadet & some of the fans took him to the First

          Aid room.      I then went from fan to fan checking that they were alright.

          Around this time      I saw that fire crews were trying to rescusiats fans

          around the goal mouth.         There were lots of fans with their faces

          covered,     dead.

          1 went back to the first aid room & assisted there.             Talking to fans

          making sure that they were conscious & talking their names.                   The

          younger      cadets I noticed were sitting     in a police van.

          Most of the casualties had gone fay this time & only the walking

          wounded & the stretcher        cases that w e r e n ’t too bad were   left.     The

          ambulances came back & took the wounded away.            Stretcher cases first &

          then the walking wounded.         Soon there was only the First Aiders,

          Police & Fire crews left all         looking very shocked.     Two colleagues

          & I went      back onto the pitch.     The fans had started leaving & the only

          people on the pitch were dazed fans walking around.             When I saw there

          was nothing left to do I went home.           I left the ground around 4.45pm

          (1 6 4 5 )

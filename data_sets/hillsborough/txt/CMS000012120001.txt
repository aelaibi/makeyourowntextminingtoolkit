H ILL S BO RO U GH DISASTER

Sir Clive Whitmore and Sir Terry Heiser discussed on 18 April
further action on the Government's proposal that there should be
moves to all-seating stadiums for certain football clubs.                 Mr
Hammond, Mr Moriarty, Mr Goddard, Mr Watts, Mr Mould and
M r Smith from the Home Office and Mr Owen, Mr McDonald,
M r Kinghanr'and Ma^Ss Weinberg from DOE were present.
                 Mn

Sir Terry Heiser said that, given the terms of the Home
Secretary's statement,        his Secretary of State had agreed that it
was for DOE to take this matter forward by amending the Football
Spectators Bill so as to enable all-seats to be a condition for

A u t h o r i t i e s ^ — They wero» agreed that an amendment to the
licensing section of the Bill permitting one condition of a
licence to be that no-one might be a spectator at a ground other
than from a seated position should be within the scope of the
Bill.    Any amendment would be in the form of an enabling
p rovision with details of implementation worked out later.                It
w o u l d be possible for only selected grounds or a category of
grounds to be covered.         Only football stadiums could be covered
b y the Bill.     Mr Ridley did not propose to bring forward such an

proposed and seek their views on how the proposal should be

that it would be advisable for the Home Secretary and Secretary
of State for the Environment to meet before Cabinet.

 figures indicated that in most major stadiums seating capacity
 at present amounted to less than 50% of total capacity;
 conversion to 100% seating capacity would clearly have a major
 economic impact on some clubs in terms of both capital and
 revenue.   Precisely which clubs or category of clubs should be
 covered would be a matter for discussion with the football
authorities,   and the DOE would look to the Home Office for
advice on safety matters affecting this decision.                       The
preliminary view with in the DOE was that perhaps all of the
first division and the major clubs of the second division might
need to Jbe covered amounting to approximately                 thirty clubs.

after Lord Justice Taylor had completed his inquiry and any
recommendations from him could be borne in mind in implementing
this part of the Bill.             Ministers might eventually decide that
handling of the Bill required adoption of                    a lat/er date for
implementation of the -Bill ae^a-**ho3.e to enable them to offer
assurances that account would be taken of recommendations made
b y Lord Justice Taylor.            Lord Justice Taylor's terms of
reference permitted him to make interim reports but it was too
soon to say whether he would wi s h to do so.              The Home Office
w e r e providing h i m with a secretariat and it should be possible
to give the DOE adequate notice of publication of an interim
report and possibly of its contents.             Sir Terry Heiser wondered
whether there was a case for interim advice on safety measures
to issue from the Home Office for example,             advising that
permitted maximum capacity should be reduced.                   Sir Clive
W h i tmore pointed out that until Lord Justice Taylor's report was
received it was unclear what such advice should contain although
this was a point the Home Office would wish to consider
further.

      Mr Ridley intended to write to                       MPs explaining the
      Government's reasons for continuing with the Bill.                          The Home
      O ffice would provide a contribution to this letter dealing with
      the argument advanced by some that the introduction of identity

21.   SEMI-FINAL TIES      The Committee's attention was drawn to the following
        Minutes:-

        a)    Minute 51 of the Joint Liaison Committee meeting held on the
              26th June

              "FA CUP SEMI-FINAL MATCHES Correspondence was considered which
              had been received in respect of crowd problems following the
              Tottenham Hotspur FC -v- Wolverhampton Wanderers FC Semi-Final
              match at Highbury Stadium.   It was agreed that although the
              Committee was very sympathetic no action could be taken as the
              damage had occurred outside the Stadium and security of sur­
              rounding areas came under the jurisdiction of the local police.
              It was agreed, however, that a recommendation should be put to
              the Challenge Cup Committee~~that very careful consideration be
              given to the venues for such matches in view of the problems
              when the ground of a neighbouring club is used and local rival."

        b)    Minute 9 of the Executive Committee meeting of the 20th August.

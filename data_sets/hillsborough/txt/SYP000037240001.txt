Dear Mr Jones,

I write in the temporary absence of Miss. Steel from the office and thank
you for your letter dated the 3rd instant, which I will draw to her attention
on her return from holiday on the 22nd August.

I have received from Fanshaw Porter and Hazelhurst the Solicitors acting
for Mrs Susan Horrocks re: her late husband Arthur Horrocks ^wfiich states
that on reflection Mrs Horrocks has decided that she no longer wishes to
see the video footage and in the circumstances would you please cancel any
proposed arrangements on her behalf.

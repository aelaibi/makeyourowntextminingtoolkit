              I am a Police Constable       in the South Yorkshire Police force       currently

              attached to C Division,       Rotherham,    as Community Constable for the

              Whiston area.

              At 8.30am on Saturday 15 March,         1989 I paraded on duty at Main Street

              Police Station at Rotherham and then travelled to Sheffield Wednesday

              Football Ground for a briefing         in the North Stand at Hillsborough as

              to our appropriate duties.

              At 11am along with my Serial Number 37,          I commenced duties at Wadsley

              Bridge Railway Station, Halifax Road, awaiting a train of Liverpool

              supporters that was scheduled to arrive a little after 2pm.             Part of

              our duties was also to police a small area of Halifax Road,             close to

              two public houses across from each other.             At this time there were a

              few supporters from both Liverpool and Notts. Forest walking along

              Halifax Road,      in each direction,    continually asking police officers

              directins to open public houses.           Myself being unfamiliar with the

              area was unable to assist them,         but I advised numerous supporters of

              the possible consequences of attempting to gain entry to

              Hillsborough drunk,       ie arrest,   not a lot of     notcie   was   taken by wha

              I said to them and they all       continued their       search   for   public houses.

              At around 1.30pm PC 2929 Bennett,          PC 1429 Bashforth, PC 1266 Adshead
                                                                          PAGE    2
                                                                          R362

and myself were    instructed by our supervising officers to cross

Halifax Road from Wadsley Bridge and patrol a small area of footpath

adjacent to the public house,         due to the large amounts of supporters

that were by now walking down Halifax Road towards the ground.

Virtually every adult male carried a number of cans of lager or beer

in his hands and it was plain to see that the vast majority of them

had had a quantity of alcohol         to drink.   I also remember hearing quite

a few, what    I can only describe as Merseyside accent,       asking other

supporters    if they had any "spares".       I can only imagine that they

were seeking tickets for the game.          A short while after this a number

of officers from my serial attended at a shopping precinct further up

Halifax Road, away from Hillsborough,         due to a report of trouble in

one store.     Myself and the other 3 officers       I have mentioned stayed

in position    in Halifax Road.       A few minutes later Mounted officers

attended at that    location to assist in what was described via personal

radios as a large crowd of supporters sat on a grass bank drinking

heavily.     Shortly after that a group of approximately 6 Liverpool

supporters,    aged about   18-22 years,    stopped at our location,    one of

them was assisted by the others to sit on a small wall at the side of

us.   This youth was obviously very drunk as he had to be supported by

his friends as he sat       the re.   We spoke to the group and ascertained

that they were from Liverpool,         they had all been drinking but were            j


very amenable and listened to our advice without question.             They

assisted their friend to his feet from the wall and continued on

their way towards the ground.          I must stress that they were not

shouting, abusive or causing trouble to anyone.

Shortly after this group left us another group of Liverpool            fans

walked past our position.       This time this group were singing in very

loud voices,   one youth in particular, with dark hair, white T-shirt,

and Union Jack shorts,      they were suitably advised by myself, all had
been drinking,    some still had cans of beer or lager in their hands,

although I must say that this group did not respond to advice given

in the same way as the previous group,       these seemed to take no notice

whatsoever and only a matter of so or so yards further and they

started up their chants,    but were spoken to again by other officers.

At about   1.50pm my colleagues and I were     called back across Halifax

Road to the station to await the arrival       of the Liverpool    train.

This arrived between 5--10 minutes   later, a little earlier than

expected and our serial along with serial 36,       Insp. Ellis,    other

supervising officers and Mounted officers from Merseyside Police,           met

the Liverpool    supporters off the train and held them in a group

alongside a public house on the same side of the road.        The

supporters were well    behaved and seemed quite quiet.     When they were

altogether we then proceeded to escort them down Halifax Road towards

the ground.     I then accompanied PC Schofield approximately half way

down the supporters.     As we walked with these supporters they were

very well behaved and seemed only intent upon getting to the ground,

which was totally opposite to the groups of supporters sat around on

walls and pavements,    drinking alcohol,    singing and shouting.     At the

junction of Halifax Road and Leppings Lane my serial was          instructed

to continue the escort to the Leppings Lane end of the ground, which

was directly opposite to instructions on the order for the game which

stated that serial 37 was not to escort supporters to the ground.

Also on the way there were numerous Liverpool supporters          continually

asking for spare tickets.

When we reached the Leppings Lane end of the ground there was a large

crowd of supporters already building up outside but there was no

recognisable queueing taking place,    it seemed to be just a mass push

for the turnstiles by the fans.

Along with a number of other officers       I was then instructed to patrol
                                                                       PAGE      •
                                                               .       R362

a section of the bridge opposite Leppings Lane entrance,       instructions

were to clear the large groups of youths that were congregating upon

it.   Upon speaking to them I found that      large numbers of these were

not in possession of tickets and they did pose a problem,          because I

could only advise them to leave the queue and once off the bridge I

do not know where they went.     At this time I remember    looking back

towards the ground and seeing a number of youths actually on top of

the boundary walls to the ground,    gaining access    I presumed without

payment.   A number of youths on the bridge also saw this and

immediately made their way across to the what was by now a very large

mass of people outside the Leppings Lane entrance.        I took   it that

they didn't have tickets and were proposing to enter by this method.

Other officers were    calling ground control via their    personal   radios

informing them that    people were getting    crushed at the front of the

turnstiles but were having difficulty in getting their messages

understood by the control.     Extra horses were brought around to

assist but were unable to make any headway into the large crowd.             I

can only think because of danger to people by trampling.

A van was then brought around and Insp. Ellis climbed on top and

requested the crowd to stop pushing,    but he was unable to make

himself heard above the noise of the crowd.       A number of requests by

officers outside Leppings Lane to the ground control       inside were made

to delay the kick off time and at one point I was convinced that the

kick off was going to be 3.15pm,    to the point of myself telling a

number of supporters that this was so.

Then all at once    I can recall one big push and seeing the large

concertina gate to the North Stand being opened and the crowd,         or a

section of it, surging through.     I was unaware of any other gates

being opened at this time.     All of a sudden it went quiet where we

were and officers    looked at each other    in disbelief at what they had
                                                                                    PAGE     !

          just witnessed,   some officers were very shaken and some stated that

          they feared at points for people lives.

          Just as this ws happening a message        came over personal   radio for all

          officers to attend    inside the ground at the Leppings Lane end.          Along

          with other officers    I ran through the open gate that I have

          previously mentioned,       through the North Stand and onto the pitch at

          the Leppings   Lane end.      I can remember seeing the players still on

          the pitch at   this time.    My first   reaction was that there   was

          fighting taking   place inside the standing area at the centre of the

          Leppings Lane stand,      because there was quite a large number of people

          already on the pitch around the rear of the goals.         I ran to this area

          and immediately jumped onto the boundary wall and assisted other

          officers   in pulling and kicking at the wire perimeter fence,          because

          1 then realised that this was not a riot but something more serious,

          the wire fence was a very thick guage wire and were unable to make

          any headway in what we were doing,        so I then started to pull     people

          from the stand through the gateway and small hole        in the fence that

          had been made.    These     people were handed to other officers who laid
••




          them on the pitch and perimeter track.        At one stage there appered no

          one to take the youth from me so I pulled him free and started to

          drag him towards an open space, at this time I was helped with him by

          a St. Johns Ambulance man who examined him and found a pulse.            We

          then laid him on a stretcher and he was        carried by officers and the

          ambulanceman away on the stretcher.

          I then returned to the       area of the goalmouth and assisted in laying

          the deceased   onto make     shift stretchers,   whilst Liverpool supporters

          and other officers    carried them away.

          The next thing I can remember      is the match being called off and

          people leaving the ground.       When the area had been cleared I then

          attended at the gymnasium underneath the North Stand where         I was then
                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                      R362

  told to accompany other officers whom I do not know in a transit van

  and we did a patrol around the immediate area of the outskirts of the

  ground.       In my opinion this was a complete waste of time as the only

  thing we did was get held up in traffic and were no use whatsoever.

  Upon returning to Claywheels Lane at about 6.30pm we boarded a coach

 and returned to Rotherham, where                        I was stood down from duty at 7pm.

  I was on duty at the same Semi-Final                        last year and although I was not

  present at the Leppings Lane end of the ground,                             I was on the streets

  leading up that section of the stadium,                         I can remember that the

  Liverpool      supporters then were heavily drinking,                         although no mention

  of any spare tickets was made then.

  From where         I was positioned outside the ground I have to say that I

  factor that caused the tragedy

T h e n all        at once          I can       recall   one big        push and seeing the             large

th e   pitch at         this time.          My f i r s t       r e a c t i o n was that t h e r e was

a l r e a d y on the       pitch a r o u n d the          rear of the goals.                 I ran to this                 i


and    i m m e di at el y j u m pe d onto the             b o u n d a r y wall and a s s i s t e d         other

officers       in pulling a n d k ic k i n g              at    the wire       perimeter         fence,       b ecau

I then r e al is ed that this was                   not a         riot but som e t h i n g m o r e s e r i o u

the wire       fence was a very t h i c k                 g u a g e wire and wer e u n a b l e             to m a k e

a n y h e ad wa y      in what we wer e doing,                  so   I then s t a r t e d to         puli     peopl

                                                                                                                       i
a St.     J oh n s A mb ul a n c e m a n w h o       e x a m i n e d him an d found a pulse.                      We

then    laid hi m on a str e t c h e r             a n d he was         carried by o f f i c e r s          an d tt

a m b u l a n c e m a n a w a y on the      stretcher.

I then      r e t u r ne d to the a r e a of the                g o a l m o u t h an d a s s i s t e d    in layii

the    d e c e a s e d onto mak e shift            stretchers,            whi l s t L i v e r p o o l     supporti

a n d other     officers           carried t h e m away.

The    next    thing       I can remember            is the m a t c h being             called off a n d

people     leav i n g the ground.                 When     the area had been c l e a r e d                 I then

a t t e n d e d at    the g y m n as iu m u n d e r n e a t h the N o r t h S t a n d w h e r e            I was
                                                                                  PAG E         6
                                                                                  R362

told to accompany other officers whom I do not know in a transit van

and we did a patrol around the                 immediate area of the outskirts of the

ground.       In my opinion this was a complete waste of time as the only

thing we did was get held up in traffic and were no use whatsoever.

Upon returning to Claywheels Lane at about 6.30pm we boarded a coach

and returned to Rotherham,                where I was stood down from duty at 7 pm.

I was on duty at the same Semi-Final last year and although I was not

present at the Leppings             Lane end of the ground,            I was on the streets

leading up that section             of the stadium.           I can remember that the

Liverpool      supporters      then were heavily drinking,              although no mention

of any spare           tickets was made      then.

From where I was positioned outside                    the   ground I have   to say that            I

have never seen so many             supporters        arriving ata match as late           as       the

vast m a j o r i t y    did that   day,   w h ic h   in my m in d   is the most   s i gn i f i c a n t

factor     that    caused    the   tragedy.

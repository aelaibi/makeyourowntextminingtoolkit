            We got        off    the m o t o r w a y      between      12.30pm a n d         '1.00pm and/fce went             for a

            drink.         We had a couple                of    pints at a pub and we h W ^ s o m e t h i n g                 to eat.

            I then drove             us    nearer        to the stadium.             I parked the               car about 5

            minu t e s     walk      from the s t a d i u m on the top of                   the hill.             I parked the

            ca r a t about 2 .00 p m .

            We w a l k e d      to the g r o u n d and            I remember       passing a           group ofP o l i c e m a n on

            a pub        car    park.       I c a n ’t remember           the    name       of the        pub,but      it   was

            closed anyway.                 No P o l i c e m a n   stopped us or             spoke to us on             the way        to

            the    ground.

            T h e r e were a lot            of    people walking            towards        the stadium by this                time         in

            an o r d e r l e y manner.             Som e       people were       singing and the mood was                     one of

            being        excited at         the     prospect        of the      game.

            We a r r i v e d at the ground at 2 . 1 3 p m and                      I was      s u p r i s e d to see that
5.o .e      outside        the ground            there was         no queuing        to get       in just a crowd of

            on 1y Po 1 i c:ernan I saw were                    two officers        on p r f f r s eback     near the wrought

            crowd.         I d i d n ’t see any            stewards at all/.

            I didn't           have any trouble                finding    t h e / ' B ’^ t u r n s t i i es entrance        as    I

            to go with           the      crowd to where you were you were                          pushed.

            After a few m i n u t e s             of joining         this    crowd       I was      s u b j e c t e d to excessive

            crushing.            We all m a n a g e d          to stay    pretty well           together.

         I remember           seeing       people       climbing       seeing       people     climbing        up the wall

         We    had been        in the       queue       outside       for about 2 0 — 25 minutes.

         Once     inside we had to wait a couple                         of minutes           for the        other    two to

         plenty of standing                 room     in what      I now know             to be Pen 6.          I pointed

I must       say    that at           about      2 .50 while       we were         in the     pen I could hear

At 10.0 Oam that date, briefing was held in the main stand, which I attended.
Mtyjdetail was serial Wo.                   which was delegated the duty of supervising the
herries Hoad end of the ground, and the arrival of the Nottingaarn iOicoi, supporter

We took up position in Herries Hoad South.
At 3»oopm that date we completed our first phase of duty and our intention was
then to attend Claywheels Lane for meal, however we were instructed by Superintend
Chapman to stand by at the junction of Herries Hoad South and Penistone Road.
At 3»05 pm that date we were told to go into the ground and onto the pitch.
On the pitch I was told to join other Officers and form a cordon across the pitch.
I could see that there was what appeared to be a major public disorder problem
in the Leppings Lane end and people were spilling out onto the pitch from the
standing area* We maintained general control of the pitch area, preventing any

Forest fans.
I then realised that many people had been hurt, and some were dead* Together with
P.O. Moran 1 went to the goal mouth at the Leppings Lane end where I saw many
dead bodies; laid out behind the goal. I assisted in carrying one of the bodies
from the pitch to the gymnasiun where a mortuary had been set up. Outside the
gymnasiun there were many people and scuffles were breaking out between these
people abd Police Officers. We then returned t o the pitch and I was again told to

join a cordon.
Most of the potential trouble between fans passed and then myself and P.G. Moran
returned to the gymnasiun area where we were told to stand by to recover more
bodies from the tunneil area on the Leppings Lane end. We remained in the

gym for some time but were ne«er directed to leave
At 5»20pm that date we returned to the Main Stand for a be- briefing and later

returned to Maltby.

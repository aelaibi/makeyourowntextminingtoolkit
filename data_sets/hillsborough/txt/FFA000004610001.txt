John Dyson telephoned.

1.   He agreed that we could not prevent Herbert Smith from
taking a close involvement but we ought to make sure that
they realised that we would not be prejudiced in our
preparation by passing everything through them.

2.   He also agreed that we could not stop the West Midlands
police taking their own statements but it was obviously a
matter for the judge as to which statement was used.

3.   He thought it would not be necessary to sit through all
the video tapes but at least some of them would be helpful.

I telephoned           I She would be getting Kelly's draft
statement this afternoon.  She would get her own copy and go
through it in detail. I said it was probably longer than I
had wished to make it but I thought it would be better to
start with a document which had most points in it. There
were three areas I thought I might not have covered. Those
were

(i)   Perimeter fencing.

It was clear to everyone who went up to see Hillsborough
that the access for an emergency from the perimeter fence in
the Lappings Lane End was not adequate. The question was
likely to be asked as to what steps the FA took to make sure
that its directions on emergency access from perimeter
fencing were complied with? The Poppjtewell Report said that
would be necessary and also -i^FA had said itwas necessary.
I said the answer was likely to be none.       agreed.  I
said that did not necessarily impose any liability on the FA
but was a point we ought to bear in mind.

I had not found the final safety certificate for
Hillsborough anywhere.      said that was because it was not
issued yet. We had not been sent a copy of the plan with
Sheffield Wednesday's response but we certainly did have
details of the layout of the around and the barest assentiali
on the perimeter fencing in place prior to the venue
decision of 20 March 1989.

With regard to the FSA complaints about last year's cup
final these were many and detailed and took up half a file.
I was not able to draft in any comprehensi’vyeanswer to those
points as to what the FA had done. I said JGW had been keen
that we did provide some sort of response but we could
discuss that on Monday.

She would also find a section left for her to draft on the
contrast of Wembley/internationals/under-21 games with FA
cup semi-finals.  Other than that I was quite happy with the
statement.

Engaged 15 minutes including dictation

Julian Gibson-Watt telephoned on the same matter. He
tfianked me very much for the draft statement and asked if I
could fax him down Appendix 9 the report on the previous
year's game as well as the agenda and notes of the meeting
where venue was selected.   I said I would.

He said we ought to have Wiseman and Clark oerhaps standing
by to give evidence if necessary*.

I mentioned that there were three main areas I had left out.

(1)   Perimeter fencing.   1 thought this would be more
      relevant to Phase 2.

(ii) The Safety Certificate issue and

(iii)The FSA complaints and what the FA did about them.

}vhether Julian agreed with (I) . With regard to (ii) I said
I would rax'IEtiia a copy of the documents we had on the safety
certificate.     From those it was clear that the FA were not
iii possession cf an issued Safety Certificate for
Hillsborough when the venue was chosen.

With regard to *iii) we would need to get more information
crom the client. vJe agreed to see each other on Sunday
taornxng.

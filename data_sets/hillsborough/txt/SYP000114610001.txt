             While at        this     location        I noticed numerous         people who were              o b viously

no    later than 2 . 15pm.

At this       time there was a number                 of    people milling a r o u n d          but no       real

problem*        The m a j o r i t y were        drinking      from    lager     or beer        cans and a

number were          sat, on surrounding walls                drinking.         Attempts        by officers

were made       to move       these      people     from the walls          but      it was a no win

s i t uation as fast as one group was moved another                                 came along       to take

their    place.

the    lane from the dir e c t i o n we             had e s c orted      the fans and           seeing a

solid block          of   people    heading        towards     us.

I remember an             Inspector Sykes          coming     over    towards myself            and PC 3183

Trcek who        I was     stood next       to and tafi, ling us the                road was      being

closed off        to traffic.            It was     inevitable        this was        going     to have       to

be done as        people were walking jSHbout all                    over   the      road    in swarms,

e veryone appeared, to be drinking,                        in my opinion        it was       only a small

We should have            gone    for / e a l    to C l a y w h e e I s Lane    for 3pm but due              to

the    large amount         of    people arriving           at thJ^T' late time and the                    chaos

we    stayed     in situ.

to go between the horses.                    It was       obv i o u s l y an attempt           at keeping          the

fans      in order and       stop them          pushing      in their         panic: to get          into the

ground.      Whilst     trying          to achieve        this and trying            to stop the fans

getting      through,       the    s u ^ g ^ ^ o ^ j p e ^ p ^ ^ ^ b ^ c a m e ^ so strong    that    I was

this also      seemed       to happen to the Police                    horse     I was       next    to.

Fans were      totally       ignoring        requests       to stop         pushing      forward and          to

move    orderly aro u n d         the    cordon we        had made,         they were         scrambling

through horses         legs and g e n erally taking                    every a d vantage            in a

si t u a t i o n whe n the Police were              o u t n u m b e r e d and    little       could he       done

           vvaw-ww■-    I remember was              sat    on top of a Land Rover                    and

snouting     through a loudhailer                 for     fans    to stop        pushing       forward.           This

appered     to have     little          effect    on the      fans.

On turning        towards     the       turnstiles        on Leppings Lane              I saw one mass             of

people,     it was at        this       stage    I realised        things were going                 very

quickly downhill.             An    Inspector whose              identity        I do not       know was          sat

a stride    a wall     by    the turnstiles and was                    pulling     people       over       the wall

who were     o b viously      in danger          of being        crushed outside              the ground.

I recall making         comment          to PC Trcek at           this time        that       there was       going

to be a tragedy,,            It was       chaos    but still           fans     continued       pushing

forwards     it was as        if they were           ignorant as to what was                    occurring.

I was     stood    looking     on h elplessly             trying       to hold the           rear    end of the

fans    back and shouting at               people       standing around            the entrance             gates

to move     if they h a d n ’t got a ticket.                     The    fans a p p e a r e d beligerant             to

requests made        of them and just              s a untered around.

It was at this         time    I heard a radio message                      requesting all            a v ailable

P olice    personnel        onto    the pitch.            I have       no   recollection            of how    I got

into the ground thro u g h the                  crowd but        I remember waiting a few

seconds     once    in the ground to be                 let onto        the     pitch    I assume          by a

                            a d m i n i s t e r e d oxygen to him whilst                          an off       duty fireman did heart

                            massage.                We    thought       the re was a f 1i cke r of                life     i n him but when                put

                            on a s tretcher                    and   ca r ri e d away w e t h o u g ht d i f f e r e n 1 1y .            Whe n thing s

                            finally            calmed a little                from the          initial        bustle     of getting           fans out

                            from behind                  the    fence onto          the     pitched area          I recall       fans      crying and

                            hysterical               and fighting amongst                     themselves.          I intervened            in no end

                            o f s q u a b b 1 i n g b e 1w e e n t h e f a n s .

                           The smell                of alcohol         w.a_s u n b e l ievable          it seemed        to h ^ rq           ,|h° a i r .

                           When all                the    casualties who were                   believed        to be alive were             removed

                           and taken to ambulances,                            the a t m o s p h e r e was        electric and           looking

                           back        this was            the most         frightening.              Both sets of fans seemed to be

                           brewing             trouble and a line of Police                           officers was         formed across                the
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                           R388

         p it ch .

         I don't       know whether        this      is because    the Motts.      Forest     fans were

         unaware       of the    tragedy and were             of the    impression the      casulaties

         were    victims      of fans     fighting         each other     or whether      it was    sheer

         0 V 1 1n 05b a

         T h e ' d i f f i c u l t i e s were made    doubly worse       by not only having         to deal

         with the         injured but also           the   fighting and the fear          of a pitch

         invasion by Notts.             Forest       fans.

         In my opinion the           tragedy occurred            due    to the en mass arrival           of fans

         at such a late time.               On their arrival            it was apparent       the m a j o r i t y

         had been drinking and              in fact had the gall            to still      be drinking.

         There was        no rush until        the final       moment     to get   into    the   ground and

         their       priority was       to drink as much and as             long as    possible.         My main

         concern       is that    the    people       I was    trying   to help had been the           innocent

         victims as they were             obviously the early arrivals                to be      positioned

         where    they were.

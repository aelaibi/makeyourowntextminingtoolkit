  END          OF   REPORT
Richard Glynn COLLIER   P.C       *B* Group Hammerton Road Police Station .



At 10am on Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at Sheffield Wednesday
Football Ground for briefing . I was on serial 3 with P.S 577 Gardner as
serial sergeant . My duties were supervision of the turnstiles on the South
stand .   The Nottingham Forrest supporters using the South stand arrived
between 12 noon until just after 3pm . They were orderly and good humoured.
At 3•05pm the same day as the turnstiles cleared along with other officers I
went to the rear of the South stand to supervise supporters in that part of
the ground .   A short time later I looked towards the Leppings Lane end of
the ground and saw what appeared to me and the Nottingham Forrest supporters
to be a pitch invasion by the Liverpool supporters . The opinion of the
Notts Forrest supporters was one of * Liverpool are at it again '• I saw a
large number of Police make their way to the Leppings Lane end of the ground
and officers giving the kiss of life to two or three supporters laid on the
pitch .    At this stage P.S 577 Gardner regrouped the serial and we made our
way onto the pitch .    Once on the pitch the magnitude of the situation was
realised .     Liverpool supporters k x k were all over the pitch and hindering
efforts to remove the dead and injured . I moved large number of them away
from Police and others who were trying to assist the injured . A large
number of the Liverpool supporters smelled str ongly of intoxicating liquor.
The supporters on the pitch were angry and shocked but the ones who had been
drinking were the most vociferous .      I was then directed to form a cordon
across the pitch to prevent the Liverpool supporters reaching the Hotts Forrest
supporters .
As things quietened down and the dead and injured had been moved off the pitch
the serial 3 members that were left and myself were directed tb the rear of
Leppings Lane end of the ground to clear Liverpool supporters away from the
central tunnel to allow removal of the dead and injured .      A large number
of these smelled strongly of drink and were also angry and shocked . They
nearly all blamed the Police for what had happened with the following viewpoint:
YOU SHOULD HAVE STOPPED THEM COMING IN . YOU KNOW THEY ALWAYS RUSH AT THE LAST
MINUTE SO THOSE WITHOUT TICKETS CAN GET IN .
It seemed that those most angry were the supporters who had not got on to the
Leppings Lane terraces or who were at the back and were amongst those who had
been doing the pushing.
The only stewards I came into contact with were those at the South Stand and
they appeared to be doing their job .
I was not aware of any breakdown in radio transmissions .

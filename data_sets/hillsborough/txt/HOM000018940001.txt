                                               The value of B R E ’s work to both
                                               Government and industry rests on the
                                               Establishment’s independence of sectoral
                                               interests, the breadth of its technical
                                               capabilities and the depth of scientific
                                               understanding that underpins its work.

                                               Establishment is of no value unless it
                                               is known and applied, and this year

Sulphate resistance of concrete
Concrete made from Portland cement is
vulnerable to expansive sulphate attack
because of its tricaicium aluminate content.
Analysis was completed during the year of
concretes exposed for 15 years to a fissured
sulphate-bearing clay soil at a site north­
west of London. R esults suggested that
concrete can resist sulphate penetration if
it is well-compacted, contains an adequate
cement content and has a low water to
cement ratio. If these conditions are not
met, if sulphate is present in very high
concentrations, or if conditions create a
hydrostatic head across the concrete, then
some attack is likely. U sing sulphate-
resisting concrete, autoclaving or pre-
carbonation of the precast products can
offset sulphate attack. T h e results of this
work, and other research on slag and pfa
cements, will be used to update BRE
recommendations for the specification of
concrete in sulphate-bearing soils and
ground-waters.


Lim estone fillers for cement
New C E N standards, which may become
mandatory in the U K , would allow up to
5% of cementitious or inert fillers in
Portland cement; cements containing up to
20 % of inert filler m ay also be allowed.
D uring the year B RE undertook new
research to assess the effects of calcareous
fillers such as limestone, chalk or cement
raw m eal on cement properties and long­
term concrete durability. This will result
in guidance to specifiers on these unfam ­
iliar materials.


Accelerated durability test
for masonry
A recently developed accelerated test
should reduce the time taken to assess the
durability of masonry products from many
years to a few months and should be of use
to manufacturers and specifiers. T he test
uses a chamber program m ed to control
temperature and water spray at rates which

Surface coatings for
structural concrete
Surface coatings which prevent carbon
dioxide absorption can reduce the carbona­
tion rate of structural concrete and the
associated risk of corrosion of the reinforce­
m ent resulting from the reduced alkalinity
of the concrete. There is grow ing interest
in these coatings from specifiers, designers
and those concerned with the maintenance
and repair of structural concrete.
   D uring the year, BRE developed two
new methods to assess the performance of
surface coatings for concrete w hen freshly-
applied and after weathering. T h e first —
application to mortar blocks which are then
exposed to carbon dioxide — provides low-
cost qualitative information on the resis­
tance of freshly-applied coatings to carbon
dioxide transmission. T he second test
assesses the quantity of gas passing through
a supported film of the test coating in a
partition cell. Exposure to a w ide range of
conditions can be used to m easure change
in carbon dioxide resistance as coatings
weather.
   Information from this work will form the
basis for guidance on selecting cost-effective
coatings of adequate carbon dioxide resis­
tance. It will also be used to develop per­
form ance standards and m ethods of
performance testing.


Aggregates
Studies at BRE into the durability of
concrete made from Jurassic limestone or
carboniferous sandstone have improved
understanding of aggregate porosity. This
can affect concrete carbonation, liquid
w ater permeability, the risk of alkali
aggregate reaction and susceptibility to
freeze-thaw damage. T he implications for
aggregate specifications are being assessed.
Wood and wood products

Performance of adhesives
Adhesives are used increasingly in timber
construction, in wood-based panel products
and finger jointed, laminated or built-up
beams. They provide a means of enhanc­
ing the structural properties of timber com­
ponents as well as using tim ber resources
more effectively. Adhesive performance is
a key factor in m aintaining the integrity of
these components; it is therefore important
to understand w hat influences adhesive
performance and to predict how it might
change with time.
   BRE carried out evaluations of durabil­
ity, u n der various climatic conditions, of
the adhesive bond and of wood products
m anufactured using adhesives. This
provided data from which to predict long­
term behaviour. It was also valuable in
developing methods of test and levels of
performance for British and European
 standards, both for adhesives themselves
 and for wood-based panel products. C on­                                                                                                   mm

Performance Analysis Club
Building designers and services engineers
need to be able to predict the environ­
mental perform ance of buildings, but at
present they are faced with a proliferation
of prediction methods and little guidance
on their use. D uring the year BRE set up
a new organisation which will permit better
co-ordination and consultation within the
construction industry on the best methods
to use. T he inaugural meeting of the
Building Environm ental Perform ance
Analysis Club (BEPAC) was held at
Garston in November 1987.


Measuring airtightness of
office buildings
Natural air leakage is a major factor which
must be considered when calculating
ventilation requirements. Until now, use
of the p ressu risatio n techn ique for
measuring air leakage has been confined
almost exclusively to housing because of
difficulties of equipment size and multiple                                                             Si!Ml

 become economically attractive when

Noise environm ent in buildings
Noise is an increasing problem in housing,
and owners commissioned BRE to investi­
gate complaints and recommend ways of
improving sound insulation. Investigations
were carried out in occupied houses to
measure the performance of walls and
floors against existing standards and to
suggest remedial measures.
   O ther work for commercial clients invol­
ved using the large anechoic chamber,
which can be instrumented to carry out a
wide range of acoustic measurements.
Examples of equipment tested this year
included hi-fi systems and ship’s whistles.


Gasifier slags for use in concrete
A new type of slag is formed as a by­
product of a gasification process for the
production of substitute natural gas (SNG)                 B R E Anechoic Chamber
and for electrical power generation from
coal. BRE research showed that these slags
have promising cementitious properties
and could be used as partial replacements
for Portland cement in concrete. British
Gas commissioned BRE to carry out long­
term durability studies on gasifier slag
cement concretes; their performance is
being evaluated following exposure in
sulphate solutions, and in sea water and
acid moorland water. T he work will pro­
vide concrete specifiers and users with
information to ensure the safe use of
products incorporating these materials.                    Improved sulphate resistance o f concretes containing

softwood joinery, and in improved coating
systems. D uring the year BRE worked
with several companies in the joinery and
surface coatings industries, and with raw
materials suppliers, in evaluating existing
types of wood coatings and developing new
formulations. Using both natural and
a rtific ia l w e a th e rin g facilities, a
comprehensive evaluation was made of the
durability of coatings and their effectiveness
in controlling wood moisture content;
microbiological assays established resis­
tance to attack by micro-organisms.
   BRE has developed a technique for
evaluating photodegradation of wood
which involves the assessment of tensile
strength changes in thin wood strips
exposed to artificial weathering. This
provides a rapid means of obtaining
quantitative data, and offers a way of

                                               The value of B R E ’s work to both
                                               Government and industry rests on the
                                               Establishment’s independence of sectoral
                                               interests, the breadth of its technical
                                               capabilities and the depth of scientific
                                               understanding that underpins its work.
                                               Those characteristics are amply

                                               Establishment is of no value unless it
                                               is known and applied, and this year

Sulphate resistance of concrete
Concrete made from Portland cement is
vulnerable to expansive sulphate attack
because of its tricalcium aluminate content.
Analysis was completed during the year of
concretes exposed for 15 years to a fissured
sulphate-bearing clay soil at a site north­
west of London. Results suggested that
concrete can resist sulphate penetration if
it is well-compacted, contains an adequate
cement content and has a low water to
cement ratio. If these conditions are not
met, if sulphate is present in very high
concentrations, or if conditions create a
hydrostatic head across the concrete, then
some attack is likely. Using sulphate-
resisting concrete, autoclaving or pre-
carbonation of the precast products can
offset sulphate attack. The results of this
work, and other research on slag and pfa
cements, will be used to update BRE
recommendations for the specification of
concrete in sulphate-bearing soils and
ground-waters.


Lim estone fillers for cement
New C E N standards, which m ay become
m andatory in the U K , would allow up to
5% of cementitious or inert fillers in
Portland cement; cements containing up to
20% of inert filler m ay also be allowed.
During the year BRE undertook new
research to assess the effects of calcareous
fillers such as limestone, chalk or cement
raw m eal on cement properties and long­
term concrete durability. This will result
in guidance to specifiers on these unfam­
iliar materials.


Accelerated durability test
for m asonry
A recently developed accelerated test
should reduce the time taken to assess the
durability of masonry products from many
years to a few months and should be of use
to manufacturers and specifiers. T he test
uses a cham ber programmed to control
temperature and water spray at rates which
simulate natural exposure cycles of
freeze/thaw, wetting and drying. Results
so far show promising correlation with
natural exposure trials.

Wood and wood products

Performance of adhesives
Adhesives are used increasingly in timber
construction, in wood-based panel products
and finger jointed, laminated or built-up
beams. They provide a means of enhanc­
ing the structural properties of timber com­
ponents as well as using timber resources                                                                                                                        lilllt

performance an d to predict how it might

   BRE carried out evaluations of durabil­
ity, under various climatic conditions, of
the adhesive bond and of wood products
m anufactured using adhesives. This
provided data from which to predict long­
term behaviour. It was also valuable in
developing m ethods of test and levels of
performance for British and European
 standards, both for adhesives themselves
 and for wood-based panel products. C on­
tinuing work, together with assessments
 sponsored by manufacturers of new wood-
 based panel products, will provide                                                                      Evaluating a new method of assessing durability of wood

Building E n v iro n m en tal
Performance Analysis Club
Building designers and services engineers
need to be able to predict the environ­
mental performance of buildings, but at
present they are faced with a proliferation
of prediction methods and little guidance
on their use. D uring the year BRE set up
a new organisation which will permit better
co-ordination and consultation within the
construction industry on the best methods
to use. T h e inaugural m eeting of the
Building Environm ental Perform ance
Analysis Club (BEPAC) was held at
Garston in November 1987.


Measuring airtightness of
office buildings
Natural air leakage is a major factor which
must be considered when calculating
ventilation requirements. U ntil now, use
of the p ressurisatio n techn ique for
measuring air leakage has been confined
almost exclusively to housing because of
difficulties of equipment size and multiple
fan controls. B RE has now designed and
built B REFA N , a system of fan units
which can be used together to pressurise
non-domestic buildings. It is powered from
conventional 13 amp sockets, and uses
independent synchronous control to
prevent interaction between fans.
   Leakage tests on a conventional office
building and on the BRE Low Energy
Office confirm ed that the pressure
difference between inside and outside
required for effective m easurem ent was
easily reached. They also demonstrated the
high level of airtightness achieved in the
Low Energy Office: the conventional                                                       imMi
building was twice as leaky. Further work
will lead to a better understanding of the
balance required between the opposing
needs of controlling air leakage to reduce                                                           mMiM

Storm dam age to buildings
The storm of 15/16 October 1987, with
near hurricane-force winds, caused exten­
sive building damage over a wide area of
south-east E ngland. BRE responded
immediately, visiting affected locations,
inspecting dam age and providing advice on
the state of damaged structures. Sub­
sequently over 16 000 reports of damage,
from the press, District and C ounty
Councils an d Area Health Authorities,
were received and analysed.

Noise environm ent in buildings
Noise is an increasing problem in housing,
and owners commissioned BRE to investi­
gate complaints and recommend ways of
improving sound insulation. Investigations
were carried o u t in occupied houses to
measure the performance of walls and
floors against existing standards and to
suggest rem edial measures.

ved using th e large anechoic chamber,
which can b e instrum ented to carry out a
wide range o f acoustic measurements.
Examples o f equipm ent tested this year
included hi-fi systems and ship’s whistles.


Gasifier slags for use in concrete

product of a gasification process for the
production o f substitute natural gas (SNG)             B R E Anechoic Chamber
and for electrical power generation from
coal. BRE research showed that these slags
have prom ising cementitious properties
and could b e used as partial replacements
for Portland cem ent in concrete. British
Gas commissioned BRE to carry out long­
term durability studies on gasifier slag
cement concretes; their performance is
being evaluated following exposure in
sulphate solutions, and in sea water and
acid m oorland water. The work will pro­
vide concrete specifiers and users with
information to ensure the safe use of
products incorporating these materials.                 Improved sulphate resistance of concretes containing

years in im proving the performance of
softwood jo in ery , and in improved coating
systems. D u rin g the year BRE worked
with several companies in the joinery and
surface coatings industries, and with raw
materials suppliers, in evaluating existing
types of wood coatings and developing new
formulations. Using both natural and
artificial w e a th e rin g facilities, a
comprehensive evaluation was made of the
durability of coatings and their effectiveness
in controlling wood moisture content;
microbiological assays established resis­
tance to attack by micro-organisms.
   BRE has developed a technique for
evaluating photodegradation of wood
which involves the assessment of tensile
strength changes in thin wood strips
exposed to artificial weathering. This
provides a rapid means of obtaining
quantitative d ata, and offers a way of

FRS analysis o f fire brigade statistics (with

response to an alarm) has supported the
desirability o f installing single point
automatic fire detectors in dwellings. There
is economic justification for doing so, but

safety, when a sprinkler system is installed.

Dear Sir
FORMAL SUBMISSION TO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY BY
MR G D CLARKSON CHIEF FIRE OFFICER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE
LONDON FIRE AND CIVIL DEFENCE AUTHORITY

I have received a letter dated 29th June 1989 from Mr C D Clarkson (copy enclosed)
sending me a copy of evidence submitted to your inquiry which I understand you
invited him to provide. As a m atter of accuracy, I write to correct a number of
factual mistakes in the submission and to draw your attention to certain important
omissions.
The London Borough of Brent is responsible for the Wembley Stadium Complex in
respect of the enforcement of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1985 and the London
Government Act 1963, which relates to Entertainments Licensing (including indoor
Sports Licensing).
I am principally concerned that the impression given by the submission is one of
unco-operative and unwilling Local Authorities, who are not committed to achieving
high standards of Public Safety within their area of responsibility. This is not the
case so far as Brent is concerned and in order to qualify this statem ent I would ask
you to take into account the following points listed in their order of importance as I
see things:-
1.         (Reference 4.4.2) The submission states that officers of the Local Authority
           will not necessarily be in attendance at sporting events held at the weekend
           or evenings . In our case this is simply not true. Item 2.11 states that
           L.F.C.D.A Officers attended all major events at Wembley Stadium and this
           amounted to 20 During Performance Inspections. There were in fact 33 major
           events at Wembley Stadium during 1988. I am in possession of this
           information because my team of Safety Officers attended on each and every
           occasion.
                                                                           Cont'd .

The Secretary to the Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster


2.     (Reference 6.3.5) I think the suggestion that the LFCDA and Police be given
        duplicate powers to issue prohibition notices to be quite unnecessary and also
        itself dangerous. In my view it is imperative that agencies involved with
        safety work together. At present this happens. If agencies can issue
        prohibition notices in the absence of 'the local authority' this could well be a
        recipe for anarchy. It would certainly remove one of the main planks which
        at present makes close liaison between different agencies necessary.
        Duplicated powers can also give rise to responsibility being avoided by 'buck
        passing' between the agencies having the same power. The Stadium operator
        also needs to know exactly the responsibilities and powers of the different
        agencies involved.
3.     (Reference 5.1.4) It is alleged that a "Police Exercise" took place at Wembley
        concerned only with Police reactions to Public Order situations. This is
        untrue. In 1987 a major incident exercise was arranged to test the reaction
        times of Fire, Police, Ambulance and Medical Services. I enclose the list of
        co-ordinating authorities present at the four meetings prior to the exercise,
        together with a list of the dates of the meetings when a divisional Fire
        Brigade Officer was in attendance. I further enclose a press cutting showing
        a Fire Officer at the scene of the "incident"

       It has been decided to test again the response times of emergency services
       because of changes in the roadways around the Stadium. In this respect I
       enclose a note of the minutes of the last meeting showing an LFCDA
       Divisional Officer in attendance. I am informed that two previous meetings
       have taken place 31 January 1989 and 11 April 1989 when Divisional Officer
       Sillitoe was also in attendance. The Fire Brigade will be sending a number of
       appliances on this exercise, as indeed they did on the last one.

       Since Brent became the enforcing authority, after abolition of the Greater
       London Council there have been two instances of a "major exercise" and the
       LFCDA have been fully involved in both the planning and execution of the
       same.

4.     (Reference 4.1.7) It is stated that during a major refurbishment this
       Authority did not consult with the Fire Brigade on means of escape in respect
       of seating upperbays. My records show, that the m atter was discussed at the
       Brent Safety Team with two Divisional Officers together with the Station
       Officer responsible for the Stadium. There was a joint inspection made with
       the Licensing Officer by the LFCDA. Fire Officers hold no suitable
       qualification to adjudicate on structural matters. However, it is not my view
       that they should be excluded from an opinion and that is why the m atter of
       seating the upper (previously) standing bays at Wembley, was raised at the
       proper forum of the Safety Team.

                                                                          Cont'd .
The Secretary to the Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

        I am surprised that Mr Clarkson raises this particular issue, since by seating
        bays which were previously standing accommodation, the capacity of the bays
        was cut by approximately 50 per cent, whilst almost double the necessary
        escape capacity remains available. In this particular instance additional exits
        were provided in certain bays and travel distances reduced considerably. At
        the same time a review of overall capacities took place and reductions were
        also made in the lower bays.
5.      (Reference 2.3.1) It is stated that Wembley Stadium apply for "at least” 12
        occasional music licences in respect of large outdoor pop concerts per year.
        This is simply not true. Since the Stadium was built in 1923, there has only
        been one year when so many concerts have taken place and that was 1988.
        The average (from GLC records) is 3 major concerts annually since 1970 with
        only 2 to date this year with 2 more planned.
6.     (Reference 1.1.14) It is stated that under the 1987 Act the term "sports
        ground" is replaced by the term "sports stadia", In fact the Act did exactly
        the opposite and replaced the term "sports stadium" with the term "sports
        ground". The same reference to "sports stadia", where in fact Mr Clarkson is
        clearly referring to "sports grounds", appears throughout his submission.

7.     There are also factual inaccuracies in the Appendices section of Mr
       Clarkson's submission but I do not think them to be of sufficient import to
        ment detailed corrections.
The purpose of this letter is to correct certain factual inaccuracies that are
immediately apparent to me. There are many other opinions and value judgements
made in the submissions, about which I am very uncomfortable.
In general terms since the abolition of the G.L.C. this Council has found working
relations to be excellent with our counterparts in the Fire Service. This good working
relationship has been forged, together with the Police Authority and Fire Brigade,
under the auspices of the Brent Safety Team. It is unfortunate that such good work
should be prejudiced by a Chief Officer's submission prepared on the basis of
inaccuracies and misinformation.
I find it regrettable and inexplicable that Mr Clarkson should make a submission to
you containing such material inaccuracies. We have taken the view, since GLC
abolition, that full consultation between all agencies concerned with safety is vital.
We have never sought to limit any of those involved to the confines of their
professional disciplines and have welcomed all contributions. Personally I have found
LFCDA officers to be substantial contributors to consideration of all safety matters
concerning the Wembley Stadium complex. My staff have enjoyed a similar
experience.
I know that my Members regard it as essential that the Council fully co-operates with
all other agencies concerned with safety matters, especially the Police and the
LFCDA. This has been and will continue to be so in Brent.

I can only assume Mr Clarkson prepared his submission in haste.

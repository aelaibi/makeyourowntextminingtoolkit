               I am a Police Constable/ 1 n the South Yorkshire Police Force                      jjpssently

               April   1989 (ISC            I commenced acting Police Serg<                duties at

               Mexborough Police Station.             At 1511 pm that day as a result of what

               Police Sergeant 2254 Johnston told me I made my way in company with

               Sergeant Johnston to the Hi 11s bo rough Football Stadium at She f f i e 1d .

               On arrival at the junction of Penistone Road North and Cl ayw he e1s

               with PS 2254 Johnston at the junction of Penistone Road North a n d

   tZ & Y      Cl ay wh ee 1s L a n e . Whilst engaged on traffic duties I observed many
'Sort►*T0rJ*
               Liverpool supporters          carrying cans of alcoholic drink.             A large number

               of Liverpool      supporters were clearly the worse for drink,                some
                                                                                PAGE

           supporters hurled verbal abuse directly at myself and other officers.

           In the circumstances of the tradegy I felt   it was prudent

           to ignore the comments made by some Liverpool   supporters.     I remained

           engaged on traffic control duties at this location until      1810   pm.   In

           company with Police Sergeant 225 and Johnson I made my way to

           Mexborough Police Station arrivng at 1845 pm.

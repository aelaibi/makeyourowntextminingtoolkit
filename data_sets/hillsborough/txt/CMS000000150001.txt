  JOINT RIBA AND SPORTS COUNCIL SPORTS STADIA SEMINAR 2 OCTOBER
  1990
  As you will see'from the enclosed, the new Minister for Sport has
  been invited to speak at the second seminar on Sports Stadia
  after Hillsborough following the first in March of this year at
  which Lord Ferre Cs gave the opening address. Would the Home
  Office be content at such DOE rather than Home Office involve­
  ment?
  We can see some advantage in the Minister stressing the
  importance which he attaches to improved spectator facilities,
  stressing the Government's commitment to all-seater stadia,
  referring to the draft Planning Policy Guidance Note on Sport and
  Recreation (which should be out for consultation by then!) at the
  DOE role in relation to the Football Trust. Naturally he would
  also have to trespass briefly on your territory, particularly on
  what the latest position was on the FLA. Clearly we would need to
  consult you on any draft text of his speech.

  Incidentally, I see from the attached agenda that Professor
  Maunder is given as a member of the FLA. I thought any such
  appointments were a secret at present and that he was not a
  member anyway?

  Yours sincerely

     M i s t e r McIntyre Esq*,
     Private Secretary to the Minister of Sport.

                     BY PAX - 3 sheets including this covering letter-

     Dear Alister McIntyre,

            Joint RIBA & Sports Council Sports Stadia Seminar 2*
                     Thursday October 25th- 1990.

     Further to our telephone conversation this morning 1 attach as
     promised the draft programme for the follow up seminar on Sports
     Stadia to take place at the RIBA on Thursday October 25th. 1990*

     You will see I have allocated provisionally a slot for the
     Minister of Sport, Robert Atkins to speak at the Lunch. If that
     w erenot convenient I would obviously rearrange the programme
     to fit the Ministers busy schedule.
     The first Sports Stadia seminar which dealt with the immediate
     effect of the Taylor Report was held at the RIBA on March 29th*
     An opening paper was given by Lord Ferrers the Minister of State
     at the Home Office - the government department responsible for
     the presentation of the Taylor Report* The seminar was very
     successful - being over subscribed and an edited version will
     shortly be published.

     This seminar will deal with the problems and opportunities of
     implementing^the Taylor Report proposals — with an emphasis on
     the opportunities rather than just the ringing of hands i

     Can let me know as soon as possible whether the Minister is free
     and able to attend and speak at the seminar? We need to get the
     programme to the printers to enable promotion to start.
     If you have any queries do telephone me.
     Yours sincerely,



     Owen Luder CBE


     P.S.      I understood from the Sports Council last week that a
               preliminary approach had been made by them - and they gave
               me your telephone number.

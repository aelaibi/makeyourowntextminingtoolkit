Dear Sir,

                   ^illsborouirh ™heffield.Saturday 15 th April 1989.


                    As an eye witness at the Leppings Lane end of the ground I would
like to give you m y account as seen,this may be of assistance to you
during your investigations.
                    l l y first reaction,on reflection,is as to whjr so many fans
arrived so late.I travelled by coach fron Earlestown and although we
departed at 11.19 we 'lid not arrive until 2/35 pm,this long journey,in
mj’- opinion was due to the ridiculously chosen route,ie travelling via
'l6 1156 M 63 through Stockport where we stationery in traffic for over
one hour,and involved in traffic hold ups with traffic travelling to
Old Trafford.Our coach driver said he was under instructions to take
this route.9n our return he chose the more direct,quicker Ml 1162 route.
                     ?hir coach was stopped and searched by Police on the outskirts
 o? Sheffield to make sure we all had tickets.
                    ’Then we actually arrived at the ground at approx 2 / k O pm
along with many other coaches at this late time.T was horrified to see
 so ma'ny fans oon(Tref»atinq; around lie North entrance A and 3.It was
 apparent that both seating and standing tickets holders were urin; the
 f\~? ntr.noc.Several children and older folk were being crushed at this
po int.
                     There were 3 horse mounted police standing like statues
and doing nothing to organise any sort of order at the entrances.
                     I finally got through the turnstile to make my way to the
 seating in the North stand .As I showed my ticket I complained to the
attendant that something should be done about the crushing outside and
he just shrugged his shoulders. I was so annoyed by the poor control
that once inside I spoke to 3 Policemen who were just standing with arms
 folded and asked if they knew of the severe crushing and danger to fans
outside,one of them said yes and that he was about to open the large gate.
TTithin seconds as the gate was opened we were swept off our feet by the
 incoming serge of fans.There was a programme sellers stall right dn the
path of the incoming fans and many m e e swept aside.
                    Pans for both standing and seating entered th? same entrance
area and one can imagine the 'charge' to get to positions as by tfiis
time it was approx 3/93 pm.
                    There is no doubt in my mind that this surge was linked with
the terrace disaster that was to follow.

Dear President:
                            HilIsborough


I enclose a copy of a letter         rec e i v e d   this m o r n i n g   from   the
S e c r e t a r y to the Inquiry.
It w o u l d be helpful ini tially to set up a small 'think tank'
c o m p risi ng perhaps, yourself, Ian Stott and Gordon M c K e a g with
m embers of staff.
The office cou ld then draw up the report.          Maybe we could
discuss this m a t t e r this afternoon.


                          Y ou rs sincerely,




                              J .D. D e n t ,
                               Secretary

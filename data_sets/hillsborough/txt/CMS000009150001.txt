         Dear

         Thank you for your recent letter to the Prime Minister which has
         been passed to this department in view of our responsibilities for
         the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I apologise for the delay in
         replying to you.

         Lord Justice Taylor recognised, in his Final Report, that there is
         no single solution to achieve crowd safety and cure all the
         problems of crowd control. However, he was satisfied that seating
         does more to achieve these objectives than any other single
         measure.  He also considered that moving to all seated
         accommodation was consistent with the policies of both FIFA and
         UEFA.

         I understand your feelings and those of many others who wish to
         stand at football matches. However, Lord Justice Taylor said in
         his Final Report:

         "I am not convinced that the cherished culture of the terraces is
         wholly lost when fans are seated. ... The communal spirit is still
         there and finds ready expression. To such extent as the seating
         limits togetherness or prevents movement, that price is surely
         worth paying for the benefits in safety and control."

         This is a view with which the Government is in agreement.

         Lord Justice Taylor also commented that it should be possible for
         clubs to plan a price structure which suits the cheapest seats to
         the pockets of those presently paying to stand. He pointed to
         Ibrox where seating is £6 and standing is £4, which he did not
         consider to be a prohibitive price or differential.  Therefore, the
         fears of many spectators that they may no longer be able to afford
         to attend football matches may be unnecessary.

                                                            Yours sincerely

                other Police Officers were                     in atte nd an ce      to m ai n t a i n order and

                c o ns eq ue ntly we j ^ r k ^ I the vehicle                just off Halifax Rd close to the

               trouble        spots      on our area.

               At about         12.45        (1245)    a message was         received that Liverpool               fans were

       r       getting        rowdy on Hali fa x Rd              close to      its junction wit h Kilner Way.                     iiy

S' °           /serial a t te nd ed and              checked out the area.              Kilner Way       is a shopping

               precinct and a l t h o u g h what a pp ea r e d to be Liverpool                        fans were       in

               e vidence        in quite          lar^e   numbers,      there was       no trouble and          I would

               describe        thei^/rno^l as b o i s t e r o u s .          S i t u a t e d on Kilner Way        is a

               G a t e w a y S u p e r m a r k e t w h i c h had a large queue            (in excess of 20)           of

               Liverpool         s upporters wait in g            to gain entry,          the re a pp e a r e d to be

               S up e r m a r k e t    officials       restricting access an d             I could see that           upon

               leaving the             premises       the football        fans were       carrying      packs     of alcohol

               w h i c h they were            consuming whilst walking away.

               My serial          resjafhed from Ki ln er Way and a ga in                 parked near the T r av el le rs

               Public^>kfuse^.               We   remained at this          point    unti 1 approx.        2.55pm        <1455).

               Dur in g this           period thousands           of Liverpool         fans    passed our       point and         it

               was    remarked upon on several                    occasions       that a lt h o u g h time was        running

               out to enter             the ground a large              portion of the fans were              in no

               a p pa re nt     hurry to get           there,     and    in fact many were walking a w a y from

               the ground as             late as 2 . 4 0 p m      (1440).       I w o ul d estimate        that    it w o ul d




                                                                                                                  'n V
take a m a x im um of          10 minutes        to walk         to H i l l s b o r o u g h from our    point.

D ur i ng      our time at this          o b s e r v at io n    point a large       proportion of the

fans     old enough to drink were                  passing our          point    carrying alcohol             in

the form of bottles and                  cans w h ic h they were             consuming whilst wa lk in g

t owards       the ground.           There was       o bviously a lot of alcohol                being

consumed         in the      short    distance       prior       to entering      the football          ground.

At    no time did         I see a fan         I w ould deser ibe as d r u n k .

T r a f fi c    conditions      on the day         in and a ro u n d the main road              I w o ul d

consider        to be normal          for a semi-final             day and there were           no major

hol d- up s      in our section.             By approx.          2.2Qpm    (1420)    the traffic         flow

appeared        normal       for a Saturday,           but sometime         just after 2 . 3 0 pm (1430),

I saw 2 coaches              full    of Liverpool         supporters arrive,            what    I consider           to

 be late.         These a p p e a r e d to be the               last of the travelling           supporters.

At a r o u n d 2 . 5 5 p m    (1455)     it a pp e a r e d from the         radio traffic        that        there

was    some     sort of       problem at the L ep pings Ln end of the g r o u n d , and

c o n s eq u e nt ly my serial a t t e n d e d there.                Upon^aching          the   location at

a r ou n d 3pm     (1500)      I saw a large           number q ^ s u p p o r t e rs outside           the

  urns t i l e s , obv io us ly wait in g          to qe j / i n the g r o u n d.       At this        time

there were a large amount                    of Pojj/ce Officers            on foot     in a tt en d a n c e and

from my o bs ervations               there    dya not          seem any major       problem.      At     this

time I saw Inspector ROBIJtfSON who was walking away from L e p p i n g s Ln
               —           —             —            ;
and he instructed my^-^rial to resume mobile patrol in the area.           We

resumed        patrol and a l t h o u g h there was a lot of traffic                       on the       radio we

did not         realise      either    the extent         of the disaster           or the actual

location.         However,          in the    next few minutes             it was obvious        that        there

was a major         problem and that ambul an ce s a nd fire                      engines were

requiring         urgent access          to t h e qffround, my serial             therefore      closed

reactions.

After       congestion had eased at approijjrlffate 1y 3.4 5                    (1545)      I took my

At 4 . 4 0 p m        (1640) S e rgeant GLOSSOP informed me that 20 men were

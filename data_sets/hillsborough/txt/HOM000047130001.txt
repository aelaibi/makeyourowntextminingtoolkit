Dear Mr Bone

Documents Pertaining to Hillsborough Disaster

I refer to the letter dated July 1997 from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to Richard Wells, Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire. In paragraph 3, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith asks that you be
informed of the nature of documents we hold and how you may obtain access to them.

Our store of documents is held in police premises at Heeley, near the centre of Sheffield.
Our Heeley offices accommodate the Discipline and Complaints Department and the Audio
and Visual Aids Unit. The premises are locked and alarmed at night.

The store room of documents contains about 70 hours of video tape recordings, 30
photograph albums and numerous documents, statements and transcripts. The room is
about 15 feet square and is full from floor to ceiling with shelves of Hillsborough related
items. There is also a central column of documents. There is about 315 feet of shelves full
of papers, etc. We have a computer to help keep track of all the items. Many of the
documents, videos etc are duplicates of records held by other bodies.

We will provide every assistance to you and your staff in gaining access to the documents.
Constable Ken GREENWAY (tel: 0114 2821047) is conversant with all aspects of the
disaster and the documentation. He works at Heeley and I am sure you will find him of
great assistance in your work.

Please contact me when you have considered how you wish to work, and I will make the
necessary arrangements.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

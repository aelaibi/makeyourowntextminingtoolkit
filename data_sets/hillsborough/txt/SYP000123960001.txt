 CRUSH.        I WAS HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING AND I JUST LOST MY FOOTING AND MY
 LEGS GAVE WAY AND I WENT DOWN.        IT WAS JUST THE PEOPLE IN THE TUNNEL WHO

 WERE PUSHING FORWARDS BECAUSE ALL THEY KNEW WAS THAT THE MATCH HAD KICKED

 OFF AND THEY WERE MISSING IT SO THEY PUSHED FORWARDS.

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF      YOUR OWN ACCORD?

G20

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 ^p|ER I HAD SEARCHED AROUND THE GROUND F O R _______ f WANTED TO GO THROUGH THE

 TUNNEL TO SEE IF HE WAS IN THE PENS OR DEAD ON THE PITCH.             THERE WERE HALF A

 DOZEN POLICE OFFICERS BLOCKING THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL AND THEY WOULDN’T

 LET US THROUGH.    THEN A MIDDLE AGED MAN CAME RUNNING UP AND SAID THAT HE HAD

 BEEN TOLD THAT HIS SIXTEEN YEAR OLD SON WAS DYING ON THE PITCH AND HE WAS

 FRANTIC TO GET TO SEE HIM BUT THE POLICE JUST WOULDN’T LET HIM THROUGH.

 THEY GOT A BIT STRONG WITH HIM AND HE TRIED TO PUSH HIS WAY THROUGH BECAUSE

 HE WAS UPSET BUT A MAN TOOK HIM AWAY AND AROUND ANOTHER WAY.

 THEY WERE TOTALLY UNSYMPATHETIC AND JUST COLDLY SAID THAT NO ONE WAS GOING

 THROUGH.

IT WAS ALL JUST A COMPLETE SHAMBLES, THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION AT ALL.
      4

THERE WERE MORE POLICE STANDING ON THE HALF WAY LINE DOING NOTHING THAN WERE

HELPING WITH THE INJURED AND DEAD.     IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE POLICE WERE MORE

CONCERNED WITH KEEPING THE FANS SEPARATED THAN WITH SAVING LIVES.

THEY SHOULD HAVE GONE OUTSIDE WITH A LOUD SPEAKER AND POSTPOSTED THE GAME“S

KICK OFF AND TOLD EVERYONE OUTSIDE AND IT WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE PANIC AND

STOPPED THE CRUSH OUTSIDE.

I REMEMBER THAT THE POLICE WERE HAVING TO STAND ON BODIES WHO MAY NOT HAVE

ALL BEEN DEAD TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THE PEN.

IT IS JUST AN OBSERVATION BUT IF THEY HAD CARRIED THE BODIES OUT ALONG THE

UiNNEL THEN THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO WALK OVER PEOPLE WHO STILL. MAY HAVE

BEEN ALIVE.

QS4

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

THERE WAS   A LOT OF BAD FEELING AGAINST THE POLICE BECAUSE   OF THEIRLACK    OF

ACTION TO   HELP PEOPLE.   THEY TOOK A LOT OF ABUSE THAT   DAY AFTER THE MATCH.

I DO N ’T THINK THAT THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN PLAYED THERE AT ALL.      THERE WAS

NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE FANS AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT HAD TO GET THROUGH

THE SMALL ENTRANCE WAS TOO MUCH.

■ A r e WERE NO POLICE OFFICERS UP LEPPINGS LN SORTING OUT THE CROWD AND I

DON *T KNOW WHY THEY DIDN’T SET UP BARRIERS FURTHER UP     THE ROAD.

THERE WAS   NO ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND AT ALL.

AT ANFIELD THERE ARE SIX QUEUES, FIVE POLICE HORSES IN BETWEEN THE QUEUES

THAT MOVE UP AND DOWN KEEPING EVERYONE IN LINE.     IF YOU STEP OUT OF LINE

THEN YOU    GET DRAGGED AWAY FROM THE GROUND.   THEY DO NOT STAND ANY NONSENSE

AND SO AS A RESULT YOU CAN HAVE GOOD ORGANISED QUEUES HALF WAY AROUND THE

GROUND BUT THERE IS NO CRUSHING. AT HILLSBOROUGH IT WAS CHAOS AND TO MY MIND

THE POLICE CAUSED THE PROBLEMS OUTSIDE THE GROUND BY LETTING THAT CRUSH

DEVELOP INSTEAD OF ORGANISING EVERYONE.

 WHEW I WENT THROUGH THE TURNSTILES THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STILL
     %
 WAITING TO GET IN AND WHEN I WAS BEING CRUSHED IN THE PEN THREE BY THE TUNNEL

 THOSE PEOPLE WERE STILL WAITING TO GET IN.        BY LETTING THAT HAPPEN IT SLOWED

 DOWN THE   NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO COULD GET IN BECAUSE ITWAS DISORGANISED AND

 MADE THE   SITUATION WORSE.

 I KNOW THAT NEARLY     EVERYONE HAD TICKETS BECAUSE WHEN I WAS TRYING TO BUY    ONE

 OUTSIDE WITH         THERE WAS   NO ONE ELSE TRYING TO BUY ONE.

 I HAVE JUST REMEMBERED THAT SOMEONE TOLD ME IN THE GROUND THAT PEOPLE WERE

 BEING CRUSHED AND WERE DYING AT 1430,

 REALISED HOW SERIOUS THE SITUATION WAS AND WOULD HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO MAKE

 MORE ROOM.

 3.      THE POLICE JUST KEPT TELLING THE CROWD TO MOVE BACK BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE

 TO DO SO I WAS IN A VERY DISTRESSED CONDITION AND I C A N ’T REALLY RECALL

 EVENTS VERY CLEARLY.


<3^

 354

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICAL INQUIRY.

 1.     A LOT OF TRAFFIC CONGESTION MEANT LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WERE ARRIVJlMG AT

 THE GROUND LATER THAN THEY INTENDED.

 2.      THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH POLICEMEN CONTROLLING THE CROWD BY THE TURNSTILES,

 THERE WERE MORE OF THEM THERE LAST YEAR      AND THE QUEUES WERE BETTER CONTROLLED

 3.      THERE DIDN’T APPEAR TO BE AS MANY STEWARDS THERE, LAST YEAR THERE WERE

 MORE.
 4,   SUPPORTERS SHOULD BE CHECKED TO SEE IF THEY'VE GOT A TICKET BEFORE THEY

 GET TO THE GROUND-    THOSE NOT HAVING A TICKET SHOULD BE TURNED AWA Y .

 BY DOING THIS IT WOULD CUT DOWN ON THE CROWD CONGESTION OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 INSIDE THE GROUND THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN STEWARDS DIRECTING THE CROWD SO THAT

 IT WAS EVENLY   SPREAD AMONGST THE PENS ON THE TERRACING. THE REASON FOR

 ALLOCATING THE ENDS WAS THAT OF TRAFFIC ACCESS.       WELL WE CAME INTO SHEFFIELD

 THROUGH THE FOREST END SO I D O N ’T BELIEVE IT WAS A VALID REASON.

 THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORT SHOULD HAVE HAD THE SPION KOP END AS IT WAS OBVIOUS

 THAT THEY WOULD TURN UP IN THE GREATER NUMBERS.

 IF THE FENCES HAD NOT BEEN THERE THIS TRAGIC EVENT WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER/THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?
                C M
 THE POLICE WERE NOT ORGANISED. I DO NOT THINK THEY REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING

 WHEN THEY DID THEY DJ/C EVERYTHING THEY COULD. BUT THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION AT

 ALL. THE FANS SEEMED TO BE DOING MORE THAN THE POLICE, THAT’S BECAUSE OF THE

 NUMBERS I THINK.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1) THE FA GOT IT WRONG WITH THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS.   IAM TOLD   ITWAS BAD

 L|pr YEAR. THEY SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THE FANS.

 2) THERE WAS NO POLICE ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND. THEY SHOULD HAVE KEPT

 PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE TURNSTILES.

 3) THEY SHOULD HAVE REALISED THE SITUATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND DELAYED THE

 GAME. BECAUSE EVERYONE OUTSIDE KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO MISS THE GAME AND

 BECAME AGITATED.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE! ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE:. INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

       REACTION BY THE OFFICIALS WAS VERY SLOW AND ONCE THERE WAS A REACTION

 THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION AT ALL,WITH POLICEMEN ACTING ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE

 NO STEWARDS SEEN AT ALL Gt. 11 ING INVOLVED WI fri ASBIS! 1NG IHe:.. rANa.       iHtRE WAS

 OBVIOUSLY A COMPLETE LACK OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT UNTIL AN AMBULANCE ARRIVED,

 WHICH WA S N ’T UNTIL 1540 HOURS.     THE POLICE REACTED TO THE INCIDENT AS IF

 THERE WAS A PITCH INVASION AND WERE MORE CONCERNED WITH KEEPING FANS APART.

 FROM THE EARLY LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENTS IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THERE WAS NO

 COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE AUTHORITIES AND THE ANNOUNCER DID NOT KNOW WHAT

 WAS GOING ON.

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 •1.         THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS WRONG.                 LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED

 THE SPION KOP END PURELY ON THE BASIS OF WEEKLY ATTENDANCES AT MATCHES,

 2.           THE FENCES AT THE SIDES OF THE PENS PREVENTED THE SPREAD OF FANS

 FROM THE CENTRE PENS TO THE SIDE AREAS.

 3.           THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF TRAINING FOR MATCH STEWARDS WHO ON THE

 DAY DID NOTHING TO ASSIST.

 4.           POLICE COMMUNICATION SEEMED VERY POOR AT HILLSBOROUGH WITH LITTLE OR

 NO ORGANISATION.

 3.           DESPITE ARRIVING AT THE GROUND EARLY AND HAVING PLENTY                  OF TIME TO

^ i D MATCH VIEWING POINT, I DID NOT REALISE THAT YOU COULD GO AROUND

 THE SIDE OF THE STAND TO GET TO THE TERRACING AND THOUGHT THAT THE

 ONLY WAY IN WAS THROUGH               THE CENTRE TUNNEL. MORE          SIGNS SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 IN VIEW OR THERE SHOULD               HAVE BEEN POLICE/STEWARD         DIRECTIONS.

 6   .        THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF ENCOURAGEMENT FOR FANS TO GO INTO THE

 GROUND EARLY (EG ENTERTAINMENT OF SOME SORT) TO AVOID THE LATE RUSH

 AND PANIC CAUSED AT TURNSTILES.                     THE RE-INTRODUCTION OF LICENSING

 INSIDE THE GROUND WOULD               STOP PEOPLE STAYING AT PUBS UNTIL THE          LAST

 MINUTE AND RUSHING TO GET TO THE GROUND.

 NO.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE HATCH WAS STOPPED?

 PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO GET OUT AND FANS WERE FULLING THE WIRE MESH AWAY               IN

 ORDER TO FREE THEM.    HOWEVER POLICE WERE PREVENTING THEM.           FANS RIPPED

 BOARDINGS AWAY AS STRETCHERS BUT AGAIN POLICE STOPPED THEM.

 A a   MESSAGE HAD SEEN GIVEN OUT AT AN EARLIER STAGE THEN THE POLICE WHO HAD

 FORMED A CORDON ACROSS THE PITCH WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE

 OR ORGANISATION OF SUCH A RESCUE INSTEAD OF LEAVING SO MANY NOTTS FOREST

 SUPPORTERS SINGING AND AGGREVATING LIVERPOOL FOLLOWERS.

 YOUR* ENTRY POINT AND MATCH VIEWING POINT?

 (BRIEFLY DESCRIBE)

ONCE I WAS SEATED AT ABOUT 2PM (1400)        I COULD SEE 1 OR 2 PEOPLE

 BEING LIFTED UP INTO THE WEST STAND PER MINUTE.           I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND

WHY THIS WAS OCCURRING BECAUSE THERE APPEARED             TO BE PLENTY OF ROOM AT

 THE BACK OF THE TERRACE.     IN MY OPINION THIS WAS A PRE-DETERMINED

 PLAN FOR PEOPLE TO GET INTO THE STANDS FOR A BETTER VIEW. THERE WAS

 A CONSTANT FLOW OF PEOPLE BEING LIFTED UP FROM 2PM <1400) ONWARDS.

 I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT TOWARDS THE KICK OFF THE NUMBERS BEING LIFTED

 UP ESCALATED TO 20-30 PEOPLE PER MINUTE.

WE LEFT ABOUT 10 MINUTES AFTER THE LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT THAT

THE GAME HAD BEEN ABANDONED, BECAUSE THE GROUND WAS VISIBLY

EMPTYING.

G52

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A

 CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 I SAW ONE LIVERPOOL FAN RUN THE FULL LENGTH OF THE PITCH, HE STOOD IN FRONT OF

 THE NOTTINGHAM FOREST KOP, WITH HIS LEGS APART AND MADE TWO FINGERED GESTURES

 TO THE KOP, HE THEN RAN BACK TO THE CORNER BETWEEN THE SOUTH STAND AND THE

 LEPPINGS LANE END WHERE HE WAS RUGBY TACKLED BY A POLICE OFFICER AND MARCHED

 (ft   .

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WERE NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME.

 UNTIL THE FIRE BRIGADE ARRIVED THE POLICE APPEARED UNABLE

 TO PREVENT THE CRUSH.

 THE POLICE INITIALLY APPEARED TO TREAT THE SITUATION AS A PITCH

 f t A S I O N AND APPEARED TO CONCENTRATE ON CONTAINING THE FANS

 WITHIN THE TERRACE AREA.     THIS WAS CONFIRMED WHEN ANOTHER

 GROUP OF OFFICERS CAME IN FROM BETWEEN THE NORTH STAND AND

 THE SPION KOP AND IMMEDIATELY FORMED A CORDON ALONG THE CENTRE

 LINE. CLEARLY THE RESCUE SERVICES WERE COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED

 BY THE SITUATION.

 THE POLICE APPEARED     TO BE BEMUSED,   I SAW NO   SENIOR POLICE OFFICER

 TAKING CONTROL AND    THERE WAS COMPLETE DISORGANISED CHAOS. EVERYBODY

 WAS GETTING IN EVERYBODY ELSES WAY. THERE DID APPEAR ENOUGH POLICE

     COMMUNICATION THEY WERE UNABLE TO.

     I COULD SEE AN AMBULANCE COME FROM THE AREA BETWEEN THE SPION

     KOP AND THE NORTH STAND.    IT TRAVELLED ALONG THE PERIMETER TRACK

     IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND, BUT DUE TO THE SHEER VOLUME OF

     PEOPLE AND BODIES SITUATED ON THE PITCH AND PERIMETER TRACK IN

     FRONT OF THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACE ITS PROGRESS WAS SEVERELY

     HAMPERED. THE AMBULANCE, DESPITE HAVING THE SIREN AND BLUE LIGHTS

     ON COULD ONLY INCH ITS WAY ROUND TO THE BACK OF THE GOAL.

     I NOTICED THERE WAS A DEFINITE LACK OF ANY MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.

     ^ M Y   OPINION THE FIRST SIGN OF ANYBODY TAKING CONTROL WAS WHEN

     THE FIRE BRIGADE ARRIVED AT ABOUT 3.30PM (1330). THEY WENT STRAIGHT

     TO THE FENCE AND GOT INTO THE PEN AND WITHIN 10 MINUTES THE PEN

     BEGAN TO CLEAR VERY QUICKLY.

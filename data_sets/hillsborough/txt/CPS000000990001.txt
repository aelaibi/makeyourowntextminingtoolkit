Dear Mr Croston

Adlington v Duckenfield: Adlington v Murray


We have this afternoon discovered that we have made a false point about the positioning o f
James Sharpies’ statement. The mistake arose because the first digit o f the page number was
put in wrongly to the computer. Our sequential list shows Sharpies’ statement appearing at
page 2458 when it should be page 3458. Therefore, we no longer rely on its position in the
Master Witness List. However, we continue to rely heavily on the other points made about its
contents.


Yours sincerely



ft .              .

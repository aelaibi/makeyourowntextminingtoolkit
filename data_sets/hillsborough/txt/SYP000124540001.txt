 NO X C O U L D N ’T, THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO.    I WASN'T IN A POSITION TO

 HELP.     I SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER     FENCES AND BODIES      CARRIED OVER AND THROUGH

 UP TO ENTER AT LEPPINGS LANE TURNSTILES FOR THOSE 3 POINTS.             A LOT   OF

 M ^ S L I N G AT ENTRANCE BOTTLE-NECK SITUATION.     THIS CAUSED    GATES TO BE OPENED

 AND SUDDEN RUSH.     A LOT OF FANS CAME     INTO PEN (6) BY ME WHO    STILL HAD THEIR

 REALISED THE SERIOUSNESS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED.    WHEN IT WAS REALISED IT WAS

 A LACK OF MEANS TO DEAL WITH IT THAT WAS APPARENT.

 <354

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 (1) LACK OF SIGNS AND DIRECTIONS BY POLICE OFFICER OR STEWARDS/pfFICIALS

 WITHIN THE YARD AREA TO DIRECT FANS TO LESS CROWDED PARTS QFVTHE GROUND,

 (2) LACK OF CONTROL OR DIRECTION BY ABOVE OFFICIALS AT TUI^NEL ENTRANCE TO

P ENS <3) AND (4) .             u'Q-Pi-s2-         .

 <|Q NOT ENOUGH POLICE/STEWARDS MONITORING FRONT       OF PENS (3)   AND <4> TO FEED

 BACK INFO RE NUMBERS OF   FANS BEING ALLOWED INTO THOSE PENS.       SHOULD HAVE

 THEN BLOCKED OFF TUNNEL ENTRANCE.

 <4) WHY WERE THERE SIDE   FENCES BETWEEN PENS <1> TO <6> PREVENTING EXPANSION

 TO SIDES OF FANS IN (3) AND <4) WHEN ALL WERE THE SAME       SUPPORTERS. IN MY

 OPINION THIS CAUSED THE UNNECESSARY DEATH AND INJURIES       TO FANS.

 (5) I CAME TO THE MATCH LAST yEAR AND THIS WAS THE ONLY REASON THAT I KNEW

 I HAD AN ALTERNATIVE TO PENq /<3> AND <4> AND SO I WENT      TO PEN (6). WHEN

 STANDING IN THE YARD AREA IT DID NOT APPEAR POSSIBLE TO SEE THE ENTRANCES TO

 (1) AND (6).   THOSE ALTERNATIVES WERE NOT SHOWN BY EITHER SIGN OR DIRECTION.

 IN THE WEST STAND AREA.

                                                                          PAGE    9

 ALLOW PEOPLE IN AND TO SORT THE CRUSH OUT.

 3)    HOW COULD PEOPLE ENTER AN ALL TICKET CUP SEMI-FINAL AND GET INTO THE

 SEATED AREA WITHOUT TICKETS.

 4)    THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A CORDON ABOUT 73 YDS AWAY FROM THE GROUND WHERE

 TICKETS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHECKED AND NONE TICKET HOLDERS COULD HAVE BEEN

 TURNED AWAY.

Dear Sir,

Football Violence.

v'Thilst. I received your letter dated 15th 'fover&sr, I '.n unable to trace
receipt of the report ,::?ootballlViolence - the Metropolitan Viewpoint”
which you mention you sent in Bebruary, 1984.

However, I can say that the South Yorkshire Police maintains close
liaison with other Police Forces as well as with the British Transport
Police and Transport Undertakings through the Footlall Liaison Section
of the Operations Division at Police Headquarters.  Divisional Police
personnel also maintain close consultation and liaision with individual
football clubs.  Additionally, the Police are members of the mufcti-
Msfcipline Officer Working Parties set up by the County Council to
enforce the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.   As
regards the use of Reporting Centres, particularly on Saturday after­
noons, I am able to say that extensive use is made of such facilities.

                              Yours faithfully




                              Chief Executive

Dear Mr. ’IcGeeg®,

Police Charges

I thank you for yourrletter dated 19th November.

It 4s quite true that examples of police charges at away matches were quoted
during the meetings of the Working Group on the effects of Professional
i'oothall on the Coramunity (which met on a number of occasions over the
Winter/Spring of 1933/83).

However, the charges quoted in respect of Horae Matches did not reflect the
amended criteria introduced with effect from 1st April, 1933. As I understand
the position, it was left at the 2nd June, 1983 meeting that the Football Clubs
would come back at the start of the 1933/84 season with evidence of anomalies
which existed in comparative police charges in the light of the application
of the revised criter&A.

Whilst they may not be accurate dwsn to the last spectator or the last penny,
the following approximate figures which I have beennsupplied with illustrate that
the revised criteria has worked to the advantage of the South Yorkshire
Football Clubss-

represent only a small proportion of the total policing costs of football

grounds met by the Police Authority. For example, the total policing costs
for the Hillsborough Stadium in 1983/84 amounted to £216,461. This amount
does not include the cost of officers deployed outside the Stallium.

Far from being an additional tax on South Yorkshire Football Clubs, the
Police Authority believes that the Football Clubs are being treated more
than fairly.

Let Mr Cooney of the Civil Litigation Dept at West Midlands County

On 9 November the High Court Registrar imposed a time limit for the
discovery of documents in connection with the action against Sheffield
United. Details of the time limit are with Mr Irving. When time for
discovery is past the County Council can apply for the trail to be
set down for hearing.  It looks as though the hearing will now take
place before March.

Dear Mr.Hainsworth,

                                                           Police Charges

         Like you I do not wish to prolong correspondence on this m a tte r, but I
am much taken aback when in your fourth paragraph you refer to the opportunity
being given to the clubs to discuss with the County Council and to dem onstrate
th a t the charges were out of line with other areas. This is completely out of
truth with the facts.

      We had a number of meetings, and on many occasions dem onstrated th at
South Yorkshire police charges were way out of line with other areas. If you
examine the files you will see lists and examples. In case these papers have
been misplaced I enclose some copies.

       What we would like to think is th a t the citizens and ra te payers of South
Yorkshire, who are also interested in football, are tre a te d in a similar manner
to other football supporters in the Kingdom, and not be levied an additional tax
as is the case here.

                                                                Yours sincerely,

MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING

The minutes of the meeting held on 9 August 1 9 8 3 , which had been previously
circulated, were accepted as a true and accurate record.      There were no matters
arising.

SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
- PROGRESS REPORT

Mr Vaughan, the Secretary of the working group examining and administering the
provisions of the Act, gave a brief history of what had been achieved in South
Yorkshire.

He drew attention to the condition contained within the general safety
certificate that 21 days notice must be given to the County Council of any
proposed alterations to the grounds.   He was aware that this was not happening
and asked Club Secretaries to be mindful- of the fact that to fail to comply
with a condition of the certificate was an offence under the Act.

Chief Superintendent Carlin asked if there was still in existence a voluntary
 code of safety adopted by Clubs not falling within the bounds of the Act, as
he was most disturbed at the condition of Doncaster Rovers ground.   He was
worried that should disturbances occur in the ground there was a surfeit of
 large pieces of concrete and other potential missiles which could be used by
.unruly elements.

 Mr Holloway agreed with Chief Superintendent Carlin that parts' of Belle Vue
•Were in need of immediate and. extensive renovation and said that he way to have
 a meeting with the Chairman of the Football Grounds Improvements Trust in order
  6 ascertain if there were monies available to Doncaster Rovers to improve their
 f*ound.
Chief Superintendent Carlin questioned the    determination of the Directors at
the Club, as improvements had been spoken    of for a number of years and nothing
had been done*  He reiterated his concern    for the safety of police officers
on duty in the stadium, and enquired of Mr    Vaughan whether the County Council
could assist.

Mr Vaughan stated that as Doncaster Rovers did not qualify under the Act, the
only way the County Council could help would be at the invitation of the Club,
and any changes recommended would have to be undertaken at the Club's expense,
but he did offer to visit Belle Vue, together with the other members of the
working group should the Club so wish.  Mr Holloway thanked Mr Vaughan for the
offer, which he felt would be accepted.

Item discharged.
                                                       !

1984/1985 SEASON

The Chairman gave members a brief account of what he predicted for the
forthcoming season as regards policing problems, stressing the possibility of
recent lawlessness witnessed on picket lines being repeated at football grounds
especially when teams from working mining areas such as Nottingham visited South
Yorkshire.

Mr Clement also warned members of the possibility of policing football matches
with less officers than operationally desirable due to continuing heavy demands
upon manpower.

Chief Superintendent Broomhead recounted an incident at a match at Bramall Lane
towards the end of last season when stones were thrown by the hooligan element
in the crowd.

Chief Superintendent Moseley wanted placing 011 record his appreciation of the
efforts made by the Sheffield Wednesday Manager, Howard Wilkinson, in trying
to prevent pitch invasions at the end of last season.   He also informed members
of the difficulties being faced by British Rail in respect of lack of rolling
stock which would affect special trains to Wadsley Bridge Station, thereby
increasing the number of supporters going through the city centre from the
Midland Station to Hillsborough.

Chief Superintendent Carlin asked Club Secretaries to make their supporters
clubs aware of the difficulties faced by the police after games had finished.
He referred particularly to travelling supporters stopping off in towns, usually
for alcoholic refreshment, which sometimes resulted in confrontations with other
supporters and then the police.

Chief Superintendent Meadows agreed with Chief Superintendent Carlin, and
informed the meeting that with the .assistance of the British Transport Police
and British Rail it was hoped that trains carrying supporters would be
time-tabled so as not to arrive at stations such as Doncaster at the same time.

The Chairman summed up by saying that although there had been signs during last
season that the hooligan problem associated with football was declining he feared
that the trend may not continue in the forthcoming season.

Item discharged.
     SEGREGATION OP SPECTATORS

     Chief Superintendent Moseley introduced this item, outlining a problem occurring
     in the Leppings Lane stand at Hillsborough.  Traditionally, the terracing at
     the Leppings Lane end had been allocated to 'away' supporters, but from
     time-to-time 'away' supporters had also been allowed in the stand.   He was most
     concerned at the continuing sale of season tickets in the stand to Sheffield
     Wednesday supporters increasing the likelihood of confrontation.   He asked for
     guidance as to interpretation of the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975, on this
     point.

     Mr Vaughan replied that the conditions for segregation of supporters contained
     in the Safety at Sports Grounds Act had been interpreted as applying to standing
     areas and he was of the opinion that it did not apply, to seated parts of grounds.

    Mr Chester stated that Sheffield Wednesday were aware of the problem of home
    supporters in the West Stand and,had tried to reduce the numbers of season ticket
    holders from over 200 last season to under 40 this forthcoming season.  He
    pointed out the problems associated with this policy, as some of the season
    ticket holders had been using that stand since it was built for the 1966 World
    Cup.

     The Chairman pointed out that as season tickets had already been sold to
    - Sheffield Wednesday supporters for the West Stand, the potential for
     confrontation would have to be borne in mind when arrangements for policing
     matches were made.                                                .

     Item discharged.

    DUTIES OF STEWARDS

    Chief Superintendent Moseley also introduced this item, saying it had come to
    his notice that stewards were not fulfilling their duties and on occasions had
    removed their jackets and mingled with the crowd in order to avoid trouble.
    He was concerned with the abrogation of their responsibilities and asked Club
    Secretaries to make it clear to stewards what their duties entailed.

    The Chairman stated that it was better for the Clubs if minor disputes which
    need not involve the police were resolved by the stewards rather than resorting
^   to police intervention.

    Item discharged.

    ANY OTHER BUSINESS

    a.   Financial Arrangements for 1984/85 Season

    The Assistant Chief Constable (Management Services), Mr Watson, stated that
    it was the intention of the South Yorkshire Force to police.the five football
    league grounds in an identical manner to previous seasons.  Divisional Commanders
    would assess their manpower requirements for each game and deploy sufficient
    police officers to ensure that there were no public order disturbances.  The
    Clubs would be charged as per the agreed formula based on the official attendance
    at the match, irrespective of how many officers were actually used.  He further
    stated that with effect from 1 September 1984, it was expected that there would
    be an approximate increase in charges of 4.8# to reflect a similar increase
    in police pay.

    There v/as no dissension from this proposed course of action and Mr Watson further
    indicated that in respect of each game Clubs would be allowed 21 days to meet
    the account rendered or legal proceedings to recover the charges would be
    commenced.
                                           _   4   -



    '»
Mr Chester stated that Clubs would have appreciated advance notice of the
increased charges before setting their admission fees.  Mr Watson replied that
the review of police pay was based on a wages index (May to May figures) and
these were not released until late July each year.  To estimate the proposed
increase would be dangerous as evidenced by the NUM dispute which had reduced
the pay index from approximately 7% to 4.8# this year.

Item discharged.         |

b.   Affairs of Football ciubs Discussed
     in Police Committee

Mr Chester asked that Clubs be forewarned about matters concerning them which
were to be discussed at future Police Committee meetings.  He stated that within
an hour of the Police Committee meeting, the Clubs were being approached by
the press and asked to comment about matters on which they had little or no
information.

Mr Vaughan replied that the County Council were aware of the problem and would
look into it.

Item discharged.



The Chairman wished the Clubs a successful and prosperous forthcoming season
and assured them of the continued support of the South Yorkshire .Police.



There being no further business the meeting closed at 12.40 pm.

Dear Mr Spink/Mr Darnhill/Mr Chester/Mr Smith/Secretary

CHARGES FOR POLICE AT FOOTBALL MATCHES

I aii writing to you because I know there has been concern expressed in the
past when this issue ha# arisen at meetings of the Police Committee without
advance notice having been given to the Clubs. This is sometimes unavoidable
because matters are raised in debate when the press and public are present.
However I thought I should let you know that following a meeting of the Police
Finance Sub-Committee the subject will be given an airing at the Police
Committee's meeting on Monday morning, 30 July.

The Committee will be recommended to maintain charges at their present level
until such time as the Police Pay Award is settled. This is currently
rumoured to be around 4.8% and would come into force very early into the start
of the season, leading to an appropriate adjustment in the charges.

Members of the Police Committee are very concerned about the late payments by
Clubs during the past two seasons, particularly the two Clubs who still owe
payments for the season before last and which have made, at present, n o 1offer
to pay. Members feel that it is quite unreasonable for the ratepayers of
South Yorkshire to bear these debts particularly at a time of cut-backs in
public expenditure and extreme pressure on the Police budget due to the miners
dispute.                                                              \

 The Police Finance Sub-Committee are therefore recommending that for the comin
 season the Clubs will be required to meet each bill within 21 days, failing
 which legal proceedings will be instituted without further wsaning.

1.    Note of Previous Meeting

The note of the previous meeting held on the 28th January,              1983, was considered
and agreed.

2.    Charges for Police Services

The meeting had been convened primarily at the request of the five football
league clubs in South Yorkshire to discuss the question of the implementation
date of the revised charges for police services at football matches and the
relevant letter requesting the meeting from the Chairman of the Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club to the Chief Executive was submitted.
In addition the Chief Executive submitted a report recalling the background
to the current and proposed charges for police services together with details
of the outstanding accounts submitted to the Clubs for policing charges during
the recently completed 1982/83 football season, now amounting to some
£243,682.69.  At the request of the Chairman of the Police Committee the
question of Court proceedings for recovery had been deferred pending the
outcome of the discussions on the revised charges and implementation date.

Following consideration by the Policy Budget Sub-Committee and Policy Advisory
Sub-Committee 'A' , the County Council on 23rd March, 1983, had accepted the
revised reduced scale of charges recommended by the Working Group and the
Police Committee but decided that the date of implementation should be 1st
April, 1983, rather than the 1st January, 1983, as recommended.

The clubs welcomed the agreed revised scale of charges but expressed
disappointment that the date of implementation had been delayed, particularly
in view of the current financial difficulties being experienced by many clubs.

The Clubs pointed out that even when the revised scale of charges came into
operation the charges would still be amongst the highest in the country,
and some comparative examples of charges within and outside the county were
quoted.

The Working Group noted the comments of the clubs but pointed out that the
date of implementation of the revised scale of charges had now been finalised
as 1st April, 1983, and could not now be altered.

RECOMMENDED -

1.    That implementation of the revised scale of charges for the services of
Police at football matches from 1st April, 1983 be noted.

2.    That the five Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire be requested to
settle all accounts, as now outlined, submitted for policing charges during
the recently completed 1982/83 football league season.

3.    That, at the start of the 1983/84 season, the Working Group consider
any evidence put forward by the Football Clubs of anomolies in comparative
police charges.

3.   Opening of Football Club Facilities to the Community

The Chief Executive submitted a report on the possible opening of football
clubs facilities to the community, particularly the young unemployed.

At the request of the Chairman of the Working Group the Secretaries of the
five South Yorkshire Football League Clubs had been requested to supply
information regarding the type and extent of facilities available, the current
use made of the facilities by the community together with details of any
proposed additional use. The replies from Sheffield Wednesday, Doncaster
Rovers and Rotherham United Football Clubs were submitted and with the Chairman
permission copies of the reply from Sheffield United Football Club were
circulated.  (Note - a reply from the Barnsley Football Club was received
subsequent to the. meeting and a copy circulated)
The Working Group welcomed the initiatives already taken by the clubs
together with the clubs'offers of future assistance in this field.

The possibility of using grants from the Urban Action Working Party for
specific schemes was considered particularly for schemes involving the young
unemployed. There was a need for such schemes to be developed jointly
between the clubs and the County Council, possibly on the basis of two per
club.

The possible use of a purpose built training facility located at Orgreave
in Rotherham was also considered.

RECOMMENDED - That officers of the County Council and the Clubs discuss
possible suitable schemes involving the use of Football Club facilities for
the community, particularly the young unemployed, and the Chief Executive
report results of the discussions to the Urban Action Working Party.

                                         that the total policing costs

                                  Yours sincerely.

Dear Sir

FOOTBALL VIOLENCE

Representatives of the Association met the Minister for Sport, N MacFarlane MP
on 14 November 1984 to discuss a report produced by officials from various
Government departments on football violence. ("Football Spectator Violence":
HMS0 : ISBN 0 11 751749 6). A summary of the conclusions and recommendations
of the report is set out at annex. The Minister has asked for a formal
response to the report from the Association by the end of the year and the
Association is therefore seeking your Authority's comments on the report.
In addition, this Association circulated the report of an AMA joint working
group to you in February 1984, ("Football Violence — the Metropolitan view­
point") which set out a number of recommendations for co-operation between
local authorities and football clubs.

It would be most helpful, therefore, if, in considering the Government officials'
report, you could also identify the measures which your Authority has undertaken
or plans to introduce to reduce football violence in line with the AMA
recommendations. This information will be used to formulate a response to the
Minister and will be published as a supplement to the AMA working group report.
In view of the relatively short timescale suggested by Government, it is hoped
to re-convene the Association's Working Party before the new year, and to this
end it will be most helpful to receive your views by 10 December 1984 if at all
possible. Additional copies of this circular are enclosed for the information
and attention of your chief officers as listed below, and queries should be
addressed to Mr R G Perkins of this office on extension 206.

Yours faithfully

 SECTION 2: CONCL US ION S A N D R E C O M M E N D A T I O N S




2.1 We draw together in paragraph 2.8 below our recommendations on
further measures which the football and public authorities can take to
contain and deter football hooliganism. We summarise here some more
general conclusions about the nature of the problem and possible
remedies.

2.2 Soccer spectator violence is not an exclusively British problem. But
by its scale and the level of public concern, it is a specific and serious
problem for this country; other countries’ hooligans do not follow their
teams abroad to the same extent as do the British.

2.3 Considerable expertise in dealing with the problem now exists.
Successful and effective measures are available. The measures must,
however, be implemented locally and at specific times. Thus, whilst
violence, particularly in the stadium, appears to be reducing, difficulties
can arise when those responsible locally for the implementation of
counter-hooliganism measures lack specific expertise, experience or
advice, or the will to act effectively.

2.4 Close liaison and cooperation between the football and public
authorities is essential. The partnership between Government and the
Football Association is appropriate and necessary. Whilst the measures
applied have, in the Group’sview, been helpful in countering violence, we
believe that better implementation of the existing range of controls and
precautions, the refinement of existing Football Association rules and the
introduction of more specific measures could bring substantial short term
benefits in reducing violence and the extent of misbehaviour in and around
grounds. These remedies are unlikely, however, to have an impact on
violence away from the ground: thisisa matter of public order, though the
football authorities and clubs still have a role to play in cooperation with
the police.
2.5 Neither the football authorities nor the Government can be compla­
cent. Countering violence requires continuous and effective vigilance:
good planning and preparation, often encompassing - to the inexperienced
- apparently unnecessary precautions. Effective policing is of course
important.

2.6 We are also clear that the practical measures to counter violence
recommended in Sections 5 and 6 will not eliminate violence. W e consider
that to be an unrealistic aim.

2.7 There is an important presentational issue. Reporting of football
violence is often exaggerated and inaccurate. The media have a responsi­
bility to report, in a balanced way, both incidents at matches and the
measures taken by the Government and the football authorities. We are
concerned that there islittlegeneral appreciation of the progress made in
dealing with hooliganism especially in domestic competition, or of the real
constraints on action by the authorities. A public consultation process
would inform people generally and could lead to the general support
needed to make some measures more effective. In particular, an early
opportunity should be taken to consult the Football Association and other
interested bodies on these proposals.

2.8 In summary, the recommendations made in thisreport are as follows:


I    DOMESTIC RECOMMENDATIONS



A.   MEASURES PRIMARILY FOR THE FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES


Powers o f the Football Association

1. The FA should review and better define itspowers and procedures and
the responsibilities of the clubs. Ifthe powers prove to be inadequate, the
FA should consider taking enhanced powers. [5.5]


The “ blue-print”

2. The FA should ensure that clubs adopt the provisions of the

8
“blue-print” issued by the football authorities and the Government by
requiring each club to review its particular arrangements and produce a
detailed set of plans, in collaboration with the police and other relevant
agencies, to be submitted to the football authorities for endorsement. [5.7
+ 5.81


FA Liaison Officers

3. The FA should enhance and better define the Domestic Liaison
Officers’role. There may be a case for the Government helping to meet
part of the Liaison Officers’salaries. [5.10]

4. The FA should consider arranging national conferences or regional
seminars for representatives of league clubs and police forces to discuss
methods of crowd control in and around stadia. [5.11]


The League Programme

5. The FA should rate clubs according to the threat of violence posed by
their supporters, home and away, at stadia or on trains. [5.12]

6. Matches between high risk clubs should be programmed to take place
mid season and not during Bank Holidays. The current practice of playing
local derbies at Bank Holiday periods should be changed. High risk clubs
should not play away at major seaside towns on or during public holidays.
[5.14]


Club Membership

7. The FA, with the Football Trust and the Government, should examine
quickly and in detail a possible membership card scheme for controlling
ground access. [5.15-5.18]


Closed-circuit Television (CCTV)

8. Subject to the resultsofthe experiment being mounted by the Football
Trust, selected clubs should be urged or required by the FA to install the
necessary equipment for CCTV. [5.19]

                                                                         9
B. MEASURES PRIMARILY FOR THE L A W ENFORCEMENT
   AUTHORITIES


Action o f the Police

9. The police should do more to explain why, on occasion, it is not
possible to press charges against offenders. [5.24]


Action o f the Courts

10. The Courts should make more use of attendance centres, particularly
on Saturday afternoons. [5.26]


C. MEASURES PRIMARILY FOR CENTRAL G O VER MEN T


A New Offence?

11. There is no need for a new offence of ‘football hooliganism’ but
Ministers should seek to counter the widely held impression that the
Courts are passing light sentences. [5.28]


Liaison by Football Clubs with Magistrates

12. The Magistrates’ Association should be encouraged to accept
invitations to attend matches in their areas. Clubs should be encouraged to
issue invitations. [5.29]


Alcohol on Football Coaches

13. The Group hopes that the Traffic Commissioners will make the full
appropriate use of their powers in the light of police advice. [5.37]




10
II.   INTERNATIONAL R E C O M M E N D A T I O N S


A.    MEASURES PRIMARILY FOR THE FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES


Powers o f UEFA

14. UEFA should take further steps to ensure that its own rules are
observed and enforced. [6.5]


Club Membership

15. The FA and clubs should take an allocation of tickets for their
supporters to promote segregation and the exchange of information on
supporters’travel plans. [6.7]

16. Supporters should travel as members of organised groups rather than
individually to that adequate preparations can be made for them. [6.8]

17. The FA should discuss with UEFA the implementation of a possible
scheme to limit the sale of tickets and admission to grounds in Europe to
members of a national supporters' club. [6.9]


Overseas Liaison Officer

18. The FA’s Liaison Officer performs a most useful role. The Scottish
FA should be encouraged to make a similar appointment. [6.10]


B.    MEASURES PRIMARILY FOR THE L A W ENFORCEMENT
      AUTHORITIES


Liaison by British Transport Police

19. BTP should continue in the role they have developed asco-ordinators
of transport information in the UK, within their resource constraints.
[6.18]


                                                                      11
 C    MEASURES PRIMARILY FOR CENTRAL GOVERNMENT


 Council o f Europe Recommendation on Violence in Sport

20. The Government (with the FA) must continue to take the lead in the
implementation of the Recommendation. Letters from the Minister for
Sport to his European colleagues are useful in paving the way for close
cooperation between responsible authorities for all high risk matches.
[6.26]


Government Liaison

21. A group comprised of Government officials, representatives from the
FA, the police and clubs should be established to oversee preparations for
European fixtures. [6.28]


 Consular Confidentiality

22.  The principle of Consular confidentiality should be preserved. The
FA should make enquiries about convicted British subjects through
UEFA, national football associations or Government Departments here.
[6.29]

Dear Sir

FOOTBALL VIOLENCE

Representatives of the Association met the Minister for Sport, N MacFarlane MP
on 14 November 1984 to discuss a report produced by officials from various
Government departments on football violence. ("Football Spectator Violence":
HMS0 : ISBN 0 11 751749 6). A summary of the conclusions and recommendations
of the report is set out at annex. The Minister has asked for a formal
response to the report from the Association by the end of the year and the
Association is therefore seeking your Authority's comments on the report.
In addition, this Association circulated the report of an AMA joint working
group to you in February 1984, ("Football Violence - the Metropolitan view­
point") which set out a number of recommendations for co-operation between
local authorities and football clubs.

It would be most helpful, therefore, if, in considering the Government officials’
report, you could also identify the measures which your Authority has undertaken
or plans to introduce to reduce football violence in line with the AMA
recommendations. This information will be used to formulate a response to the
Minister and will be published as a supplement to the AMA working group report.
In view of the relatively short timescale suggested by Government, it is hoped
to re-convene the Association's Working Party before the new year, and to this
end it will be most helpful to receive your views by 10 December 1984 if at all
possible. Additional copies of this circular are enclosed for the information
and attention of your chief officers as listed below, and queries should be
addressed to Mr R G Perkins of this office on extension 206.

Yours faithfully




The   Chief Recreation/Leisure Officer
The   Chief Education Officer (The Principal Youth Officer)
The   Director of Social Services
The   Chief Planning Officer
                                                                                               1180/84
 SECTION 2: CO NCLUSIONS A N D R E C O M M E N D A T I O N S




2.1 We draw together in paragraph 2.8 below our recommendations on
further measures which the football and public authorities can take to
contain and deter football hooliganism. We summarise here some more
general conclusions about the nature of the problem and possible
remedies.

2.2 Soccer spectator violence is not an exclusively British problem. But
by its scale and the level of public concern, it is a specific and serious
problem for this country; other countries’ hooligans do not follow their
teams abroad to the same extent as do the British.

2.3 Considerable expertise in dealing with the problem now exists.
Successful and effective measures are available. The measures must,
however, be implemented locally and at specific times. Thus, whilst
violence, particularly in the stadium, appears to be reducing, difficulties
can arise when those responsible locally for the implementation of
counter-hooliganism measures lack specific expertise, experience or
advice, or the will to act effectively.

2.4 Close liaison and cooperation between the football and public
authorities is essential. The partnership between Government and the
Football Association is appropriate and necessary. Whilst the measures
applied have, in the Group’s view, been helpful in countering violence, we
believe that better implementation of the existing range of controls and
precautions, the refinement of existing Football Association rules and the
introduction of more specific measures could bring substantial short term
benefits in reducing violence and the extent of misbehaviour inand around
grounds. These remedies are unlikely, however, to have an impact on
violence away from the ground: this isa matter of public order, though the
football authorities and clubs still have a role to play in cooperation with
the police.
2.5 Neither the football authorities nor the Government can be compla­
cent. Countering violence requires continuous and effective vigilance:
good planning and preparation, often encompassing - to the inexperienced
- apparently unnecessary precautions. Effective policing is of course
important.

2.6 We are also clear that the practical measures to counter violence
recommended in Sections 5 and 6 will not eliminate violence. W e consider
that to be an unrealistic aim.

2.7 There is an important presentational issue. Reporting of football
violence is often exaggerated and inaccurate. The media have a responsi­
bility to report, in a balanced way, both incidents at matches and the I
measures taken by the Government and the football authorities. We are
concerned that there islittle general appreciation of the progress made in
dealing with hooliganism especially in domestic competition, or of the real
constraints on action by the authorities. A public consultation process
would inform people generally and could lead to the general support
needed to make some measures more effective. In particular, an early
opportunity should be taken to consult the Football Association and other
interested bodies on these proposals.

2.8 In summary, the recommendations made in thisreport are as follows:


I    DOMESTIC RECOMMENDATIONS



A.   MEASURES PRIMARILY FOR THE FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES


Powers o f the Football Association

1. The FA should review and better define itspowers and procedures and
the responsibilities of the clubs. Ifthe powers prove to be inadequate, the
FA should consider taking enhanced powers. [5.5]


The “ blue-print"

2. The FA should ensure that clubs adopt the provisions of the

8
 “blue-print” issued by the football authorities and the Government by
 requiring each club to review its particular arrangements and produce a
 detailed set of plans, in collaboration with the police and other relevant
 agencies, to be submitted to the football authorities for endorsement. [5.7
 + 5.8]


 FA Liaison Officers

3. The FA should enhance and better define the Domestic Liaison
Officers’role. There may be a case for the Government helping to meet
part of the Liaison Officers’salaries. [5.10]

4. The FA should consider arranging national conferences or regional
seminars for representatives of league clubs and police forces to discuss
methods of crowd control in and around stadia. [5.11]


The League Programme

5. The FA should rate clubs according to the threat of violence posed by
their supporters, home and away, at stadia or on trains. [5.12]

6. Matches between high risk clubs should be programmed to take place
mid season and not during Bank Holidays. The current practice of playing
local derbies at Bank Holiday periods should be changed. High risk clubs
should not play away at major seaside towns on or during public holidays.
[5.14]


Club Membership

7. The FA, with the Football Trust and the Government, should examine
quickly and in detail a possible membership card scheme for controlling
ground access. [5.15-5.18]


Closed-circuit Television (CCTV)

8. Subject to the resultsof the experiment being mounted by the Football
Trust, selected clubs should be urged or required by the FA to install the
necessary equipment for CCTV. [5.19]

                                                                          9
B. MEASURES PRIMARILY FOR THE L A W ENFORCEMENT
   AUTHORITIES


Action o f the Police

9. The police should do more to explain why, on occasion, it is not
possible to press charges against offenders. [5.24]


Action o f the Courts

10. The Courts should make more use of attendance centres, particularly
on Saturday afternoons. [5.26]


C. MEASURES PRIMARILY FOR CENTRAL G O VE RME NT


A New Offence?

11. There is no need for a new offence of ‘football hooliganism’ but
Ministers should seek to counter the widely held impression that the
Courts are passing light sentences. [5.28]


Liaison by Football Clubs with Magistrates

12. The Magistrates’ Association should be encouraged to accept
invitations to attend matches in theirareas. Clubs should be encouraged to
issue invitations. [5.29]


Alcohol on Football Coaches

13. The Group hopes that the Traffic Commissioners will make the full
appropriate use of their powers in the light of police advice. [5.37]

Dear Mr McGee

POLICE CHARGES

You wrote to me on 1© October about the subject of police charges. I do
not wish to prolong our correspondence about this - the sooner we get back
to normal the better - but I felt I had to pick up the two main points you
were making.

Before I do so X would, However, like to thank you for the excellent arrange­
ments which you made for the County Council's aeabers, staff and guests at
the sponsored fixture last Saturday. Everything went extremely smoothly
and was a tribute to the excellent organisation which you obviously have at
Hillsborough.

You mention the commercial practice of making payment on a thirty day basis.
We have not had this of course over the last two peasons with regard to
police charges and this is the reason why earlier payment is being requested
at the aoaant. I have hadto argue against "commercial sanctions'* being
applied such as a refusal to supply services or payment in advance.

You also mention the level of charges. This matter has been discussed by
the clubs with the County Council before and the opportunity was given for
the clubs to demonstrate that the charges were out of line with other areas.
This opportunity has not been taken up and we do not believe that they wifin.
However, there is a recoamendation going to the Police Coaaittee that the
recent pay award for police officers should not be passed on immediately
although it is now affecting the pay of officers attending football matches.
I think you will find that far froa being an additional local tax on the
public, what is really thecase is that the unfortunate behaviour of soae
so-called supporters has led to a situation where police involvement inside
the ground and away froa it has had to be substantially increased in recent
years. We reekkn that about 80% of the cost of policing football Batches is
incurred away from the ground and falls directly on the rate payers of the
County.

Dear Sir,

Thank you for your letter of the 8th October and for your cheque. I am
sorry that you feel that relationships between the County Council and the
Club have deteriorated. There is no ill-feeling hess, but I am under very
strict instructions frcm the Police Committee, as I indicated to you in
my letter of the 27th July, to make sure that the arrears which built up
during the last two seasons do not do so again, particularly in view of the
enormous problems which the policing of the mining dispute has caused for
the Police Ccmmittee's budget.

Your letter was written before the match with Leeds United last Saturday and
I hope you will agree that, with all the problems that the police have to
deal with at football matches, they should not be faced with uncertainty as
to when they will be paid for the services which they have provided.

                                    Yours faithfully,




                                    Chief Executive

Dear Sir

Thank you for your l e t t e r o f the 4th October. Copies of the two accounts
referred to in your l e t t e r for matches on the 2yth Auaust, 1984 and the 141.m
September, 19J4, which were despatched on the 11th SepUMbur, 1904 and the
18th September, 1984 e e s p e c tlv e iy , are enclosed. A copy of the account for
the match on the 18th August, 1984, which has not been paid, Is also enclose!.

The press reports which you have seen arose out of a Meeting of the Police
Committee's Finance Subcommittee which confirmed t h e p o s i t i o n which 1
Indicated to you in my l e t t e r o f the 27th July. The Police Committee are
i n s is t e n t that the situ ation which arose durlna t h e l a s t two football seat^n?.
should not arise aqain, particularly 1n view of the sU-«i»u which the pol u i>. i
of the mi nine dispute has placed upon the County's P o l i c e Fund. I an uncn-r
firm instructions to take leqal action should any a c c ou n t remain unpaid for
21 days. I would naturally not wish to do this i f i t is"at all avoidable and
1 hope that with your cooperation such action will oe unnecessary.

                                         Yours faithful ] y,

          Dear Sir,

          We are most concerned over reports t oday that it is your intention to
          issue a writ for unpaid police costs for the 1984/85.
          In this respect I would make the following observation.

          1.     You assume that the accounts sent are correct and received by the
                ..due recipient.

          2. That in normal business practice a statement of account issent                                                  to ensure
             that the account has been received in the first place.

          3. My board meet once a month and all accounts due for payment                                                are signed
          for payment so obviously there is a non compatable situation.
          The only account I can see that is due for payment is cleared by the enclosed
          cheque. I am still awaiting t he account for the York City fixture on the
          into the m a t ter for us
   $lf-   Yours faithfully,

    Dear Sir,
                                                  Charges for Policy Services

         We are greatly concerned about the attitude of the County Council
    towards this Company.
         Every possible effort has been made over the last fourteen months
    or so to reduce the arrears on our account. Nov that we are up to date
    the County Council continues to tarnish the favourable relationship
    which may have existed between our two organisations by making further
    threatening demands for payment of an account which under conventional
    terms of trading would not be paid until the end of October.

              Our cheque in the sum of £1,949.25 is enclosed.

                                                                     Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir

POLICE CHARGES 1984/85               ,

  lank you for your letter dated 4 October 1984.

The charges imposed for policing your ground are determined by the Police Committee
and not the Chief Constable.  They are part of an agreed formula negotiated between
ourselves and the five football league clubs.  In our opinion the charges are fair
ones.

The sliding scale used to determine the level of charges ensures that Clubs with
low gates pay less for the policing of their ground than those with higher gates.
These charges are irrespective of the number of officers actually used to police
any fixture which is always considerably higher than the numbers you pay for. This
additional cost falls upon the ratepayers of South Yorkshire.

At the match you quote, namely the home fixture with Bolton Wanderers, a total
of 40 police officers were employed.  You were charged for the services of 13
officers which is less than one-third of the cost of policing this game.

 The point-you make about charges being increased as a crowd increases from 4,999
 to 5,001 is valid but each 1,000 of the crowd is a sensible demarcation line and
^ h e extra three officers employed for an additional 1,000 represents a small
 percentage of the total cost of policing a game.

Any case you may wish to make for the charges to be altered should be made to the '
Police Committee.

Yours faithfully

              Dear Sir,

              POLICE CHARGES 1984/85

             We refer to the current sc a le charges for p olice operations at Belle Vue.
             We do f e e l that as our gates are rather on the low side we are in many
             respects being penalized, w hilst other Clubs in the area who are receiving
             larger gates are based on the same rate. It does appear that the less
             fortunate Clubs with gates around the 4000 mark are paying costs well above
             the average. For example our la s t home game versus Bolton Wanderers
             a gate of 4850 was recorded and our p olice costs were £692.80 t h i s represents
             12% of our nett receipts which does seem rather high in the current climate-
             We would be grateful therefore i f you would give consideration after your
             own investigatio n s of re-level.lin g the p o lice charges.

             One anomaly we have found is that the- difference between the gate of
             4999 and 5001 can mean the d ifference of a p olice b i l l of some £148, when
             in fa c t i f we actually receive a gate of 5002 we would only be receiving
             £6.00 gross and in fa ct paying £142 for the p r iv ile g e of having additional
             three people through the gates.

              I look forward to receiving your reply in due course.

             Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

Action over Policing of Football Grounds                    1.10.84


A report has been requested to be placed before the Finance Committee on
Tuesday morning concerning the current status of the actions to be taken
against the football clubs. Peter Appleyard is preparing a statement
as to the financial position and the legal matters are currently being
dealt with by Jim King in Legal Services. A case against Sheffield
United is currently at the discovery of document stage and following
the suasions for directions is expected to be set down in January. This
is an estimate only. The Committee may question why a report earlier
this year suggested that the case may come to trial before the sumner
recess. It may help to phone Jim King before the meeting.

Dear Mr Chester

Thank you for your letter of 19 September addressed to the
County Treasurer.  I share your wish to avoid the problems
of last year and any embarrassment in the future.  I am,
nowever, under fury firm instructions from toe Police
Committee to take positive action regarding the settlement
of accounts and the situation regarding our police 'budget
which 1 mentioned in my letter of 27 July is, if anything,
worse now than it was then.

The smtaefcittcn which you are putting forward for the payment
of accounts c o u l d , for example, mean thafi an account submitted
to you on 1 October might not be $*id until 8 December and I
do not think thot the Police Committee, in the present
circumstances, woula find that acceptable.

Yours sincerely

  Dear Sir,

  We acknowledge receipt of previous notifications sent by the South
  Yorkshire County Council relating to the payment of the accounts in
  respect of the provision of the police services at Hillsborough.

  It was thought to be only right and proper to enter into correspondence
  with yourself to avoid any possible embarrassment in the future.
  As you will recall certain difficulties arose last year over the payment
  of the relative police accounts and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
  where I believe, the first of the five South Yorkshire Clubs to clear
  their account in total. We at Hillsborough have a very sound relationship
  with all our creditors for the manner in which we settle our accounts
  in accordance with the normal commercial procedure and it is felt that
  if we were to adopt the same procedure with the settlement of the accounts
  from the South Yorkshire County Council in exactly the same manner then
  it could only be in the interests of both parties.

  The procedure which we normally adopt is that for instance any accounts
  received for the month of August, cheques would be drawn by the end of
  September and posted so as to arrive not later than the first week in
  October.

  I am sure neither your organisation nor ourselves which to be involved in
  the same difficulties as last season and I would be obliged if you could
  forward to me your observations to me on the above suggestion.

   is continued.

Mr Vaugha n, the Secretary of the working group examining and administering the
provisions of the Act, gave a brief history of what had been achieved in South
Yorkshire.

He drew attention to the condition contained within the general safety
corl if'icate that 21 days notice must be given to the County Council of any
piM>|Hir;< (i alterations to the grounds. He was aware that this was not happening
and ,i::ked C.fub Secretaries to be mindful' of the fact that to fail to comply
with a condition of the certificate was an offence under the Act.

Ch id' Superintendent Carlin asked if there was still in existence a voluntary
code o f safety adopted by Clubs not falling within the bounds of the Act, as
lie wa.- iiioiil disturbed at tin: condition of Doncaster liovera ground.              He wan
w o r r i e d that should disturbances occur in the ground there was a surfeit of
I . ne.      p icof'.n of concrete and other p o t e n t i u l mieu.lleu which could be used by
unruly         elements.

Mr H o M o w a y agreed with Chief Superintendent Carlin that parts'of Belle Vue
wc«*< :ii need of immediate and extensive renovation and said that he was to have
.i iiu > i i nr with !lie Chairman of the Football Grounds Improvements Trust in order
to .a. ' i't ain if there were monies available to Doncaster Rovers to improve their
cli id' Superintendent Carlin questioned the    determination of the Directors at
the Club, as improvements had been spoken      of for a number of years and nothing
had been clone.   He reiterated his concern    for the safety of police officers
on duty in the stadium, and enquired of Mr      Vaughan whether the County Council
could assist.                          ■                                              *

Mr Vaughan stated that as Doncaster Rovers did not qualify under the Act, the
only way the* County Council could help would be at the invitation of the Club,
and any changes recommended would have to be undertaken at the Club's expense,
bul lu* dirt offer to violt;'Belle Vue, together with the other members of the
workiiiK group nhould the Club so wish. Mr Holloway thanked Mr Vaughan for the
ofIVr , which he felt would b@ accepted.

Item discharged.

I'jd'l/l’iHb .SKASON

The Chairman gave members a brief account of what he predicted for the
forthcoming season as regards policing problems, stressing the possibility of
recent, lawlessness witnessed on picket lines being repeated at football grounds
especially when teams from working mining areas such as Nottingham visited South
Yorkshire.

Mi- Clement also warned members of the possibility of policing football matches
witii i    officers than operationally desirable due to continuing heavy demands
u p o n manpower.

Chief Superintendent Broomhead recounted an incident at a match at Bramall Lane
towards.; the end of last season when stones were thrown by the hooligan element
in the crowd.

Chief' Superintendent Moseley wanted placing on record his appreciation of the
efforts made by the Sheffield Wednesday Manager, Howard Wilkinson, in trying
to prevent pitch invasions at the end of last season.  He also informed members
of the difficulties being faced by British Rail in respect of lack of rolling
stock which would affect special trains to Wadsley Bridge Sta£i-on, thereby
inereaaing the number of supporters going through the city centre from the
Midland Station to Hillsborough.

Chief Superintendent Carlin asked Club Secretaries to make their supporters
clube aware of the difficulties faced by the police after games had finished.
He referred particularly to travelling supporters stopping off in towns, usually
for alcoholic refreshment, which sometimes resulted in confrontations with other
nuppm'ters atici then the police.
                                                          *
Chid1   Superintendent Meadows agreed with Chief Superintendent Carlin, and
informed the meeting that with the assistance of the British Transport Police
anri British Kail it was hoped that trains carrying supporters would be
t.ime■ tabled eo av, not to arrive at stations such as Doncaster at the same time.

The      irman summed up by saying that although there had been signs during last
oe.-ru.n thrft the hooligan problem associated with football was declining he feared
that the trend may not continue in the forthcoming season.

 S l'.c;IiKU AT JON OF SPECTATORS

 Chief Superintendent Moseley introduced this item, outlining a problem occurring
 in the l.eppiags Lane stand at Hillsborough. Traditionally, the tei’i’acing at
 the heppings Lane end had been allocated to 'away' supporters, but from            *
 time-io-time 'away' supporters had also been allowed in the atand. He wan moot
 concerned at the continuing sale of season tickets in the stand to Sheffield
 Wiuini-niiny supporters incrfeafling the likelihood of confrontation. He asked for
 guidance as to interpretation of the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975, on this
 point..                      1

 Mr V aughan replied that the conditions for segregation of supporters contained
 In the Safety at Sports Grounds Act had been Interpreted as applying to standing
 area;: and he was of the opinion that it did not apply to seated parts of grounds.

Mr Cheater  stated that Sheffield Wednesday were aware of the problem of home
            in the West Stand and had tried to reduce the numbers of season ticket
 suppo rte rs
holder:- from over 200 last season to under 40 this forthcoming season.  He
pointed out the problems associated with this*-policy, as some of the season
ticket, holders had been using that stand since it was built for the 1966 World
C up .

The Chairman pointed out that as season tickets had already been sold to
S h e f f i e l d Wednesday supporters for the West Stand, the potential for
c o n f r o n t a t i o n would have to be borne in mind when arrangements for policing
m a t c h e s were made.                                                     _

Item discharged.

DU'i'i HS OP STEWARDS

Chief Superintendent Moseley also introduced this item, saying it had come to
hln imt.ic.c that stewards were not fulfilling their duties and on occasions had
removed their jackets and mingled with the crowd in order to avoid trouble.
He war, concerned with the abrogation of their responsibilities and asked Club
Secretaries to make it clear to stewards what their duties entailed.

The Chairman stated that it was better for the Clubs if minor disputes which
need not involve the police were resolved by the stewards rather than resorting
to police intervention.

a.     t'i naiicial Arrangements for 1984/85 Season

The A;;;: ibtant Chief Constable (Management Services), Mr Watson, stated that
it was the intention of the South Yorkshire Force to police the five football
leagu.- grounds in an identical manner to previous seasons.      Divisional Commanders
would us;Bes s their manpower requirements for each game and deploy sufficient
p o l i c e officers to ensure that there were no public order disturbances.  The
Cl hi .,: would be charged as per the agreed formula based on the official attendance
at the match, irrespective of how many officers were actually used.       He further
stated that with effect from 1 September 1984, it was expected that there would
be an approximate increase in charges of 4.8# to reflect a similar increase
In police pay.


Tin-re \a.-i no (llooeiifjIon from tliIs proposed course of action and Mr Watson further

Mr Cheater stated that Clubfi would have appreciated advance notice of the
increased charges before setting their admission fees.    Mr Watson replied that
the r evie w of police pay was based on a wages index (May to May figures) and          ^
these were not released until late July each year.  To estimate the proposed       ",   j

CHARGES FOR POLICf AT FOOTBALL MATCHES

Thank you fo r your l e t t e r dated 27 July.

As you are no doubt aware, the Club's S o l i c i t o r , Mr A»rneldD Greene, is
himself dealing with a l l aspects of the dispute between { I) the Sputh
Yorkshire County pouncil and (2) the Club^ c ^ t e r ^ i % ! et^rfes for Sf|olicf
attendances at footb all matches at Bramall Lane. Unfortunately, Mr Greene
i s at present on holiday, but I have sent a copy of your l e t t e r to him and
I have asked him to make a f u l l reply thereto* i f he considers i t necessary,
on his return at pie end of August 1984.

However, without prejudice to any comment Mr Greene may wish to make, I
note that your l e t t e r does not mention any threat of an application for an

Dear Mr. Harris,

                                      Charges for Police at Football Matches

     Thank you for your letter in which you advise us of the
business to be transacted at the Police Committee meeting to be
held on Monday 30th July 1984.

     The comments contained in the letter are noted and will be
discussed by my Board of Directors at their next meeting.




                                                                        Yours faiL^fully,

  Dear Mr Spink/Mr Darnhill/Mr Chester/Mr Smith/Secretary

  cmsms FOR POLICE at   football matches

 I aio writing to you because I Know there has been concern expressed in the
 past when this issue has arisen at meetings of the Police Committee without
 advance notice having been given to the Clubs. This is sometime® unavoidable
 because matters are raised in debate when the press and public are present.
 However I thought I should let you know that following a meeting of the Police
 Finance Sub-Committee the subject will be given an airing at the Police
 Committee*s meeting on Monday morning, 30 July,

 The Committee will be recommended to maintain charges at their present level
 until such tia* as the Police Pay Award i« settled. Skis is currently
 rumoured to be around 4.8% and would come into force very early into the start
 of the season, leading to an appropriate adjustment in the charges.

 Members of the Police Committee are very concerned about the late payments by
 Clubs during the past two seasons, particularly the two Clubs who still owe
 payment® for the season before last and which have made, at present, no offer
 to pay. Members feel that it is quite unreasonable for the ratepayers of
 South Yorkshire to bear these debts particularly at a time of cut-backs in
 public expenditure and extreme pressure on the Police budget due to the miners
 dispute.

 The Police Finance Sub-Committee are therefore recommending that for the coating
 season the Clubs will be required to meet each bill within 21 days, falling
 which legal proceedings will be instituted without further wsaning.

I am sorry that matters have come to this stage but I thought I should
let you know that the issue will arise on Monday morning so that you are
not taken by surprise. I believe the Chief Constable is arranging a meeting
with you to discuss the policing at football matches in the new season and
we look forward to having the opportunity to discuss the situation with you.

Yours sincerely

      Dear Sirs,

                                             RE: Outstanding Accounts Charges
                                                 for Police Services 1983/84 Season
                                                 (Don cast er Rovers)______________

            We act for Doncaster Rovers Football Club Limited and are giving our
     attention to the Writ issued against the Club by the County Council for the
     sum of £20,581.77* The Acknowledgement of Service, on which an intention to
     defend the proceedings is stated, has been sent back to the Sheffield District
     Registry.

            Eitirely without prejudice to our clients* right to Defend and
     Counterclaim at this stage, they are prepared to settle this matter on the
     terms proposed below:—

     1.      They are prepared to pay £19»58l.77» (£1000. having been recently
     paid) together with £105.00 costs on the Writ by 5 monthly instalments of
     £3,937»35»» payable on the 1st day of each month, the first payment to be
     made on the 1st August 1984*

     2   .        They would expat no claim for statutory interest to be made against
     them.

     3»     They accept that the County Council, during the currency of any such
     agreement, would expect charges for Police services made during the 1984/85
     season to be paid regularly as and when invoices (issued, we understand,
     approximately once a month) are delivered. It must, however, be appreciated
     that our clients cannot agree and bind themselves to pay such charges when they

                                                                                                            continued

have no means of knowing the rate at which those charges will be made.
As you know, our clients have always considered the Policing charges
to be excessive and unreasonable, when compared with those levied against
Clubs in other parts of the country and, in the absence of knowledge of the
rate of charge for the 19 8 4 -8 5 season, they will not forfeit their right to
object to the amounts of any such charges if they consider them unreasonable
in due course.

            They would,however, be prepared to have it as the term of an agreement
relating to the present claim if it w e agreed and understood that the rate of
charge for the 1984-85 season would be no higher than the rate of charge for the
1 9 8 3 -8 4 season.

4»     That during the currency of any such agreement, and so long as the terms
thereof were being observed by both parties, no further action on the Writ
would be taken by either party.

5»     But if circumstances arose whereby either party decided to take further
action on the Writ then that party waid give to the other 7 days notice of
their intention to do so.

       We should be obliged if you would take instructions on the above proposals
and trust that no further action on the Writ will be taken whilst you are doing
so.   If the proposals are not acceptable, and further action is decided upon,
we consider it reasonable that you should give us 7 days notice of your intention
in that respectc

         We await hearing further from you in due course.

                                       Yours famhfully,

Dear Councillor Moores

CHARGES FOR POLICE AT FOOTBALL MATCHES

I attach copies of letters forwarded oa behalf of Sheffield Wednesday,
Doncaster Rovers and Barnsley football clubs.    I would like to discuss
with you the response which we should make. It aoejas to ae that the
offer from Sheffield Wednesday should be accepted although we would
wish to d a i s from them the fee paid for the writ which was £150.  I
would however like to start the next football season with a clean slate
and the offer from Barnsley would mean that this year's charges were
not paid in full until the end of Septeaber and in the case of Doncaster
it would be the first of December.

There has been no response fros Rotherham United and if they have not
entered an appearance in court, judgement will be obtained against then.

The position with Sheffield United is as before - we are waiting for a
date for the court hearing.

The*e is also the question of charges to be made for the next football
season and the manner is which they are to be collected. You will
reaesber that the Police Committee are asking for some payment in advance.

Could we have a chat about all these matters please.  I would need
probably to bring the Treasurer's Department and the Police in on the
discussion.

Yours sincerely




Deputy County 61ark

      Dear Sirs,                                           I—

                                             RE: Outstanding Accounts Charges
                                                 for Police Services 1 9 8 3 /8 4 Season
                                                 (Doncaster Rovers)

            We act for Doncaster Rovers Football Club Limited and are giving our
     attention to the Writ issued against the Club by the County Council for the
     sum of £20,58l.77« The Acknowledgement of Service, on which an intention to
     defend the proceedings is stated, has been sent back to the Sheffield District
     Registry.

            Entirely without prejudice to our clients' right to Defend and
     Counterclaim at this stage, thqy are prepared to settle this matter on the
     terms proposed below:-

     1.      They are prepared to pay £19,58l.77» (£1000. having been recently
     paid) together with £105.00 costs on the Writ by 5 monthly instalments of
     £3* 937•35•« payable on the 1st day of each month, the first payment to be
     made on the 1st August 1984.

     2.           They would expect no claim for statutory interest to be made against
     them.

     3»     They accept that the County Council, during the currency of any such
     agreement, would expect charges for Police services made during the 1984/85
     season to be paid regularly as and when invoices (issued, we understand,
     approximately once a month) are delivered. It must, however, be appreciated
     that our clients cannot agree and bind themselves to pay such charges when they

                                                                                                           continued

have no means of knowing the rate at which those charges will be made.
As you know, our clients have always considered the Policing charges
to be excessive and unreasonable, when compared with those levied against
Clubs in other parts of the country and, in the absence of knowledge of the
rate of charge for the 1984-85 season, they will not forfeit their right to
object to the amounts of any such charges if they consider them unreasonable
in due course.

       They would,however, be prepared to have it as the term of an agreement
relating to the present claim if it wre agreed and understood that the rate of
charge for the 1984-85 season would be no higher than the rate of charge for the
1983-84 season.

4.     That during the currency of any such agreement, and so long as the terms
thereof were being observed by both parties, no further action on the Writ
would be taken by either party.
                                                    ■4’
5.     But if circumstances arose whereby either party decided to take further
action on the Writ then that party wariLd give to the other 7 days notice of
their intention to do so.

       We should be obliged if you would take instructions on the above proposals
and trust that no further action on the Writ will be taken whilst you are doing
so.   If the proposals are not acceptable, and further action is decided upon,
we consider it reasonable that you should give us 7 days notice of your intention
in that respect.

         We await hearing further from you in due course.

                                       Yours faAthfullyf

Charges for Police at Foofcball Matches                     26/00/84




Mr. Chester, the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, rang me
yesterday. He says they ar® mot likely to contest the writ - creditors
have to be paid he says - and that the amount outstanding is correctly
stated. He needs to talk to his Chairman about cash flow and will do so
today.  It is possible they will offer to pay in two halves, one    the
end of June and the other before the start of next season. He is anxious'
that we should not take any action on the writ which might affect the
good r-a:ne of the; Club.

Mr. Chester has rung today to say that he has got agreement to sending us
a cheque immediately for £13,168.65 and a further cheque for the balance
in the first week in August.  It is possible he may send the second cheque
now and post-date it. I told hia in these circunstances I did not see any
reason why we should obtain judgement on the writ so long as the agreement
were kept.

OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS FOR POLICE SERVICES
BARNSLEY FOOTBALL CLUB                                     20.6.84




I do not think we can aspept the offer from Barnsley Football Club
since it does not meet the objective of clearing outstanding debts
before the start of the next football season. However, it goes a
long way towards doing so and perhaps we should wait to see what we
aofcaal-lly get from the other clubs.

            Dear Cllr Moores

            Just ft note to let you know that the briefing which you
            requested on the Prosecution Service for the Police
            Conference will be ready at the beginning of next week.
            There are just one or two additional pieces of information
            which I am seeking.

            You were also asking about charges for police at football
            matches and I am attaching a schedule which indicates the
            amounts outstanding.

            We are hoping that the High Court Action against Sheffield
            United will be heard before the Court goes into its
            Summer Recess. High Court Writs against all the other
            Clubs are abott to be issued.

            I have heard from Tyne & Wear that they have issued a writ
            against Sunderland FC. Officers from the two Authorities
            are getting their heads together to compare notes.
            Yours sincerely

Dear CouncillorsMoores,

Charges for Policing at Football M at ches.

Following our recent conversation, I confirm that the subject of football
charges has been kept under review by the Officers.

As you will be aware, the current football season is due to expire on
12th May and it was thought worthwhile to await until after this date to
report so as to enable the Police Committee to have a full picture of
the position.

It is intended that the report to the Police Committee will, as well as showing
the position as regards actual amounts outstanding from the football clubs,
also show details of the total numbers of police officers on duty and the
numbers for which the clubs were charged (including costs) in order to
illustrate the point that the clubs are not even paying the full costs of
officers within their grounds.



                                     Yours sincerely,




                                     Chief Executive.

Mr Moores mentioned football club charges to me yesterday -
wondering if the officers had forgotten all about itl I
told him that I had seen correspondence between us and the
Treasurers and knew that things were being kept on the boil
however I think we ought perhaps to report to the next
Police Committee on the current situation and possibly
they ought to have a regular report just to update them -
do you agree?

Perhaps you could have a word with the Treasurers and a
letter should perhaps go to the Chairman briefing him on
the position.

X think we should get together to discuss what farther Action aay be seeded
to recover charges doe frost the Clubs other than Sheffield United. X did
aestios to the Jolice Coasittee that action would be takes against the
other Clubs in the event of thUir not responding to requests for pajnaeat,
and there appears to he no doubt is Members minds that a firm line needs
to be taken.

Could you let   me   know when you would be free for half as hour.

Dear H±rCaldwell

CHARGES FOR SPECIAL POLICE SERVICES

Thank you for your letter of 20 February. The problem appears
to fee quite widespread and 1 have had similar letters from
Cleveland and West Glamorgan.

The issue is being raised by Sheffield United in connection with
the County Council's High Court action. No date has yet been
fixed for a hearing, but I will certainly keep you informed of
any relevant developments.

Yours faithfully

This matter is being dealt with by   Mr . Cardwell         Ext   302




           Dear Sir,

           RE;      CHARGES FOR SPECIAL POLICE SERVICES

           I understand that your County Council, in its role as Police Authority,
           is having some difficulty with Sheffield United Football Club in
           connection with the payment of charges for the attendance of police
           officers at football matches held at their ground.

           This Authority has encountered difficulties with both Sunderland A.F.C.
           Ltd., and Newcastle United Football Co. Ltd. with regard to their paying
           accounts raised for the attendance of police officers at football matches
           held at their respective grounds.   Last season it was necessary for
           me to issue proceedings in the High Court against Sunderland A.F.C. Ltd.
           and, this season, county court proceedings have been issued against
           Newcastle United Football Co. Ltd.  Both o f these actions have been
           successful and the full amounts due plus costs were paid very soon after
           service of the process.

           I understand that the question of the application of Section 15 of the
           Police'Act 1964 will be raised in your court action against Sheffield
           United Football Club.  Needless to say this Authority is extremely
           interested in any decision reached by a court with regard to the
           application of Section 15 of the Police Act 1964 in relation to the
           attendance of police officers at football matches.  I should therefore
           be very much obliged if you would kindly keep me informed of any relevant
           developments and, in due course, let me know the outcome of your court
           action.

           Yours faithfully,

 Dear John,

         Thank you for your letter of the 16th January about the costs of
 policing Football Clubs.

         We have two League Football Clubs within Cleveland and they are
 both in financial difficulties, and some of the debts which are outstanding
 go back, in the case of one Club, some two or three Seasons.

         What has tended to happen in the past is that when the Club
 received handouts from, e.g. the F.A., they would settle part of the debt,
 which satisfied the County Council up to a point.  That practice now seems
 to have stopped because other creditors, e.g. Inland Revenue, are more
 forceful than we are.

         At the moment we have reported to Committee, who have set up a
 Sub-Committee to look into the matter, because I suspect that there is a
 tremendous dilemma between recovering the debt and possibly putting the
 Clubs out of existence.

         I gather that one of the Clubs will take up with the Police what
 they regard as the totally excessive charges being levied, not so much in
 terms of the actual cost per hour, but the number of hours charged for.
 If there are any significant developments, I will keep you posted.

                                                        Yours sincerely,




                                                        County Secretary

This is an article I did for the Centre for Contemporary Studies.
It is based on some remarks I made at a seminar in London earlier
in the year.  When the AMA Working Party produces:its report, I
think the remarks here will be seen to be in line with its general
conclusions.  I do not pretend that this is in any way a definitive
answer to the problem.

Local Authorities Involvement with Problems of Violence Associated
with Professional Soccer.

J C Cornwell, Chairman, AMA, Arts and Recreation Committee

Many people directly involved with Professional Association Football
have often declaimed in some desperation, that the violence on the
terraces and around the grounds on match days a/iSk not just soccer's
problem but those of society as a w h o l e . The conditions that
produce the phenomenon of the unacceptable b e h a v i o u r , termed
"soccer hooliganism" in press parlance, are created in our society
and professional soccer matches have become the focus of this
aberrative c o n d u c t .

The AMA Councillors and their advisers# who are on a special              working
party to look at this problem/are largely in agreement with               that
assessment.  If a permanent solution is to be found it will               be
created outside the football stadiums and the crowd control               methods
as presently practiced can only be a short term palliative.

That young adolsecents should boil over into violent behaviour
at football matches can surely come as no surprise to anyone who
knows the passions and attitudes of the young urban males and the
peculiar ferocious loyalties that soccer clubs create.         Even elderly
mature supporters can get irrational about their team's performance
and d e c i s i o n and incidents on the field of play.  Nor is there
anything unusual about the violence developing amongst young men
and teenagers, its own cults, myths, elites and organisation.         In
a large American city it may be a street gang which becomes a focus
for pride and action, and claims loyalty and gives status to its
members.       In Britain it is the "Gasworks St. Enders" who provide
identity, respect and excitement for young people, especially
working class males who get little enough sense of importance in
normal life.         A cynical view might well be that society is spared
further problems because 'Isoccer hooliganism" is predictable in time
and venue and virtually containable, but if such violence was
happening at random in areas of our cities up and down the country
society would have a much more serious and destabilising problem
to deal with.

Obviously neither professional football or society can accept the
inevitability of violence at football matches, although the AMA
working party would agree with many in football that it is a much
more infrequent phenomena than dramatic media coverage would convey.
That in terms of civil order within the UK we are talking about
a small number of serious incidents involving usually a small
proportion of any given group of spectators.  Put in a proper
perspective the majority of football matches are unaffected and
major outbreaks of violence are very much the exception.

Local Authorities^ and the AMA members*, especially & s most of the
larger football league gounds are in London and the Metropolitan
areas, are affected in many ways.                  Obviously the cost and policies
of the Police both inside and outside the ground are directly
relevant.          Police operational practices many feel have now come
to terms'with violence inside the grounds but it is outside the
ground that the problems now start jand the local authority is the
o b v i o u s i n s t i t u t i o n to plan a solution on behalf of the community.
Basically anything that involves the planning of the area near
the ground, the transportation of fans, the probation services,
the educative,, or alternative leisure activity rely very heavily
on the local government services.

New planning policies and housing developments should take
account of the existence of football grounds^which in most cases
are historically in' the most crowded working class areas with
few of the facilities which would be obligatory if the grounds
were being designed from scratch.   Urban redevelopment in some
cases has given a new opportunity to get it right this time.
Where railway lines run close by the stadium/ local authorities
should be prepared to join with others in designing and funding
low cost basic platforms thereby avoiding crocodiles of hostile
supporters winding their way through the town or using public
transport.  Similarly where taste in transport is moving to vans,
proper car and coach parking facilities as joint ventures with the
club should be planned for and developed.

However it is in the longer term solution that local authorities
have a major role to play.  If soccer violence is a product of
social problems and attitudes, then local authorities remit
for a social policy to civilise the effects of the industrial
revolution that still plague our cities,is as relevant for "soccer
hooliganism" as it is for the wider social problems.

More specifically the local authorities are well placed to co-operate
with the football clubs in specific leisure schemes aimed to involve
the juveniles and young adults who are likely to be the problem
group.   There obviously has already been some use of football and the
community schemes to find a solution to the problems of the terraces ,
and.there may now be an attitude that such schemes have been found J
wanting.   The AMA working party believe this is one of the major
areas we must pursue, learn from past experience and attempt to
come to terms with the young people involved.   The alternative
seems a dead end of attrition, with chairmen of clubs screaming
at the "animals on the terraces", and managers calling, as in one
case, for public bxrchings at the centre spot before the kick off.

If recreation schemes involving the clubs and local authorities
are to be successful they must be ptoperly targetted/so that a
facility is not set up that becomes only another subsidised
sporting activity for the middle-class.    Councils can help
wi^h positive management and monitoring systems through their
recreation departments and helpp to identify and keep in touch with
relevant groups through youth and social workers and probation
department staff.   It must be possible to properly harness the club's
footballing "heroes" to make and keep contact with even the most
hardened "hooligan". They identify very strongly with their clubs
so it must be possible to turn this to advantage through community
schemes involving players at the clubs premises, and in wider links
wi£h the community.   Many clubs have tried this, some with real
commitment, some with mixed success.    It is not a route which will
bring instant success and it is very much reliant on the personality
and imagination of the players, officials and council workers
involved.  It should be allied to a policy of the council of
raising the quality and quantity of leisure provision in the less
well off urban areas in g e n e r a l .
                            -   3


Certainly fans who commit acts of violence must be restrained
and criminal acts must be punished.  It would be nonsense at
the present time to suggest that crowds should be desegregated
or that the police presence should be severly reduced, but it
is easy to see that caging in of young spectators brutalises
them.  That the Police although necessary, become part of the
"game" of violence on the terraces, that a club that appears to
be reaching up market in its facilities for wealthier patrons,
with executive boxes and suites/will further alienate less well
off, now often unemployed, youths who often regard themselves
as the true supporters.

For twenty years the cancer of violence at matches has stalked
professional football.  To some extent behaviour and events on
the field and in the boardroom have contributed to the problem,
so undoubtably has press and media sensationalism.  However if
this is basically a social problem that manifests itself in an
association football forum, rugby league for instance is virtually
free of such problems, then it is up to the agencies of society
to find an answer.  The AMA working party believe that a large
part of the answer can be found in a more specific extension of
leisure provision carefully worked out, managed and monitored ,
and linked to other agencies many of them local council
institutions which can bring about social improvement in the
community.

1 ._______Note of Previous Meeting

The note of the previous meeting held on the 28th January, 1983, was
considered and agreed.

2 ._____ : Charges for Police Services

The meeting had been convened primarily at the request of the five
football league clubs in South Yorkshire to discuss the question of the
implementation date of the revised charges for police services at
football matches and the relevant letter requesting the meeting,from
the Chairman of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to the Chief Executive
was submitted.
In addition the Chief Executive submitted a report recalling the
background to the current and proposed charges for police services
together with details of the outstanding accounts submitted to the
Clubs for policing charges during the recently completed 1982/83 football
season, now amounting to some £243,682.69.   At the request of the Chairman
of the Police Committee the question of Court proceedings for recovery had
been deferred pending the outcome of the discussions on the revised charges
and implementation date.

Following consideration by the Policy Budget Sub-Committee and Policy
Advisory Sub-Committee 'A', the County Council on 23rd March, 1983, had
accepted the revised reduced scale of charges recommended by the Working
Party and the Police Committee but decided that the date of implementation
should be 1st April, 1983, rather than the 1st January, 1983, as recommended.

The clubs welcomed the agreed revised scale of charges but expressed
disappointment that the date of implementation had been delayed,
particularly in view of the current financial difficulties being experienced
by many clubs.

The Clubs pointed out that even when the revised scale of charges came
into operation the charges would still be amongst the highest in the
country, and some comparative examples of charges within and outside the
county were quoted.

The Working Group noted the comments of the clubs but pointed out that the
date of implementation of the revised scale of charges had now been
finalised as 1st April, 1983, and could not now be altered.   However,
should the Clubs highlight anomalies in police charges still existing
despite the new scale of charges the Working Group would reconsider
further possible reductions in the future.

RECOMMENDED -

1.       That imolementation of the revised scale of charges for     the services
of   Police at football matches from 1st April, 1983 be noted.


2.      That the five Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire be
requested to finalise all accounts, as now outlined, submitted for
policing charges during the recently completed 1982/83 football league
season.

3.      That, should the football clubs highlight anomalies in police
charges still existing despite the implementation of the new scale of
charges, the charges for police services at football matches be
reconsidered.

3.      Opening of Football Club Facilities to the Community

The Chief Executive submitted a report on the possible opening of
football clubs facilities to the community, particularly the young
unemployed.

At the request of the Chairman of the Working Group the Secretaries of
the five ^outh Yorkshire Football League clubs had been requested to
supply information regarding the type and extent of facilities
available, the current use made of the facilities by the community
together with details of any proposed additional use.  The replies from
Sheffield Wednesday, Doncaster Rovers and Rotherham United Football
Clubs were submitted and with the Chairman's permission copies of the
reply from Sheffield United Football Club were circulated.

The Working Group welcomed the initiatives already taken by the clubs
together with the clubs offers of future assistance in this field.

The possibility of using grants from the Urban Action Working Party for
specific schemes was considered particularly for schemes involving the
young unemployed.  There was a need for such schemes to be developed
jointly between the clubs and the County Council, possibly on the basis
of two per club.

The possible use of a purpose built training facility located at
Orgreave in Rotherham was also considered.

RECOMMENDED — That the Chief Executive be requested to contact individual
football league clubs to discuss possible suitable schemes involving the
use of Football Club facilities for the community, particularly the
youijg unemployed, prior to submitting a report on the subject to the
Urban Action Working Party.

Dear Mr. McGee,

Charges for Poliod Services

I have today received your letter on behalf of 111 five Football
League Clubs in South Yorkshire dated 21st April.

After speaking to the Chairman of the Working Group on the Effects
of Professional Foothill on the Community, Councillor G. H. Moores,
I am asked to say that the meeting with the Working Group which you
request will be held as soon as mutually convenient arrangements
can be agreed.

I am looking actively at possible dates in conjunction with the
Members of the Working G bbup, but it may be of assistance if you
could let me know in the meantime if there are any particular dates
or periods which the Football Clubs would wish to avoid.

                                    Yours sincerely.


I




                                     Chief Executive.

CRIME REDUCTION SEMINAR                           7 4 83




Just a thought which arises from a comment in the AMA Police
and Dire Committee this week - would there be any benefit in
inviting a representative of the British Insurance Association
to our seminar? Further, Sir Philip Knights threw out the
idea that each Met County Police Force ought to think in terms
of forming some kind of Standing Committee which could meet
from time to time with their District Councils and people
such as the British Insurance Association representatives to
talk about the whole question of crime reduction possibilities.
This idea strikes me as being a useful one and I wonder if we
should ask Mr Gosling whether the Chief Constable felt that
this was an idea worth following up - if so it could be
mentioned by the Chairman at the seminar and it occurs to me
that we could mop up some of the individual working parties
which we appear to have spawned recently eg the Football
Holliganism Working Party. I think what Sir Philip Knights
naa m mind was a meeting say twice a year in order to talk
through matters relating to the possille reduction in crime.

Perhaps you could float the idea and let me know what the

Dear Councillor Cornwell,

So_ccer_ HooJLigani stn

As   requested I enclose a copy of a book entitled 'Football Hooliganism’

ihe authors attribute, the idea for the hook to a seminar on the subject held
in January, 1977 , which M r . __________ , a Probation Officer based in Doncaster.
attended.

Extracts fcrom the. book were considered by the Social PAT on 4 th January, 1983 .
At the meeting referenceswas made to the involvement of Hr. Seddon in the
publication and he was invited to attend a future meeting of the P.A.T. to
discuss the. problem of soccer hooliganism.   Subsequently, he attended the
Social P.A.T. meeting on 1 st March, 1983 , and a copy of the minutes of thafi
meeting are attached for your information.

As I am enclosing our only copy of the book perhaps you would return it to
Mr. M. feasdale, of ray office, when you have had an opportunity to consider it.




                                            Yours sincerely.




                                            Chief Executive.

John Cornwall, Esq.,

S h e ff ie ld ,




On behalf of my Advisory Council may I in v i t e you to a seminar on Patterns
of Social Violence: Football as a Focus for Disorder which the Centre for
Contemporary Studies, with the support of the Football Trust, is
organising. As you will see from the brochure which I enclose, the
seminar takes place on Tuesday, 10th May at the Royal Society of Arts in
London.

We will be seeking at the seminar to broaden the discussion on soccer
violence and to stimulate some new thinking on the subject. However,
central to the debate will be the game i t s e l f and the p o s i t iv e , e f f e c t i v e
steps which might be taken to protect i t .

I very much hope that you will be able to join us. Places at the seminar
are by in vitation only and you will be the guest of the Centre. However,
places are s t r i c t l y limited and I would be g ra tefu l, therefore, i f you
would l e t me have your reply as soon asp o ss ib le .

i    look forward to hearing from you.

 Yours s in c e r e ly ,




    Lord Avebury

             Dear Mr. Mallett,

             CHARGES FOR POLICE SERVICES

             The football clubs in South Yorkshire had a meeting this
             morning to discuss your letter dated March 23rd.

             I was asked to write to you to request a further meeting
             with the Liaison Subcommittee. I do hope that this can
             be arranged.

             Our purpose as always is one of trying with your council
             to come to an arrangement that would ensure our clubs in
             South Yorkshire a continuance of existence.

             Our disappointment is that the intention of retrospection
             which was referred to and seemingly agreed at our meeting
             with your subcommittee, has not been confirmed and I
             personally want you to know that the fact that the clubs
             in question have not yet made payment against police
             charges rendered, is not because in any way we wish to
             be obstructive but rather the opposite.

             Yours sincerely,




             H. E. McGee,
             Chairman.

The County Council at their meeting today accepted the recommendations of the
Working Group on the Effects of Professional Football on the Community and
of the Police Committee on the revised scale of charges for police services
at professional football matches (see paper 'B* attached). However, the
date of implementation was amended to 1st April, 1983.

Accordingly, accounts in respect of football matches up to and including
31st March, 1983, should be prepared in accordance with the existing scale
and, from 1st April, 1983, in accordance with the new Scale.

I understand that my Legal Services Division already has a number of
outstanding accounts which have been held in abeyance at the request of the
Chairman of the Police Committee until the future scale of charges and
effective date were determined. I am, therefore, passing a copy of this
Memo to the Legal Services Division with a request that action now be taken
to re-submit those accounts to the football clubs concerned.

CRI TERIA F O R LEVYING CHARGES F O R POLICE SERVICES



The amount levied for police personnel doing duty in the stadium will
be related to crowd attendance and the incorporation of a constant' basic
number.     At all times this basic number will be one Sergeant and five
Constables.      The number of Constables will be increased by three for
each 2 ,0 0 0 spectators. The number of Sergeants will be increased in the
ratio of one to every nine Constables.       A charge will be levied for the
services of an Inspector for a gate over 9,0 00 and will be increased by
an additional Inspector for every four Sergeants.       In addition, there
will be a charge for a Chief Inspector whenever the spectator atten
reaches or exceeds 35,000 and for a Superintendent whenever the gat
excee ds 4 9 ,0 0 0 . The chart below illustrates this criteria.

On behalf of my Advisory Councilmay I i n v i t e you to a seminar on Patterns
of Social   Violence: Football asa Focus for Disorder which the Centre for
Contemporary Studies, with the support of the Football Trust, is
organising. As you will see from the brochure which I enclose, the
seminar takes place on Tuesday, 10th May at the Royal Society of Arts in
London.

We will be seeking at the seminar to broaden the discussion on soccer
violence and to stimulate some new thinking on the subject. However,
central to the debate will be the game i t s e l f and the p o s i t i v e , e f f e c t i v e
steps which might be taken to protect i t .

I very much hope that you will be able to join us. Places at the seminar
are by invitation only and you will be the guest of the Centre. However,
places are s t r i c t l y limited and I would be gratefu l, therefore, i f you
would l e t me have your reply assoon as p o ssib le.

    look forward to hearing from you

 Yours sincerely




 Lord Avebury

   SOCCER HOOLIGANISM

The effects of soccer hooliganism are becoming increasingly serious for

residents living near the grounds, police, local authorities and for

the clubs themselves.




Cllr Dohn Cornwell, chairman of the Arts and Recreation Committee of

the Association            of Metropolitan Authorities comments:

"Every week ue hear of more serious incidents of soccer hooliganism.                                                These

are not just confined to the grounds.                               Both before and after the match

shoplifting and vandalism often occur and fights are common on route to

local railway and bus stations; while during the game violence is often

vented on the police as well as other fans.




"We realise that a minority' of fans are involved, but this is criminal

behaviour and ,euen though it may stem from social problems it should not

 be made semi-acceptable by being, regarded as simply misbehaviour by football ians.




"The drain on police manpower during the football season is enormous.

In my own authority of South Yorkshire up to 500 policemen - out of a

total force of 2 8 7 2 - are often on duty at matches.                                   Clubs do contribute

towards the cost of policing their grounds and in some cases the charges

 are causing problems for smaller clubs already in financial difficulty.




"In order to consider effective measures to aleviate the problem the AMA

has set up a working party that will make recommendations to the Home Office

The situation we have at present with deteriorating crowd behavior cannot be


allowed to continue.                    The Government must take urgent action to find a solution.

Note of a Meeting of the Working Group on the Effects of Professional Football

                                 28th January, 1983.

PRESENT:

Representing the Police Committee

Councillors:  B. P. Flanagan (in the Chair), D. W. George, M. McCoy, W. K. Martin
(substituting for Councillor G. H, Moores), R. H. Patton, J. Peet, P. T. Senior,

Magistrate Member: Mr. G. G. Wood,

Representing the Policy Committee
Councillor J. C. Cornwell.

Mr. G. Buckle (Chairman), Mr. M. J. Spinks (Secretary)

Representing the Doncaster Rovers Football Club L t d .

Mr. A. Bannington (Director), Mr. R. Chester (Company Secretary).

Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

Mr. G. K. Hulley (Director), Mr. E. England       (secretary).

Apologies for absence were received from Councillor A. England and, on other
Council business, from Councillors J. Brown, G. H. Moores and R. Thwaites.

1.   Note of Previous Meeting.

The note of   the previous meeting held on 15th December, 1982 (a   copy ofwhich had
been circulated previously) was considered and agreed.     .

Mr. J. Layden did observe that no reference was contained in the Note of the
possibility of retrospection of the revised charges for police services.  It
was agreed that this was so, but it was explained that this was a matter of
policy yet to be decided.

2.   Charges for Police Services.

At the meeting on 15th December,   the    Chief Constable   had   been requested to prepare
a report on   the present criteria for    levying charges    for  police services, possibl
future criteria, the extent of co-operation between the Clubs and the Police, and



                                         1.
the extent of community related activities already being under-taken by the
Clubs.

The Working Group considered a report (a copy of which had been circulated
previously) incorporating the information requested.-

Whilst the effect of the revised criteria could not be estimated with any
real certainty (the football clubs being charged retrospectively, based on
the actual number of spectators present), it was likely that the total annual
charges to Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire would be reduced by some
£50,000 per annum.    The charges would also be more in line with the charges
made for the services of police in other areas of the country.    The possible
effect of the financial penalties and loss of grant arising from the recently
announced rate support grant settlement consequent upon the reduced income
which would result were outlined.    It was accepted that, looked at on a
County w id e service basis, the loss of income would not worsen the position
significantly, but it was considered to be a factor of which the Clubs should
be a w a r e .
                                                                                {
The Clubs acknowledged that, in the present economic situation, any assistance
which could be given would be most welcome, and were pleased that the input which
they were making on community problems by the various schemes which they were
already undertaking or proposed to undertake was now being recognised.  The
problems of the unemployed were of especial concern, and Rotherham United
announced that they intended to introduce on 29th January reduced admission
charges for the unemployed.  The Clubs also accepted that it would be necessary
for the County Treasurer to have a sight of their accounts.

RECOMMENDED - That, subject to any comments of the County Treasurer after having a
sight of the Clubs’ accounts, the revised criteria set out in Paper '*B" for the services of the
South Yorkshire Police at Football league matches in South Yorkshire be substituted
for those currently in force (set out in Paper "A") as from a date to be agreed
by the Police Committee after consultation with Policy Advisory Sub-Committee "A".

3.   Meeting with Media Representatives

On 15th December, the Working Groups decided to consider further the problem
of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football matches, and to                   (
invite media representatives to discuss the effect on the problem of media
reporting.

A dozen representatives of television, radio and the press had accordingly
been invited to be present, and the following persons were present for the
discussion:-

                , Sheffield Star
               1 South Yorkshire Times
              I Sheffield Star
                 Morning Telegraph
                Barnsley Chronicle
                |
                , Radio Hallam
                  I
                  , Doncaster Evening Post.

An apology for absence was received from the Editor of the Sheffield Star,
Whilst the Working Group accepted that generally the South Yorkshire based
media (and the Barnsley Chronicle and the Rotherham Advertiser in particular)
reported football matches in a factual, non-sensational, manner, the same could
not be said of certain elements of the media nationally.      In the Working Group's
opinion, the inflammatory language and descriptions often used could have the
effect of inciting an admittedly small minority to engage in the type of incidents
which the media were criticizing.   It also had the effect of discouraging the
average supporter, the casual supporter and families from attending m a t c h e s .
This particularly applied to pre-match publicity in some newspapers.        Addit­
ionally, it appeared that Considerable space was taken up on reporting’ .
 unruly incidents (which comprised only a very small amount of the total match
time and, in some cases, occurred outside of the grounds or in town centres), rather
than On a description of the match and, in some cases, even giving the match
result was omitted.   In comparison, wh^re spectators were involved in incidents, the
media frequently gavelittleor no publicity to itheresultant penalties imposed by
the Courts.   A pilot scheme to overcome this problem was in hand in the Rotherham
area and, to date, was proving to be mutually advantageous.      Certainly in South
Yorkshire, cases of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football matches
were being contained and were even showing signs of declining.       In contrast,
the media reporting of incidents appeared to be increasing.

They could not speak for their Editors, but the media represent­
atives present felt obliged to point out their duty and responsibility to the
public to report facts, even where these were unpleasant.  This was not to say
that this should not be done responsibly and in a balanced manner.  Certainly,
the view could be taken that if the media had not highlighted problems such
as hooliganism/vandalism, responsible people and bodies would not now be
working together in an effort to overcome such problems.  If there were
occasions when it was felt that balanced reporting had not taken place, complaints
could be made to be Editor concerned.  The media did not live in an "ivory tower"
and weresensitive to public opinion.  Action would be taken where it was justified.

It was agreed that the County Council's initiative in arranging meetings such as
this was welcome and a positive step.  It was only by the clubs, local and central
government agencies and the media working together for the good of the community
that the problem of hooliganism/vandalism could be contained and in time, hope­
fully overcome . The portion of the South Yorkshire Police Report on Charges for
Police Services relating to the involvement of the Football League Clubs in
South Yorkshire with the community was circulated to the media representatives
present.

RECOMMENDED -

1.  That a small Sub-Group (consisting of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the
Police Committee and two other Councillors* together with appropriate officers
and one representative from each of the Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire),
be appointed to discuss and report on the editorial policy adopted by the media
on incidents of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football matches.

2.  That the Editors of the twelve television, radio and press organisatibns in
question be invited to personally meet the Sub-Group to discuss the matter.

3.  That the Chairman of the Divisional Liaison Committees be requested to consider
inviting a representative from each of the Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire
to the next appropriate meeting of the Committee covering the area in which the
respective Grounds are situated.

CRITERIA FOR LEVYING CHARGES FOR POLICE SERVICES

The amount levied for police personnel doing duty in the stadium will
be related to crowd attendance and the incorporation of a constant
basic number.  At all times this basic number will be 1 Inspector, 2
Sergeants and 10 Constables.  The number of Constables will be increased
by 2 for each 1,000 spectators.   The number of Sergeants will be
increased in the ratio of 1 to every 10 Constables and there will be
added 1 Inspector to every 3 Sergeants or multiples thereof,   A charge
will be levied for the services of a Chief Inspector whenever one or
more Inspectors are on duty.   in addition, there will be a charge for a
Superintendent whenever the spectator attendance reaches or exceeds
40,000.  The chart below illustrates this criteria.

For the purpose of calculating the number of Constables for levying
purposes, 500 spectators and below will be disregarded and a figure above
500 will be 'rounded-up' to the next whole figure of 1 ,000, e .g. 5, 07 3
shall be deemed to be 5,000 and 14,782_ shall be deemed to be 15,000

These charges will be at the Special Services Rate applicable at the time.

Should a match be cancelled at short notice whereby police expenditure is
necessarily incurred- a basic charge will not be levied as is done in some
police forces, but a report will be submitted to the Assistant Chief
Constable (Management Services) for negotiations with the Secretary of the
Club for reasonable reimbursement.

These charges will be at the Special Services Rate applicable at the time.

Should a match be cancelled at short notice whereby police expenditure is
necessarily incurred, a basic charge will not be levied but a report will
be submitted to the Assistant Chief Constable (Management Services) for
negotiations with the Secretary of the club for reasonable reimbursement.

                        SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL

Note of a Meeting of the Working Group on the Effects of Professional Football
on the Community

                                 28th January,   1983.

PRESENT:

Representing the Police Committee

(substituting for Councillor G. H. Moores), R. H. Patton, J. Peet, P. T. Senior,

Mr. G. K. Hulley (Director), Mr. E. England       (secretary).

Apologies for absence were received from Councillor A. England and, on other
Council business, from Councillors J. Brown, C. H. Moores and R. Thwaites.

1.   Note of Previous Meeting.

The. note of the previous meeting held on 15th December,         1982   (a copy of which had
been circulated previously) was considered and agreed.

Mr. J. Layden did observe that no reference was contained in the Note of the
possibility of retrospection of the revised charges for police services.  It
was agreed that this was so, but it was explained that this was a matter of
policy yet to be decided.

2.   Charges for Police Services.

At the meeting on 15th December, the Chief Constable had been requested to prepare
a report on the present criteria for levying charges for police services, possible
future criteria, the extent of co-operation between the Clubs and the Police, and
the extent of community related activities already being under-taken by the
Clubs.

The Working Group considered a report (a copy of which had been circulated
previously) incorporating the information requested.

Whilst the effect of the revised criteria could not be estimated with any
real certainty (the football clubs being charged retrospectively, based on
the actual number of spectators present), it was likely that the total annual
charges to Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire would be reduced by some
£50,000 per annum.  The charges would also be more in line with the charges
made for the services of police in other areas of the country.  The possible
effect of the financial penalties and loss of grant arising from the recently
announced rate support grant settlement consequent upon the reduced income
which would result were outlined.  It was accepted that, looked at on a
County wide service basis, the loss of income would not worsen the position
significantly, but it was considered to be a factor of which the Clubs should
be a wa r e .

The Clubs acknowledged that, in the present economic situation, any assistance
which could be given would be most welcome, and were pleased that the input which
they were making on community problems by the various schemes which they were
already undertaking or proposed to undertake was now being recognised.  The
problems of the unemployed were of especial concern, and Rotherham United
announced that they intended to introduce on 29th January reduced admission
charges for the unemployed.  The Clubs also accepted that it would be necessary
for the County Treasurer to have a sight of their accounts.

RECOMMENDED - That, subject to any comments of the County Treasurer after having
sight of the Clubs’ accounts, the revised criteria set out in Paper "B" for the services of
South Yorkshire Police at Football League matches in South Yorkshire be substituted
for those currently in force (set out in Paper "A") as from a date to be agreed
by the Police Committee after consultation with Policy Advisory Sub-Committee "A"

3.   Meeting with Media Representatives

On 15th December, the Working Groups decided to consider further the problem
of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football matches, and to
invite media representatives to discuss the effect on the problem of media
reporting.

A dozen representatives of television, radio and the press had accordingly
been invited to be present, and the following persons were present for the
discussion:-

               , Sheffield Star
              / South Yorkshire Times
               Sheffield Star
               1 Morning Telegraph
               Barnsley Chronicle
               ] Radio Hallam
                   Doncaster Evening Post.

An apology for absence was received from the Editor of the Sheffield Star,
Whilst the Working Group accepted that generally the South Yorkshire based
media (and the Barnsley Chronicle and the Rotherham Advertiser in particular)
reported football matches in a factual, non-sensational, manner, the same could
not be said of certain elements of the media nationally.      In the Working Group's
opinion, the inflammatory language and descriptions often used could have the
effect of inciting an admittedly small minority to engage in the type of incidents
which the media were criticizing.    It also had the effect of discouraging the
average supporter, the casual supporter and families from attending matches.
This particularly applied to pre-match publicity in some newspapers.         Addit­
ionally, it appeared that Considerable space was taken up on reporting
 unruly incidents (which comprised only a very small amount of the total match
time and, in some cases, occurred outside of the grounds or in town centres), rather
than on a description of the match and, in some cases', even giving the match
result was omitted.   In comparison, whe're spectators were involved in incidents, the
media frequently gavelittleor no publicity to the resultant penalties imposed by
the Courts.   A  pilot scheme to overcome this problem was in hand in the Rotherham
area and, to date, was proving to be mutually advantageous.       Certainly in South
Yorkshire, cases of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football matches
were being contained and were even showing signs of declining.        In contrast,
the media reporting of incidents appeared to be increasing.

They could not   speak for their Editors, but the media represent­
atives present   felt obliged to point out their duty and responsibility to the
public to report facts, even where these were unpleasant.   This was not to say
that this should not be done responsibly and in a balanced manner.   Certainly,
the view could be taken that if the media had not highlighted problems such
as hooliganism/vandalism, responsible people and bodies would not now be
working together in an effort to overcome such problems.   If there were
occasions when it was felt that balanced reporting had not taken place, complaints
could be made to be Editor concerned.   The media did not live in an "ivory tower"
and weresensitive to public opinion.   Action would be taken where it was justified.

It was agreed that the County Council's initiative in arranging meetings such as
this was welcome and a positive step.  It was only by the clubs, local and central
government agencies and the media working together for the good of the community
that the problem of hooliganism/vandalism could be contained and in time, hope­
fully overcome.  The portion of the South Yorkshire Police Report on Charges for
Police Services relating to the involvement of the Football League Clubs in
South Yorkshire with the community was circulated to the media representatives
p r es ent.

RECOMMENDED -

1. That a small Sub-Group (consisting of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the
Police Committee and two other Councillors, together with appropriate officers
and one representative from each of the Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire),
be appointed to discuss and report on the editorial policy adopted by the media
on incidents of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football matches.

2. That the Editors of the twelve television, radio and press organisations in
question be invited to personally meet the Sub-Group to discuss the matter.

3.  That the Chairman of the Divisional Liaison Committees be requested to consider
inviting a representative from each of the Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire
to the next appropriate meeting of the Committee covering the area in which the
respective Grounds are situated.

 PROPOSED 1 9 8 2 / 3 CRITERIA



 CRITERIA FOR LEVYING CHARGES FOR POLICE SERVICES


 The amount levied for police personnel doing duty in the stadium will
 be related to crowd attendance and the incorporation of a constant basic
 number.  At all times this basic number will be one Sergeant and five
 Constables. The number of Constables will be increased by three for
 each 2,000 spectators. The number of Sergeants will be increased in the
 ratio of one to every nine Constables.  A charge will be levied for the
 services of an Inspector for a gate over 9,000 and will be increased by
 an additional Inspector for every four Sergeants. 'In addition, there
 will be a charge for a Chief Inspector whenever the spectator attendance
 reaches or exceeds 35,000 and for a Superintendent whenever the gate
 exceeds 4-9,000. The chart below illustrates this criteria.

Dear

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE LIAISON WITH FOOBALL LEAGUE     CLUBS

I refer to the recent meeting of the South Yorkshire County Council Working
Group looking into the effect of professional football on the corr.nu.nity,
held at County Hall on 15 December 1982, and your request regarding action
taken by football clubs  to improve safety and facilities, and also       their
involvement with the community.  I am pleased to inform you as follows:

Co-operation between the football clubs and the police is of the highest
possible nature and any requests by the police for action by trie clubs is
generally regarded favourably, and providing finance is available then our
suggestions are acted upon.

I attach to this letter a report submitted by Chief Inspector Stuart which
details certain action which has been taken anr also illustrates the
involvement of the various clubs with the coismunity.

In so far as the levying of charges for police services is concerned, I a®
also attaching for your information two papers marked ’A* and ’B' . Paper
'.V sets out the criteria vrhich is currently in operation throughout the
County and explairta how  charges are na.de. upon the football clubs. Paper *B*
i.3 a suggested criteria   if the County Council decide to allejviata      so.r^e of
the financial difficulties currently being experienced b y the clubs arid would
have the effect of deducing income from football ciuka by sons £50,000 per
year. This is an approximate figure, as you will appreciate, because *a
retrospectively charge football clubs for our services, depending upon the
number of spectators.   Any accurate forecast is almost impossible .as crowd
attendances fluctuate depending upon the success a teas is enjoying at
any particular time.

I trust this information will be of value to you, but should you require
any further help, please don't hesitate to contact oo.

Yours

To

CC(Operations)        Sir

r R J Goslin
                      At the meeting of the South Yorkshire County Council Working
                      Group looking into the effect of professional football on the
                      community, held at County Hall on 15 December 1 9 8 2 , the Chairman,
                      County Councillor Mr G H Moores, called for a report on the
                      'Cooperation with the five l e ague clubs, ground improvements
                      and general involvement with the community1.

                      In October 1979 a Working Group was established to examine
                      sports stadiums throughout South Yorkshire. The Working
                      Group operates within the provisions of the Safety of Sports
                      Grounds Act 1975 and is comprised of representatives of the
                      South Yorkshire County Council, South Yorkshire Police, South
                      Yorkshire Fire Service and members of the Building Control
                      Authority for the four metropolitan districts of the county.
                      Each of the representative bodies has a particular respons­
                      ibility for various aspects of safety.

                      Some of the points of particular importance to the Police are
                      as follows:

                      1   A central control point for use by the supervising police
                           officer and the club's safety officer.

                      2    Intercommunication between central control and turnstiles.

                      3   A metering system to record all admissions at turnstiles.

                      k   Public addressing equipment, capable of being controlled
                          from the central control point.

                      5   Availability of loud hailers.

                      6   Police radio facilities which are available should
                          augment and not supersede club communication systems.

                      7   A special room for police use not connected with the
                          communications control point where detained persons may
                          be recorded.

                      So far as the policing of the ground is concerned, this is
                      a matter which is determined for each particular event,
                      taking into account the venue, type of match involved and
                      number of spectators anticipated.

                      Since its establishment the Working Group on Safety at
                      Sports Grounds has visited all the grounds in South
                      Yorkshire and has made contact with club representatives. •
                      The grounds have been inspected from a safety aspect and
                      recommendations made to improve safety levels with particular



 G EN/52
emphasis being made on the control of spectators. The ground
representatives have responded to advice and numerous alterations
have been implemented. An example of the type of work recommended
and carried out, is the alteration of inward opening gates which
should either open outwards or be of the sliding type. Gates of
this nature have been located at grounds within South Yorkshire
and on recommendation of the Working Group have been altered to
conform with safety standards.

Another example is the clearance of waste materials from terraces,
which have previously been used as missiles, and the erection of
fences for crowd segregation and containment.

 At the present time football clubs in the first and second divisions
 are required to make application for a general safety certificate
 under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975* So far as South
 Yorkshire is concerned, the only ground issued with a certificate
'at the present time is the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club at
 Hillsborough, the safety certificate being issued on 21 December
 1979* Considerable work was undertaken by the club in order to
 bring the ground up to the required safety standard for the
 certificate to be issued.

As previously stated, general improvements and alterations are on­
going at the remaining four league clubs who are working towards
the ultimate issue of a general safety certificate.

Perhaps it is pertinent to mention in this report in view of the
Working Group's terms of reference, that the requirements for
adequate policing is contained within the general safety certificate
and under section seven of the certificate the following is stated:

'The holder shall, at his own expense, arrange for the attendance
at every specified activity of an adequate number of police officers
to secure the orderly and lawful behaviour of the spectators and
the number of police officers required at each specified activity
shall be agreed between the Chief Constable and the holder, at least
21 days (or such short a time to which the Chief Constable may
consent) before a specified activity takes place'.

The establishment of the Safety of Sports Grounds Working Group
provides for a common policy throughout the county and allows a
close watch to be maintained upon various sports stadiums, with
particular emphasis on safety precautions in relation to the
crowd attendances likely to be expected.

Involvement with the community

Our five football league clubs have a considerable amount of
involvement with the community and in the cas'e of Barnsley training
and coaching sessions are held on their training pitch during the
evening on three nights a week. Invitations are extended to schools
to visit the ground and players are frequently involved in charity
and fund raising events. . The club is at present very actively
involved in a saving scheme that will provide a stand for the
disabled and handicapped. -

Doncaster Rovers Football Club also run a Junior Rovers Club
and offer physio facilities to the public and allow the ground
to be used by the community for organised matches.

Rotherham United Football Club are very much involved with the
community and have a Junior Millers Club with a membership of
approximately ^00 meetings once every two weeks and have a junior
pass scheme whereby 3 0 0 fans have special passes which are with­
drawn if they are involved in any trouble.    There is a schools'
liaison scheme at Rotherham whereby each primary school applies
for a week at Millmoor.    This is used as a catalyst for art work
and creative writing, culminating in an exhibition at Millmoor
of all art work produced.    Every Wednesday a personality at the
club gives coaching sessions and a conducted tour of the ground.
The club entertains nine boys from local schools at every home
game and a pilot scheme is planned which will allow free entry
to a pupil if accompanied by a paying adult.    The club loans
equipment to schools, is involved with road safety schemes and
runs a week's coaching course at Orgreave for over 100 12 to 16
year olds in which players take part, the course culminating
in a trip to Wembley for a guided tour.

On the financial side, a family scheme operates at Millmoor
Lane stand which offers savings of at least £1.00 off a joint
family ticket costing £5*00.  There are also reductions in the
price of family season tickets.  Parent family groups are
organised and advice given to young supporters regarding travel
on trains and coaches and general conduct whilst attending
matches.  The local unemployed centre has free use of social
club facilities for disco dances and a four point plan not yet
gratified by the committee is being considered as follows:

1   Making available Orgreave five-a-side pitches.

2   Indoor sports hall at Millmoor to provide new changing
    facilities.

3   Social club to be turned over for indoor club facilities
    during the day.

k   Half price admission into the Tivoli stand on match days.

Players and staff at the club of course attend all manner of
functions to make presentations and every evening between
^ • 3 0 and 10.00 pm different groups of children are given use
of the sports hall, heating and light being supplied by the
club.     Support is given to local majorettes by allowing them
to stage pre-match entertainment and take collections.     The
Assistant Manager, Mr Barry Claxton, now qualified under FA
Treatment of Injury Certificate, runs a six week course for
treatment to amateur coaches etc, 2 3 persons have in fact
completed this course.     It is difficult to see how Rotherham
United in particular could be any more involved with the
community.     Sheffield United Football Club run a Junior and
Senior Blades Club Monday and Wednesday evenings; the Singles
Club use the Executive Suite and the community has use of the
Banquetting Suite and.of course the Social Club, their involve­
ment mainly is with the very active and popular Junior Blades
Club.

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club run a Young Owls Under l^fs
Club, a Junior League Under 16s Team and the sports hall is
used by the public for keep fit and circuit training, the
sessions being organised by the team trainer.  There is a very
active official supporters club as indeed have all the other
South Yorkshire League Clubs and Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club have an Open Day one Sunday per year and a Junior Owls
competition.   It is fair to say that all the clubs, particularly
Rotherham United, are most actively involved with the community
at large.   I feel however that all the clubs could be perhaps
more actively involved with the unemployed and it must be of
some benefit to the clubs in the way of increased attendances
if they were to offer admission price reductions to this section
of society.

                         MINISTER REMINDS P00TBALL LEAGUE CLUBS OP
                          PROCEDURES TO PREVENT SOOTBALL VIOLMCE

          Neil Macfarlane, Minister for Sport, has written to Mr Jack Dimnett JP MP,
President of the Bbofball League, a reminder letter on measures to prevent violence at
football matches.   Mr Dunnett and Mr Bert Millichip, Chairman of the Jbotball Association,
agreed with the Minister that recent outbreaks of.violence indicated that League Clubs
should be reminded of the available PA guidelines.   Mr Dunnett is to circulate the
Minister*s letter to all 92 5botball League Clubs.
         In his letter the Minister expresses his deep concern — shared by the PA and
the Fbotball League — at the recent return of crowd violence at some league matches.
In reminding clubs of the precautions which must be taken, Mr Macfarlane pays tribute
to the efforts clubs have already made and looks forward to the preparation of new and
detailed advice for clubs by the Liaison Group and the proposed Council of Europe
Working Group.
         Experience in the UK and abroad demonstrates that adherence to the available
guidelines effectively limits crowd violence.   The Minister highlights two key
requirements:
         —   effective segregation;
         —   careful and detailed preparation and planning, especially with the Police
             and for problem matches.
         Mr Macfarlane*s letter urges clubs to look again at their procedures   and
j   cautions to prevent further outbreaks of violence in the weeks to come.
NOTE TO EDITORS
         The ’’liaison group” was set up by Mr Macfarlane to plan for the Vforld Cup.
It is currently chaired by Mr Bert Millichip. It comprises officials of the PA, the
Ebotball League, Department of the Ehvironment, Department of Transport, Home Office,
Association of Chief Police Officers, British Rail, and British Transport Police.

          It was agreed at last Thursday’s meeting of Council of Europe Sports Ministers
in Paris that a working group should be set up to prepare a European Convention on
Violence in Sport.

         A copy of Mr Macfarlanefs letter is attached.

You, Bert Millichip and I are all deeply concerned at the recent
return of crowd violence at some league matches.  That it is
continuing to afflict some clubs is a matter of grave concern to
me.  You offered to circulate a reminder letter to the 92 League
Club Chairmen as a matter of some urgency.

The Football Association has, in the past, circulated useful
guidance on crowd control to the affiliated clubs.  The current
difficulties primarily affect the professional league clubs.   It
seems to me essential to remind clubs that there are precautions
which must be taken, and to highlight two particularly sensitive
points.  In doing so, I must pay tribute to the efforts which our
clubs have made in recent years in trying to uphold law and order
in and around the grounds.  I also do not seek to pre-empt the
work of the Liaison Group, or the proposed Council of Europe
Working Group, both of whom are working on detailed advice which
we hope to receive shortly.

Experience, both here and abroad, has shown that adherence to the
available guidelines effectively limits crowd violence.  There
appear to be two key requirements:

        a.  segregation - which must be effective.* this means working
        out the right measures for each stadium, terrace and stand;

        b.  careful and detailed preparation and planning, especially
        with the Police.  This will involve a rigorous on-site
        assessment by both clubs well in advance of all matches
        involving sides with a history of violence by a minority of
        their supporters.

These guidelines are not new, nor may they be exhaustive, but
I hope clubs will make use of them until we have the detailed
recommendations of the Liaison Group.  As we are both aware, no
such guidelines can represent a panacea to make our major winter
sport once more the family entertainment we all want it to be.
We are all saddened by recent events, which make it plain that a
reminder of the basic "rules" cannot be out of place.  I urge
clubs to look again at their procedures and precautions so that
we can prevent further outbreaks of violence in the weeks to come.

Note of a Meeting of the Working Group on the Effects of Professional Football
on the Community

                                 28th January,   1983.

PRESENT:

Representing the Police Committee

Councillors:  B. P. Flanagan (in the Chair), D. W. George, M. McCoy, W. K. Martin
(substituting for Councillor G. H, Moores), R. H. Patton, J. Peet, P. T. Senior,
M. E. Smith.
Magistrate Member: Mr. G. G. Wood,

Representing the Policy Committee
Councillor J. C. Cornwell.

Representing the Barnsley Football Club L t d .

Mr. G. Buckle (Chairman), Mr. M. J. Spinks (Secretary)

Representing the Doncaster Rovers Football Club L td.

Mr. I. M. Jones (Chairman).

Representing the Rotherham United Football Club L td.

Mr. J. Layden (Director), Mr. J. E. Bennison (Secretary).

Representing the Sheffield United Football Club L td.

Mr. A. Bannington (Director), Mr. R. Chester (Company Secretary).

Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

Mr. G. K. Hulley (Director), Mr. E. England (secretary).

Apologies for absence were received from Councillor A. England and, on other
Council business, from Councillors J. Brown, G. H. Moores and R. Thwaites.

1.   Note of Previous Meeting.

The note of  the previous meeting held on 15th December, 1982 (a copy of which had
been circulated previously) was considered and agreed.

Mr. J. Layden did observe that no reference was contained in the Note of the
possibility of retrospection of the revised charges for police services.  It
was agreed that this was so, but it was explained that this was a matter of
policy yet to be decided.-

2.   Charges for Police Services.

At the meeting on 15th December,   the    Chief Constable    had  been requested to prepare
a report on   the present criteria for    levying charges    for  police services, possible
future criteria, the extent of co-operation between the Clubs and the Police, and
the extent of community related activities already being under-taken by the
Clubs.

The Working Group considered a report (a copy of which had been circulated
previously) incorporating the infomiation requested..

Whilst the effect of the revised criteria could not be estimated with any
real certainty (the football clubs being charged retrospectively, based on
the actual number of spectators present), it was likely that the total annual
charges to Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire would be reduced by some
£50,000 per annum.  The charges would also be more in line with the charges
made for the services of police in other areas of the country.  The possible
effect of the financial penalties and loss of grant arising from the recently
announced rate support grant settlement consequent upon the reduced income
which would result were outlined.  It was accepted that, looked at on a
County wide service basis, the loss of income would not worsen the position
significantly, but it was considered to be a factor of which the Clubs should
be aware.

The Clubs acknowledged that, in the present economic situation, any assistance
which could be given would be most welcome, and were pleased that the input which
they were making on community problems by the various schemes which they were
already undertaking or proposed to undertake was now being recognised.  The
problems of the unemployed were of especial concern, and Rotherham United
announced that they intended to introduce on 29th January reduced admission
charges for the unemployed.  The Clubs also accepted that it would be necessary
for the County Treasurer to have a sight of their accounts.

RECOMMENDED - That, subject to any comments of the County Treasurer after having a
sight of the Clubs' accounts , the r e v i s e d criteria set out in Paper "B" for the services of the
South Y o r k s h i r e Police at Football League matches in South Yorkshire be substituted
for those currently in force (set out in Paper "A") as from a date to be agreed
by the Police Committee after consultation with Policy Advisory Sub-Committee "A".

3.   Meeting with Media Representatives

On 15th December, the Working Groups decided to consider further the problem
of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football matches, and to
invite media representatives to discuss the effect on the problem of media
reporting.

A dozen representatives of television, radio and the press had accordingly
been invited to be present, and the following persons were present for the
discussion:-

                ^ Sheffield Star
                  South Yorkshire Times
                 Sheffield Star
                  Morning Telegraph
                Barnsley Chronicle
                j, Radio Hal lam
                   IDoncaster Evening Post.

An apology for absence was received from the Editor of the Sheffield Star,
Whilst the Working Group accepted that generally the South Yorkshire based
media (and the Barnsley Chronicle and the Rotherham Advertiser in particular)
reported football matches in a factual, non-sensational, manner, the same could
not be said of certain elements of the media nationally.        In the Working Group’s
opinion, the inflammatory language and descriptions often used could have the
effect of inciting an admittedly small minority to engage in the type of incidents
which the media were criticizing.      It also had the effect of discouraging the
average supporter, the casual supporter and families from attending matches.
This particularly applied to pre-match publicity in some newspapers.          Addit­
ionally, it appeared that Considerable space was taken up on reporting
 unruly incidents (which comprised oaly a very small amount of the total match
time and, in some cases, occurred outside of the grounds or in town centres), rather
than on a description of the match and, £n sojjjg cases, even giving the match
result was omitted.    In comparison, whe'rei spectators were involved in incidents, the
media frequently gave little or no publicity to the resultant penalties imposed by
the Courts. A pilot scheme to overcome this problem was in hand in the Rotherham
area and, to date, was proving to be mutually advantageous.        Certainly in South
Yorkshire, cases of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football liiatches
were being contained and were even showing signs of declining.         In contrast,
the media reporting of incidents appeared to be increasing.

They could not speak for their Editors, but the media represent­
atives present felt obliged to point out their duty and responsibility to the
public to report facts, even where these were unpleasant. This was not to say
that this should not be done responsibly and in a balanced manner.  Certainly,
the view could be taken that if the media had not highlighted problems such
as hooliganism/vandalism, responsible people and bodies would not now be
working together in an effort to overcome such problems.  If there were
occasions when it was felt that balanced reporting had not taken place, complaints
could be made to be Editor concerned. The media did not live in an "ivory tower"
and weresensitive to public opinion. Action would be tdken where it was justified.

It was agreed that the County Council's initiative in arranging meetings such as
this was welcome and a positive step.  It was only by the clubs, local and central
government agencies and the media working together for the good of the community
that the problem of hooliganism/vandalism could be contained and in time, hope­
fully overcome. The portion of the South Yorkshire Police Report on Charges for
Police Services relating to the involvement of the Football League Clubs in
South Yorkshire with the community was circulated to the media representatives
present.

RECOMMENDED -

1. That a small Sub-Group (consisting of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the
Police Committee and two other Councillors* together with appropriate officers
and one representative from each of the Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire),
be appointed to discuss and report on the editorial policy adopted by the media
on incidents of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football matches.

2. That the Editors of the twelve television, radio and press organisations in
question be invited to personally meet the Sub-Group to discuss the matter.

3. That the Chairman of the Divisional Liaison Committees be requested to consider
inviting a representative from each of the Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire
to the next appropriate meeting of the Committee covering the area in which the
respective Grounds are situated.
CRITERIA FOR LEVYING CHARGES FOR POLICE SERVICES

The amount levied for police personnel doing duty in the stadium will
be related to crowd attendance and the incorporation of a constant
basic number.  At all times this basic number will be 1 Inspector, 2
Sergeants and 10 Constables.  The number of Constables will be increased
by 2 for each 1,000 spectators.   The number of Sergeants will be
increased in the ratio of 1 to every 10 Constables and there will be
added 1 Inspector to every 3 Sergeants or multiples thereof.   A charge,
will be levied for the services of a Chief Inspector whenever one or
more Inspectors are ori duty.  In addition, there will be a charge for a
Superintendent whenever the spectator attendance reaches or exceeds
40,000.  The chart below illustrates this criteria.

For the purpose of calculating the number of Constables; for levying
purposes, 500 spectators and below will be disregarded and a figure above
500 will be 1rounded-up' to the next whole figure of 1, OOO, e .g . 5,07 3
shall be deemed to be 5,000 and 14,782^ shall be deemed to be 15,000.

These charges will be at the Special Services Rate applicable at the time.

Should a match be cancelled at short notice whereby police expenditure is
necessarily incurred, a basic charge will not be levied as is done in some
police forces, but a report will be submitted to the Assistant Chief
Constable (Management Services) for negotiations with the Secretary of the
Club for reasonable reimbursement.

These charges will be at the Special Services Rate applicable at the time.

Should a match be cancelled at short notice whereby police expenditure is
necessarily incurred, a basic charge will not be levied but a report will
be submitted to the Assistant Chief Constable (Management Services) for
negotiations with the Secretary of the club for reasonable reimbursement.

                           MINISTER CALLS TOR COMBINED APPROACH
                                    TO BEAT HOOLIGANISM

      Neil Macfarlane, Minister for Sport, today challenged all agenices involved in
 the organisation of soccer events to join together in a combined force to curb
 spectator violence.
      Speaking at a Council of Europe Informal Working Group of Sports Ministers in
 Paris, Mr Macfarlane stressed the crucial ingredient of sound planning and preparation
 for the successful staging of all sporting events particularly footbal-l matches.
 He said:
      "We need a clear and definitive lead from the football authorities and co­
operation*      co-operation between governments, between the independent football
 authorities and governments, and all the other authorities and agencies involved.
      ’’We must ensure that the UEFA rules are observed and -


      -     control Ihe sale of tickets;

      -     segregate fans both in the stadium, and on their way to and from the
            match;


     -      plan carefully for matches where trouble is likely to occur.


     "We must also ensure the judiciary hand out appropriate sentences which will
have a deterrent effect.”
     5The Minister illustrated the success of this kind of co-ordinated approach by
referring to the achievement of the UK Ebotball Liaison Group which had played a
 major role in tackling the hooligan problem particularly with regard to the World Cup
tournament last year.

                 SPEECH FOR

             NEIL MACFARLANE MP

             MINISTER FOR SPORT

                   TO THE

COUNCIL OF EUROPE: INFORMAL WORKING GROUP OF
          MINISTERS FOR SPORT PARIS

                    ON

              27 JANUARY 1983
     In the UK, soccer has been played for well over TOO years,
and football is still an integral part of the social scene in
most of our cities. Indeed we have 40,000 clubs affiliated to
the Football Association, but our attention at this Conference
is on the professional game.

     The organisation of Football is predominantly the concern
of the governmeng bodies, but Governments do have a part to play.
Because if violence between football spectators occurs away from
the grounds then that is not a matter for the football
authorities. That is a matter of law and order, as would be any
public disorder. Government must bear the responsibility of
ensuring that its country’s laws are adequately framed to deal
with violence, and that the courts should be given adequate
powers to deal with offenders. In Britain, there are penalties
for public order offences of fines and terms of imprisonment,
or both. These apply to disturbances both inside and outside
the grounds.



                                                              2
      I am a firm believer that when the law is broken, the
offenders should be subject to the natural process of law.
Research in the United Kingdom has shown that in those areas
where magistrates deal out harsher sentences, violence at
soccer matches is less than in other areas. The British courts
also have at their disposal the penalty of requiring offenders
to report to attendance centres on Saturday afternoons when they
would otherwise be at football matches.

      I have been concerned, therefore, to see that some
European countries tend simply to deport British fans as quickly
as possible when they have been arrested for acts of violence.
This is not a deterrent generally: nor is it a deterrent which
will prevent those fans returning to that country to cause
trouble again. I therefore urge my colleagues that any British
offenders should not exempt from the processes of law and order
and they must be charged, and dealt with by the courts using
the full range of their powers.
                    /


      Government authorities also have a role in controlling the
transport of fans to and from matches, and in controlling the
availability of alcohol. In the UK, the Traffic Commissioners
(who control coach operations) have powers to ban alcohol from
coaches conveying football supporters. British Rail does not
permit alcohol on the special trains which it runs for football fans.

                                                               3
Also, in liaison with the police, British Rail ensure that
these so-called "football specials" brircjing away fans to
matches arrive only shortly before the start of a match. This
enables the police to ensure that rival supporters do not meet
en route to the grounds, sometimes by the use of special routes
from railway station to the match where fans are marshalled
by the police. In Scotland, alcohol has been banned from the
grounds as an experiment. The experiment is not yet complete,
but there is a subjective feeling amongst the authorities in
Scotland that crowd behaviour has improved as a result.

     However there is absolutely no doubt that the malicious
and criminal behaviour of some so-called football fans of any
country tarnishes the reputation of that country. .




                                                                  4
     As I have said, Governments and the independent football
authorities have responsibilities. The English Football
Association has acknowledged that they, together with the clubs,
must accept a large degree of responsibility for what happens
inside football grounds. There are a number of precautionary
measures, which the Football Association asks clubs to take in
order to minimise trouble. Some of these include the
segregation of rival supporters inside grounds, rules concerning
the sale of alcohol, separation of rival supporters moving to
and from grounds and using different entrances, and many others.

     At my instigation, the Chairman of the English Football
Association chairs a liaison group of all the interested
organisations to review these measures. The group includes
representatives of the football authorities, of my Department -
the Department of the Environment, the Home Office, the
Department of Transport, the Police and British Rail. That
group will produce shortly a blue print of all the preventative
measures we have evolved over the years to deal with soccer
violence in England.




                                                            5
     You will have read of serious crowd violence at an English
Division 2 football match only last Saturday between
Derby County and Leeds. One of my officials, here with me
today, has just returned from the ground having made a pre­
liminary assessment of what went wrong.

     It would seem that some of the measures, to which I have referred,
(and which should be part of all pre-match planning) were not
necessarily put into operation and thus problems occurred.

      I do not want to dwell too much upon events of last
Saturday - that is not the purpose of this Conference but it
seems to me that some clubs are insufficiently aware of the
fine detail of the precautions which they should take and it
is imperative that the governing bodies of football at all
levels set out rules which must be followed all the time.
This was the idea behind my forming the Liaison Group, and I
shall be taking up with the England football authority the
persistent failure of some clubs to understand the detail of
what they should do.




                                                                  6
     This latest regrettable incident does not detract from
the improvement that many clubs have achieved. The same
Derby County entertained, recently, Nottingham Forest. There
is intense rivalry between these two clubs and yet no trouble
either on the terraces or outside the ground was reported.
It does I think point to the need for very clear rules to be
set out, and the need to ensure that they are rigorously
applied at all times. I am convinced that clubs cannot spend
too much time in planning well in advance of potentially
troublesome matches.

     I turn now to the European scene.

     The European governing body (the European Union of
Football Associations - UEFA) has what it calls "binding
instructions and recommendations to the organisers of U F A
competition matches and to the visiting teams with regard to
precautionary measures to avoid crowd distances". I have a
copy here. These "binding instructions and recommendations"
drawn up in 1976 include:

    a. the segregation of opposing supporters;

    b. timing of arrival of organised parties;

    c. prevention of potential missiles being taken into the
       ground.                                               7
     There are many other constructive points for clubs
and stadium authorities to follow. They are indeed
similar to the English requirements. But I am concerned
that some European clubs experienced in UEFA competitions,
and their national Football Associations, have been
unaware of these binding instructions.




                                                             7a
It is, my experience that, whenever British fans have been
involved in trouble inside European football grounds, these
UEFA rules have been ignored by the stadium authorities.

     One interesting aspect in all this is the role of the
International governing body of football - FIFA: the
International Federation of Football Associations. They have
no rules about the control of spectators during international
matches: only rules setting down punishment after trouble has
occurred.

      Before the start of The World Cup tournament, my officials
visited all the centres where the 3 British teams would be
playing and discussed arrangements with the City authorities,
the local police, and stadium officials. My staff were
accompanied by those of the English Football Association. They
discussed vital matters such as the segregation inside grounds
of rival supporters, ticket allocation, ticket distribution,
sale of alcohol inside grounds, separation of parking facilities
for rival supporters, and segregation of supporters from the
parking places and other points of access to and from the
grounds. Segregation will not work if tickets are sold
indistriminately on the day of the match: ticket distribution
must be controlled too.

                                                              8
     Some 30,000 British supporters visited Spain for the
                 'i
World Cup. Overall their behaviour was a revelation due,
I believe, in part to the sound in planning and preparation
initiated by my officials, and their insistence upon adherence
to the UEFA rules and recommendations even though it was a
FIFA event.

     Since then, my officials have repeated this exercise for
last year's European Cup Final in Rotterdam between Aston Villa
and Bayern Munich, Greece against England, Bayern Munich against
Tottenham Hotspur, and Paris St Germain against Swansea City. I
myself visited Munich to see the precautions at first hand, and to
have discussions with local officials. On each of these occasions,
the match passed off incident-free, the only troubles occurring before
this Munich match and yet again alcohol was one of the main causes.

     Only once since the World Cup has there been trouble - the
match.between Denmark and England. My officials had not visited
Copenhagen beforehand, and the UEFA rules were not applied for this
FIFA match.

     I am convinced that this experience gives us a lead on how
to control trouble. But we need a clear and definitive lead
from the football authorities and co-operation: co-operation
between governments, between the independent football authorities
and governments, and all the other authorities and agencies involved.
We must ensure that the UEFA rules are observed and -

     - control the sale of tickets;

     - segregate fans both in the stadium, and on their way to
       and from the match;

     - plan carefully for matches where trouble is likely to
       occur.

We must also ensure the judiciary hand out appropriate sentences
which will have a deterrent effect.

     We must rid ourselves of this hideous problem: it is a
problem for us all and by helping ourselves, and more importantly
by helping each other, we can control and significantly reduce
violence at soccer matches, even if in today's society we cannot
eliminate it altogether.

     We face a common problem which I submit, should be
countered by a common approach.

Dear Sir,

Barnaley Railway Station - Crowd Control
              *   \-%b
I attach a copy of correspondence relating to a request by British
Rail for a contribution towards the cost of an improved compound
for football supporters awaiting trains at the Barnsley Railway
Station.

The only previous application which I an avare of which is in any way
similar was some four years ago and related to a possible contribution
towards the cost of keeping the WadIley Bridge Railway Station open for
football trains. This request was considered by Policy Advisory Sub-
Cosmittee 'A* and refused.

In the Barnsley case, ve are talking, about British Rail passengers on
British Rail property awaiting British Rail trains (presumably football
"specials" arranged by British Rail).

I am not sure what the division of responsibility is between the British
Transport Police and the South Yorkshire Police (if any) but, in any case,
perhaps you would kindly let me have your consents on the present request
by British Rail.

                                     Yours faithfully,

 REPORT OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE                                       WORKING GROUP ON THE EFFECT OF
                                                                 PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL ON THE

                                           TERMS OF REFERENCE

 The Police Committee on 1st November passed the following Resolution, which
 was confirmed by the County Council on 24th November

" RESOLVED -

 1.    That it be a recommendation to the Home Office through the Association
 of Metropolitan Authorities that a group from interested organisations be
 appointed to look at a national approach to the football hooliganism problem,
 its cost to the community, the charges which should be levied upon football
 clubs for policing, and other solutions to make the game more acceptable to
 the community at large.

 2.     That, in the meantime, a small group representing Members of the Police
 Authority and of the County Council, the Police, the Chief Executive, the
 County Treasurer and the Football Clubs be constituted to examine:-

 (a)    charges for police services in South Yorkshire, particularly where
        attendances fall below an agreed pre-determined level, and

 (b)    a closer co-operation between the football clubs and the police to
         stimulate and encourage young persons towards an interest in the
        Clubs and to break away from hooliganism at and associated with
         football matches.

3.     That the Chief Constable's initiative in drawing the attention of the
football clubs to the action which may be taken by the police for misbehaviour
on the football field be fully supported."

Part 1 of the Resolution has been taken up through the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, and Parts 2(a) and (b) represent the Working Group's
terms of reference.

 PROPOSED 1982/3 CRITERIA


 CRITERIA FOR LEVYING CHARGES FOR POLICE SERVICES


 The amount levied for police personnel doing duty in the stadium will
 be related to crowd-attendance and the incorporation of a constant basic
 number. At all times this basic number will be one Sergeant and five
 Constables. The number of Constables will be increased by three for
 each 2,000 spectators. The number of Sergeants will be increased in the
 ratio of one to every nine Constables. A charge will be levied for the
 services of an Inspector for a gate over 9,000 and will be increased by
 an additional Inspector for every four Sergeants. In addition, there
 will be a charge for a Chief Inspector whenever the spectator attendance
 reaches or exceeds 35»000 and for a Superintendent whenever the gate
 exceeds 49,000. The chart below illustrates this criteria.

These charges will be at the Special Services Rate applicable at the time.

Should a match be cancelled at short notice whereby police expenditure is
necessarily incurred, a basic charge will not be levied but a report will
be submitted to the Assistant Chief Constable (Management Services) for
negotiations with the Secretary of the club for reasonable reimbursement.

Introduction



     While the behaviour of a minority of football spectators in Britain

continues to be a source of grave concern to the authorities and the

footballing and non-footballing public alike, in recent years it has

been the beha:viour of British, particularly English,   fans abroad which

has been perceived to be most damaging to our national image.      The

recent performances of some English fans abroad have even led the European

football authorities to consider a complete ban on English clubs and the

national side from international competitions.      At a time wher. some

League clubs are in dire financial straits and the game itself'is battling

against the effects of an economic depression which has had repercussions

at the turnstiles, such a move might well have crippling consequences for

the English game.



     While it is undoubtedly true that English fans are now preceded into

Europe by their reputations, it is also the case that the problem of

spectator violence at football matches is by no means confined to our own

shores.   Nevertheless, English fans are at the moment probably justifiably

regarded as the betes-noires in and around continental football stadia.

Apart from a very small number of largely anecdotal writings on the

subject, however, there is at present only very limited data available

on, inter a l i a , the social backgrounds of the youths and other supporters

who typically travel abroad in support of their favourite club or the

national side.      Furthermore, beyond occasional references in the press

to ’’provocation" on the part of home spectators, there is little objective

data available about the build-up to serious terrace disorders involving

English fans on the continent or in other foreign contexts.



     Given the "news valute" attached by the British press to the poor

behavioiir, in particular, of English spectators, it is perhaps unsurprising
that newspaper reports are seldom able to provide comprehensive and

detached accounts of crowd behaviour and crowd control at European ties

involving English clubs.             The methodological difficulties involved in

monitoring crowd behaviour and crowd control should not be underestimated,

'of course.      They probably account, in large measure, for the relative

lack of any sustained, systematic academic research in this field.                      It

is our view, however, that the undoubted difficulties in this area should

not lead to premature conclusions that such work is impractical.                  We are

of the view that the presence at such events of a trained and skilled

participant observer          is both desirable and necessary in order to provide

information       of a more reliable and objective kind than that towhich               we

have previously been accustomed.                Kluckhohn describes the aims   of the

method of participant o b s e r v a t i o n ,t h u s :

                    The purpose is to obtain data about behaviour
                    through direct contact and in terms of specific
                    situations in which the distortion that results
                    from the investigator's being an outside agent
                    is reduced to a minimum. ^


This description of method seems relevant to the aims of what we might'

 call the 'international'         dimension of the Football Trust crowd behaviour

project based at Leicester.              The following account of events leading up

 to and during the European Cup Final tie between Aston Villa and Bayern

Munich played in Rotterdam is based on the observations of a trained

 researcher who travelled to Holland for the game as an "ordinary" Aston

Villa supporter, remaining inconspicuous even to the extent of wearing an

Aston Villa football shirt at the match.                 It is the first of a numoer

 of continental assignments the Leicester group are undertaking for the

Football Trust.         At the end of the research period we are optimistic

 that, coupled with the information we expect to obtain from a number of

surveys we plan to carry out of football fans who travel abroad, our

observations will be useful in the construction of policy initiatives

designed to minimise hooliganism by English fans abroad.      To this end,

we have included, in the form of a summary at the end of this paper, some

preliminary ideas on how the problem might best be tackled, based upon

our experiences in Rotterdam.


1.   The final tie of the European Club Champions Cup played at the

Feyenoord Stadium, Rotterdam on Hay 26, 1982 , brought together Aston

Villa, the champions of the English First division, and Bayern Munich,

the premier club side in V/est Germany.   The meeting promised to be a rather

more entertaining affair than those which followed the final of 1977

when, coincidentally, another English club, Liverpool, accounted for the

Germans of Borussia Munchen Gladbach by three goals to one.     Since then,

the European Final had been characterised largely by stereotyped, negative

play and a succession of one-nil scorelines in favour of English, clubs

against continental opponents.    Both Villa and Bayern were, however,

sides .renowned more for the quality of their attacking play than for the

sureness of their respective defences.    Most football commentators

predicted an exciting encounter, liberally sprinkled with what the tele­

vision pundits describe as 'goal-mouth incidents' and, more importantly,

a fair share of goals.


     Off the field, there was ai^o a sense of anticipation as the match

approached, but of a rather different kind.    Crowd trouble was widely

feared.   English fans, in particular, are not the most welcome guests on

the continent at the present time.    The Final tie itself had already been

scarred on a number of occasions by the misbehaviour of English fans,

notably that involving Leeds United in Paris in 1975 and Liverpool in

the same city in 1981.   vMoreover, these constituted just two examples

from a long string of incidents involving English spectators in Europe
which stretched back to the early 1 9 6 0 's and which characterised support

of the national team as well as that of English club sides during this

period.      In short, as we stated in the introduction, English fans are

currently the betes-noires in continental football circles, and under­

standably so.


        The Dutch authorities, in particular, had their own very special

reasons for being wary of English spectators.       Back in May, 1974 in

the same Feyenoord Stadium earmarked for the European Club Final eight

years later, Spurs fans had run amok during their side's EUFA Cup Final

defeat by the home club.      The visiting English fans had caused thousands

of pounds worth of damage in the stadium and its surrounding areas and

had set about local fans with bottles and sticks, incurring the dis­

pleasure of the Dutch riot police (MR) in the process.          It was a lesson

which was not lost on the people of Rotterdam or the Dutch authorities.

When Spurs fans returned in 1981 to play the Ajax club of Amsterdam,

they brought with them what The Sun described as the "sub-zero" reputation

of British fans, a reputation which induced the introduction of

                  mobile sin bins, commando police, plain
                  clothes officials and dog and horse patrols...
                  added to the normal security at the Olympic
                  stadium

                                          (The S u n , 11 September, 1 9 8 1 )


        Reports of incidents'which occurred before and after the match, however,

suggested that travelling Spurs 'hard cases' had more than enough to cope

with away from the suffocating security arrangements employed at the Ajax

ground.      In Amsterdam itself, groups of local black youths, sometimes

200 strong, were reported to be attacking and robbing visiting English

fans.      In one incident at the central railway station, three Spurs fans

had been stabbed and one thrown through a shop window in what one local

policeman described as a "vicious and bloody fight" which "the Tottenham

fans did not start", but which resulted, nevertheless, in the deportation
 of 28 London fans. (Evening Standard, 17 September, 1 9 8 1 )


      Such incidents were not merely isolated accounts of some latter-day

 Dutch resistance movement aimed, this time, at the invading English.

^ The domestic football scene in Holland was far from free of th.e affects

 of football-related hooliganism, as witnessed by the Dutch preoccupation

 with mazes of   fences and moats which, at many grounds, separate spectators

 from the playing area.   Despite our own preoccupation        with    the problems

 of the control of British fans, some reports of spectator disorder in the

 Netherlands have even surfaced recently in the British press.             In

 November, 1 9 8 1 , for example, The Daily Mirror was repcrting that:

                 Hooliganism on the terraces is becoming a
                 major factor among the many reasons put
                 forward for a slump in Dutch attendances.
                 A new and frightening element was intro­
                 duced over the weekend when a Molotov
                 cocktail hurled from the crowd injured
                 Feyenoord goalkeeper Joope Hiele in the
                 game with NEC

                                          (The Daily M i r r o r , 10 November, 1981)

Later in the season, in April 1 9 8 2 , the 6 en Haag ground in the country's

 capital was reported to have been set on fire by football vandals,

 causing damage estimated at £250,000.     (The T i m e s , 6 April, 1 9 8 2 ).   In

that same month (April 1 9 8 2 ), in Belgium, Aston Villa fans were busy

booking themselves an even warmer reception from the authorities for the

Final in Rotterdam than they might have otherwise had legitimate cause to

expect as English representatives in European competition.



     Villa, in their first year in the European Cup competition,had

travelled widely up to the semi-final stage of the tournament.             Trips to

Iceland, the Soviet Union and East Germany in earlier rounds of the

competition, had served to keep the number of travelling Villa fans and,

hence, the potential for spectator disorder to a minimum.             The short

trip to Anderlecht in Belgium for the second leg of the semi-final tie,
 however, provided the opportunity for a large number of Vilia fans to

 follow their side into Europe for virtually the first time.    Accordingly,

 Villa officials attempted to obtain some basic assurances from Belgian

 officials before the match at Anderlecht, concerning arrangements for

, travelling Villa fans.   There were problems at the outset.   "We feared

 there would be trouble", commented Villa secretary Steve Stride.

 "Anderlecht officials looked on in amazement when we asked that rival

 supporters be strictly segregated."   (Guardian, 23 April, 1982).

 Officials from Manchester United had been similarly apprehensive in 1977

 before the away leg of a Cup Winners Cup tie in St. Etienne.    In France,

 taunts about a bread strike, then in full swing in England, had played

 a part in starting the disturbances on unsegregated goal-end terraces

 before the game.    In Anderlecht it was reported that taunts about the

 Argentinians had preceded the fighting which resulted in a stoppage in

 play of some six minutes as fans spilled onto the playing area (Daily

 Telegraph, 23 April, 1982).    Significantly, Charles Burgess of The

 Guardian commented in this connection that:   "It must also be said that

 a small group of Anderlecht supporters on the terraces behind the goal

 seempd intent on violence too." (The Guardian, 23 April, 1982).


      It seems inevitable that unfamiliar or non-existent policies con­

 cerning the segregation of rival fans in continental stadia will continue

 to be a source of grave concern to the English football authorities.       In

 support of their European neighbours1 reluctance to act in this regard,

 some English officials point to the glaring lack of crowd disorders when

 continental fan? visit our own shores.    Which is a little like arguing

 that we in England do not have a football spectator problem by considering

 in isolation the good behaviour of English fans at the bi-annual meeting

 with the Scots at Hampden.    In both cases, it seems likely that it is

 the "reputation" of the home support which acts as one of the principal

 deterrents to potential visiting 'troublemakers'.    At Anderlecht, Villa
instructed their travelling club stewards to stand between the rival fan

groups on the terraces when the club realised that the Belgians refused

to ensure that there would be formal divisions between home fans and

their guests.      Their efforts were probably instrumental in containing

the disturbances which did occur, although they could do nothing to

contain the exaggerated accounts of the disorders which emerged later in

the press as Anderlecht strove to be reinstated in the competition at

Villa's expense.


        After the game, Villa officials were adamant in their claims that

none of the offending "supporters" had travelled with the official Villa

Travellers Club party of 2,000 fans which had arrived from England a

matter of hours before the kick-off in Belgium.        In this connection The

Daily Telegraph reported that

                  during the 2k hours preceding the match,
                  several hundred (Villa fans) arrived in­
                  dependently - many drunk and looking for
                  a fight - and obtained black market tickets
                  in cafes near the ground

                                           (The Daily Telegraph, 23 April, 1982)

Later, Anderlecht's secretary Michael Verscheurun confirmed that
                                                               V

                 the only tickets sold to Britons went to
                 Villa but there were many sales points
                 within Brussels where anyone could have
                 bought as many tickets as they liked

                                           (The Guardian, 2k April, 1982)
                           ^               1       1 1 1   1



Villa's position with regard to the likely travel plans of offending fans

in Anderlecht, had parallels with the experience of West Heim officials

following the disturbances in Madrid,which occurred towards the end of

1980.     'On that occasion, none of the arrested London visitors were

registered as members of the major travelling group of fans organised

by the West Ham club.      Villa officials blamed the disturbances in Ander­

lecht on the activities of* part of a group of 600 fans who did not travel

with the official party.       Significantly, Villa officials claimed that
not all of those involved in the troubles actually came from the Midlands,

despite the fact that eight fans arrested inside the stadium were, indeed,

Midlanders.       Villa Vice-Chairman, Don Bendall, later argued Jljat "many

behind the goal where the trouble had flared hp.d cdckney accents."      (The

Guardian, 2b April, 1982), although the source o£ this information was

not made clear.       Tony Barton, the Aston Villa manager lamented the fact

that "anyone can put on a Villa scarf and cause trouble and then in the

eyes of EUFA be a Villa supporter" (The Guardian, 1 May, 1982).        The

inference of these sorts of arguments - that the Belgian disturbances did

not involve 'true* Villa supporters, but rather alien groups of English

thugs masquerading as Midland fans, who had, in fact, turned up solely

for "aggro" - gained limited support of sorts from the revelation early

in M»y that the Villa "fan" who had run onto the field during play, to be

subsequently knocked unconscious by a policeman as he was being manhandled

out of the ground, was, in fact, a Scottish soldier on leave from Germany.

(The Guardian, 2k April, 19 82 ).


     Again, "the forces problem" is by no means new to English club sides

playing abroad.       Many matches in which they have been involved have

attracted the attentions of British servicemen serving away from home.

Unleashed temporarily from the constraints of service life, their shifting

attachments to British sides have occasionally been expressed in terms

unacceptable to the game's ruling bodies.        Notable in this context, for

example, was the brawling which occurred on the field and on the terraces

between British soldiers and German spectators during a 'friendly1 match

between S.V. Hamburg and Manchester United during the English club's pre­

season European tour back in August, 19&5 (Daily Telegraph, 9 August,

1965).
              !                                           •

     Notwithstanding the mitigating circumstances which Villa submitted
                                                                       9.


to EUFA officials in their defence, the British club was apprehensive

about the outcome of an enquiry into the incidents at Anderlecht.

EUFA secretary, Hans Bangerter was already recommending that English

clubs should be banned from European competition, and F.A. secretary

Croker admitted that "we must be getting very close to it."      (The Times,

23 April, 1982).      It was, then, with some relief that Villa officials

received the news from the EUFA Disciplinary Committee that the English

club was not to be expelled from the competition as demanded by Belgian

representatives.      Their punishment was still a severe one.   The Aston

Villa club was fined £14,500 and ordered to play their next two home

matches in European competition in front of empty terraces and stands.

In terms of gate receipts alone the club is liable to lose something in

excess of £300,000 as a result of the Belgian affair.



2.    As fans of the Aston Villa club were stirring the European football

authorities into retributive action following the scenes in Anderlecht-,

the behaviour of supporters of Bayern Munich, their prospective German

opponents in Rotterdam, was causing more than a little concern to the

German authorities.     The 1981/82 Bundesliga programme had started

violently in August with Stuttgart fans causing £20,000 worth of damage

at Karlsruhe, behaviour which led to twenty arrests, and which echoed

the problems of the previous league season when fans of the Hertha Club

of Berlin had set fire to and destroyed three railway carriages en route

to a match in Aachen (The Guardian, 26 January, 1981).


     In April 1982, immediately following the troubling scenes involving

Villa fans in Belgium, West German police were reported to have seized

truncheons, heavy chains.and "other lethal weapons" from supporters

entering the Olympic Stadium
                          V\
                             in Munich for the match between Bayern ana

,5.V. Hamburg.   Other fans were arrested for attempted robbery* and police
                                                                    10.


were reported to have used truncheons and tear gas to break up riots

after the game.     (The Times, 26 April, 1982)


     All these incidents paj^d^ 'aowever, in comparison with those which

occurred in Frankfurt on May 3i 1982, before, during and after the West

German Cup Final between Bayern and Nilrnberg.      Before the match began,

police used water cannon to disperse fighting fans who then "rampaged

through the city centre, smashing shop windows and attacking a Trade Union

May Day March, giving Nazi salutes and chanting *Sieg Heill* "      Incidents

which continued throughout the day finally accounted for figures of 92

arrests ar*ct 138 persons treated for injuries.     (The Guardian, The Times,

3 May, 1982).      With an eye both to the meeting of Villa and Bayern fans

in Rotterdam some three weeks later, and to the expressed anxiety of the

Dutch and EUFA officials about the behaviour of the English contingent in

Holland, English F.A. Secretary, Croker, issued a timoly reminder to

the sport's governing bodies about the decidedly international flavour of

football crowd disorderliness.      He commented:

                  We are reminding EUFA and the Dutch Football
                  Association not to look at crowd trouble as
                  purely an English problem.   (At Frankfurt)
                  there were incidents and disturbances far in
                  excess of anything we have seen over here.
                     Our reputation goes before us when we have
                  a game abroad these days.   Inevitably that
                  means there is a certain provocation.   But it
                  is a reputation we have deserved.   One we have
                  got to live down.

                                          (Daily Mirror, 7 May, 1982)

Despite Croker's admonishment, however, EUFA had begun preparations for

Rotterdam with an air of resolve and determination clearly fuelled by
                                                                    v
the past performances of English fans in Europe.       In April, Rene Eberle,

Secretary of EUFA's Disciplinary Committee, assured Villa officials that

the European football authorities, "will have to insist that there is

complete segregation in Rotterdam and that no tickets are sold to anybody

but the clubs" (The Guardian, 23 April, 1982).       Just over a week later,
however, the commercial realities of a situation which would have left

the stadium housing the Final of Europe's premier club competition half-

empty for the event, led Eberle and EUFA to think again.          The Secretary

of EUFA conceded, again with apparent scant regard for the reputation of

Bayern fans:

                  We can only control the sale of tickets up
                  to a limit.    We fear there could be trouble
                  again in Rotterdam.    If there is,, the
                  punishments will get stiffer and stiffer,
                  until the only situation is to kick out
                  British clubs.

                                          (The Guardian, 1 May, 1982,
                                          .italics added)

In the weeks before the Final and in accordance with EUFA recommendations,

each of the clubs involved received an allocation of 14,000 tickets for

the match.      With the Feyenoord Stac’ium all-seated apart from two small

standing terraces at either end of the ground, less than 20^ of each

club's ticket allocation was reserved for standing spectators.         The

Feyenoord Stadium has a capacity of 5 6 ,000.


        The Aston Villa club linked the whole of their ticket allocation

to officially accredited package tours by coach, train and plane organised

by the travel firm, David Dryer Ltd through the Aston Villa Traveller's

Club.     The Traveller's Club had been established by Villa in an attempt

to monitor and control the behaviour of the club's followers abroad.

Each club member is required to submit two passport-size photographs and

is issued, in turn, with a club membership card which may be confiscated

in the event of misbehaviour.      By making match tickets hard to come by

in England outside the Travel Club arrangements, EUFA and Villa officials

hoped to be able to account for almost all the club's travelling support.

In effect, of course, there existed serious leakage points in the system.

Soon* tickets for the match not linked to the Villa tours began to surface

in England.     A number of London-based travel agencies were reported to be
offering all-inclusive tours to Rotterdam complete with match tickets.

A spokesman for one firm involved claimed that the high cost of these

excursions made them unattractive to potential 'hooligans'.      More

ominous, perhaps, than the news of these luxury tours, were

stories emerging from Holland as the date of the Final approached, that

blocks of up to 50 tickets for the game were being bought up and brought

to England to satisfy a thirsty 'black market' and private demand.        This
                                                 1



was despite previous assurances from Dutch officials that applicants

in Holland would receive just two tickets per person for the Final.

Keit'i Smith, Secretary of the Aston Villa Traveller's Club, recounted

the story of a telephone conversation he had had with a 'cockney' Villa

fan who had, inadvertently it seemed, secured a match ticket for entrance

into the small standing terrace reserved exclusively for German supporters.


     In addition to these ticket sources, further reports from Holland

suggested that local pre-match ticket sales had been poor, which meant

that, despite EUFA's fears about the inadequate segregation of opposing

fans, match tickets were liable to be available in Rotterdam immediately

prior to the game.      Poor ticket sales, of course, are always liable

to be a possibility when, as in this case, the Final was to be played

in a neutral country.     All these factors were probably also significant

.in contributing to a shortfall in expected public response to the package

deals offered by Aston Villa, despite their vury low cost.       About 4000

tickets of the Villa club's original allocation were returned to Rotterdam

a few days before the match.      If 'rogue' fans were able to purchase

tickets freely in Holland or elsewhere, then the club was keen to ensure

that tickets for the 'Villa only' sections, of the ground were available

to satisfy this potentially disruptive demand.       Indications later,

especially from reported ferry traffic between Harwich and the Hook of

Holland, suggested that somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 persons claiming
to be Villa fans travelled to the game by means other than that offered

by the Villa Club.



3.   There are very many reasons, of course, why the officially accredited

trips to Holland organised by the Aston Villa club might be unattractive

to would-be followers be they well behaved or otherwise.      The coach and

rail tours, for example, promised to be singularly arduous for the in­

experienced or reluctant traveller.     Overnight accommodation was guaranteed

in Holland for only the most expensive packages, and so on.      In addition

to these 'traditional* limitations on freedom of choice and movement on

continental football packages, a further disincentive to potential Travel

Club patrons was clearly Villa's plans to ensure that coaches, ferries,

buses and planes remained 'dry' for the duration of the trip.     Such

arrangements, of course, were much in accordance with the widely expressed

connections which are taken to exist between the consumption of large

quantities of drink and the incidence of crowd disorderliness at football

matches, both at home and abroad.     Such fears are, perforce, heightened

by the vir-its of British fans to the continent during which they are

confronted with a plethora of alcoholic beverages of a variety, strength

and price with which they are perhaps unfamiliar in this country.        'Booze-

activated louts' was how Shadow Sports Minister Howell had described erring

Tottenham fans in Amsterdam the pievious September.     'Drunk and looking

for a fight' had been The Daily Telegraph's assessment of some of Villa's

followers in Anderlecht.   The cJub had since decided to act.


     With Villa pledging to enforce what amounted to an alcohol embargo

on Travel Club members en route to Holland, it was not without a sense

of irony that the club should choose this time to announce a new and

lucrative sponsorship deal with the Midlands brewery group, Davenports.

The club shirts would ca riry the names of their new sponsors in non­

televised League and Cup matches over the following Football League season.
This sense of irony was in no way lightened by the fact that a female

interloper, fined for a revealing display on the field during a recent

Rugby Union international match, was chosen to advertise the new deal

in local newspapers,   (The Birmingham Post, 20 May, 1982),       Since her

arresting pitch •invasion*, the lady in question had moved on to ever

more lucrative projects as shown by her contract with Villa and a variety

of television and press appearances.        Her experiences were in direct

contrast, of course, to those of a Scottish serviceman, with a similar

penchant for public displays at major sporting events.         His unscheduled

arrival on the pitch at Anderlecht had contributed to the near-expulsion

of Villa from the European Cup competition, and he had since been

'disciplined* by his regiment.        Incidentally, neither the model nor the

soldier appear to have been restrained in their drinking before their

unscheduled appearances.        Quite the opposite, in fact.    In conclusion

one might say that there seemed to be more than a hint of 'double standard

about the club's approach to their latest commercial venture.


     As it turned out, in fact, the Villa guidelines on the control of

alcohol consumption by Travel Club members were probably more effective

in ensuring that potential 'hooligan' fans sought other means of transport

to Rotterdam than they were in actually preventing drinking at selected

points during the arduous road or rail journey to Rotterdam.         For example

and contrary to what had been understood at the outset, the bars and duty

free shops on the cross-channel ferries were open to Villa fans on both

the outward and return journeys.        By choosing a Dover - Calais ferry

crossing, however, rather than a more direct route crossing from Harwich

to the Kook of Holland, the time available for drinking was reduced quite

dramatically, although the journey time itself was perforce considerably

extended.
                           \v




The fact that the duty-free ferry shop was open during the Travel Club

Dover - Calais crossing, appeared to take many fans by surprise, and the
                                                                   15.


shop was much under-utilised for the purposes of drinking on the outward

journey.   This was in sharp contrast to the brisk business being done

by the bars on the same ferry from 0?00 hrs onwards.    The threat of a

'stop and search' policy on reboarding coaches in France, seemed sufficient

to deter fans from 'stocking up' with spirits for the journey through

France, Belgium and Holland.


     Nevertheless, the widespread beer drinking and, in some cases, wine

drinking exploits of fans in the early hours of Wednesday morning clearly

caused some consternation among the regular holiday traffickers who had

neither endured the drive by coach through the night from Birmingham, nor

were locked in preparation for the major events which were to occur in

Rotterdam later that evening.


     Characteristically on continental sojourns of th?s kind, with bars

offering service during what, from an English standpoint, are 'unsocial*

drinking hours and the regular constraints on the consumption of alcohol -

mediated, for example, by the requirements of sleep, attendance at work etc.

temporarily suspended, drinking may be regarded as an appropriate form of

beha/iour at almost any waking hour.    Drinking out of regular hours also,

of course, represents the final break from day-to-day routines which, in

turn, serves to distinguish the continental match excursion as an event

and to place it in sharp jrelief to the whole gamut of 'regular', domestic,

social and cultural leisure pursuits.


     It h a s to be admitted, of course, that regardless of the good behaviour

or otherwise of groups of English fans travelling abroad, the image of

"beer-swilling" supporters plying their trade in the early hours of the

morning is almost bound to prejudice or reinforce the casual observer in

his or her attitude towards football fans in general, particularly if

their experience of football match spectating is relatively limited, or
                                                                      16.
                                                                               t



 confined to the television screen or pages of the national press.       All

 that pan be recorded from this particular crossing is that there were

 no obvious cases of drunkenness among Villa fans as we disembarked from

 the ferry in Calais.     However, conversations later with Villa fans who

- had returned to England via the Hook of Holland - Harwich link after

 the game, suggested that scenes on that particular journey were rather

 more unsavoury.
                                                  i




 k*   The Villa club, as we had been reminded almost constantly by the

 British press in the days before the Final, carried with them the hopes,

 not only of fans of Aston Villa and the Midlands, but also those of the

 country as a whole.    Villa, after all was attempting to maintain an

 English run of success in the competition which had kept the European

 trophy in this country for the past five seasons.       It had been widely

 suggested, too, that a victory in Rotterdam would boost confidence in the

 England World Cup camp as they prepared for the Final stages of the

 competition to be played in Spain.     In addition, the prospects of travel

 through the unfamiliar    territories of the French, the Belgians and the

 Dutch - for some fans possibly for    the first time - meant thatmany Villa

 fans, too, were keen to adopt a corporate identity at the national level

 over and above their regular club and regional affiliations.       Union Jacks,

 for example, were much    in evidence among travelling V?_lla fans,although

 in some cases the name    of the club was superimposed across thenational

 emblem.   (The flag is, rather misleadingly, meant to emphasise English

 rather than British solidarities.     The Irish, Scots and Welsh, with a

 heightened sense of nationalism, particularly in relation to the English,

 invariably favour their own national emblems.        The cross of St. George,

 by way of contrast, is singularly absent as a source of identity among

 English fans despite their, lack of empathy with the other home countries.)
      The high degree of nationalism which is invariably excited by trips

 of this sort, was undoubtedly heightened on this occasion by the events

 in the South Atlantic.      Indeed, before leaving Villa Park early on

 Wednesday morning, by far the noisiest and most passionate displays of

. national sentiment among young male fans were concerned with the British

 Forces' military victories in the Falkland Islands.     Versions of "Rule

 Britannia!" were lustily delivered by a group of about fifty young men,
                                                   /


 along with the more direct and more vociferous, "We only hate Argentina!",

 and a variety of complicated adaptations of traditional football songs

 to the cause in the South Atlantic.     At their height, feelings were

 most fervently expressed in an expedient reworking of the old sea shanty,

 "What shall we do with the drunken sailor?", which had become "What shall

 we do with the Argentinians?" inviting the rhetorical reply "Bomb, bomb

 Buenos Aires!" and so on.


      Although it might be both dangerous and even misleading to make too

 much of the point, it was difficult to avoid the uncomfortable feeling

 that some fans observed clear parallels between the British mission in the

 Falklands and the European 'manoeuvres’ involving the Aston Villa Club and

 her fans, in presumed hostile territories, over the next 36 hours.       Indeed,

 amidst the nationalist fervour generated outside Villa Park about the

 Falklands crisis, attention would occasionally return to the matters more

-immediately at hand, although, these moves did little to raise the general

 tenor of wordsmanship.   Bayern fans, for example, would need to steel

 themselves against taunts like, "Two World Wars and a World Cup too", a

 reference to what some travelling Villa fans took to be^ the last three

 major engagements of the two countries.     One feared for what the German

 fans might produce, particularly after the reported stimuli for the events

 in Anderlecht.   Clearly, too, the Falkland crisis and the feelings it

 engenders, particularly, one suspects among young working class males,
is a factor which will have to be carefully monitored throughout the

World Cup tournament in Spain.


     These nationalistic themes which, in practice, revolved around the

ritual degradation of foreign cultures and territories in opposition to

the sanctity of shared domestic cultural experiences, were taken up almost

immediately we set foot on foreign soil.     The group of young male
                                                  ;
supporters who had established themselves towards the rear of the coach

on which I travelled to Lhe game, v/ere soon deriding all and sundry as we

moved away from the ferry terminal at Calais.         Young men from the

industrial heart of the Midlands were less than impressed with the delights

of rural France and Belgium ("This country's a right 'ole innit?           It's

all countryside.   Boringi")     Local males who watched with puzzled

expressions as our convoy passed were invariably labelled as "wankers",

(i.e. less than 'real' men).      Those who had the perspicacity to identify

the purpose of our trip and pledge their support with a wave or a clenched

fist^ were greeted with tlie same.    Young women attracted most attention •

of all, with the least attractive added to a growing fund of 'evidence'

of the cultural supremacy of the visitors. " Those admired for their looks

were loudly and crudely informed of the benefits of an instant liaison with

English lads, so briefly in town.


     On an impressionistic level, the majority of Travel Club members

who made the trip to Rotterdam were male* aged between 16 and 30 years

and probably drawn from the upper sections of the working class.           There

was a liberal sprinkling of groups of older spectators in the party and

a few younger fans, usually accompanied by adults.         Female fans made up

perhaps 2S& of the Villa contingent.     Most of the females present appeared

to be accompanied by boyfriends or husbands.      Finally, given the racial

mix of the Birmingham area, there were surprisingly few fans of "New

Commonwealth" origins in the sample.      Given the co-operation promised by
the Aston Villa club, it should be possible to obtain more detailed

information on Travel Club members via a survey of those registered with

the Villa project.


     If the overnight journey to Dover had been arduous, the coach journey

from Calais to the Feyenoord stadium was taxing in the extreme.        Our

cause on coach 26 (out of 2 9) was ill-assisted by the efforts of our

English 'navigator' who managed to direct the driver wrongly no fewer than

three times.     As a result of this fact, we fell behind schedule and con­

sequently our only stop of any length during an 8 hour trip from Calais

to Rotterdam was one oi‘ about 20 minutes on the French/Belgian border.

Those among us who had recovered sufficiently from the morning's ordeal

took the opportunity to aid revival with a few more beers.        Experienced

campaigners had had the foresight to remove their shoes during the coach

journey which prevented undue swelling of the feet.      A man who had

brought a pillow to smooth his passage was no longer the subject of

derision for the rest of the party.      It was a very hot day for a very

long coach journey.


     Most of the occupants of coach 26 attempted to catch up or. some

sleep through Belgium and Holland, despite the discomforts of the heat

and cramped conditions.    As we eventually neared the city of Rotterdam,

however, and came across more and more fellow journeymen, the coach became

more animated.    Passing English fans in cars, mini-buses and vans hooted

their allegiance as they passed.      We waved or shouted ours.    Bayern fans,

passing by in luxury coach or car, were roundly abused by the lads at

the back who persistently urged the driver to "catch up the German bastards"

so that the exchange of the international sign language of abuse might

continue - two fingers from the English, raised second finger from the

Germans.   The lavishnes&.of the German travel arrangements, with their

de-luxe motor coaches and Mercedes and Audi cars, were roundly condemned
as a sure sign of "stuck up cunts" with all the pejorative attributes the

label implies.     The Villa lads were celebrating their own real sacrifices

made in order to attend the final.       (At least two from coach 26 were

unemployed and had 'borrowed' money from their parents to make the trip.)

The Germans, by comparison were not 'real' fans at all, or so the argument

went.


        The appearance of the Feyenoord Stadium floodlights in the near-

distance had almost the entire coach singing the current European anthems:

"When Den (Denis Mortimore, the Villa captain) goes up, to lift the

European Cup, we'll be there, we'll be there!", and "Rotterdam; Rotterdam!

Well we're all pissed up and we're gonna win the Cupi"       The more .

'respectable' and older fans towards the front of the coach baulked a little

at some of the cruder lyrics and, when appropriate, provided some 'toned-

down' accounts.      Dutch motor cycle police arrived quickly to cscort us

to the stadium's coach parks.      The stems which rose from the rear of

their machines gave them the appearance of having been recently removed

from a fairground ride.      More derision from the lads at the back.     We had

all heard about the levels of policing in operation for this game.        •Our

first sight of these helmeted guards with their flashing lights hadn't

impressed.      "Pigs" were mentioned.


        As the Dutch authorities had promised, the coach parks backed onto

the stadium itself.      German carc and coaches had clearly been skilfully

directed by the local constabulary to vehicle parks, around tho other side

of the stadium.      Segregation so far had been impressive.    The arrange­

ments were very similar to those practised by the V/est Midlands force to

cope with the influx of opposing groups of spectators at Cup semi-finals

at Villa Park.      Here, as in Birmingham, opposing fans were directed by

the police to opposite approaches to the stadium and instructed to park

accordingly.      The offer of Midlands' expertise in this matter had
evidently been embraced by the local force, and with no small measure

of success.


     Our b p.m. arrival at the Feyenoord Stadium gave us four hours of

'preparation' before kick off.      We were instructed by our Stewards

(off-duty police personnel;      Villa had rewarded them v/ith free travel

and match tickets for their pains) to return to the coach park one half
                                                  r

hour after the match had ended.      There would be neither time for

celebrating, comrniseraticnnor retribution, in Holland at least.     Some

fans, notably the older groups and those with female companions or

children, chose simply to stay in the immediate vicinity of the stadium,

lounging on the many grass verges until kick off approached.       Kost others

decided that some liquid refreshment before the match was required.         With

the city centre too far distant to engage most people's interest, the

search began for a bar closer to home.      Across a major road to the west

of the stadium, the Feyenoord Football Club's extensive sports      grounds

offered facilities for tennis, football and squash.      In addition,

the grounds harboured a couple of pleasant bars but ten minutes walk from

the’stadium.    The bars appeared to be attracting the custom of groups

of Villa and Bayern fans alike, and so these locations offered a useful

base for some pre-match observations.


     Outside the first bar, Villa fans of all ages, bedecked in scarves,

hats and club shirts moved comfortably with German fans in similar attire.

Information from English fans who lay on the grass outside about the

available drinks suggested that the order of the day was six, small (plastic)

glarses of lager "for under two quid”.     On the football pitch nearby,

some Villa lads were already embarked on an impromptu match, complete with

running commentaries from those fans,who watched from the side of the

playing area.   Occasionally, a police car drove slowly past to monitor

the situation, keeping in tune with what appeared to be a general policy

of maintaining a 'low profile'.
        Inside the bar, a group of about ten Bayern fans, probably aged          p

between J>0 and 3 5 » were already ensconced on the right hand side of the

main room.      Each wore a Bayern football shirt, some had red and white

Bayern scarves.      A group of about 30 Villa fans, in club shirts, hats

and some bare-chested, watched the antics of the Germans with some amuse­

ment.      With each new influx of Villa supporters, the Germans responded

with a barrage of club songs and chants including, "C'mon you Redsi",
                                                  •   i



clearly a memento from Bayern's many meetings with Liverpool over the

years.      This response surprised the Villa lads, short on German replies.

Judging from the towers of plastic* glasses near the Bayern grou^, their

'preparations' had begun some time before our own.


        Soon, "chant leaders" on each side had become informally established

and, despite the protestations of the serving staff, they began to lead

their "choirs" from precarious positions on top of bar tables.       With

Villa fans threatening to overwhelm the German effort, however, more

Bayern 'reinforcements' arrived in the shape of a group of about twenty

younger fans.      Their appearance was more immediately threatening than

that.of their compatriots in the bar.       In their late teens or early

twenties, almost all of the group wore a uniform of a sleeveless denim

jacket with Bayern insignia between the shoulder blades.       Kany wore

studded leather belts, and some wore studded leather wristbands, in

addition to a variety of "scarves, shirts and emblems in club colours of

red and white.      A few of the new German contingent wore heavy leather

boots similar to the Doc Martins favoured by some British fans.       In

contrast to the fashionable shorter hairstyles of most of the younger

Villa, fans, many of the Bayern lads wore their hair quite long.      In fact,

their entire appearance represented something of an atavistic reminder of

a hooligan style widely popular ii^ England in the early to mid-1970's.
                            V   x

The closest approximation       in this country today to such a style is probably
that reflected in the macho mode of British "heavy metal" rock fans who

are generally supposed to have a poor record of football match attendance.

"Cave men", was how one young Villa fan described these German fans, a

description which captured nicely both the brawny gait of the Germans'

and what the younger Villa fans took to be an outmoded terrace style.


       The appearance of this new group of Bayern faithfuls galvanised the
                                                  /
Villa ranks into ever-shriller self-praise and more penetrating degradation

of the Germans and their country v/ith like responses from the Bayern

contingent.     References to 'World Wars' and 'Argentinians' became more

frequent, which prefaced a few minor drunken scuffles which the bar's

'bouncer' managed to prevent from spreading to the main body of supporters.

With tempers fraying and a serious confrontation looking likely, the

situation was defused when a young Villa fan suggested a match on the

nearby football pitch between, as he put it, "the jerries and the Villa."

It proved an attractive proposition.     The Bayern supporters quickly agreed

that honour should be satisfied outside and we moved back into the sunshine.


       The 'teams' lined up on the Feyenoord junior team pitch, with 'Aston

Villa' playing from left to right from the bar side of the ground.        There

had been no team selection, of course.     Players simply lined up at will,

an arrangement which meant that Villa outnumbered their opponents by about

50^.     At a conservative^estimate, about thirty Villa representatives

took the field against twenty Bayern followers.       Each side was cheered

on by German and English fans who lined thetouchlines.      All in   all, the

entire affair had captured the attention of    about 500 people.


       With so little space for each 'player' to work with, a singular lack

of the usual footballer's garb, and a high level of alcohol in the blood­

stream, neither skills nor gentility were much in     evidence.   It was a

very rough affair, indeed, which lasted for    about an hour but     contained
just one free kick, awarded to themselves, by the Villa lads.       Opposing

players were regularly flattened without ceremony, and throw-ins, corner

kicks and goal kicks were a matter of who reached the ball first when

it left the playing area.       Villa, because of their numerical superiority,

were usually in command in this department.       Under a combination of

pressures of this sort, the German's succumbed to defeat by seven goals

to one.   Someone close by assured me that Gary Shaw had scored a hat-

trick for the victorious English.        A little less dubious was the feeling

that, notwithstanding its inherent roughness, this spontaneous contest

between representative? of opposing factions had, in all probability,

directed the collective attention away from what had promised to be some

rather unsavoury incidents in a bar outside the Feyenoord stadium.


     Elsewhere, however, there had been the inevitable disagreements.

During the match between Bayern and Villa fans, I had been talking to

two bare chested, tattooed Villa fans in their mid-tventies who had

arrived in Amsterdam via ferry on Monday evening to head for what they

described as the City's "red light district".        Two of their group had

"bought” women for twelve pounds for the evening, they told me, and later

they claimed to have been involved in a number of fights with local youths

outside an Amsterdam bar.       The English fans claimed that the Dutch

youths had shouted abuse, at them with references to the Falklands dispute.

It seems very likely that these incidents were similar if not identical

to those reported by the English media before our departure for Holland

on Tuesday (Midlands Today, BBC Television, 25 May, 1982).        The fights

in Amsterdam were recounted here with relish rather than with regret.


     Both of these lads had also been present in Anderlecht during the

semifinal disturbances which, again, they described with some affection.
                        V   x        :


They claimed that there were fans "from all over the place" (i.e. from

all over England) at the game that night who were certainly involved
in the terrace troubles.     I asked if there were any signs of the same

sorts of thing this time and was told of rumours that some "Chelsea

nutcases" had been arrested on the ferry between Harwich and The Hook.

(On our return from Holland, The Guardian reported that a coachload of

London-based fans "dressed in the claret and blue of Villa" and en route

to the match had been turned back by police at the Hook of Holland,

presumably because of suspicions about their motives for travelling.
                                                i

Implicit in the report and the action of the authorities in this case

was the notion that these Southern fans were not, in fact, supporters of

Villa, but rather renegade English followers in search of "aggro".

The Guardian, 27 May* 1982).


     At around 7»15 p»m., fans of all hues began drifting more positive iy

towards the large queues which wpre already forming outside the Feyenoord

stadium.     Again, strict segregation of opposing spectators was clearly

in evidence outside the ground.     A small group of about 20 Villa fans,

approaching the ground from the City (Bayern) end were momentarily the

focal point of an incident during which planks of wood were wielded by

German supporters.     Mounted policemen waded into the area to quell the

affair almost as quickly as it had begun.     The Villa fans remained

within the main phalanx of German support, however, and it was clear that

they had obtained tickets for the Bayern end of the ground.      Around the

Villa queues, £-nall grotfps of young Dutch lads hung around listlessly

and without apparent threat to observe the behaviour of their guests.

I saw just two Villa fans who we^e clearly so much the worse for drink

that it was arguable whether they would be capable of watching the

match.     This figure compares very favourably to the scenes in Rome,

for example, before Liverpool's first European Cup Final against Munchen

Gledbach, when the streets outside the Olympic Stadium were littered

with sleeping Merseysiders who never saw their team's triumph.
                                                                   26 .


     At the turnstiles, all fans were thoroughly frisked by Dutch police

for weapons and alcohol, and a succession of wire fences guided fans

towards their appointed entrances at      opposite ends of the ground.

Birmingham fans who had travelled byrail with the Travel      Club had

been allocated the small number of standing vantage points behind one

goal which had been made available to the Villa club.       All the other

Villa fans who had travelled by coach, air, or under their own steam,
                                                 ;

were seated on upper and lower tiers around the half of the stadium to

the right of the players' tunnel.      Tickets allocated to fans travelling

on coaches in the upper range were for the elevated, uncovered tiers of

the 5 6 ,0 0 0 capacity stadium.


        In the distance, at the far end of the stadium, the knot of standing

Bayern fans danced, chanted and engineered "crowd falls" down the terraces

in a manner which made them hard to distinguish from English goal terrace

fans.      To their right (our left), a group of perhaps 200 Villa fans, no

more, were encamped in a lower-tier seated section in the heart of the

Bayern ranks.      Their position was separated from the Bayern tsrraces by

one block of seated German spectators.      Chants for "Villai" from the

renegade group were instantly met with chantsfor "Argentina!" from        the

German terraces.      An angry surge to   the left towards the terraceswas

the reply of the isolated Villa contingent.       "Sieg Heili", with salutes,

came from sections of the main gathering of Villa supporters at our end

of the stadium.      Dutch police moved in between Villa and Bayern fans

at the German end to calm the situation.      At the mid points of the stadium

where, theoretically, Bayern and Villa fans were most likely to find them­

selves side by side, the police cause had been aided by the shortfall in

ticket sales.      In these sections of the ground there were rows of empty

seats.      A few 'neutrals' did prpvide something of a 'buffer' between
                                   |

opposing factions, although most of the English support collected in the
                                                                      27.


areas of seating immediately behind the goal.      Villa stewards had since

donned their bright orange jackets and were carefully nursing their

charges into position.


     Between the front rows of Villa's standing and terrace support and

the playing surface, lay a succession of impressive obstacles to pitch

invasion.    A heavy metal fence gives way to about 15 metres of concrete

"no-man's land".    This area was patrolled on this occasion by two dog

handlers.    Behind them, a water-filled moat and more fencing surrounded

the entire playing surface.      Ingenuity will out, however.      Before the

start two young Villa fans managed to gain entry to the pitch to perform

a number of pre-match rituals in front of the faithful.         The club scarf

was paraded, kissed and worshipped before they and their apparel were

solemnly removed by the local constabulary.


     Drink (lager) was available in the stadium in plastic half-pint

cartons.    For those with a particularly pressing thr.rst, or friends to

supply, cardboard trays were provided which enabled the carriage of six

drinks at a time up the winding staircases at the back of the stadium.

In 'no-man's land', the small Dutch     ball boys had been won over to Villa's

cause by the gifts of hats and scarves.     They conducted the terrace

choirs in their songs as the plainclothes handlers v/ith their giant

Bouviere de Flandres dogs     eyed us all with suspicion, predictably

puzzled by the array of bare chests, tattoos and the occasional claret

and blue hairstyle which peppered our ranks.     The arrival of the teams

on the field was greeted with rockets from the Germans and firecrackers

from the Villa end, and the Villa stewards turned to watch the game.


     The match itself was not the affair which had been demanded by the

purists.    For all that, it appeared to be painfully exciting and tense

for the thousands of Villa spectators who had travelled tor up to 16
hours to be there to witness the event.     At half-time, the match was

still scoreless.     Villa had had the majority of the possession.

Bayern had had the chances to score.      Villa, however, had already lost

their veteran goalkeeper, Rimmer, through injury.      He was replaced by

the virtual unknown, Spinks, who had performed heroically in the first

half.     Not all the Villa players earned such half-time plaudits.     Peter

Withe, for example, had angered many Villa fans during the first half for

trying to play ntoo fancy” - like the continentals.      The fans wanted

more aggression, more combat, in the second forty-five minutes.       Mean­

while, we were allocated more handlers and dogs who now emerged to surround

the pitch before the interval, presumably to protect the marching bands

who provided the entertainment between the halves.


        At the start of the second half, Bayern lay siege on the Villa goal.

That they did not score was accountable to their own bad luck and the

sterling performance of Spinks in the Villa goal.      Anxiety was beginning

to J)e communicated through the Villa ranks in the stands.     It was

dissipated by chanting and singing which became louder, more desperate

and almost relentless.      Later, fans will remark on the fact that it was

the crowd that had lifted the team.      That it was not anxiety but an

unquenchable will to win which was communicated to the Villa players.

This will be their role in a famous victory.      Some players claim never

to hear the crowd during a game.      Others admit to being swayed in their

performances by supportive or hostile audiences.      Perhaps the Villa side

did have a preponderance of players in the latter category that night.

No matter.      Withe, who had been playing badly, scores.


        The celebrations which ensued in the seated sections of the Feyenoord

stadium housing supporters of Aston Villa were not diminished to any

great extent by the nature of our viewing position.      True, the provision

of seats did mean that Villa fans were unable to engage in the 20 yard
                                                                        29.


 "sways" which may be allowed on half-empty terraces.          But the dancing,

 hugging, falling, pushing, shoving and jumping, characteristic of goal-

 terrace celebrations following the scoring of goals at home in England,

 were all present here.          Indeed, many fans were standing in their seats.

. These seated sections of the ground were simply 'converted' to banks
                If          J)
 of very steep terraces with plastic edgings.          It seemed hardly con­

 ceivable, given the pandemonium which occurred, around me after Withe

 had scored, but no-one near me appeared to sustain an injury during the

 bout of exaggerated exuberance we had all experienced and expressed.


      The final third 01 the match, incredibly given the renewed German

 pressure, produced no further goals to the massive relief of the English

 spectators present.        The tension was so great towards the end of the

 match that some fans were unable to watch the closing minutes of the

 game, choosing instead to leave the stadium or lie along lines of vacant

 seats to stare rigidly at the sky.         It is, of course, difficult to

 predict what the mood cf some sections of the Villa support might haye

 been given a late score for the Germans, and perhaps eventual defeat for

 the' English side.       One only has to go back to the experiences of Leeds

. United fans in Paris in 1975 to note how the vagaries of the game can

 play a part in triggering a violent response from the stands and terraces,

 especially when the investment by fans has been relatively large in

 terms of time, money, and the sheer arduousness of the journey.         As it

 was, it was the Bayern spectators who glumly slouched out of the Feyenoord

 stadium; while those of Aston Villa stayed to watch their victorious team

 first receive, then parade, the European Cup.


      In effect, of course, the tradition which dictates that fans of the

 winning side remain in the stadium^ to join in the post-match celebrations

 is of great assistance to the authorities in coping with post-match

 segregation.        It serves a rather similar purpose to the tactic, widely
                                                                      30.


practised in this country, of 'holding' away fans in the stadium after

the match, while police usher home ferns out of the vicinity of the

ground.     On this occasion, virtually all of Villa's travelling support

preferred to remain in the stadium for half-an-hour after the match while

Mortimore and his colleagues jigged in front of them.     Outside, meanwhile,

Bayern's disgruntled fans were already being directed on board coaches,

cars and mini-buses for the journey home or a ,'wake' in the nearby

Rotterdam city centre.


     By 11.00 p.m., with the celebrations all but over, most of the Villa

Travel Club coaches were ready to leave on the long trek to Calais, their

occupants, in the main, too tired and drained for further revelry.          As

we left Rotterdam, again with police escort, we passed small knots of

Villa fans who were hanging around nearby bars and brightly-li-' service

stations.      They, too, seemed exhausted by the excesses of the past 48

hours or so.      We drove through the night to the French coast.     Almost

everybody slept.


     Some petty theft in the middle of the night at a service station

somewhere in Belgium was more the result of a lack of adequate service

than real maliciousness.      One man in a snail booth had found himself

with the task of dealing with one hundred tired, hungry and thirsty fans

in a twenty minute■stop*-     "He made enough anyway", argued one of the

benefactors, and it was difficult to argue that the station's sudden

windfall of customers hadn't taken care of its profit margin despite

the loss of some goods without payment.


     There was room for our coach on the 4.JO a.m. crossing to Dover.

On board, the bars were open again and doing good business.         This time,

too, the duty free and gift shops|were doing a roaring trade, but the

bottles of spirits purchased remained unopened.      The ship's 'bureau
                                                                    31.


de change' was also choked with fans, many of whom*had travelled with

supplies of guilders and francs but had had little opportunity to spend

them on the continent.    The ship's restaurants and cafeterias also

bulged with football fans.     "It was difficult to know which queue to

go to next", one supporter remarked later.      It was that sort of trip.

But there was little disturbance on board.      A loudspeaker announcement

by the ship's captain congratulated Midlands' fans both on the success

of their side and on their ov/n "exemplary,, behaviour during the voyage.

There were loud cheers.


     Back on the coaches for disembarkation, the club stewards 'reminded'

their charges about the custom and excise laws relating to the purchase

of duty free goods.    Those who had exceeded the permitted limit were

advised to use other club members as 'carriers' as v/e went through customs.

Despite such recommendations, however, one coach was held by customs when

undeclared cigarettes were discovered in a baggage hold.     The coach was

released after payment of a fine of £75.


     In contrast to the hordes of press men which greeted Manchester.

United supporters on their return from St. Etienne in 1977, there were

no journalists to meet us on the quayside at Dover.     Expectations of

good, orderly behaviour on the part of large football crowds have a low

nev/s priority.   The only serious incident reported in the English press

concerned a pre-match city centre clash between "armed" German fans and

a group of Villa supporters.    Some reports suggested that the Bayern

fans were armed with revolvers and ammunition, but later accounts suggested

the firearms were, in fact, starting pistols.     (Birmingham Evening Mail,

27 May, 1 982).   In this incident, nine Britons were arrested for drunk­

enness and hooliganism.   Twelve Germans were detained.     No one was

hurt in the incident, an'd the arrested fans were jailed until the end of
                                                                   32.


the game and then sent home.    Kees Otteranger, the senior Dutch Police

Officer in charge of crowd control at the match, described this and a

small number of other incidents as "quite minor and no more than we

would expect for any game".    (Daily Mail, 28 May, 1982).   The

Birmingham Evening Mail reported the following message, sent by Otteranger

to the travelling Villa contingent:

               Congratulations, not only on yinning the
               Cup, but for being so nice while you were in
               Rotterdam.   Everything has gone so very well.
               There was no fighting at all, nothing to give
               us any worries.   We thank you all for the
               very sporting way you conducted yourselves...

                                         Birmingham Evening Mail, 27 Mayi 1982
Summary and Preliminary Observations on Crcwd Control.


      There were widespread fears expressed by both the English and

European football authorities that the European Cup Final tie of 1982

between Aston Villa and Bayern Munich was liable to be attended by

serious crowd problems.      Such gloomy prognostications were based

largely on the reputation for disorder of English fans and on incidents

involving Aston Villa and, to a lesser extent - although, in this case,

the incidents were considerably more serious - Bayern fans just prior

to the final itself.      In fact, there were few incidents of spectator

disorder before, during or after the match in Rotterdam, although this

fact was given a fairly lew news priority by the British national press.

Given the penchant of the press in this country to report in full the

malpractice of British fans abroad, and the associated possibility that

such coverage may serve to attract to European matches those "fans" who

may be keen to sustain the "bad" reputation that English spectators have

abroad, we are of the opinion that the popular press should be encouraged

to give at least as much attention to relatively trouble-free matches

involving English clubs as they do to the troublesome ones.     More

specifically, in the context of the relatively trouble free Rotterdam

tie, mention should be made of, inter alia:


(1/   the successful co-operation between Birmingham and Rotterdam

police which helped to ensure that:

                    (a) despite EUFA's policy about the sale of match

tickets, of which more will be said later, the Rotterdam authorities

managed to practise effective segregation of English and German fans,

where necessary, both inside and outside the Feyenoord Stadium;

                and (b) $hat policing was, on the whole, low-key, a

fact which undoubtedly played a part in preventing the incidents which

did occur from escalating;
(2)   the commitment of the Aston Villa Travel Club to monitor and

accept responsibility for the good behaviour of some 9»000 Villa fans

who travelled to Rotterdam under its auspices.


      In principle, the Aston Villa scheme is an excellent idea which,

we understand, is already in force at a number of English clubs which

are regularly engaged in European competition.    Its spread should be

encouraged.    Moreover, the Villa initiative of appointing off-duty

police officers as crowd stewards seems a sensible and effective measure.

We are of the opinion, however, that the appointment of off-duty police­

men as travelling stewards should be given greater publicity by clubs,

and perhaps made obligatory or encouraged by the F.A.    We argue this

for two reasons:    firstly, and simply, they might act as a greater

deterrent to potential 'troublemakers';   and, secondly, they could offset

the possibility of confusion at home and abroad about the steward/police

relationship, especially with regard to their respective responsibilities

and" powers.   In addition to these points, officers who are invited to

travel with fans abroad might be requested to submit written or verbal

reports about their experiences.     These reports would constitute an

extremely useful data source for research and hence for policy-making

on the subject.


      One note of possible discord did sound quite loudly, hoover, during

th*> Travel Club's Rotterdam trip:   the long and arduous coach journey

through France, Belgium and Holland suggests that many aspects of such
                                   .                      *
journeys could represent a potential flashpoint for disturbances, even

on the part of "normally" well-behaved fans.     This is a very complex and

difficult matter.    We understand that clubs provide cheap tours abroad

to allow as many fans as possible! to follow their sides into Europe.

Again, this generally means recourse to long periods of travel on hot,
stuffy motor coaches or trains which provide the minmum of basic

comforts and the maximum source of irritation and malcontent to weary

travellers.      There was some evidence that the total ban on alcohol on

coaches, and most certainly the long spells without stops en route to

Rotterdam, taxed even the most patient of Villa's Travel Club members.

(V/e will, of course, be able to provide more substantive evidence on

this point should the Trust agree to finance the survey of Villa Travel
                                              ' 1

Club members for which we shall shortly be submitting a proposal.)

There was certainly a case here for more frequent stopping points en route

to Rotterdam, if not for a system of monitoring rather than prohibiting

the carriage of alcohol on the coach journey through Europe i.e. wines

and spirits should be prohibited but small quantities of beer, for

example, might be allowed at the discretion of the club steward.        Thus

it v/ould be important to ensure that stops were frequent, but brief, in

order to guard against fans being "tanked up" before rejoining the coach;


3. _ the part played by the informal, pre-match game in defusing the

tension of a situation that looked like getting out of hand.     This

suggests that one possibility that the authorities and football clubs

might consider is that - given the regularity nowadays of European

competition - suppprters clubs or Travel Clubs might usefully be encouraged

to develop more permanent relationships with their counterparts in differ­

ent countries.     The equivalent in some senses of "twinning" between townr

might serve a useful function in this regard.     In particular, regular

coverage of joint events and of the "twin" team's matches in the home

club's programme might play a part in breaking down the overly insular

identifications on either side which are such a potent source of trouble.

Official encouragement would be of great help in this regard.     So, too,

would grant aid from official sources.     Considerable political kudos
                         \»

Could attach to this country for taking such a novel, constructive and

non-punitive lead in this regard;
k,   the fact that there is an almost inherent contradiction between,

on the one hand, the profit orientation of EUFA and the clubs and,

on the other, the effective control and segregation of football crowds.

Profit orientation in this case reduced, considerably, control over

the sale of tickets to English supporters and thus probably reduced

the numbers of fans who otherwise would have been compelled to travel

via the monitored Aston Villa Travel Club tour?.       The little evidence

we do have about the few disturbances which occurred in Holland strongly

suggests that it was ’’private" rather than Travel Club ’’supporters" who

were involved.    Inside the stadium, it was Villa fans - or ostensible

Villa fans - in the German portion of the ground who were the major

source of anxiety for the authorities.


     These problems, which surround the control of the distribution of
                                                   *

tickets, are most liable to occur when the match is played in a 'neutral'

country (i.e. where home demand is liable to be relatively poor) where

the attraction of the gnme assuch is declining, and where the recession

is reducing effective demand for attendance.


     On balance, and particularly when English clubs are involved in

matches in the so-called "Low Countries", where distances and hence travel-

costs are low, it might be prudent to consider the following ideas as a

possible means of providing more effective segregation of supporters at

least inside the ground.    We should emphasise that these ideas are in

an embryonic form, and we anticipate that they will be refined, perhaps

even extensively modified, in the course of the research.


     Tickets for different fan-groups should be of different colours

since this would form an easy and effective means of identification.

When a neutral ground is used to stajge a match, then three colours could

be used;   say, in the case of the 1982 Final, blue for Villa fans, red
                                                                    37


for Bayern fans and black for '’neutral*' supporters.    When there is no

neutral party involved, of course, then just two different ticket colours

would be necessary.      The proportion of tickets made available for each

should be determined by EUFA in consultation with the clubs involved.


        Continuing to use the 1982 Final as an example, all of Villa's

allocation of blue tickets would be made available to the Travel Club,

which would then be in a position to monitor the behaviour
                                                      «
                                                           of travelling

fans.     In,most cases the Villa match tickets might be sold in con­

junction with stewarded motor coach and rail tours.      Exceptions to this

rule would be possible, of course, at the discretion of the Villa club.

The point is, the Travel Club should be accountable for all the Villa

travelling contingent.


     Widespread publicity should also be given in this country to the

fact that ON NO ACCOUNT would Aston Villa fans - or any other Englishmen -

who were holders of red or black tickets be allowed into the ground to

watch the game.     Indeed, if The Guardian report of Nay 27 that London-

based Villa "fans” were refused entry to Holland is correct, then the

legal grounds may exist to prevert the entry into Europe, or exit from

these shores, of fans who either have no ticket for the match or possess

a red or black ticket.     Publicity should be widely given, too, to this

practice.     Beyond these constraints, especially given the relatively

obvious social class characteristics of most of the troublesome fans,

it should not be too difficult to identify, at point of entry to the

ground, supporters who are trying to use the wrong colour tickets.       In

time-honoured fashion, any Travel Club member involved in disturbances

abroad might then have his club membership terminated for a specified

period of time, depending upon the seriousness of the offence, and in
                                   »
                                   ?

the event of mass distrubances, action could be taken against the

supporters, i.e. withdraw future travel prospects, rather than the club.
     'Away* clubs should be encouraged to return unsold tickets at

least one week before the match is due to be played.     Then, should

some system of penning exist in the host club's ground, it may be in

a position to "convert” these unused tickets into a colour appropriate

for opposing or "neutral” fans without compromising segregational

procedures.   On no account should the tickets be returned and sold

without a colour conversion.
                                                f

     Other refinements to this scheme could be made later (e.g. to

ensure that new Travel Club members are generally well behaved, a period

of six months membership of the club prior to travel might be suggested,

and so on.)


     The aims of such a scheme would be the more effective regulation

of travel to foreign matches;     improved segregation inside continental

grounds;   effective identification of 'troublemakers', whose names should

be relayed to the club involved;     and the curtailment of the activities

of'ticket touts in this country and abroad.


     To date, the measures devised by EUFA to combat football hooliganism

have been unsuccessful.     One could be excused for concluding that this

lack of success results in some measure from the haphazard and ad hoc

manner in which they have been designed and implemented.     Moreover,

EUFA's response to fan-disorder when its control-measures fail seems often

to involve the punishment of clubs, independently of their culpability

or ability to control such matters.      The essential qualities of any

successful scheme must be that it is simple to operate and subtle and

discriminating in its response in the sense that it punishes tue guilty

rather than the innocent.      We believe that the rudimentary scheme

outlined above contains the seeds of such a successful policy.

                                Summary.


        During the World Cup Finals in Spain, a total of 111 British

subjects, the majority of them English, were arrested.         In the event,

the highly publicised prospect for hooligans of an extended stay in

a Spanish jail without being either charged or tried proved to have

little substance.         Only eleven individuals experienced anything

beyond a short confinement, and only two English citizens were held

under these conditions far mtrre than tv/o weeks.       The two men in

question n£re South Yorkshire miners'.       Following a fight at a night

club, the SparTteh ptxbice wzFS repo'rted to be looking for "tall English­

men".      Apparently, the two Yorkshire miners fitted the bill. (Daily

Mirror, July 26, 1982 ).


        English fans were not the only offenders in Spain.     Nor were

they the only ones to attract attention from the Spanish police.          To

bur knov/ledge, German, Austrian, French, Algerian and Spanish fans

v/ere also arrested during the course of the tournament.       Clearly, how­

ever, English fans were by far and away the most prominent in this

regard®     Nevertheless, given the fears expressed by both the British

and Spanish authorities before the Finals regarding the likely behaviour

of the English contingent in Spain, the fact that there were no major

disturbances during matches involving the England team gave rise to a
                                      V.
sense of relief in both countries.


     On page 69 of our report, we have outlined some of the factors

which appear to have played a part in limiting the occurrence of

disorder at the First Phase matches in San Karnes.       In Madrid, the

intimidatory approach of the Spanish police, coupled with a com-
                     \V
prehensive policy of segregating opposing fans - most notably for

the Spain v England game - were undoubtedly of some significance in
reducing the potential for disorder inside the Bernabeu stadium.

Outside the stadium, however, and in a number of situations not

directly related to football, uorft serious disturbances did occur

but, largely because of tfte provocative actions uf the Spanish

police and Spanish right-wing political groups, even these were

not as damaging to our national image as many English commentators

and officials had feared.


      In summary, the following central points can be made:


(1)   The majority of the English supporters who travelled to Spain

      for the Finals behaved tolerably well.     To this extent, the

      Amigos campaign may have had some impact, although it is very

      difficult to make any precise evaluation of its effectiveness.

      It was unfortunate that so many peaceable English fans, whose

      only crime was to be identifiably English, were treated harshly

      by Spanish police in Madrid.


(2)   The people of Bilbao and the surrounding region were, for the

      most part, extremely hospitable in their reception and treatment

      of English fans.   There v/ere many accounts from English fans

      of the warmth of their welcome in the North.     Nevertheless,

      sections of the English supporters acted ungraciously and v/ith

      hostility towards their hosts and when this occurred, local

      youths -seemed quick to reply in kind.

           At the same time, the warmth of the reception of the English

      in the North, may have had negative consequences for Anglo-

      Spanish relations in Madrid.      All too often, the locals were

      regarded by English fans as cold and hostile, and the English

      by local youths as provocative.      In the latter respect, some
                               i
      English supporters, whether intentionally or otherwise, did not

      endear themselves to local people or the police in-Madrid when

      they flaunted Basque flags and chanted ETA slogans.

(3)    The activities of Sportsworld Travel before and during the

       Finals were a constant source of irritation to their English

       clientele.      It should also be recorded in this regard, how­

       ever, that the Spanish organising body, Mundiespana, emerged

       from the tournament with little credit, its activities even

       giving rise to suspicions about the legality of some of its

       transactions.     A large number of English fans who were in

       Spain at high cost, for the sole purpose of peaceably watching

       the Finals, were treated shabbily by Sportsworld/faundiespana in

       terms of their match ticket allocations in Bilbao and Madrid.

            Finally, the overall organisation of ticket sales and

       package tours, both at the Spanish and British ends, meant that

       it was inevitable that larger numbers of young English supporters

       -travelled to Spain 'unsupervised    than might otherwise have been

       the case.


(k )   Perhaps the most striking finding of this report concerns the

       large number of youths and young men from lower working class

       backgrounds who made the trip to Spain.      It might have been sus­

       pected that the potentially high costs of a trip such as this

       might have deterred fans from this kind of background.        In fact,

       time and again we were struck by the ability and willingness of

       lads in manual occupations and even out of employment to conserve

       their limited funds in order to make the trip.      Once in Spain,

       groups of lower working class males with little or no knowledge

       of the land or the local tongue, could quite easily survive off

       their wits for weeks on end.     They did so by, inter alia     stealing

       food and drinks, sometimes money;     'dossing down', free of cnarge,

       in a variety of locations;     and 'jumping' trains to all parts of
                     Vv
       the country.

            We also found that even holidays at the upper end of the
                                                              iv


      package tour range attracted custom from some unskilled manual

      workers, and, in general terms, the Cestona group, for example,

      was characterised by a rather unexpectedly broad,occupational

      mix.


(5)   Largely on account of their restricted social and cultural

      horizons, their lack of knowledge about different societies,

      and a general stress among such groups on insider/outsider

      distinctions. English fans from lower working class backgrounds

      did not mix easily with the local people.      Furthermore, such

      groups were most susceptible to becoming involved in the gen­

      eration and transmission of unfavourable stereotypes concerning

      the cultural and racial inferiority of Spanish people and other

      "outsiders".     Such feelings were reinforced by their perceptions

      of their own experiences and by the way in which they received and

      interpreted information whilst in Spain.

             These kinds of prejudices were most characteristic of groups

      of young English fans from the South of England*      These pledged

      their allegiance to political factions of the extreme right, not­

      ably the National Front.     It has already been noted that the

      National Front is active at domestic football matches in England.

      In Spain, as in England, it was followers of fcfte Chelsea Club who

      were most prominent in this regard.       It is to be expected that

      the sometimes violent nationalistic fervour which is generated

      by movements such as the National Front is liable to be pronounced

      in an international setting.     It is also not surprising that,

      insofar as such groups r,upport football, the activities of the

      national tea”n excite their allegiance.      They also tend to be

      totally opposed to black players, whether in their local or the

      national team,


(6)   Nationalistic sentiments of an extreme kind were further fuelled
                                                               V


      in Spain by the Falklands War, and concern over the Gibralter

      issue.    This was especially the case in Madrid, where Spanish

      right wing extremists displayed fanatical support for the

      Argentinians, and for the claims of Spain in the Gibralter

      affair.      It must also be stated that some sections of the

      England following in Madrid seemed intent on provoking Spanish

      citizens, and, in some cases, the Spanish police, into violent

      retribution.     Such actions played some part at least in gen­

      erating the conditions under which a number of English fans were

      assaulted by the police in Madrid, and four were stabbed in

      Chamartin.


(7)   The attitude and behaviour of the Spanish police are also worthy

      of comment.     In the North, on match days, the police behaved

      tolerably well towards: the English, with a few notable exceptions,

      some of which have been documented in this report.      In non­

      football contexts, however, the police too often seemed to follow

      their own almost 'tribal' instincts, an example being the treat­

      ment of innocent England supporters in San Sebastian.        The net

      result of this kind of policing was to alienate young English

      fans even further from their hosts.

           In and around Madrid during the Second Phase, the police

      appeared to be acting on the basis of their pre-conceived image

      of English fans.     They did not respond in a measured fashion to

      events as they unfolded.     All too frequently, the police in the

      South seemed more concerned with quelling, by whatever means,

      the perceived excesses of English fans, rather than with the

      even-handed control and protection of opposing fan groups.        This

      approach culminated in thp violent scenes outside Bernabeu before
                    V*
      and following England's Second Phase matches.   As in the North,

      but to an even greater extent, the police in Madrid seem to have
                                                              vi


      acted more in terms of nationalistic sentiment than in the

      interests of securing crowd control.


(8)   There v/as some evidence in Spain of the presence of a growing

      'hard core' o£ England support on the continent which appeared

      to be drawn from the London area, and especially from followers

      of the Chelsea club.     For some of the youths and young men

      who follow England abroad on a regular basis, such trips seem

      to be treated as campaigns in which football is a significant,

      but not an all-consuming part.      Lads such as these, claimed to

      look forward to 'trouble* abroad and they expressed their pride

      in the hooligan reputation of England fans in international

      circles.   Veterans from earlier England matches, notably those

      in Basle and Turin, had a tendency to reflect with pride on the

      'performance' of English fans in those locations, and on their

      treatment of and by the local authorities, rather than about the

      performance of the England team.      Indeed, throughout the Finals,

      conversations about the respecti/e merits of home 'c-nds' and

      recent terrace fights were rather more prevalent than discussions

      about football per se.     It has to be anticipated that, under

      present conditions, this trend will continue with England matches

      abroad - especially in the low countries where travel costs are

      minimal.   Such matches provide a source of attraction to lower

      working class youths and young men in search of 'excitement'.

      Such quests are liable to involve, on occasions, a resort to

      physical violence and vandalism.      Correlatively, the reputation

      of English fans on the continent is liable to give rise to further

      •incidents' by drawing in their local equivalents.      Such incidents

      will perhaps be made worse!by the tendency on the part of con-
                    \K
      tinental police to overreact.      This, in turn, may invite
                                                              Vll


       accusations of police brutality as happened in Spain.        It

       may also serve to dissuade those English fans who are more

       cosmopolitan in their outlook and behaviour from attending

       England matches at which trouble is likely to occur.


 (9)   It is undoubtedly true that the availability of cheap alcohol

       and its consumption in large quantities played a prominent part

       in triggering disturbances between English fans and local youths,

       and also some of those involving English fans and the Spanish

       police.   As far as the Spanish police were concerned, drunkenness

       on the part of the En6 lish tended to be construed a s a serious

       threat to public order in virtually all social contexts.

            The evidence concerning the relationship between drinking

       and hooliganism in Bilbao and Madrid, however, should not be inter­

       preted in any simple sense as sufficient to establish causal links

       between heavy drinking and violence and vandalism.      One has only

       to look at the orderly behaviour of Scottish supporters in Southern

       Spain to see that there is no simple relationship between the con­

       sumption of alcohol and football hooliganism.     By all accounts,

       both hooliganism and temperance were conspicuous by their absence

       in the South.


(10)   Finally, even in Madrid at the Spain v England match when the

       Spanish police behaved violently towards English fans, it was

       possible for English supporters to travel to watch the match

       unmolested.     This was possible by the simple expedient of not

       wearing England colours, and by refraining from reacting to the

       chants of local supporters, many of which were not even aimed

       directly at the English.     However, many English fans travelled

       to the game in full 'uniform' (many had little else to wear),

       in large groups, and ready, willing and eager to react to

       'provocation' on the part of local fans.     Not to do so would
would have been 'unmanly1, and would have been construed as

evidence of a poor "terrace performance".   Moreover, such

restraint would have been at variance with the values which

are central to the lives and experiences of the majority of

lower working class youths.

Dear Member,

Effect of Professional Football on the Community

15th December, 1982, at the County Hall, Barnsley. Formal

     Dear Mr. Thwaites,

     Effect of Professional Football on the Community.

     You will recall that Minute 138 of the Police Committee of 1stNovember,1982,
     (set out on pages F.2 and F.3 of the Council Summons of 24th November,) refers
     to a Seminar held at the County Hall Barnsley, on 27th October.

     Set out below is the Resolution of the Police Committee which was confirmed at
     the County Council on 24th November:-

    ‘*1.   That it be a recommendation to the Home Office through the Association of
           Metropolitan Authorities that a group from interested organisations be
           appointed to look at a national approach to the football hooliganism
           problem, its cost to the community, the charges which should be levied
           upon football clubs for policing, and other solutions to make the game
           more acceptable to the community at large.

     2.    That, in the meantime, a small group representing Members of the Police
           Authority and of the County Council, the Police, the Chief Executive, the
           County Treasurer and the Football Clubs be constituted toexamine:—

           a)   charges for police services in South Yorkshire, particularly where
                attendances fall below an agreed pre-determined level, and

           b)   a closer co-operation between the football clubs and the police to
                stimulate and encourage young persons towards an interest    in the
                Clubs and to break away from hooliganism at and associated with
                football matches.

     3.    That the Chief Constable's initiative in drawing the attention of the
           football clubs to the action which may be taken by the police for
           misbehaviour on the football field be fully supported.*'

    I am taking part 1 of the Resolution up through the Association of Metropolitan
    Authorities. As regards part 2, the Chairman of the Police Committee would

Dear Sir,

Effect of Professional Football on the Community

The attached document was recently considered at a Seminar for all County
Council Members, Magistrate Members of the Police Committee and representatives
of the five Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire.

A report on the Seminar was subsequently considered by the Police Committee,
who decided that the problem required action at both local and national
levels.

I am taking the action requested at local level, and the extract from the
Police Committee’s Minutes set out below is the action which is being
requested at national level:-

    "That it be a recommendation to the Home Office through the
    Association of Metropolitan Authorities that a group from
    interested organisations be appointed to 14ok at a national approach
    to the football hooliganism problem, its cost to the community, the
    charges which should be levied upon football clubs for policing,
    and other solutions to make the game more acceptable to the community
    at large".

Perhaps you will arrange for the matter to be considered by the appropriate
Committee of the Association.

                                 Yours faithfully,

Dear Member,

Seminar on Charges for Police Services

The Police Committee is to hold a Seminar on
Charges for Police Services (which, of course,
includes charges for police services at football
matches) on the morning of the next County Council
meeting.

The Committee has asked me to also invite all
Members of the County Council, together with
representatives of the South Yorkshire Football
League Clubs and the Media, to be present at the
Seminar.

Perhaps you would note in your Diary that the
Seminar will commence at 10.00 a.m. on Wednesday,
27th October, 1982, in the Council Chamber at the
County Hall, Barnsley.

                                              Yours faithfully,




                                              Chief Executive.

           of the County Council have been invited to be present, and the
           Committee wish to extend an invitation to all the South Yorkshire
           Football League Clubs to be represented. I would add that M m
           Seminar will also be open to such representatives of the media who
           may wish to be present.

           Could you kindly let Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (ext. 422) know
           whether the Club will be able to accept the invitation and, if so,

1 .__________Purpose of Meeting

Councillor Flanagan welcomed the representatives and apologised for the
absence of the Chairman of    the Police Committee, Councillor G.H. Moores,he
having been called upon to attend a Regional Police Meeting. Councillor
Flanagan recalled that this meeting had been called at the request of the
Football Clubs, and invited the representatives to put their case.

2 .__________ Charges for Police Services

The Clubs' representatives, pointed out that it was very rare for football
clubs to speak with one voice, but they were unanimous on two points. Whilst
the service provided at football matches by the South Yorkshire Police was
undoubtedly first class, on the subject of charges for those services they
were unanimous in condemning them as excessive. This conclusion had been
reached after the clubs had seperately compared figures in respect of South
Yorkshire Police charges with those charged to certain Football League Clubs
in other areas (both adjoining South Yorkshire and further afield). These
random surveys had revealed that the South Yorkshire Clubs were being charged
between twice and five times the amounts which non-South Yorkshire Clubs were
being charged for police services. Even the West Yorkshire Clubs paid less.
On top of this, many Clubs outside South Yorkshire had received grants or
loans from their local authorities. The General Rates in South Yorkshire were
also very high in comparison with many other areas. Based solely on the
charges for police services, one Club in South Yorkshire had paid 19.45% of
their gate income in police charges last year.    Indeed, the police had received
more income out of the home games than the Club in question had. The time
was fast approaching when it would be more economic for the Club to play
behind closed doors than to admit spectators and pay for South Yorkshire
Police services. Based on the random surveys, it would also be more economic
to pay an adjoining police force and provide coaches than to continue to pay
for South Yorkshire Police services. The possibility of employing security
firms was also mentioned.   Coupled with the general low level of the economy

                                      1.
it was not impossible that one or more of the clubs might well become bankrupt. The
resulting number of people, particularly youngsters, who would be at a loose
end on a Saturday afternoon could well constitute more of a public order problem than
at present, and the Police Authority would not receive any income at all
towards dealing with the problem.  Finally, the Clubs were disturbed at the
one week's notice of a further increase in charges in view of assurances
previously given that they would be given adequate notice.

The Police Authority representatives pointed out that they had not had the
benefit of the results of the random surveys carried out by the Clubs.
However, the charges for police services were increased in accordance with
Police Annual National Pay Awards.   It was recognised that since the Edmund
Davies Report some three years ago, such Pay Awards had been substantial, but
the hourly rates charged (minimum period 4 hours) for the various ranks were
common throughout the No. 2 Police Region, and were thought to be charged
nationally.   It was stressed that the criteria used for charging for
policemen inside football grounds in South Yorkshire provided for the charge
to be calculated retrospectively on the actual numbers of spectators present
on the day. This meant that often the Clubs did not pay for anywhere near
the actual number of police on duty inside a ground on a particular day and,
of course, did not pay at all for those on duty outside the ground or in the
Town Centre. These costs were met by the Ratepayers. Aditionally, no
charge was made for cancelled matches, unlike some other Forces. However, it
was accepted that there were apparent a n o m o l i e s and it was intended to
endeavour to seek agreement on criteria and charges to be applied on a national
basis.   In the meantime, the Police Committee were to hold a Seminar on the
subject of Charges for Police Services generally, to which all Members of the
County Council were also to be invited.     It was hoped that the Clubs'
representatives would also be able to be present to put their views.        In the
final event, the paramount factor had to be that of the Chief Constable being
able to carry out his statutory duty of ensuring that the level of policing
was sufficient to meet reasonably foreseeable demands of public safety and
security.

3.__________ Action

IT WAS AGREED

(a)         that to enable the Chief Constable to have as complete a picture
             as possible and to support a possible call for national criteria
             and charges for police services, the Clubs would supply Mr. Goslin
             with the results of the random surveys carried out by them;

(b)         that, subject to any national standards which might be forthcoming,
             the Chief Constable be requested to consider whether he could
             recommend or otherwise the suggestions made by the Clubs'
             representatives that the minimum chargeable period of 4 hours
             could reasonably be reduced to 3 hours and whether the 1, 2, 10
             personnel and crowd base level criteria used in South Yorkshire
             could safely be modified;

(c)         that Mr. Vaughan would write formally to the Clubs inviting them
             to be represented at the Seminar on Charges for Police Services
             (to be held in the morning of Wednesday, 27th October at the
             County Hall, Barnsley).

                                     would be pressing for
                                     cheaper charges.

                                      the spokesman.
                                          It comes only a few

     Dear Sir,

     We axe in receipt of invoices 17266 and 17265 following Police duty
     here at Belle Vue during the current football season 1982/83.

     As you know we were recently invited to a meeting with the Police
     Authority at which the current level of charges were discussed. We
     understood that a complete review of the charges was to take place
     within the near future, and we note that these accounts have been
     considered at the usual rate.

     I would be grateful therefore if you could take this matter up on our
     behalf and look forward to hearing from you.

      pints~were sold^at 14 pence, i.e. a rate of 28 pence per pint which m
      effect is overcharging.

1.4   It is recommended that this is a suitable case for consideration for
      the issue of a caution.

2.1   It may be that the Committee would also care to consider the whole area
      of the issue of cautions at this time.

2.2   The Committee resolved in November 1974 that it would reserve for
      itself the right to decide whether a caution should be issued although your
      officers are generally authorised to institute proceedings.

2.3   This procedure has the effect that a full investigation has to be carried
      out on every occasion, that statutory notices have to be issued to the
      alleged offenders, to the Office of Pair Trading, and that a report
      must be made available to the Committee within the statutory time limits
      so that proceedings could still be instituted if the Committee so
      decided.   These time limits are:

      Under the Pood and Drugs Act             -      2 months
      Under the Weights and Measures Act       -      3 months
      Under the Trade Descriptions Act         -     12 months

2.4   There are many cases where very early in an investigation it becomes _
      apparent that the most appropriate procedure would be the issue of a
      caution ^.nn if the investigation could then be aborted considerable time
      and money could be saved by a-voiding the completion of the full formal
      procedure.

2.5    I would therefore submit for your approval that the issue of a caution
       should be within the power of your Chief Officer and such other
       designated officers in the same maimer as the institution of formal
       proceedings.

Dear Mr McGee

Thank you for your letter dated 24 August 1982 relating to a meeting
between the Chairmen of local football league clubs and the Chairman
of the South Yorkshire Police Committee to discuss the question of
police charges at football matches.

Your information is correct in that such a meeting is to be called and
arrangements are being made by David Vaughan, Senior Committee
Administrator, South Yorkshire County Council, who will be contacting
you in the near, future.

The responsibility for determining charges for police services lies
with the Police Authority, but I have the responsibility for police
operations. You will see therefore that the appropriate body for you
to consult with in regard to police charges is the Police Authority.

 I hg.ve forwarded a copy of your letter and my reply to David Vaughan.

             Sheffield S3 8LY.


             Dear Chief,

             Unfortunately due to holidays I wasn’t able to attend the Annual
             Lunch you gave for Chairmen and Secretaries this year.

             I understand that at that meeting it was inferred that you would
             be calling a meeting shortly of all Chairmen of Clubs inside your
             area, to meet the Chairman of the Police Committee to discuss
             further this question of police charges.

             I don't think this meeting can be called too soon because all the
             football clubs in your area must be feeling the effect of the
             considerably increased charges your Authority is making for police
             attendance at football matches.

             For your information and the information of every Chairman in your
             territory, I give you below the charges you have made against us
             for the last four seasons:-

                                   Season 1978/79   £8053
                                      »   1979/80   14,606
                                      "   1980/81   35,543
                                      »   1981/82   55.014

             These sums of money now are like life and death to football in this
             area, and the charges being made are figures that football just
             cannot afford, and I do hope it won’t be too long before the proposed
             meeting is held.

              Perhaps it would be a good thing if you could give each Chairman a
              number of dates for the meeting so that a date might be arranged that
              is convenient for most if not all to be there.


              Yours sincerely,




                                                             Copies to all Chairmen -

Many authorities already make good use of the Urban Programme
to fund projects which have the effect of reducing the levels
of crime and vandalism in their inner areas.  Since I recognise
the important contribution to the regeneration of inner cities
which can be made by discouraging crime and damage to property
I should be grateful if your authority could look at your Inner
Area Programme from this point of view.

Some measures are designed to tackle the problem- directly. These
include improved security on blocks of flats and community projects
of environmental improvement.  Urban Programme resources may be used
for projects in this area, especially for innovative and/or community
based projects from which lessons may be learnt for main programmes
of expenditure.

I believe that recreational projects for young people, especially
those providing constructive activities during school holidays,
also have an important part to play.  As you may know, we have made
additional resources for holiday projects available under the
Urban Programme this year on top of the amount initially allocated.
I am also pleased that the Urban Programme funds support for
continuing work amongst disadvantaged young people, especially by
the provision of premises and equipment.  We can also help support
key workers operating in an innovative way.

In the longer term an important factor in crime prevention may be
the location and design of housing estates and other
developments.  I would like to see local authority planning and
housing departments seeking the advice of the police where it is
appropriate.  Here we hope that the improved arrangements
being made for consultation between police forces, local authorities
and other community interests will help to bring about useful
contacts of this kind.

I am writing in similar terms to the leaders of all the programme
authorities;  partnership chairmen are writing to the leaders of
partnership authorities.

I am sending a copy of this letter to your Chief Executive.

           X have received a request from the Secretary of the Doncaster Hovers
           Football Club Limited for a meeting between the Chairman of the Club
           (Mr Ian Jones, a partner in the Doncaster firm of Solicitors,
           Attey, Bower and Jones) to discuss the question of charges made to
           the Club for the services of Police Officers within their ground
           daring matches.

          I attach a summary of the dealings which have taken place with the
          Club since Legal Services Division were first involved and you will
          see that pasTmgnts^hay^jeei^lg^and that on one occasion it was

          The position with regard to these charges is somewaht unusual in that

          contractual one as there does Hiot necessarily have to be any
          agreement between the Police Authority and the Football Club as
          to the number of Officers required on any particular occasion or
          as to the scale of charges for their services. Xhere is, I
          understand, a relationship between the charge and the attendance
          figures for each match but the ratio of Police Officers to spectators
          appears to be decided by the Police Authority. From a practical
          point of view Football Clubs seem to have little choice as to whether
          or not to make use of Police services on these occasions and
          the Chief Constable appears to take the view that it is not open to
          him to withdraw the services of the Police because accounts have
          not been paid. In addition Doncaster Rovers Football Club Limited
          appear to consider that the level of charges in South Yorkshire is
          higher than in other areas of the country. I enclose copies of papers
          provided by the Chief Constable and which throw some light on the
          way in which the charges are calculated.

          Doncaster Hovers Football Club are not the only club experiencing
          financial difficulties at the present time. It has been necessary
          in the past to threaten proceedings against Sheffield United, and
          Sheffield Wednesday have only recently paid overdue accounts
          totalling £9186 .60 .

          With regard to the request for a meeting with you I should be glad
          to have your views as to who should be present at such a meeting.


          Chief Executive.

DONCASTER ROYERS FOOTBALL CLUB LIMITED


The Police Authority make available to Doncaster Rovers Football Club

Limited, Police Officers for the purpose of crowd control on the Club’s

premises before, during and after each match.       Accounts in respect of

these services are raised by the County Treasurer.



Outstanding accounts were referred to the Legal- Services Division for

recovery in January, March, June, July, October and November of 1981

and also in February 1982.       The   attached schedule lists all of these

Accounts and gives the    dates of issue, the         dates of referal and the dates

of payment or other conclusion.


Pressure for payment short of proceedings resulted in the payment of

five accounts in 1981 the time taken for payment averaging 15 weeks.


At the end of the 1980/81 Season the Club pleaded financial hardship

ami promised to clear outstanding accounts before the start of the 1981/82

Season in September 1981.        The promise was not kept and a writ was issued

in November 1981 which    resulted in payment         of all Accounts outstanding at

that date.   Subsequent   accounts in October         and November 1981 were paid promptly

albeit on threat of further proceedings in the High Court.


Further accounts totalling £9726.47 were referred to Legal Services

Division in February 1982 and are still outstanding.

Dear Sir

CHARGES FOR POLICE
I refer to previous correspondence concerning the approved charges for
the hire of oolice officers within your ground and in particular, in my
letter dated 3 December 1980, I'"pointeSo^’That the rates would rise
again in September 1981.
However, a recent survey has shown that the charges for the North East
Region were substantially below those charged by other police forces and
it has been agreed that new standard rates should come into effect on 1
May 1981. Details of the new rates are shown in the Appendix to this
letter.
The undertaking which I gave you at the beginning of this season will
still hold and that is that despite this increase, your payment will not
rise other than by a very small amount, because it is not possible to
charge for a fraction of an officer. It is important, however, that you
should take account of these new rates when calculating your costs for
next season, using the number of officers agreed at the meeting on
2 2 August 1980.
The rates will no doubt rise again later in the year, once the size of
the September pay award is known*

Yours faithfully

Dear'Sir,

Outstanding Accounts

I am writing in connection of the outstanding accounts which you wrote to us
about regarding police expenses at football matches from August.

At this moment in time we are in correspondence with South Yorkshire Police
as to the amounts we are being charged as we feel that these are extremely high.

I would, therefore, be grateful if you could postpone any procedures until this
problem has beenres)
            been ^resolved.                                              .

  Chief Constable,

 Dear Sir,

 Police Charges at Football Matches

 I am writing to make a most vociferous protest against mimimura charges being made
 against Doncaster Rovers Football Club when attendances are in the region of 2,000
 or 3,000.   Whilst making this protest, I must also point out that this will in no
 way interfere with the excellent liaison we have with the local police nor detract
 from the excellent work done by them at matches at Belle Vue.

  During the summer a meeting was held in conjunction with a dossier giving details
  of last seasons police involvement in South Yorkshire and also presenting proposed
  charges based on actual attendances.   Of course, the charges were not linked with
  the number of police officers either required or actually on duty inside the ground.
  These charges are all very well for attendances above 6,000, and indeed would be score
  than fair for clubs in the habit of having 20,000 gates or above.   Unfortunately,
  &t the other end of the sliding scale, the charges become ludicrously high for a
; 2,000 gate and, indeed, leave the Club in a desperate position.

 Let me quote an example to you of the financial position of one such game already
 played this season.    _ _ ___ .                                   _    v._ .,

Even in the First Division, Middlesborough last season paid only £1,300 for attendances
in the region of 18,000 - charges covering duties performed by only 39 police officers
(32 constables) which number South Yorkshire now see fit to control a gate of 12,000.
We now find ourselves in the embanassing position of having to pay these accounts
which we can barely afford to do - particularly on such a limited budget.

The police strength within the ground has always been more than adequate and, despite
the seemingly large number of arrests, there have never been more than the one or two
incidents, such as the Sheffield Ohited match last season which was a "one off" and
would be inevitable at any ground in England. We do not decry that an increase was     fji
necessary but, for Doncaster Rovers, & near 400^ increase is impossible to meet.     '
Public safety and comfort is of the utmost importance and we are considering
installing seats in our popular (covered) stand to bring our ground in to line with
the comforts of sports stadia worldwide - one development I*m sure you will be pleased
to hear. Even now, however, when you consider the area of the terracing here at Bells
Vue, you will appreciate that it would be extremely easy to cope with a 2,000 crowd
with more than the required safety levels maintained. The other thing which applies in

THE 'SKINHEAD' PROBLEM - SHEFFIELD CITY CENTRE

1.     Although skinheads are not a recent phenomenon they are currently
having a resurgence which is causing concern both to the police,and the
majority of members of the public. The young men and women who ally
themselves to this cult present a disturbing front with their shaven heads,
heavy footwear and, sometimes clothing of a paramilitary appearance. This
is accentuated by the fact that they, gather in large groups and thereby
attain an even more sinister visual impact.

2.     Unfortunately .their menacing appearance is extended into their
conduct and actions, if the following statistics are accepted.

3.     An in-depth analysis has been undertaken into crimes committed in
the city centre by the 14 to 21 age group in the period 1 June 1980 to
31 May 1981. The figures produced, sub divided into those offenders readily
identifiable as skinheads and those obviously not, are shown in the appendix.

4.     It will be seen that skinheads were responsible for over 44% of
robberies, which by their very definition involve some threat or violence,
and a staggering 56% of all offences of assault, both minor and serious.

5.     During the relevant period some 588 skinheads were either arrested or
reported.on summons for a variety of criminal offences, and a further 127
were desribed by complainants as of the skinhead fraternity although they
were not traced.

6.     There is little doubt that the centre of the City of Sheffield has
become a focal point for skinheads:to congregate.   In the Central Sub-
Division (Dl) of the City, over the past 12 months, there have been 1,002
incidents involving skinheads, in fact almost three per day, and in respect
of which the police were contacted. These incidents include the crime
figures already quoted. Additional to the 588 arrests for criminal offences
a further 78. skinheads were arrested for offgnces such as being drunk and
disorderly, using threatening behaviour, etc.

7.     Although, as previously mentioned, the number of incidents average out
at about three per day, there have been occasions such as the 28th October
1980 when there were nine separate incidents, all of which involved disorder
and disturbances by skinheads, during an eight hour period.

8.     The main areas where problems with skinheads are experienced are the
large city centre stores, the Danish Kitchen, King Street, Castle Square
(Hole in the Road), the Crucible Theatre, the Market area, along with the
Gallery, and particularly Pond Street Bus Station. One meeting point which
is often the focal point of incidents is Angel Street outside the Crystal Rooms.

9.    Premises from where regular complaints about            the conduct of skinheads
are received are:-
             Bubbles and   Cuddles, The Gallery
             The Gallery   in general (usually from Market patrol men)
             The Friary,   Pond Street
             Pond Street   Bus Station
                                   - 2 -


      The Showboat, Pond Street
      Presto-Supermarket, Pond Street
      Woolco, Haymarket
      The Danish Kitchen, King Street
      The Crystal Rooms, Angel Street
      Numerous residents upon the Sky Edge and Wybourn estates
      Rackhams, High Street
      Debenhams, The Moor
      The Crucible Theatre, Norfolk Street

The problem is so acute that some concerns have employed security men purely
to deal with the aggravation of the skinheads. Market patrol officers are
said to be in fear of the results of the skinheads' activities.

10.    Some of the typical involvements with the skinheads are outlined below

       a.   On the 9th November 1980 at 3.54 pm, the police were informed
            that a gang of about 30 skinheads werecausing trouble outside
            the Travel Centre at the Midland Station.   The policeattended
            to find that a man had been stabbed. He was taken to hospital
            and treated for a perforated liver.   His assailant was arrested.

       b.   At 7.25 pm on the 26th November 1980 the Manager of the Top Rank
            Suite telephoned the police to say that a man had been stabbed
            in the back by a gang of skinheads whilst in the nearby National
            Car Park.  It was eventually ascertained that two persons had
            been stabbed and two skinheads were later arrested. The initial
            number of persons in the gang is not known.

       c. At 3.50 am on the 12th December 1980 a man was robbed in the
           centre of Sheffield by five skinheads, all dressed in black.
           The youths responsible were arrested a short time later in
           Sheaf Street, still in possession of the camera and tape
           recorder which had been stolen.

       d.   The Crazy Daizy night club was the scene of an incident at
            1.-20 am on the 10th April 1981, when a man was stabbed. The
            police officer who attended the incident was-unable to approach
            the injured man because of the hostile attitude of a large
            group of skinheads. He called for assistance and a number of
            skinheads were questioned.   None could be connected with the
            stabbing incident however and the assailant has not yet been
            traced. The man who was stabbed had to undergo an exploratory
            operation and he described his attacker as a skinhead.

       e. Recently a lone officer on foot patrol was attempting to arrest
           one of a group of five skinheads who was drunk and disorderly.
           He was attacked by all the members of the group. He was kicked
           about the head and body and knocked unconscious. The officer
           was admitted to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital where he was
           detained overnight.  He is still away from work on sick leave
           because of this incident. Arrests have been made.

11.    Other incidents over the past 12 months present an appalling catalogue
of violence, damage and assaults, and an equally disturbing factor involves
apparently motiveless attacks upon young females by female skinheads, i.e.
                                 - 3 -


      a.   On the 10th December 1980, a mother reported that her 15 years
           old daughter had been attacked by five female skinheads with
           an iron bar. She had sustained a head injury which had
           necessitated, stitches being inserted into the wound. Her
           assailants were not traced.

      b.   An even more frightening attack took place in Pond Street Bus
           Station during the early evening of the 19th April 1981. A
           16 years old girl was slashed in the face by a skinhead girl
           who was wielding a cut throat razor.. The assailant has not
           been traced. The wound required 12 stitches.

12.   To   combat this menace, and to discharge the primary duty of a police
officer - to protect life - police patrols in: the city centre area have been
increased.   Due to the fact that skinheads are described as the persons
responsible for large numbers of crimes, particularly violent ones, they are
the.group who are watched and questioned by the patrolling officers. One
must also remember that a large, stationary group of 30 or so persons must,
by their very existance, cause an obstruction to the free passage of the
highway (whether skinheads or not). police officers are constantly reminded
to approach these situations with tact and diplomacy . Regrettably their
reception for this style of policing is often to be given abuse.

13.    A large number of assaults, robberies and thefts, all alleged by
witnesses to have been perpetrated by skinheads in the Pond Street area,
and which remained undetected, led to the detention of some 34 skinheads
during the evening of Monday 1st December 1980. A team headed by a
Detective Sergeant interviewed the detained youths without clearing up any
of the outstanding crimes. Only 11 of the group were over 18 years old.
The parents of the juveniles were asked to attend the police station, and
after the circumstances of the detentions had been explained to them,
without exception, they agreed with the, action 'taken by the police. This
effort alone resulted in antagonism towards the police by skinheads, and
when in large groups they do not fail to be obstructive to the efforts of
the police officers.

14.    If the circumstances are propitious the skinheads are not afraid to
assault police officers. No hard statistics are maintained which show how
many officers have been assaulted during the execution of their duty by
skinheads, although it is possible to say that 119 o f f i c e r s within the
Central Sub-Division were assaulted during the•past year, and of those some
46 received injuries, including broken bones, concussion, head injuries,
bites, scratches, general cuts, bruises and abrasions.

15.    The skinheads are predominantly from the Sheffield area and a large
number of them hail from the nearby Park Hill and Hyde Park flat complexes.
The shortage of amusement facilities in those locations ensure that the
gangs filter into town and concentrate in the particular areas already
described. Many of the disorder situations are spontaneous and. only last
a short period of time. By the time a member of the public has, reported an
incident and the police have attended, the trouble has stopped, unless the
incident is of a serious nature. For this reason, many of the incidents
are written off as 'no trouble, gangs of skinheads in area but no offences
disclosed'. The skinheads possibly think that they are being harassed when,
the police respond to an incident which is over, but the police are duty
bound to respond.                        .
   16.    Pond Street is another focal point and over the last year 74
   incidents have taken place there involving skinheads. This is a minimum
   figure and does not include those incidents seen and dealt with by
   patrolling officers.   If all these were recorded the numbers would
   increase considerably.   Of the incidents recorded on police message forms
   the source of the complaint is invariably found in violent conduct by the
   skinheads.

   17.    The police have not restricted themselves to enforcing the law to
   settle the problems of the skinheads. They have visited places where
   young people, and particularly skinheads, congregate with the object of
   holding discussions with them. The following centres have been visited:—

            i.    Bow Centre, West Street/Holly Street - talks and
                  discussions - problems of policing city centre outlined.

           ii-    Sheffield Starting Point, 73 West Street - talks and
                  discussions.

          iii-    'Pop in' unemployed teenagers centre, 14 High Pavement,
                  Hyde Park flats - visits and talks - sporting fixtures
                  between police and teenagers proposed and police asked to
                  become involving in forthcoming Hyde Park Fete.

           iv-    City Centre Churches Youth Club, United Reform Church,
                  Norfolk Street - visits made, table tennis and five-a-side
                  football played. Mainly used by skinheads.   Invited to
                  take part in sponsored Lyke Wake Walk and agreed to attend
                  but none turned up. Four of the number had been sentenced
                  to serve a period of Borstal training in the interim period.

           .v.-   Croft House Settlement Youth Centre, Garden Street - very
                  good liaison, talks, visits, and numerous games evenings
                  held.

           vi.    Parkhouse Comprehensive School, Bawtry Road, Sheffield -
                  police project held for 6th form pupils. Talks and
                  discussions held.

    18.         Objections were raised by the skinheads to this form of activity by
    the police and it became apparent that they were receiving advice from
    outside their group. Leaflets, alleging police harassment and unprovoked
    assaults upon skinheads by policemen were published, followed by an
    announcement that it was proposed to march in protest against these alleged
    actions.        In an endeavour to forestall the march and enquire into the
    credibility of the allegations, Superintendent Pratt of the Community
    Liaison Department attended a meeting at the Bow Centre, West Street,
    Sheffield, on the 7th June 1981. This was also attended by a City
    Councillor who invited the Superintendent and a County Councillor. Two
    youth workers were also present with the rest of the audience being
' c o m p r i s e d of skinheads.

  19.    The meeting consisted mainly of spurious allegations of police
  brutality, without supporting evidence. Superintendent Pratt put forward
  the police viewpoint and suggested that any complaint should be made through
  official channels.  It was apparent at this meeting that a protest march
  against police harassment to be held in the city centre of Sheffield was a
  popular concept.
                                 - 5 -



20.    The leaflets distributed in the name of the skinheads show alleged
case histories of police brutality, and contain brief details of 13
alleged incidents. Only one.is of sufficient detail to allow a purposeful
check to be made against police records. This is a case where a person
identified as       alleges that he was assaulted in various ways and
taken to a police station where he was eventually charged with assault on
the police and the use of obscene language. This incident is said to have
occurred at 7.30 pm. The only incident of this nature occurred at 9.30 pm
at the Showboat, Pond Street, when three police officers were assaulted by
a large number of skinheads whilst investigating a complaint of criminal
damage. No one called f      Iwas arrested for assaulting a policeman.
However the age group of an offender and the offences committed fit a youth
of a different Christian name.   If this is the person who has made the
allegation it is obvious that fictitious names have been used.   In addition
the account contains many inaccuracies, unsupported allegations, and many
obvious lies.

21.    One story suggests that a prisoner was kept in local custody for
four days and was not allowed to visit the toilet at any stage. Cells
within the South Yorkshire Police area have toilets within the cell so
that allegation is palpably untrue.   In addition a detained person must be
brought before the court as expeditiously as possible and there is no
record of anyone having been detained for such a length of time without
appearance before court. Another case quoted someone called         1 as
having been charged with, amongst other things, 'loitering'. No such
charge has been made. However the statements which are most unacceptable
are those relating to the degree of violence.   The alleged violence,
particularly that with the use of truncheons would have caused very serious
injuries necessitating hospitalisation.   The allegations, by their
exaggerations, have lost their credibility.

22.    The advent of a march by skinheads against police harassment was
seenas a dangerous rallying challenge to authority which would be likely
to attract those always prepared to aggravate a sensitive situation.
City politicians at two meetings were advised against the march, but it
went ahead with the declared objective of drawing attention to the case
of youth unemployment, as opposed to alleging police harassment.

23.    The march took place on Saturday the 20th June 1981, with banners
alleging police harassment of skinheads.  Little visual attention was
drawn to youth unemployment. An estimation of 250 assembled, essentially
skinheads, and the procession moved forward about midday. The only
incident on route of a disorderly nature was the dropping of drawing pins
on the road. The police escorted the march under low profile for which
they were later complimented. At 12.45 pm the march, and subsequent
speeches on the City Hall steps had concluded.

24.    With the conclusion of the march a group of skinheads, estimated at
150, walked along Fargate, and from that time the following incidents are
recorded in police records

       12.48 pm the Manager of the Crucible Theatre informed the police
       that damage had been caused inside the theatre by a group of
       skinheads. Subsequent observations showed that a City Councillor
       and a local government officer connected with the group were in the
       vicinity. Three display cabinet windows, each measuring 3' x 1'6",
       and valued at £75 were broken and several items stolen from inside
       the display case.   Information to identify the culprits has not
       been forthcoming.
                          - 6 -



12.50 pm the same group caused damage in a bread shop in Pond
Street, damaged an ice cream vending machine, and caused a
disturbance in the Friary fish and chip shop.

12.55 pm a call that the same group were responsible for throwing
gravel and rubbish at passing police vehicles. No damage was
sustained.

About 12.55 pm complaints were received from shopkeepers in the
Gallery, Haymarket, that large numbers of skinheads were
obstructing shoppers. The group was moved.

1.13 pm a member of the public reported fighting by a number of
skinheads outside Rackhams store on High Street.

1.25 pm jeans were stolen from the Jeanery, Fargate, by skinheads.
Police officers attended and one Constable was slightly injured.
One skinhead was arrested for theft and for assaulting the officer.

Between 1.27 pm and 1.30 pm there was a disturbance outside
Jonathan Silvers menswear shop, Pinstone Street, and a report of a
number of skinheads with knives in York Street. No arrests were
made in the first incident and the second matter was not substantiated.

1.35 pm one skinhead was arrested for a public order offence in the

COMMENT

25.     There has been a campaign of vilification against the police and
this campaign has included the publication of unfounded complaints. The
campaign was orchestrated by other than the skinheads. The pamphlets
produced evidently were not prepared by Sheffield skinheads, but they
were prepared by someone who was willing to further allegations against
police officers without giving the officers the chance to reply. The
opportunity to defend oneself against allegations is the right of every
citizen including police officers. Those who made the allegations did
so under the cloak of anonymity and mainly in general terms. Are they
afraid of an investigation to get at the truth - the police force certainly
is not?

26.    It should be noted that of 13   anonymous complaints 4     involve
persons being charged with criminal offences.  The complainants who
appear before courts do have an opportunity to have their allegations
examined by the magistrates, and I advise that they take that opportunity.

27.    There is a danger of giving credibility to a cult such as 'skinheads'.
It is necessary to examine the recprd of those who dress in the uniform of
shaven heads, braces outside the clothing, trousers at half mast, and heavy
boots, and from this account alone you will see that it is one of gang
violence.  This cult is not representative of the youth of this country,
the vast majority of whom are law-abiding even though a considerable number
of them are unemployed. The recent skinhead march and rampage through the
streets of Sheffield has disgusted the law-abiding citizens of this area.
'Sheffielders' and visitors to the city are being unnecessarily put in
fear. Bus drivers, conductors, passengers, shop workers, office workers,
market traders, and visitors to the city have felt the fear of massed
hooliganism, and I have received many messages of support for the first
class manner in which my patrolling officers are undertaking their very
difficult task of protecting the community.

28.    It is my duty and the duty of all police officers to prevent and
detect crime and in particular it is our duty to prevent violence from
whatever quarter it originates. The Force is a disciplined service and
everyone can be assured that I will not tolerate criminal violence by
members of my Force against members of the community.

29.    My chief officers and I did our utmost to advise against the march
which took place on Saturday 20th June. The open support given by certain
local government representatives and officials gave us cause for concern
for what we saw was likely to be and what in the end turned out to be, a
frightening rampage by an ill disciplined mob. We envisaged the danger
of attracting to Sheffield those always ready to fan the flames of
violence.  The basis of the complaints is that groups of skinheads are
constantly moved-on.  Parading by gangs of youths around the city centre
does breach the law. Police officers have a duty to uphold the law,
accepted with sensitivity, and to maintain the Queen's Peace, and this
will be done in the City of Sheffield and elsewhere in South Yorkshire.
Ask yourselves, "What is the alternative - rule by the mob?". The
skinheads can solve the problem by ceasing their aggressiveness towards
society as a whole.

30.    Despite our misgivings about the motives of some of those who have
supported and in some instances undoubtedly organised the skinheads, we
have maintained contact with the object of defusing the tension, and
                                 - 8 -



moving forward towards improving the situation for all concerned.    This
Force is committed to developing contact with all sections of the
community to establish a better rapport between the police and the
people it serves. We will work with anyone to lessen the problems of
any group, and that includes the skinheads.  I suggest we put this
distasteful episode behind us and work together in an endeavour to solve
the problems of disenchanted youth.

   These offences are those committed IN THE CITY AREA which are POSITIVELY IDENTIFIABLE as having been committed by YOUNG PERSONS IN
   THE AGE GROUP 14 TO 21. It must be appreciated that the Police records system is not geared to positively identifying the various
   ethnic groups and these figures are arrived at by meticulous research into completed files where the witness has been able to give
   the police officers a description of the offenders. This is not the whole picture of crime. During the twelve months ending
   31 May 1981 a total number of 12,405 offences of all categories were committed in this Division and the police reported or arrested
   2,944 young offenders within the age group 14 to 21. Over 50% of offences were undetected and in most of the cases no description
   of the offenders was forthcoming, therefore, it is impossible to speculate on the total involvement of young offenders in crime
   but the final percentage, if it were known, could, I believe, be high.

 I have received a request fro e th e S ecretary o f the Doncaster Rovers
 F o o tb a ll d u b Lim ited fo r a m eeting between the nh^rmfm o f the d u b
 (H r Is a Jones, a p a rtn e r in the Doncaster firm o f S o lic ito rs ,
 A tte y , Bower and Jones) to discuss th e question o f charges                  to
 the Club fo r the s e rria a e o f P o lic e O ffic e rs w ith in th e ir ground
 during matches.

 I a tta c h a summary o f th e dealings which have taken place w ith the
 Club since Legal Services D iv is io n were f i r s t involved and you w ill
 see th a t payments have been slow and th a t on one occasion i t was
 necessary to issue a w r it fo r £9803.75 in order to o b tain payment.

OShe p o s itio n w ith regard to these charges is somewaht n w i i i j , in th a t
the P o lic e A u th o rity do not appear to be a c tin g in pursuance o f any
s p e c ific s ta tu to ry power nor is the m a tte r a stra ig h tfo rw a rd
c o n tractu al one as th ere does not n e c e ss a rily have to be any
agreement between the P o lic e A u th o rity and the Football Club as
to the numbe r o f O ffio e rs req u ired on any p a rtic u la r occasion o r
as to th e sosle o f charges fo r th e ir s e rv ic e s . 2here is , I
understand, a re la tio n s h ip between the charge end the attendance
fig u re s fo r each match bu t th e r a tio o f P o lic e O ffic e rs to spectators
appears to be deaided by the P o lic e A u th o rity . From a p ra c tic a l
p o in t o f view F o o tb a ll d u b s seem to hove l i t t l e choice as to whether
or no t to make use o f P o lio e services on these occasions
the C h ie f Constable appears to take the view th a t i t is not open to
him to withdraw the services o f the P o lio e because accounts have
no t been p a id . In a d d itio n Doncaster Hovers F o o tb a ll d u b L im ited
appear to consider th a t the le v e l o f ohazges in South Y orkshire is
hig her t han in o th er areas o f the country. I enclose copies o f papers
provided by the C h ie f Constable and which throw sane lig h t on the
way in which th e charges a re c a lc u la te d .
                              *.
Doncas te r Rovers F o o tb a ll d u b are not the o n ly      experiencing

S h e ffie ld Wednesday have only recently paid overdue accounts totalling

    Dear Sir

    CHARGES FOR POLICE
    I refer to previous correspondence concerning the approved charges for
    the hire of police officers within your ground and In particular, In my
    letter dated 3 December 1980, I pointed out that the rates would rise
    again In September 1981.
    However, a recent survey has shown that the charges for the North East
    Region were substantially below those charged by other police^forces an
    it has been agreed that new standard rates should come into effecron 1
    May 1981* Details of the new rates are shown In the Appendix to tnls
    letter.
    The undertaking which I gave you at the beginning of this season will
    •till hold and that is that despite this Increase, your payment will no
    rise other than by a very small amount, because it Is not possible to
    charge for a fraction of an officer. It is important, however, that yo
    should take account of these new rates when calculating your costs for
    next season, using the number of officers agreed at the meeting oo
    22 August 1980.
    The rates will no doubt rise again later in the year, once the sice of
    the September pay award is known.

    Tours faithfully                 ^

           relatively small amount which you are* currently being charged. You                 ^

           were approved by the Police Committee, with effect from 1 November 1930.
           This alone I consider to be a valuable concession. I am hcpefultherefore
           that after having given full consideration tc- my comments you will view the

Dear Sir,

Outstanding Accounts

Z am writing in connection of the outstanding accounts which you wrote to us
about regarding police expenses at football Batches from August.

At this moment in time we are in correspondence with South Yorkshire Police
as to the amounts we are being charged as we feel that these are extremely high.

I would, therefore, be grateful if you could postpone any procedures until this                                           ■?&

  Dear Sir,
                                          ?         1
  Police Charges at Football ?Iatches

 I an writing to make a most vociferous protest against mi mimum charges being made
 against Doncaster Rovers Football Club when attendances are in the region of 2,000
 or 3»000.   Whilst making this protest, I must also point out that this will in no
 way interfere with the excellent liaison we have with the local police nor detract
 from the excellent work done by them at matches at Belle Vue.

  During the sinner a meeting was held in conjunction with a dossiergiving details
  of last seasons police involvement*in South Yorkshire and also presenting proposed
  charges based on actual attendances. * Of course, the charges were not linked with
  the number of police officers either required or actually on duty inside the ground.
  These charges are all very well for attendances above 6,000, and indeed would be xore
  than fair for d u b s in the habit of having 20,000 gates or above. Unfortunately,
  at the other end of the sliding scale, the charges become ludicrously high for a
. 2,000 gate and, indeed, leave the Club in a desperate position.                            ■




 Let me quote an example to you of the financial position of one such game already
 played this season.      _ *_           .               -               t

Ve now fin d ourselves in the embanassing p o s itio n o f having to pay these accounts
which we can ba re ly a ffo rd to do - p a r tic u la r ly on such a lim ite d budget.

The p o lic e stren g th w ith in the ground has always been more than adequate and, d esp ite             J:
th e seemingly la rg e number o f a rre s ts , th e re have never been more than the one o r two
in c id e n ts , such as the S h e ffie ld United match la s t season which was a "one o ff" and

Authority most affected, i.e. if the AMA agrees to do it.

a Secretary of State pover to nako certain rogulatior.-j.          It giv*->*n

the power to cake, revoke and vary regulations;      and to provide

in such regulations for the particulars to be given, for the

verification of the clain by various methods and i>o on.           The words .

"and all claims not nado in accordance with ouch riYf.ilations may be

excluded" in cy view also confer a power upon the Secretary of State

viz. a powar to insert in the regulations a provision excluding

claims not cade in accordance with regulations.       T"'at pover has been

exercised quite -unequivocably by Regulation 2 in relation to tine.

Moreover the regulation provides that on an application for an

extension of tine the Secretary of State's decision nhall be

conclusivc.    There is no appeal.    l*or, in vicv of tho vordlng of

Section 4 (l) of the Act can a claimant aggrieved by refusal to receive

his claim as being out of tine or by refusal to extend the time under

the proviso to regulation 2 bring an action;     only a claimant v:ho

h a had his claim received can bring an action if h* ic aggrieved

by the adjudication thereon.     X have 'Come to the d e a r conclusion

that unless the claim io delivered vithin the ti.-.o United it cannot

be received.   The compensation authority have no power whatsoever

to enlarge the time, except under and in accordr-c     with the proviso

to Regulation 2.    Only the Secretary of State con dispense generally

with the time limitation and that he can only Co l:y new regulations

made in tho proper manner revoking or varying th- present regulations.

  Regulations 1, 3> 4» 5»            7 and 8 contain what one -.vifjht regard

  as the procedure to be followed;           those regulations all .deal with

  what mist be contained in the written claim, in wh-.t !'o rz\ the claim

  must   be set out and to whom the clain must bo delivered,                 Regulation

  paymento;       Regulation 11 with costs;       and Regulation 12 aj.plita

  tho regulations to ship, cargo, machinery and nining equipment.

  Regulations 1, 3> 4» 5»            7 and 8 must in ny view be] slrictiy

  followed.        That ia not to say that any error or cni3i;icn would

  invalidate the clain.        Des oininiB non curat lex.            A   r.isspslt

 In ny view if the procedure is followed but is flawed b y crall

 and uninportant errors it is valid.              Y/hat is a cn-all .-nd uninportant

 error end vhat is an error of substance will depend uioli the

 circumstances of each case but should in practice cause no real

 8.              It follows that the claims whi c h were delivered after

St. Paul's and there is no suggestion from any quarter that
the damage to it and the loss of its stock was not referable
to the activities of those involved in a riot.      Although
that is a negative approach to a situation which in law
requires positive proof from a Claimant, it seems to me to
be a waste of time and money to press for further evidence to
support the claim.      It seems to me inevitable that it is one
we should pay.


Conformity with Regulations


There is no reason to reject this claim on any technical grounds


Consequential Loss Claim/Common Law Claim


As I have asserted in other opinions, we must be absolutely
consistent in dealing with such claims.     We must refuse to pay
this one and wait to see what this and other Claimants do        to

test the state of the law.
Quantum


We are in the hands of our adjustors and should pay what
they advise.   It matters not w h o was the tenant of the flat,
since it appears it was the owner of the premises who
suffered the loss*    If the tenant had a claimable loss, he
is too late n o w to bring it.


No doubt in deciding what part of the £3,000 should be withheld
from the flat damage claim, o ur adjustors will make and retain
relevant         so that our de cision to pay a limited sum can be
justified in Co u r t if necessary.

Dear Sir

RIOT DAMAGES - GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE

 I am attaching a copy of a letter received Coday from the Prime Minister's
 Office about Government assistance to local authorities incurring extra
 costs arising from riots.

 You will see from the letter the Government have aban4oned the usual
 approach of limiting its contribution to a proportion of expenditure in
 excess of a penny rate product in the police force area and instead made
 the test one of total extra expenditure in excess of a penny rate in the
 district in which the main rioting occurred. -It ie understood from the DOE
 that in this context total extra expenditure means the sum of expenditure
 of local authorities in the area. Thus for example,Liverpool will qualify
 for the 607o grant even if its own expenditure is less than its penny rate
 product, provided that total extra expenditure of Merseyside and its c'i ?tr£cx..s
 is in excess of the penny rate product of Liverpool.,

 You will also see that the DOE have undertaken !<> r u m m ; f iio t. ;.,<>■) nu thw« iM
 will not suffer from penalties on their Block Grant as a result t,{                a-MO f
 expenditure.  Informally DOE say that the expenditure will not count a: v o L m e
 expenditure for holdback under the Block Grant provisions, but final details
 have yet to be worked out.

 If further information becomes available I will let you have details.

Yours faithfully
#' ■ ■- $




                              10 DOWNING STREET

Fron) the Private Secretary                               10 August 1981




     I      am w r i t i n g on the Prime Minister's behalf to thank you
tor your letter of 22 July, in which you wrote about the problems
which might be caused for local authorities by the additional
police costs arising from riots and from payments made under the
Riot (Damages) Act 1886.

     Lord B e lstead made it clear at the Consultative Council on
Local Government Finance on 4 August that the Government were
prepared to help local authorities in these m a t t e r s , and were
considering how this might best be done.    I am now writing to let
you know what the Government have decided.    And in view of the
importance of the issue I am releasing the terms of this le eter
to the p r e s s .

     If the Government were to limit its contribution to a
proportion of the expenditure in excess of a penny rate product
in the police force area concerned, only one or two authorities
would benefit.  We therefore propose the following scheme.

     In an area in which the police authority has decided that
claims under the Riot (Damages) Act 1886 may be accepted, the
Government would calculate the total extra expenditure falling
on the police authority and/or the local authority as a result of

            a.   Claims under the 1886 Act;

            b.   Additional police expenditure   (e.g. Overtime,
                  mutual a i d ) ;

            c.   The costs of clearing streets   (including the
                 repair of street furniture).

       If the total extra expenditure exceeded the product of a
penny rate in the District in which the main rioting occurred
(i.e. Liverpool City in Merseyside), the police authority would
qualify for a specific grant (to be made on the authority of an
A p propriation Act) from the Home Office Vote for those
additional costs; and the District authority would qualify for a



                                                               / similar
similar grant from a DOE Vote towards its own clearing up costs.
In both cases the level of grant would be 60%, i.e. the rate at
wh i c h central Government is supporting local authorities'
e x penditure through RSG in this financial year.

     DOE will seek to ensure that local authorities will not
suffer penalties on their block grant as a result of this
expenditure.

     The Government believes that a scheme of this sort    is a sound
basis for discussion with the local authorities.

     It is necessary to stress the exceptional nature of these
proposals, which should not be seen as a precedent for future
assistance towards the costs of emergencies.     The Government will
also w i s h to limit the degree of retrospection permissible and
ensure that only expenditure directly attributable to this year's
riots is eligible for grant.

  Tiie Chief Constable tells jpe that? in his view a

  tae 10th/11th July had they been necessary.
COUNTY COUNCIL MEETING - 2 2 JULY 1981


Questions to be answered by the Chairman of the Police Committee.

 1
1\.   Will the Police Authority accept the additional equipment offered

      b y the Home Secretary?
 (
      a.     Water cannon

      3d •   CS Gas

      c.     Plastic bullets



      Suggested reply from the Chief Constable

             The Chief Constable possesses CS gas for use in connection

             with criminal hostage situations.   He does not possess

             water cannon or plastic bullets.    He is of the view that

             in a riot situation, ‘i.e. as occurred at Toxteth, he should

             have available to him equipment which will quickly quell

             a riot, with a view to preserving life, preventing injury,

             protecting property, and returning to public tranquility

             •at the earliest possible moment.   If the evaluation which

             is going on results in recommendations that-plastic bullets

             and properly designed water cannon should be made available

             to chief constables, he considers that this type of

             equipment should be purchased for the South.'Yorkshire Police,

             but only for use in a riot situation and then only with his

             personal authority or, in his absence, the authority of the

             Deputy Chief Constable.   He deplores the need to use such

             equipment, and the policing methods of the Force are designed

             to work with the community to avoid riots.      The Chief

             Constable would like to compliment the many persons who have

             assisted the police to reduce the tension in this area and

             in particular he wishes to applaud the assistance he has

             received from the ethnic minorities.



2.    Will the Chairman please inform the questioner how many riot shields

      were available for the police on the evening of 10/11 July 1981.


      Suggested reply from the Chief Constable

             The Chief Constable considers that the South Yorkshire Police

             possesses sufficient protective shields to meet their

             commitments both within the Force area and for aid as a

             national commitment to other forces.
                                 - 2 -




Would the Chairman advise the Council how the information that
hooligans were to be expected in South Yorkshire became general
knowledge to numerous members of the public on the evening of
Friday 10 July.


Suggested reply from the Chief Constable

    Over a period of at least 12 months there have been instances
    in this county of large groups of youths massing together
    and parading around the city and town centres to the concern
    of the public.   During this parading crime has been committed.
    The concern created by this sort of activity has become
    common knowledge, and stemming from that knowledge rumour and
    speculation has gather momentum and was particularly rife
    during the previous two weekends.    The South Yorkshire Police
    have done their utmost to curtail this form of activity and
   have endeavoured to stifle actual trouble to prevent the
    spread of such rumours.   We have given reassurance to the
    public through the co-operation of the media and by an obvious
   presence of uniformed police officers on the streets of this
    county.

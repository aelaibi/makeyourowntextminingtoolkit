         REPORT R E .................................................................




                                 With reference to the above I report as follows

                                 On Saturday 15th April 1989 I attended the F.A.Cup semi final between
                                 Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough, Sheffield. I attended
                                 with my son                     of Darwen Section, DC          of HQ
                                 Drugs Branch stationed at Skelmersdale and his brother
  Examined
                                 We travelled by car and because of difficulties sustained on leaving
                                 the M56 motorway at Stockport the previous year attending this
                                 similar occasion, we left Ormskirk at 11am, allowing ourselves three
® p.s.                           hours to travel the distance of about 75 miles.

                                 However, the lesson of the previous year had not been learned, as
                                 when we arrived at this same junction there was a similar backlog of
                                 traffic waiting to leave the M56. We arrived at this junction at
                                 12 noon and it took one hour to complete the final mile of that
                                 motorway.

                                 There was no control at this junction whatsoever, which is in the form
                                 of a roundabout.

                                 It did appear to me that a further section of the motorway had been
                                 completed, and was so far advanced that it already had the road
   Submitted                     markings on it. Perhaps consideration could have been given by those
                                 in charge to have utilised this section which may have reduced the
                                 backlog of traffic, having had the same experience the previous year.
            Ch./Insp.
                                 As a result, this backlog of traffic meant that the remaining 28 miles
                                 to Sheffield were in very heavy traffic. This resulted in us
                                 arriving and parking about half a mile from the Stadium about 2.20pm.

                                 The name of the road in which we parked is not                familiar to me but I
                                 can describe it as having a hospital on it and                leading to Stocksbridge.
                                 From there we walked to the Stadium and turned                to our left into
                                 Leppings Lane and to the turnstiles which were                then on our right hand
                                 side.

                                 On this particular journey we were approached by about a dozen
                                 persons asking if we had any spare tickets for the match.

                                 From leaving the car to turning into Leppings Lane the volume of
                                 supporters walking to the match was quite light. When we turned into
                                 Leppings Lane, there were a lot more supporters present, possibly
                                 in the region of about 2000. The vast majority of these did not
                                 appear to be moving towards anywhere, merely hanging about, particularly
                                 in the area round the turnstiles.




                                                                                        cont
Having had the experience of attending last years semi final, I knew
where to go, but it was obvious that others did not and certainly
I heard comments about the turnstile markings being inappropriate.

Together with my group I made my way through the crowd, not with
any great difficulty, to the turnstiles marked 'A' and 'C' and made
to the back of the queues.  I cannot recall how many turnstiles
there were, certainly no more than 10 or 12 and the queue at each
at this time, about 2.40pm would be about 15-20 deep.

We approached the turnstile entrance, my turnstile being on the
left of two together, and being supervised by a Policewoman on the
outside and both turnstiles by a Policeman on the inside.

At first, there seemed no problem queuing but as we got nearer to
the turnstile, I began to feel presure being exerted from the rear.
This never became unbearable but it did make me think that a lot
of people were arriving late, either having been for a drink or
being delayed in traffic as we had been.

Two persons only stand out as being noticeable to me from the
time I spent in the queue to the turnstile.  One I would describe
as being male, white, 25 years, 5'9" slim build, dark short hair,
wearing light coloured clothes. He was stood inbetween two
queues facing away from the Stadium drinking cans of Guinness from
a plastic carrier bag. He was in my opinion drunk.

The other youth was the person that entered the turnstile immediately
before me. He had been searched by the Policewoman prior to this.
I would describe him as being male, white, 20 years, 5'10" slim
build, short cropped ginger hair, he was wearing a green jumper and
jeans and carried a walking stick.

He was refused entry at the turnstile, obviously without a ticket.
He said to me on his way out "I'LL TRY SOMEWHERE ELSE."

Prior to him being refused, he had had a lengthy conversation with
the turnstile attendant and the Police Officer inside the ground.
This person, in attempting to get in the Stadium without a ticket,
hindered the free flow of spectators getting through the turnstiles.

Once inside the Stadium my group and I quickly made our way to our
seats in the North Stand which were row 33 seats 148, 149, 150, 151
and 152 which we reached via gangway R.   We arrived at these seats
at 2.50pm.

On looking round the Stadium it seemed as though it had filled
evenly, apart from the standing enclosures at the Leppings Lane end,
the end allocated to the Liverpool supporters. That end appeared to
have three separate enclosures. Two on the wings and a central one
behind the goal mouth.




                                            cont
 The two enclosures on the wings, although being used, were
sparsely filled with supporters, the bulk of these being at the
rear. Large open spaces were in evidence at the front, close
to the perimeter fence.

The centre section was completely filled with supporters and
having heard the expression 'packed like sardines' this would
appear appropriate in this case.

Shortly after this, both teams emerged onto the playing area and
both sets of supporters began to applaud their respective teams
including the supporters in the packed centre area behind the
goal mouth.   It appeared that although densely packed they were
not in any great discomfort.

The game started on time at 3pm with Liverpool defending the
Leppings Lane goal. Play continued until 3.06pm when I first
noticed the crowd movements behind the Leppings Lane goal.

I saw persons trying to leave the centre standing enclosure by
scaling the perimeter fencing and by being pulled up into the
seating area above the enclosure.  I had seen persons being pulled
from the enclosure into the stand at the previous season's
semi final and thought no more about it.

It was only when I saw a policeman run to the referee that I
realised that there was obviously unrest amongst the supporters.
From the small few who were attempting to leave the enclosure
at first, it quickly grew to large numbers and the supporters
began to move onto the playing area.

As this began to happen, the referee took the players off the
field to the dressing rooms. This led to a baiting of the
Liverpool supporters by Nottingham Forest supporters by singing.
Obviously, from their position in the Stadium, which was a
similar distance away from the crowd scenes as our own, they were
totally unaware of the problems that had occurred.

I appreciate that at this stage, nobody realised the full extent
of the disaster and that their thoughts were of crowd trouble as
were my own. I felt that an early announcement over the public
address system would have alleviated this problem, informing the
crowd that it was not crowd trouble but that people had been
crushed, even though the full extent of the incident was not
not known.

This baiting by the Nottingham Forest supporters caused a reaction
from the Liverpool supporters.  I saw one youth, run from the
crowds on the field towards the Forest supporters in the Spion
Kop. He was male, white, about 20 years of age, long blonde hair,
He was bare chested and had scarves wrapped around his wrist.
He had obviously become incensed by this chanting and looked as
though he was beckoning the Forest supporters to fight.

He was chased back by Police towards the crowd scenes where he was
eventually ar rested by Police Officers.

I must say that during his behaviour Liverpool supporters in the
North Stand were shouting to him to 'behave himself' and when he
was arrested, this was greeted with applause, not only from the
Forest supporters but the Liverpool supporters as well.

The failure to have an early announcement left people bewildered
as to what was going on and it was sometime later that an
announcement was made over the public address system.
Unfortunately, I am unable to say what that announcement was
because the voice of the speaker was not clear, the sound being
quiet and muffled.

As I have said earlier, it appeared that those directly involved
did not realise what was going on. It appeared on the face of it
that people were just overspilling onto the playing area.
Once onto that area, they were either wandering around or lying
down away from the crowd.  It was only when I saw stretchers being
carried across the ground that I realised people had been injured.
Shortly after that, an ambulance was driven into the Stadium and
drove along the side of the pitch directly in front of us
towards and into the goal mouth at the Leppings Lane end.

There were two incidents which involved fighting that followed
this. One in the Leppings Lane penalty area which involved a
supporter who was plainly distressed and could not be controlled
by his colleagues and who was eventually persuaded away by Police
and another in the North Stand along gangway R around the area of
row 38. I cannot give a reason why this fight started, but it was
quickly quelled by other supporters.

After a pase in the taunts of the Forest supporters, some of them
began to start singing again.  It was obvious to the remainder
of their supporters that it was inappropriate to sing at that time
and I saw the majority of them trying to persuade them trying to
persuade them not to.




                                               cont
However, the singing brought an immediate reaction from some
of the Liverpool supporters already on the playing area.   Incensed
by what they had heard and not realising that the Forest
supporters were still in the dark as to what had happened, they
reacted by a number of them, and I cannot recall how many,
charging at the Forest supporters in the Spion Kop.

It looked at this stage as though the incident might get out of
control but the police on duty at the Spion Kop end, albeitonly
a few, went to face the charging Liverpool supporters.

I saw almost simultaneously two Police Officers at the end of
the Forest penalty area, one of whom body checked a supporter
and the other withdrew his truncheon.

Both had the desired effect because the incident was over before
it started. The supporters were quickly moved away by other
supporters.

Following this, about a hundred Police reinforcements were
marched into the Stadium from the area between the North Stand
and the Spion Kop. They were positioned along the front of the
North Stand at the side of the playing area.

I can understand why they were positioned there, to prevent any
trouble from the Liverpool supporters who would have had easy
access to the playing area and were not controlled by the perimeter
fence, but this brought a hostile reaction from those supporters
who obviously felt that their services would be better equipped
helping the supporters at the Leppings Lane end.

They did not stay there long but were taken to the centre of the
playing area and used as a cordon across the half way line.
It- was still felt however, by the supporters in the North stand
that they would be better employed looking to give assistance to
the injured.

Around this time, Liverpool supporters began running to all
parts of the ground, ripping advertising hoardings from their
positions and taking them back for the injured.

At first the stretchers and advertising boards, being carried
by both supporters and police and a mixture of both, looked as
though they contained only injured persons, but as the steady
stream carried them from Leppings Lane to the playing area by the
North Stand/Spion Kop exit, the first of the dead were being
brought ver. I saw a number of dead then that followed and they
were being laid out in an area by the corner flag.

Nottingham Forest supporters were then obviously aware of what
had happened and generously applauded the Liverpool supporters
each time they ran across with the injured or dead.

It was when one of these hoardings was being carried across the
pitch that I saw the same man who I had seen earlier drinking
Guinness by the turnstiles. He was helping to carry one of those
boards.

We left Hillsborough at 3.55pm.

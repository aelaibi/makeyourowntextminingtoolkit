Dear Ms Adlington

RE: HILLSBOROUGH: ADLINGTON -v- DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY

Thank you for your recent letter of 24 August 1998 and the enclosure of statements and other
documentation. I shall consider the relevant parts of this material during my review.

I can confirm that it is my hope that I will complete my report by the end of September so
that it can be put before the Chief Crown Prosecutor and Assistant Chief Crown Prosecutor
for Central Casework. I understand that you are in communication with the latter, Mr M
Kennedy.

I have now received notice from Walker Morris (solicitors) that they have no objection to
cross disclosure of correspondence between the parties.

In response to Keva Coombes letter of 17 August 1998 I enclose a copy of the Taylor
Enquiry transcript for pm on 7 June 1989. In response to his letter of 7 August I can say
that there has been no other material in my possession although I have viewed other
documents held by the South Yorkshire Police. It may be that the CPS in 1988 and 1989
were in possession of material that was not retained by them but returned to the police. I am
unable to confirm this point one way or another.

The HFSG letter of 31 July 1998 was answered for the most part by Mr Enzor in his reply
of 4 August. The only points that I can assist with at the moment are that your letter of 20
July was not copied to the defence solicitors, and that I am not able to provide you with a
copy of Appendix 2 to item 6 of the 1990 schedule material on the basis that this will feature
in our consideration of voluntary disclosure at a later date.
Finally, thank you for your letter of today which I have just received by fax.

Yours sincerely




George R Croston

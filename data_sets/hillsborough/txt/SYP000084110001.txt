s t o o d b y with PW G I B L I N obse rv in g                 the arrival    of Liverpool          fans.        At a

point      prior to 1 pm that day we were                          pe rm itt ed by a S o u t h Y o r ks hi re

dog se ct i o n Se rg e a n t          to    leave       the    rail way sta ti on    in order        to

ex e rc is e    our dogs.

We    retu rn ed to our task at                    the    railway stat ion after about 20 mi ns or

so.     On arrival          back       I n o t i c e d a drain on the stat ion forecourt                       had a

large wet area a r o u n d              it.        I was       told this was where alcohol                  had been

poured down the d ra in a f t e r having been rem ov ed by some of the

Liverpool         fans whilst           we had been aw a y from the area.



In company with PW G I B L I N                    I conti nue d my tasks at the              r a i 1way st a t i o n

until     a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 55 pm, at that time we were                     instu cte d to take

our meal       w h i c h we did at West Bar Pol ice Stat ion .                         All    the Liver poo l

fans     I saw ar ri v i n g at             the    railway sta ti on were          orderely.



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 1 5    pm as a result             of a radio mess age          giving       the

O n ar ri v a l    numerous        other          dogs ha ndlers were         present and after a short

while     1 saw of ficers              ta ki ng their dogs           into the ground at             the

P e n n i s t o n e Road end,          I took my, dog            into the gro und at         this     stage

assuming        it was a public order                    incident.       I was only in the gr o u n d a

few mi nu t e s when a l o n g wi t h all                  the other     dog handlers we were                 told to

leave     the ground a n d s t a n d b y at our ve hi cle s                   by a S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e

in c r e a s i n g l y f r u s t r a t i n g having         to sta ndb y on the          road outs ide wh e n we

w a n t e d to go into             the ground and help.



E v e n t u a l l y we were all             instr uc te d      to enter        the ground wi th our         dogs,

this     task was a n e x t r e m e l y             precar iou s         one due    to the    large    number        of

people       running a r o u n d a s s i s t i ng wit h             casual tie s etc just          inside       the

ground,        my dog was            in an ex ci t ed state               due to the noise and general

movement.              I eventually managed                 to make my way wi th other dog handl ers

onto     the     perimeter          track across            the oppo sit e end of the ground                   to

Le p pi ng s Lane.             This      end of the gro und was                oc cu pi ed by Fo re st    fans and

we were        instru ct ed         to face        them wit h our dogs.               Whi lst   I respect           the

d e c i s i o n to have         us facing          the For est       fans      it see med to me at the time

to be u n n e c e s s a r y, m a n y fans              behind the          large fence were        in tears and

none     looked as th ou gh they were                       likely to try and            climb over onto             the

pitch.



I re mained            in that      posi ti on until           just after          it was a n n o u n c e d on the

public ad dr e s s            sy s t e m that      the game was           being ab and one d.         On the

announcement             being made          that      the game was to be a b a n d o n e d an appeal

was    to be made             to the      crowd to stay            calm and        remain wh ere they were

rather       than       leave the         gr ou nd so that           the    roads aro un d      the gr ou nd        could

be kept        clear for use              by the e m e r ge nc y vehicles?              a small     but

si g n i f i c a n t    number      of    fans      i m m e d ia te ly    left the ground.



On    1eaving the g r o u n d             I went       in company wit h PW G I B L I N          in our vehi cle

back     towards         the C i t y Ce n t r e where we had been de ta il ed a stat i c point

to mo ni t o r         fans    re t u r n i n g   from the ground.              The vast m a j o r i t y of these

fans were very quiet and subdued.                               The y were both For est and Li ver poo l

fans.       After all           the fans          had d i s p e r s e d    I ret ur ne d to N i a g a r a and

s u b s e q u e n t l y re tu r n e d to my own Force.

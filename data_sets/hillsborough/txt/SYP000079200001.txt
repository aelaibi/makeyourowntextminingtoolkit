there      had been some               sort     of trouble at H i l l s b o r o u g h and that a number

of   people         had died.          I left straight               a way an d went         home.     I put the T.

V . on at home and saw                    the    incident         develop.           They gave an em e r g e n c y

t e lephone         number         to tel e p h o n e    on the T.V.           and    straight away          I tried to

if   I got         through or          not.

M y s e l f and my wife               together      wit h friends            tried        for ages    to telephone

without       success.

paying particular attention to licensed premises and to maintain order

In respect of my duties, as I had carried out these duties before and

was aware of the likely problems nothing was raised by Inspector

W a 1ker whi ch presentsd any prob1em .

I collec te d my radio che ck ed that it wa s working,                       co11e cte d keys f o r

the transit van, and packed meals for the offficers on the serial.                                      we

commenced patrol shortly after 11.00 am.                     (1100).         As PC 3144 Robinson-

Powell had not attended the briefing and not being aware that she had

reported sick, we attended at Ecclesfield Police Station to collect

her.    It was at this stage I was informed that she had reported sick.

The serial      was then directed by me to attend at Dee pearPolice                             Station

for meal prior to commencing patrol at 11.30 am (1130).

At 11.30 am (1130) we commenced patrol in the designated area of

Wads ley and Middlewood.           Police Constable 1301 Cherry was the deputed

driver,    I was front seat passenger and the remainder were seated in

th e rear o f t h e vehicle.

It was apparent from this early stage that there were considerable

numbers of      Liverpool supporters             in the area, many walking              away from

the ground towards local public houses.

                        was made    of                                h ouses       including    the

there were         dozens       of    people    being   taken away on t h f i makeshift

                 However,          I seem          to    remember                that          the       pen      I entered                was       empty       and     tnat

                 one    of    tr.s         sarrisrs          inside             the          compound            was       twisted           ana      collapsed              on

                 the    gr o u n a .

                 i believe             i    saw    a    number             of    shoes            an     the      terracing                but       cannot        be    sure

                 whether       it          was    then       or    minuts              later           when       i was           on    the      perimeter              track.

                 1 walked          onto          the    perimeter                track            througn             tne       gate       which       was       open        and

                 then    saw       a       man    being       carried                  towards             me     and        it      was     osvious         that        he

                 was    aead       ana       I    then       saw       a    further               two      who        were        in    tha      same       way     which
            L
                 came    as    a       great       shock.              I hurried                  towards             the       pan     where         the    people

                 were     coming            out    and       assisted                with         carrying                two     bodies         out,       they        had

 p ,r s-         been    passed             out    and       they          were        both         laid         on       the     grass         to    the    left        of

                 the    goalposts                (facing          down          tne          ground)         I    cannot             r e mer noe r     what        any       of

                 these       people          looked          like          or    what          they        were           wearing.

rV*              However,          whilst          there          it       was       obvious            that          there          was     insufficient                room

                 some    of    them          saying          they          were        looking             for        a    friend          or    relative           or

                 surprising.

                 reckoned       were             laughing          at       them.             A     number            of     them       Degan         running           up

                          Whilst             1    had       been      in    the        ground       I never           saw       any     stewards,             at    the

                           I       expected             that        shortly           after       entering           Che    ground              full    use    would       be

             ground       and      attended                at      the     briefing           and       together          with       my       detail          were          .

             11.10       am.       I    remained                at    that       location           until       shortly          aftar             3    o ’clock.

            Pedestrian             traffic              built         up    gradually              but    the    majority                of    supporters

             passing         us    were          Nottingham                Forest       suporters           but       I    saw       a    number             of

            Liverpool             supporters                  shortly        after        the       commencement                of       licensing

            hours        drunk       and         a    good         many     of     them       carrying          cans       of    beer.                 However

            this       was     not      just          Liverpool             supporters              but    Notts          Forest          supporters                   as

            well.

            Traffic          on    the       road          became          busy     especially             with       coaches             but_ b e g a n _

Approaching                 3       o ’clock            it   was        clearly             evident           that       the    majority          of

Notts       Forest              supporters                   had    arrived                at    the     ground          but    the    Liverpool

supporters              were             still          streaming                down       towards           the    ground          from    the

opposite           side             of    the       roundabout.                      However,            we    were       constantly             being

asked        by    Liverpool                   supporters                   in       cars       where     they       could          park    their

cars    right           up          till       the       last       minute             and       the     fans       were       directed          up    past

Niagara           on    the          main          road.

As    tjne       time       neared             kick          off,       I was          stood       near        the       Sergeant          and    heard

on    the        radio          about          problems             being             experienced              at    the       Leppings          Lane

end    and        repeated                requests                from       somebody,             I     believe          Supt.       Marshall             to

open    the        gates             or       people             were       going          to    get     killed.

I    then        heard          a    request             that       all          available             officers           attend       at    the

Leppings           Lane             end       which          I    did       together             with     all       my    serial.

On    arrival           the          forecourt                   into       the       ground       was        cleared          of    fans    and

there        were       a       number             of    mounted             officers             present           and    numbers          of    police

officers           milling                about.

A    drunken           Liverpool                   supporter                was       stood nearby              and       about       twenty          or

thirty           Liverpool                 supporters                   were         in     the near          vicinity          the    majority             of

them     drinking.

We    were        then          instructed                   to    form          a    cordon       and        prevent          any    more

Liverpool              supporters                   into          the       ground          until        further          notice.

The    drunken              supporter                   mentioned                earlier          began        arguing          with       one    of       the

mounted           officers                 insisting                on      his        r i g h t to      enter       the       ground       and

unfortunately                       he     was          knocked             over      and        I believe          the    horse       stood           o n hitr

After        a    few       minutes                stood          outside,             I saw       Supt.        Marshall             hurry       towards

us    and        told       us       to       go    into          the       ground          as    -our    help       was       needed.           At    that

point        I thought                   that       there          had       been          crowd       trouble           and    on    entering             the

terraces           saw          that          there          were       a    large          number        of    people          on    the    pitch          I

thought           there             had       been       a       pitch       invasion.

However,           I    seem             to    remember             that             the    pen    I     entered          was       empty    and       that
                                                                                                    PAGE 3

                                                                                                    R155

one of the barriers              inside        the compound was twisted and collapsed on the

ground.

I    believe    I    saw    a number       of     shoes    on    the   terracing       but     cannot   be   sure

whether it was then or minutes later when I was on the perimeter track.                                          I

walked onto the perimeter                  track through          the gate which was open and then

saw a man being carried towards me and it was obvious that he was dead and

I then saw a further               two who were           in the same way which came as a great

shock...      I hurried        towards      the    pen    where     the   people       were    coming out      and

assisted with carrying                  two bodies       out,    they had been passed out and they

were both laid on the grass to the left of the goalposts                                     (facing down the

ground) I cannot remember what any of these people looked like or what they

were waering.

However,       whilst      there    it was       obvious    that there was insufficient room to

lay the people down and I tried together with other officers, including an

Inspector,       to clear more ground to the left of the goals.                                However,      there

were large numbers of Liverpool supporters wandering a b o u t , again many of

them    drunk    and continually               getting    in the way,           some of them saying they

were looking for a friend or relative or acquaintance.

The     scene    was       one     of    total     confusion        and     I    was     not    aware of      any

■organisation,        but    due ^to the          fact    that    it had happened so unexpectedly,

this is not surprising.

By    this    time    numbers      of    the    Liverpool        supporters, including particularly

youths of 17-25 age group, many of them the worse for drink, began shouting

abuse    at    the    Notts      Forest    supporters       who     they reckoned were            laughing at

them.      A number of them began running up the field towards the Notts Forest

end, together with other officers I followed and turned them back.

Once    this    had     been     done     their    rage    was     turned       on us,    we   formed   a line

across the field and I was stood on the left hand side together with Police

Constable    Brookshaw    (Al),   Police   Constable   3131   Lewis   (FI?)   and   whilst

there, was    subject    to quite an amount of abuse,         "You black bastards",        "I

hope you're fucking happy now you bastards", and others.

A lot of it was also aimed towards the F.A.

I remained at this point until about 4.35 p.m. when I returned to my serial

on Herries Road.

Whilst I had been in the ground I never saw any stewards, at the Leppings

Lane end especially on entering the ground.            Throughout the period I was in

the ground I had no idea what was going off as I had become separated from

my serial.

                    States:
    1.   I was born on the 14th January 1940.
    2.   I am a Control Superintendent.         I havebeen with SYMAS   for
         21 years.     I was promoted to Control Officer In 1975, based
         at Dunford House, Wath.       I was moved to Fairfield as Control
         Officer in 1979 and promoted to Control Superintendent in
         1979/80.
    3.   On Thursday and Friday I worked 2200 hours to 0600 hours.
         On Saturday I was down for the same shift.
    4.   I was phoned by my son at about 1515 and asked what was
         happening at Hillsborough.       I switched on the T.V. and saw
         that   an    incident      a ppeared   to   be taking place     at
         Hillsborough.        Control did not ring me.   I rang Control at
         about 1630 to see if they wanted me in.                        said
         that   she would speak to         Mr   Smith.    Aft e r   a brief
         conversation she said that there were enough people already
         at Control and that I should come in on nights as normal.
         I got in at about 2150 and took over at 2200 hours.            The
         situation was quiet with the usual routine calls. There
         were a few calls coming in from the press.
         The only thing that we did organise related to the moving of
         the bodies from the Hillsborough gymnasium to the Medico
         Legal Centre.                   radioed in from time to time to
         let us know what was happening and Morley came on the radio
         at about 0530 to say that the moving of bodies had been
         completed.
         I completed my shift at 0600.           I was aware of the Major




s
     Incident Plan and the Hillsborough Plan.

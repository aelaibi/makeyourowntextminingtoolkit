were     coming    in.     I cannot       remember          seeing a s l ^ a r d      at this       gate.

were     pale and       looked    ill and m an y were            scr ea mi ng an d       crying.

It was a s e e thing mass           of    people.

liy first       thoughts were       to stop the             crush.     It a p p e a r e d to me that

           people        scr e a m in g    from the         centre      pen.      I remember        one y ou th saying            it

           saw     pile     of peopl>>^_laid on tne terrace                        at the front.           This was         the

           first      time      that      I had seen         people       not    in an upright         position.           Some     of

           them were          purple       or blue         in the    face.        It was     only at     that      time     that       I

           thought        people may have              died.        I was s h oc ke d and drai ne d both m e n t a l l y

           that     this     had been done.                 I saw that          people     on the    perimeter           track

               w ere    unable      to get       into       the    terrace,         due    to the secur it y fence.               It

               was     obvious      that       the    fence       had to be d i sm a n t l e d quickly,             or    cut.        I

               again     radioed       control         room,       as ki ng     for bolt         croppers.      I did not         hear

               a    reply,    but     heard      c o n v e r s at i on on the          radio.

               On my next          return to the gate,                   the    same PC a sk ed me how             I was.        He

               said,        "Are you a l ri g ht Serg",                  I said,          " I ’m fucked".       I was      tired and

               my min d didn't            seem to be functioning.                         He    said,     "Come out.        We'll

               get     s o m ebody fresh         in".        I remember             thinking      that was a good          idea and

               he    helped me        up onto         the    track.

               By    this    time     it can oni^sbe               d es c ri b ed as       bedlam.        There were       police

               officers,          supporters,          first aid          people and            stewards,    milling about.

               br ea th and        composure          and then went             to the         crowd of    people at the gate

               of the       centre     pen.          Petiole      in a col la ps ed state were               being       handed out

               laid him down,             his eyes were wide and staring.                               Inspector H ar ve y was

               open the man's             shirt and          began       chest massage.                I remember    the shirt

               was an off white                colour,       w ith a faint            brown      pattern.     We tried

                   e s u s c i t a t i o n for a bout 2 or 3 minutes,                     but    it was a pp arent        that    the

               /nan was      dead.        As    I stood        up I looked at              Inspector H a rvey,           he was

               I felt       so helpless.              Some     other      people       came,      I d o n ’t know who,       and

              I am a single man and reside at the/above address with my parents

              am a



              I am a Liverpool Football Club supporter and last season he 1d a season

              ticket, and went to all the home games and a few away games-



              I attended the Semi-Final          football match between Liverpool an* Notts

              Forest at Hillsborough,         Sheffield on Saturday 15th April        l4?^?


$r.       ,   <150489).

             'for the game.
                               I obtained a £6 Leppings Lane terrace ticket/from Anfiel/d

                                   I also booked a sea I on a bunspan                 Co coach

              travel to the match with my friends



              On the day of the match I got the coach in Birkenhead near to the bus
                                                                          PAGE    2
                                                                          S3632

station,    together with          and            We left Birkenhead at

about   11 am (1100) and stopped at a Service Stat ion on the motorway

before arriving at Sheffield.        We did not suffer any long traffic:

delays and arrived in Sheffield at about      1.45pm (1345).      The coach

was parked in a street with other coaches about five to ten minutes

walk to the ground.      The three of us walked around for some time

looking for something to eat and afte^ this we made dur way to the

ground.      I saw a few fans drinking from cans on the way to the ground

but I did not see anyone drunk or in trouble.                       7



We arrived at the Leppings Lane turnstiles at about                 3).      At

this time there was not many people outside the turi                    We

walked to a turnstile,      gave up our ticket stubs and into the ground.

I was searched by a policewoman inside the ground and made my way

towards a tunnel which was straight ahead.        1 had not been to the

ground before and just presumed that way/was the way to the terrace.



The three of us went down the t u n n e / which was not crowded at this

time and you could walk along quifee normally and was not pushed along.

When I came out of the tunnel      into the terrace 1 saw metal    fence

straight ahead, which ran down the terrace to the perimeter fence.                I

went to the right into Pen three with my friends and stood about half

way down the terrace near to the centre fence I described.           On taking

up this position the pen was not crowded and I could move around

freely.      While standing   in this position I saw the players    come out

into the pitch first     in their tracksuits and later to start the match

pro p er.



I think     it was about five minutes to three   (1455/ when there was a big

surge from behind me and I was pushed from a position at the centre
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               S3632

fence which I had climbed onto the bottom railing                into the middle of

Pen three and slightly nearer the pitch.                There was no way I

could help myself,        I was just pushed along and against barriers as 1

went.     During this time I was turned all ways and was very

frightened.        I could hear people screaming and shouting for help.                     I

remember one woman near me screaming for help but I couldn't do

anything for her because my arms were trapped down by my sides and I

could not move at all.           I would describe the woman as about         18-25yrs

blonde hair,    she was wearing sun glasses and I saw them fall off.                    I

cannot say what she was wearing or what happened to her after this.



I had lost contact with my friends                      and          and did not see

them again until back at the coach a lot later



I was trapped      in    the centre of the pen for five to            ten minutes and

could not move except for being           pushed    around the terrace by the

surging   crowd.        I was aware the game was going on but did not see any

of it.     I was still very worried for my own safety because of the

surging   crowd.



I saw geo pie start to climb          over the perimeter fence       a X the front of

the pen, onto the pitch and           people were still screapang and shouting

all around rne.         I was in pain and having difficulty breathing because

of the crowd crush.          The next thing I realise was being at the back

of the pen underneath the West Stand.              / I do not really know M w       I got

there I remember         being pushed ar o u n d ^ / lot.     From    the rear ofth pen

I made my way to         the tunnel and out to the rear of            the/stand. I
                                                                        .
remember other people going           out the tunnel but no o c o m i n g    down    the

tunnel towards the terrace.
                                                                                PAGE        4
                                                                                S3632

       I have marked two positions on a separate grid plan which I produce

       (Ex No         )(Ref No         these positions are marked as numbers 1 and

       number 2 .



        s I went along the tunnel      I did not see any dead 9/     injured people at

       all.       I did see one man shouting at mounted police at the rear of tt

       tunne1 .     He was shouting at them to get down the tunnel       but theyyrode

       off the other way,



       I made my way around t y the right and into the Leppings Lane terrace
   A   near to the North Star»d.      At this point there was plenty of room to
V *'   move around without being      pushed or crushed.     I saw that the play

       had left the pitch by now and I saw a lot of        fans on   the pitch so

       which were carrying people on boards across the pitch towards.               The

       Spion Kop end of the ground I also saw people on the pitch being

       treated by mainly St J o h n ’s personnel.



       I went through a gate in the perimeter fence        pnto the / itch to   look

       for my mates but I didn't find them.



       I did not have any dealings with any dead or injured people by the

       time   I had got onto the pitch most of the dead and injured had been

       removed.



       I wandered around the pitch'for half an hour or more,          I heard       GLISH

       f— ■■
           "—
       on the Tannoy whilst      I was on the pitch.   I remember St J o h n ’s giving

       people water to drink but I cannot describe any dead or injured people <



       After some time I climbed through a hole which had been torn ii/Pen

       three and walked up the terrace and again up the tunnel and aait of the
                                                                           WWWWtw

ground.     Before    leaving the ground I saw that a barrier        in Pen three

was broken and there was just a few people in the pen crying and

upset.      I waited at the rear of the stand for a while          in case my

friends came along but then went back to the coach.            Before arriving

at the coach I wanted to ring my parents and saw a large queue at a

private house waiting to phone,        I gave my details to a woman from the

house and she rang my parents for me which was very kind.



1 later met             and           near the coach and we boarded the coach

                   runs    in front of the turnstiles.

                   The volume         of s p e c t a t o r s       increased as the daywejn^on_.                      P e o p l e were

           Officers       it was    impossible          to do any^hijng about            it.    I was

           c ontinually a t t e m p t i n g    to keep both the            footpath and roadway                clear of

           s p ectators who were            just   intent     on standing around.

           A couple of        coaches a r r i v e d at the L e p p i n g s Lane           end of the ground,

           w h i c h was u n p l a n n e d and these were           emptied and the fans             dealt w ith

           accordingly.          Some alchohol          was   brought^jan^ one of these              cctac^hes and

           the driver was          i m m e d iately v erba l l y     c a u t i o ned.

           A ssis t a n c e   in clearing the           road and     paths was given fcQ^moujnted

           o fficers      from time to time.

      /    By about 2 pm the amount                of    people     in the area had gnown and by now

           m any   people were       stood around djj^ijnkjung and gen e r a l l y obsTtjjjjcting the

           other.

           A n aVtempt was made             to take the        prisoners       tc^ the P o ^ i c e ^ o o r o

           Gate,     however     this was      impractical          due to the          large   crowds    outside

           the turnstiles.            We then went down Vere Roa d to the Po l i c e Room.

           Whilst we were          going down Vere Road,              fans were jumping             over the

           barriers and as k i n g to buy the tickets                     of those arrested.

           This had been the general                order      of the day.          Man y fans were wan d t M ^ n g

c /        a r o u n d wanting     to buy ti c k e t s , o b v i o u s l y many people had a t t e n d e d at

           the ground with o u t         tickets.

           At one       point   one fan a p p r o a c h e d w i t h an obvious            f orged t i c k e t ,

            photocopied,        w h i c h he had     paid £ 2 0 for.

           The     prisoner was       booked       in and     I then a t t e n d e d at the Gy m to do

            paperwo r k .

            At about 3 pm all a v a i l a b l e          offi cers were         requested.

              gate     I saw fans     laid on the floor,             distressed.       I a s s i s t e d as   best      I

              could and then went            towards the tunnel             w h i c h gives access      to the

             terraces.        O f f i c e r s were at this      location tending victims,                I went       on

                  the terraces and a s s i s t e d          in the    |^l^^^£jick       of the fen cing          in

             order     to assist     people to getjjuIU

             I saw m any bodies                 one u p o n anot h e r       on the terraces.           The

             m a j o r i t y of w h i c h a p p e a r e d dead I then a s s i s t e d w i t h other officers

             in p icking up maybe           half a dozen bodies and pas^jng^ them t h r o u g h the

             fencing to other          officers.

             I do not know who             I passed them to,          nor    can I describe a n y of the

             bodies     I dealt with.         All    t he bodies       I m o v e d were ^ o m _ t h e    f l o o r on

             the terraces.

             I regularly work at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football           C l u b and always        in

             the same      location,       L e p pings Lane     on coach reception.             I w o r k e d the

             same semi-final         last year.

             E v e n t u a l l y we were   taken from the t e r races and            resumed.

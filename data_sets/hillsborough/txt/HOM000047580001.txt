RE: REQUEST FOR 24 BODY FILES

I refer to your letter of 22 October 1997 in which you request we send you 24 original body files
and the supplementary body files, ie those containing material that was not presented to the
inquest.

Ken Greenway will hand over to you 48 files on Wednesday 29 October 1997, that is 2 files for
each of the deceased persons named on the attached list.

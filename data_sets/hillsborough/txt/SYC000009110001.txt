  NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                    Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.
3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                          Re
     C.D. died from the industrial disease of

     C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
     on drugs.
     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                    Cause of death
     care/self-neglect').

   b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
     infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
     of the following forms be adopted:
     C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
     his/her mind was disturbed).

     C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self-
     induced abortion.                                                    Verdict
     C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.
  c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
    it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.
  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
    complete the remainder of the form.

                Dear Sirs,
                                                         !
                Re:    R E S UM E D INQUESTS 19th N O VEMBER 1990.



                If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
                of the 95 people w h o died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
                on the 19th of N o v e m b e r 1990 at 1 0.a.m. Details of venue w i l l be n o t i f i e d in
                due course.

                I do not have to remind you of the fact that a c o n s iderable amount of
                evidence has already b e e n taken, n or of the nature and limitations of a
                coronal i n v e s t i g at i o n w h i c h you w i l l recollect is not a d v e rs a r i al but
                i n q u i s i to r i a l in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

                Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ A ct 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
                under m y control, and in particular, it is m y respon s i b i li t y to select the

o               w i t n e s se s w h o w i s h to give evidence.    I am at present engaged in co n sidering
                this and in d e t e r m in i n g w h o I w i s h to invite to attend.

                W i t h o u t prejudice in any w a y to m y rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
                to give you an o p p o r t un i t y to draw to my at t e n ti o n the names and other
                appr op r i a t e details of any witness or w i tn esses w h o m you w o u l d like me to
                c o n s i d er call i ng to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

                May I please ask you in considering w h e t h e r you w i s h to d ra w any names                          to my
                attention, to be ar in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

                I also w a n t to ma ke it absolutely clear that the submi ss i o n of a name or
                names for c o n s i d e r a t i o n is nothing more than that, and that the dec i s i o n as
                to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

                I w o u l d be g rateful if y ou could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
                h e ar d from you by the end of SeptenjJaer I w i l l assume you have no names to
                submit.

Dear Dr Popper,

RE:   Peter Francis Tootle

I have recently seen Mr and Mrs Tootle and been through Peter's Summary
with them.

They have no questions to raise on it's contents but they would like a
copy of the photograph referred to if possible and I am enclosing my
questionnaire with this request in formal terms.

Mr and Mrs Tootle will be present in Court to hear the Summary presented.

I trust this information is of assistance.

Yours Fait

Dear Dr Popper,

RE:   Peter Francis Tootle

I have recently seen Mr and M rs Tootle and been through Peter's Summary
with them.

They have no questions to raise on it's contents but they w ou l d like a
copy of the photog ra p h r e ferred to if possible and I am e nc losing my
qu estionnaire wit h this request in formal terms.

Mr and Mrs Tootle will be present in Court to hear the Summary presented.

I trust this i n f ormation is of assistance.

Yours Faith.

             Sir.,

aeI ssras r.               tooma         (aeosssea). se.jj.
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not*to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner.

        Dear Sirs,

        You will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
        reports until the resumption of the Inquest, ’-hen they are
        in fact put in as evidence.

        However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
        and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
        I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
        I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
        report of your clisnt(s).

        The release of these post mortem reports are cn the basis that:-

                 a.      They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                         subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                         they are given or produced in evidence at the Inauest.

                 b.      'They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
                         conselling of the deceased's relatives or for proper
                         legitimate purposes in connection with any legal proceedings
                         in which solicitors may be engaged.

                 c.      Subject to tha-;akov§, they are to be kept confidential until
                         they come into the public domain at the resumed Inauests.

        I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
        of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
        assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
        each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
        above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
        I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
        reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
        the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

        The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is   r ft per sheet (total
                                                                               ^U-7r                  )
        Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

     4th July 1989

     De a r Mr Popper

     I write following my very helpful conversation this a ft e r n oo n w it h Mr Thompson
     from y o u r office to confirm a number of points.

     Firstly, I u nderstand that y o u are favourably inclined towards the requests
     that y o u have r ecieved from a number of Solicitors to rele a se copies of
     the P o st - M o rt e m Reports on the victims of the H i ll s b o r o u g h D i s as t e r in advance
     of r e s u me d Inquest Hearings and in this regard might I ask y ou to let me
     have copies of the Reports on the deceased n amed in the a t ta c h e d list the
     f a milies of whom I respresent.

     There is a strong feeling from many of the families that early rec e i pt of copies
     of the P.M. Reports would be beneficial both in terms of a n s we r i n g some
     h i te r t o unansw e re d questions and also in perhaps r e d u c i ng the anguish which
     might be suffered when full details of the cause of death become known at a
     public hear i n g perhaps some weeks or months hence.

     If p a ym e n t is req u i r e d for copies of any of the Reports then n eedless to say

Dear Mr Tootle
I have now had an opportunity to look at the names which you have asked
me to consider for inc. uslon.
I should mention that as you are apparently represented by Mr King*
am sending a copy of my reply to Miss Kennah.
We can find no trace of anv statements from T                     ____
      ___________                        __ _ _ _ _ In the circumstances
It is not practical for me to consider whether their evidence, If any,
would be relevant.
tilth regard to the remainder. I do not think that
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ say anything which we have not already heard
or are likely to hear. With regard to the remainder,
                        I am reserving n\y position as to whether they can or
Should be called.
Yours sincerely

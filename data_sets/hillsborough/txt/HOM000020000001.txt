             Dear Sir

            Wales v New Zealand - 4 November 1989

            I enclose a Schedule suggested for Lord Justice Taylor's visit to the National
            Ground on Saturday week. Personnel from the Welsh Rugby Union and the
            South Glamorgan County Council Working Party will be readily available
            throughout the afternoon and the Schedule has, therefore, been left somewhat
            open.

            Passes for Lord Justice Taylor and yourself to allow you access to all parts
            of the National Ground will be made available on your arrival at the ground.

            I trust that these arrangements are satisfactory but if there is anything at
            all I can do to assist, please do not hesitate to let me know.

            Best wishes.

            Yours sincerely




            E H JONES
            ACTING SECRETARY

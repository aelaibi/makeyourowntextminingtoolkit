FA/HILLSBOROUGH

Glen Kirton telephoned. He wanted to make me aware of a
conversation he had had with Barry Devonside who was ringing
on behalf of the bereaved and injured. He was anxious to
learn more about the Sheffield United Safety Certificate.
Glen had reiterated the facts before the Public Inquiry ie
that Sheffield United as with 12 other clubs had been
approached to stage the semi-final and that the FA did not
realise at the time that they did not have a valid Safety
Certificate. He just thought he would let me know. He had
appeared on Sky TV with Mr JDevonside on the day the report
was published and believed^Ci be a reasonable man although
he thought that he may have lost two daughters himself in
the tragedy.

Engaged 10 minutes including dictation

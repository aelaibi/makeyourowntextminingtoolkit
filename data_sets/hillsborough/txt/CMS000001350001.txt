HILLSBOROUGH:   LETTER TO JOHN CARLISLE MP
In Peter Bolton's absence on leave I attach a draft of a letter
prepared following the meeting with the Home Secretary on
7 September, paragraph Â° f of the note of that meeting refers to
the release of the letter to the press.
Private Office are anxious for a draft today.    Can I press you
for any comments (telephone will do) today       so that I can
incorporate them into the draft and submit.




                                         D J MOULD

h s .9.15/hillsb4.dm

You asked me whether the Home Office was satisfied with the
response of the football clubs, local authorities and others
to the recommendations in the Interim Report of Lord Justice
Taylor's       inquiry into the Hillsborough tragedy.                    I should
perhaps first of all set out what we expected people to do
or to be doing.

You     will    know   that    our    immediate     action    on    the    day   of
publication of the interim report on 4 August was to issue a
circular       letter with      copies of the report to the police,
local authorities, other emergency services, football clubs
and to     sports      organisations      urging     them    all to take the
action required         in order to          implement,     as necessary,        the
inquiry's       recommendations        without      delay.         The    circular
letter also reminded local authorities of their power under
the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) for use
 if there is judged to be a serious risk to spectators in any
part of a sports ground.

The     Government      is    conscious      that   the    1975    Act    does   not
 empower any central authority to supervise the way in which
 local    authorities        carry out their safety responsibilities
 under it.          Lord Justice Taylor has indicated that he will
 consider whether there should be some national oversight or
 inspection of local authority responsibilities in relation
 to safety in sports grounds in stage 2 of his Inquiry.                          You
 will know from your involvement with the Football Spectators
 Bill    that the Government has already amended the Bill                         so
 that, if it is considered right, this supervisory role could
 be given to the proposed Football                   Licensing Authority          in.
 respect       of   grounds    to    which    the   Bill    applies.        In   the
 meantime the Home Office is keeping under review, primarily
 through the police and Fire Service, the extent to which the
 interim        recommendations        are     being      implemented      at    the
 football league grounds.              Indications are that in generaL
 there is no unwillingness to implement the recommendations,
 that all the parties concerned have addressed them and have
either      put        them     into    effect    or,     where        that        was    not
immediately possible, have the matter in hand.                                   There have
been some practical difficulties at some grounds and some
difficulties           of     interpretation.            This    was        only     to    be
expected given the variation between grounds whose layout
and format do not necessarily conform precisely to those at
Hillsborough on which the recommendations                             are based.           We
have helped to resolve them where we can.                                  Our advice is
that the recommendations should be complied with wherever
possible       but          that   where     an        alternative          solution       is
unavoidable, it must be one which meets the intention of the
recommendation by providing at least an equivalent degree of
safety.


I     understand            that   the     application           of    the        Inquiry's
recommendation relating to reduction of terrace capacities
and the checking of numbers has caused some kick-offs to be
delayed and that some would-be spectators have been unable
to gain entry to some grounds.                    I am satisfied however that
it    is    a prudent          precaution    to    impose        the       15%    reduction
recommended by the Inquiry as an interim measure until we
can be satisfied that calculations of terrace capacities at
football grounds are correct.


We    shall       be     taking    up    with     local    or     other authorities
concerned any            case which isreportedto us where it appears
that the Report's recommendations have not been implemented.
The option referred to in our circular letter of enforcing
the       Report's       recommendations          by     means        of    a     statutory
instrument             requiring        safety     certificates              to     include
mandatory terms and conditions remains open and we have not
ruled      it out.            Whether further measures are necessary to
secure improvements in public safety at sports grounds will
be    a    matter        for    decision when      Lord     Justice              Taylor   has
published his            final report.

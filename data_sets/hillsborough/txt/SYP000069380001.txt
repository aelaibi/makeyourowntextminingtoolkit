                 At 0830 on Saturday 15 April            1989,   I reported at Hackenthorpe       in full

                 Police uniform.        I was de p 1oyed on ser ial 5, supervised by PS 1088
                   / #          v    <    ?    -------------------------------------------
                 H O D G E T T . The serial was then transported to Hillsborough Football

                 ground whereupon all serials were briefed.                   The deployment of serial 5

                 was on t/He South Staiiyk en trances 21 to 28,

                 I was outside turnstiles entrance F, searching fans who were entering

                 by that turnstile.         I remained at that         location until approx     1505

                 whereupon 1 was asked by another Sergeant to help clear the way along

                 the side of the South Stand so as to enable ambulances to leave the

                 ground with casualties at this stage               I became aware of a problem

                 inside the ground.

                 After assisting with the clearance of the passageway I then went to

                 the entrance        19-22 E entrance to assist other officers who were
                                                                                       PAGE       2
  * *.   i
                                                                                       S 1364

             helping with casualties from inside the ground.           For the next few

             hours    Iwas assisting with carrying     casualties from inside the

             jntrance E 19-22     and assisting with the carrying of several         bodies who

             were    carried on the stretchers   (bo ard s) to outside that entrance to

             wait for ambulance to transport to h o s p i t a l .   At no time did I go onto

             the pitch.

         '   The mood of the fans at entrance F were one of a jovial mood all of
 ^     ft    which were Nottingham Forest fans, and it was quite apparent that
c u to
             a1 coho 1   had been consumed by a large amount of these f a n s , but not in

             excess.      Regards to the stewards on the entrance F there were none in

             attendance,    the only ones I saw we re near to entrance 2 7 - 2 8 .

             Regarding the radio transmissions       I was not aware of any of the

             incidents which were happening due to the fact          I did not have a radio

             and there was not one      in the immediate   location.

             I. assisted with approx 20-24 casualties of which three appeared to be

             dead.     I assisted with talking to and reassuring the injured, which

             were    outside entrance   19-22.

                                                                    T A CARTWRIGHT SIGNED

              COMPLAINT AGAINST POLICE

              I refer to your letter of 30 August 1989 which was received at this ,
              Police Headquarters yesterday morning by the Chief Constable, Mr Deai
              He has asked me to reply.
                                                                                                                                K
              We acknowledge safe receipt of the copy statements made by Leigh
                                                                                                                                    t
              (277/F33/89) and Hicks (278/F34/89) which contain allegations against
              certain members of your Force.

              You will probably by now be aware that Mr Dear spoke to your Chief
              Constable yesterday, shortly after lunchtime, to indicate that at this
              time we have not formally accepted the criminal/discipline investigation
              until we have received the written assurance as far as the financial
              circumstances are concerned.  I understand from Mr Dear that Mr Wright
              fully appreciated the position we are in, given that our Police Authority
              has made it quite clear that we should not take on any additional
              investigatory responsibility until that written assurance had been
              received. This means that we are not in a position to become the
              Investigating Officers and, therefore, be in a position to serve Notices
              on the affected officers in accordance with Regulation 7 of the Police
              Discipline Regulations. It was agreed between Mr Wright and Mr Dear
              that the existing Investigating Officer already appointed, Mr Ken Cooper
              of Northamptonshire, should undertake the service of those Notices
              without delay. At Mr Wright's suggestion, Mr Dear agreed to telephone
              Captain Taylor at the Police Complaints Authority as to the decision.




     PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
                                                     Lloyd H o u s e ? Birmingham
                                   -   2 -




Shortly afterwards Mr Dear rang Captain Taylor at his office at the
Police Complaints Authority. Captain Taylor agreed with the decision
that Mr Wright and Mr Dear had reached and said that he would contact
Mr Cooper for the action to be taken as quickly as possible.

In the meantime our investigation continues to satisfy the needs of the
Coroner.  To a large extent these enquiries are related to the criminal
inquiry and, therefore, nothing is being lost at this time in impetus.
However, there will come a time when I will not be able to undertake
'new work' for the criminal inquiry until we have received the assurance
from your Police Authority.  I know we both agree the sooner that
clarification comes from the Home Office to your Police Authority, the
better it will be for unhindered progress of the overall investigation.

I trust this clarifies the latest position.  If you wish to discuss
further please do not hesitate to make contact.  I have taken the liberty
of copying this letter to Captain Taylor for his information.

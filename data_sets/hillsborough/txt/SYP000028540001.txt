REPORT'   BY PAUL ARTHUR RIMMER         BSc AUMIST

Material submitted for examination by Inspector Willis, West Midlands Police,
Nechells, in accordance with receipt dated 1 June 1989-

 RESULT OF EXAMINATION

 I have examined the tickets IDEL1 to 100 and compared them with the specimen ticket
 item IDEL1A. The following are my findings

 1. The specimen ticket bears a printed 'owl* logo which is only visible under ultra
 violet light. All of the questioned tickets, with the exception of items IDEL57
 and 96 where the right hand side is missing, bear this ’owl’ logo.

 2. The purple printing on the questioned tickets is of comparable quality to the
 specimen ticket and appears to have been produced by the same printing method.

 I can best summarise my findings by saying that I have found no evidence to suggest
 that any of the questioned tickets items IDEL1 to 100 are counterfeits.

 The documents are returned herewith.

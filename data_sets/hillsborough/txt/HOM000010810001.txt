The t erms o f reference of the Inqu i r y led by the Rt Hon Lord

’ To inquire into the e v e n ts at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y f o o t b a l l

The All-Party Football Commi ttee b r i n g s together m e m b e r s of
both the House of C om mo ns and the H o u s e of L o r d s to disc u s s
issues associated with the g a m e . The aim of the C o m m i t t e e is
to s up p o r t the interests of the game w h e n e v e r it is apparant
that 1 eg islators can be of assi st a n c e to the s p o r t . Over 120
H P ’s and Lords are now members.


The C o m m i t t e e decided to su b m i t e v i d e n c e on the second part
of the terms of reference of the H i l l s b o r o u g h S ta d i u m
D i s as te r Inquiry; C o m m i t t e e m e m b e r s who were present at the
match on April 15th have a l r e a d y given their s p e c i f i c
evidence.

from b o t h Houses. The e v i d e n c e f a l l s into two m a j o r a r e a s :

2. SAFETY,


2.1     All-s e a t e d groun ds . The trend shoul d be towards
a l 1-seater stadia. T er ra c e s , however, are not inherently
d an ge r o u s and an al 1 - se a t e r ’so 1u t i o n ’ is not relevant,, to
m a n y smaller clubs. Th e F irs t D i v i s i o n clubs should mov e
rapi d l y to change the 2 : 1 s t a n d i n g / seated ratio.


2. 2  Fences. W here p o ssible, -fences sh ould be removed. Al 1
■fences in -front o-f seats, -family enc losures, junior a reas and
disabled faci l i t i e s s h o u l d be removed. Elsewhere, fences in
front of terraces s h ou ld coll aps e / o p e n fully in an emergency
or should be 1ow e n o u g h to act as a d e t e r a n t , not a barr ier.
Access should be p o s s i b l e to the pitch in an emergency. The
provi s i o n s of the S a f e t y of S p o r t s Grou n d s Act should be
reviewed. The Footb al l A u t h o r i t i e s should m ake clear whether
a result will stand if a m at ch is aba n d o n e d due to a ’pitch
i nvasi on ’ .


2.3      S a f et y checks. I m m e d i a t e ch e c k s on ground safety,
d an ge r o u s desi gn f e a t u r e s and o b s t ac le s around grounds are
n e e d e d . In part i c u l a r , the potential death t r a p s caused by
tunnels, of which W e m b l e y Park tube station is an example,
should be redesigned.


2.4       Turnstiles, T u r n s t i l e e n tr an ce s should be 1 inked to
p a rticular sect ions of the g r o u n d w h e r e p racticable so that
m o n i t o r i n g of crowd d e n s i t y is possible.


2. 5      Pens. Terr a c e s u p p o r t e r s should not be seperated by
d a n g e r ou s high f e n c i n g into pens fro m which there is no
escape.


2.6  Venues. Th e s e m i - f i n a l s of maj or cup compet i t ions should
be played at W em b l e y u n t i 1 s ui t a b l e c a p a c i t y is available in
other grounds.


2.7 First Aid. F irst aid f a c i l i t i e s should be mandatory.
D o c t o r s should be on hand to treat                  crowd injuries as well as
those of players and s h o u ld be kept in permanent touch with
ground off i c i a l s t h ro u g h the use of mo d e r n communications.
Re s c u e packs from L ocal        He a l t h A u t h o r i t i e s should be on hand.
R o o m s within the gr o u n d     should be designated for emergen cy
use.


2.8  Insur ance cover. All ve n u e s and s p e c t a t o r s should be
covered by insurance so that re l a t i v e s and sur v i v o r s do not
need to rely on c h a r i t y in the wake of a disaster.

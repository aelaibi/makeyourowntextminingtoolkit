           I am a married man living at the above address with my family.

           I am a Nottingham Forest Supporter and work at the Nottingham Forest

           ground as                                                                  I have

           done this for 20 yrs and consequently have a great knowledge of

           football    crowds and fan behaviour.

           On Saturday 15th April       1 9 8 9 , together with my 15 yr old daughter,         I

           travelled to Hillsborough football          ground Sheffield to watch the FA

           cup semi-final       between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC,

           I went as part of an organised party on a coach which left

           Nottingham Forest football       club at noon that morning.       I had earlier

           obtained my ticket for the south stand from Nottingham Forest FC and

           the ticket    cost me £14. The    coach company we travelled through was

           Bartons.
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              S513

‘We travelled directly to H i11s bo r q p r f j h and did not stop on route to

 the mat ch. We did not    e:<perie^*€e any major de lay but getting off

the Ml     fhpJ.o rway there was/ C hold up due to the volume of traffic

 heading tawards Hillsborough.

We a r r iv e d \ n Sheffield at about       1.15pm and left the coach in a

 large coach park approx.     1 mile from the ground.

 It was    about a 10 minute walk to the ground and although there were

 plenty    of people also walking to the ground there was not

uncomfortable to walk. On route to the ground we past some public

houses and I noticed these were full of fans drinking however none

were drunk and I felt they were well behaved.

 I saw numerous Police officers on route to the ground either on

point duty at street junctions and police            in transit vans outside

the open public houses.                  ^

At about    1.30pm I arrived a^'the Spion Hop end of the football

ground and saw a \ an ^    ?ili ng flags      in Herries Road South my daughter

purchashed a £3 flag from this man and we then walked across

Penistone Road through some big iron gates            into the area for the

South -stand turnstiles.

 Inside this area I noticed there were no large queues and we were

able to walk through this area towards the turnstiles with no

 problems at all. The only queue         in this area was by a portacabin,

where they were selling programmesyfVom.

 I went to turnstiles £9       32 a njy noticed that there were 2 stewards

and a Police officer outside ^cach t u r ns ti le . The re was no queue at

the t ur nst i1e and upfn goyng to the turnstile my daughter was told by

a Police officer thavvsrmj was not allowed to bring the flag            inside

the ground following a conversation with a steward it was then agreed

that she could take the flag      into the ground       if she left the stick

outside where this steward would keep an eye on it.
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     S513

We then entered through the turnstile which we had no problems to

find as it had been clearly marked.

We gave the tickets to the steward in the turnstile and he gave us

back the ticket portion keeping the stub part.

Once    inside the ground there were signs displayed for the gangway

entries and there were stewards at both the top and the bottom of

the steps. There was no gates open in the stand other than internal

gates and the turnstiles         I did not see any persons entering the

ground illegally and purchased a programme from the rear of the

stand.    I cannot remember seeing any persons consuming alcohol                    in this

area and d i d n ’t see any incidents of disorder.

Between 1.30pm and 1.45pm together with my daughter we went to our

seats    in the south stand and started to look around at the general

state of the grounds.

Looking around I noticed that the Spion Hop area"' was pretty full,                        the

South stand was only about         1/5th full and the North stand was very

e m p t y . However the middle    sections of t h y W e s t    stand was very full at

this stage although the outer          pens wet^e still       quite e m p t y .

At about 2. O ’clock I was       looking a v jf r at the middle       sections of the

West stand which I saw we re c h a c - A - h l a c   and I started to become

concerned about the behaviour          ok   the fans in these sections,            (pens

3 + 4) as the re was a lot of /shout i ng , and a lot of pushing going

on inside the Dens caus i ng/javes to occur from the back which were

continuing to tnfc people^at the front of these stands                   I even made a

comment to my f r i e n 3 ^ w h o we re seated around me that           I felt the fans

in this section were c r a z y .

I then became aware of fans         in this section standing on top of the

crash barriers at the back,         throwing themselves          in the air,      lying

flat out on there stomach and they were then passed along the tops of

the people    in front over there heads until they either got to the
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            S313

 front of the pens or fell down between peopie^J^lfaw about a dozen

 people do this and felt very c o n c e r n e d l y this action.

About 20 minutes       prior to the stjfcjTC of the match I became aware of a

Policeman running across the^<Crack from the middle section area of
j*

the West stand towards tJ 0 ' Police        control box at the corner of our

 stand. He appeared vjyy aggitated and he had to climb up on railings

at the side          tjjy south stand having first got through the crowd. He

had to work his way up along the railings which did not appear              very

wide and he then hammered on the windows to the Police box passing

 some sort of message,         however   I have no idea what was said. He then

equally as quick got back down from the railings and walked back

along the track towards the middle section of the West Stand.

At about 2 . 5 5 pm I remember      looking across at the north stand and

being amazed how many spaces were still available            in the north stand.

Also the outersections of the terraces           in the west stand were still

fairly empty considering the type of match and time.

From 2 O'clock onwards         I had noticed that a lot of fans from the West

Stand terraces were        climbing up into the seated area of this stand

having been assisted by fans in the seated area.

The pushing in the middle Sections of the W e s t stand continued up

until kick off and many crowd surges occured and I was concerned for

the people at the front who          I thought must be having   problems.

 The game then started and I did not notice the crowd again until a

         officer ran onto the pitch. yXX was then I noticed persons

standing on the touchline area cm the north stand side of the goal

and persons were climbing o y l of the West stand middle s t a n d s .

A lot of Police of f i cer^/ran up to these sections and I had problems
'          H          „
seeing whaf was happM-ping then because of the amount of people there
            t          jdm<'
on the pitjfch and^furrounding the fences.

What appeaWtsKTo be unconci ous people were then put onto the pitch
                                                                                         PAGE     5
                                                                                         S S 13

    ►and I saw about 3 people working on a fan at the side of the pitch in

    front of the south stand for about 20 minutes there was a cheer when

    his leg moved but he appeared then to go again.                 I don't know any

    details of this person as          I was still to far away to see him closely.

    Even at this stage       I was not aware of the extent of the problem as

    there were no announcements made over the tanoy.

    At about 4.30pm an announcement was made over the tanoy and it was

    after this 1 left the football ground.

    Prior to 1 eaving the ground I witnessj^eK f a n s         ripping down hoarding

    boards to carry the ejead and i j j r f u r e d .

    I could not u n d e r s t a n d S w h y ^ a n s who were on the pitch needed to throw

    police officers helmets at an ambulance which was parked in front of

    the west stand.

    1 feel    that it took a long period of time for the mainline of police

    who   came in from the Spion Hop area to enter the ground and take up

    position in the middle of the ground.

    Also I feel that the Fireman            who w e r e ^ a r a medics also   took    a long

    time to get to the ground,

    I felt there was a lack of cjjplffrmni cat i on and that the crowd were

    uninformed because althot^fn the Forest             crowd was well behaved there

    were sections      ijWjj,y±i<f?g myself who were unaware of the seriousness

    of the situation and there was minor taunting and when a few hundred

    Liverpool    fans started to move towards the Spion Kop I feel                    it could

    have been a very volitile situati o v f.

    I   feel that a lot of the dead >smd injured lying on the pitch were

    J.eft unattended for too 1 ojprg        and feel that if a tanoy message            had
V   been made for Medi/p«^ |« sistance           then perhaps it could        have saved one

    or two.

    Although no one can plan for a sit u a A ri o n like this,           I felt      the re was

    no one co-ordinating the rescua/operation.

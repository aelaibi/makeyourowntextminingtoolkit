                             SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS
                 HOME SECRETARY STATEMENT ON POPPLEWELL INQUIRY


         The Government "accepts the need to strengthen urgently" the safety
   measures at sports grounds, the Home Secretary the Rt Hon Douglas Hurd
   CBE MP said today.     "Consultations will begin immediately with the sporting
   authorities and organisations concerned" with a view to extend
   designation this summer under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 to all grounds
   with spectator accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators at which
   soccer, rugby union, rugby league and cricket is played.

        All eligible Football League grounds here already been designated as have
   Scottish premier league grounds, Rugby League Division one and two
   grounds and the three national Rugby Union stadia.

        The principle that safety controls should also be extended to other
   sports grounds with stands capable of holding over 500 spectators and
   to indoor sports facilities with accommodation for over 500 spectators
   where adequate controls do not already exist was also accepted by the
   Home Secretary.    The first step will be to establish the facts about
   those grounds and facilities affected and the full practical effects
   of the recommendations.

        The Home Secretary was responding to the Final Report of the Committee
   of Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds set up following
   the fire at Bradford City football ground and the events at Birmingham City
   football ground last May.     He expressed the Government's gratitude for the
   speed and conscientiousness with which the Chairman and his two assessors
   had discharged this difficult t a s k .

        The Final Report makes 15 recommendations on crowd safety and control
   at sports grounds.    The full text of the Home Secretary's response is
   attached giving details of the request to local authorities, and chief
fire officers to inspect as necessary both indoor and outdoor sports
premises and proposals to publish a consultative document on legislative
changes in order to achieve the objectives of the safety recommendations
of the Final Report.

     On the question of crowd control, the Home Secretary referred to
the steps already taken to strengthen the powers of the police and courts*,
in particular new police powers of search and arrest in the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act and on further measures, including a new offence
of disorderly conduct, proposed in the Public Order Bill.   He undertook
to look further at Mr Justice Popplewell's recommendations when we have
had time to see how these measures worked in practice.   The latest figures
available suggest that in London so far this season there has been a
reduction of over ^0 per cent in the number of people arrested and
ejected; in Manchester the reduction is over 50^*




NOTE FOR EDITORS

     The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA) implemented the main
proposals of the Wheatley Report into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds
established following an accident at Ibrox Fark in 1971 when 66 people
were killed and many more injured.

     Designation under the SSGA means that the owner or occupier of a
stadium must apply to the local authority (county council) for a safety
certificate if spectators are to be admitted to the stadium.

 clubs is attached.

                        POPPLEWELL FINAL REPORT:

                       HOME SECRETARY*S STATEMENT




1.      With permission, Mr Speaker,   I should like to make a

statement on the Final Report of the Inquiry into Safety and

Control at Sports Grounds under the chairmanship of Mr Justice

Popplewell which was published today.      The House will recall that

the Inquiry was established following the fire at Bradford City

football ground and the events at Birmingham City on 11 May 1985.



2.      Now that the Inquiry’s work is completed, my Rt Hon friend

the Secretary of State for Scotland and I renew the Government's

gratitude to the Chairman and his two assessors for the speed anc

conscientiousness with .which they have discharged their difficult

task.    In addition to dealing with the events at the Heysel

stadium in Brussels on 29 May and discussing the causes of

hooliganism,    the Final Report makes fifteen recommendations on,

separately,    crowd safety and crowd control.



3.      On crowd control,   there are a number of recommendations

about the maintenance of order at football grounds:      wider powers

of police search and arrest;      a new offence of disorderly conduct

at sports grounds,    and a review of the recent alcohol legislation

as it applies to executive boxes.      Continued progress with

membership schemes is also recommended.



                                                    /The Police and
                                 -    2   -




4.    The Police and Criminal Evidence Act which came into force

on 1 January has already extended the police powers of search and

of arrest in ways which will help them deal with troublemakers at

football grounds.    I shall examine Mr Justice Popplewell's

recommendations for further powers when we see how the new Act

works in practice.



5.    On disorderly conduct, the Public Order Bill now before the

House seeks to create a new offence which will cover hooliganism

in football grounds as elsewhere.             I shall consider carefully the

recommendation for a wider offence when we see how the offence in

the Bill works in practice.



6.    The Government has already taken a number of steps to deal

with forms of misconduct about which Mr Justice Popplewell

expresses particular concern.        The Public Order Bill seeks to

implement a recommendation in his Interim Report that the

possession of smoke bombs and similar devices at sports grounds be

made an offence.     We have taken action to ban some other items

which may be used as missiles.        The alcohol legislation which was

passed in the summer makes it an offence to be in possession of a

drinks can or bottle in any area of the grounds from which the

pitch may be viewed directly.



7.    During the Parliamentary proceedings representations were

made about the effect on the revenue which clubs derive from



                                                       /executive boxes
                                  -   3   -




executive boxes.     The Government       undertook to monitor the

situation,   and I have received some information from the Football

League and representations from a number of Rt Hon and hon

Members.     I have asked for more information from the football

authorities and will wish to consider that carefully,            in the light

of the Inquiry's recommendation, before deciding whether to allow

some relaxation of the controls on alcohol in executive boxes.                 I

shall report my conclusions to the House while the Public Order

Bill is before Parliament.



8.    On membership cards,    I fully endorse Mr Justice Popplewell's

recommendation.     The Public Order Bill contains provisions to

enable the courts to ban convicted football hooligans from

attending matches.     This shows our determination to do what we can

to keep troublemakers away from football grounds,            and to restore

the good name of British football.            It needs to be matched by

equally determined action by the football clubs and the football

authorities.     My Rt Hon friend the Prime Minister has emphasised

to them the value of an effective membership card system.                The

football authorities have made some progress on this.             In the

light of the exclusion order scheme in the Public Order Bill I

hope that they will now redouble their efforts.



9.    I turn to crowd safety.    We accept the need to strengthen

urgently the measures already announced by and taken following my

predecessor's statements on 13 May and 24 July.



                                                      /10.   We accept
%




10.       We accept the recommendation that all sports grounds and

sports stadia in England and Wales with accommodation for more

than 10,000 spectators and where Association Football, Rugby

League, Rugby Union and Cricket is played which are not already

designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act should be so

designated.      Consultations will begin immediately with the sports

authorities and organisations concerned with a view to introducing

the necessary Orders as quickly as possible, but in any event by

the summer of this year.



    11.   In Scotland my Rt Hon friend intends to introduce similarly,

    as soon as practicable,    an Order designating stadia of clubs with

    accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators in the First and

    Second Divisions of the Scottish Football League.



    12.   We accept the principle of the recommendations that safety

controls should be extended to all sports grounds and stadia with

    stands for over 500 spectators,    and to indoor sports facilities

with accommodation for over 500 spectators where adequate controls

 do not already exist.        We need more facts.   Present centrally-held

    information is limited to stadia and grounds with accommodation

    for 5,000 or more,    and indoor premises with an overall capacity of

more than 1,000.         The first step will be to establish the full

    practical effects of these recommendations.      All relevant local

    and fire authorities in England, Wales and Scotland are to be

    invited to inspect all such stands and premises not previously

    inspected and report upon them to my Rt Hon friend and myself.

    Powers are immediately available under both the Safety of Sports

Grounds Act and the Fire Precautions Act to deal with any

exceptional hazard which might be found in the course of the

inspections.     Similarly, chief fire officers and firemasters will

be invited to keep under review the places they inspected under .

previous initiatives last year with the object of maintaining

safety standards at those places.
                                                                         t




13.    When we have considered these inspections we shall quickly

issue a consultative document and propose     ways of achieving   the

objectives of the Inquiry's     Final Report, fitting this into   the

review already under way on the future of the Fire Precautions

Act.   Further legislation may well prove necessary.     There will be

no avoidable risk meanwhile    because any necessary emergency    action

can be taken under existing    powers.



14.    So far,   the figures this season show a marked improvement in

the number of arrests and ejections from football grounds.        Our

measures against hooliganism should have a cumulative effect.           But

it is too soon to be satisfied.     We have to deal not only with

hooliganism but with safety;     not only with football grounds but

with sports grounds in general.     Thanks in large part to

Mr Justice Popplewell I believe we are on the right track.

                        SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

               Home Secretary welcomes Interim Report of
                          Committee of Inquiry


     "There is no single, simple method of making sports grounds safe and
free from violence," the Home Secretary, the Rt Hon Leon Brittan QC MP,
said today, "but I believe that the steps taken in the last few months,
coupled with the implementation of the important recommendations of Mr
Justice Popplewell's inquiry, have already made and will make a significant
contribution towards preserving football as a major spectator sport".

     The Home Secretary was responding to the publication of the Interim
Report by the committee which was established following the fire at
Bradford City football ground and the events at Birmingham City football
ground.   Paying tribute to the 'speedy, clear and thorough way in which
the Chairman and his two assessors have tackled this difficult t*ud important
task' the Home Secretary said "No-one reading the report, or who followed
the public hearings in Bradford, can doubt that the Inquiry has investigated
these matters as thoroughly as possible".

     The Popplewell committee makes J>2 recommendations (8 of them provisional)
in its report; these recommendations, and the 'government's response to them,
are contained in a written statement also published today (copy attached).
In particular the government is asking local authorities, police and sports
authorities to respond immediately to the spirit of the recommendations to
improve safety arrangements at sports grounds.

     The Home Secretary went on however to report the actions already taken
in the immediate aftermath of the events at Bradford and Birmingham.         First,
under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act all qualifying grounds of clubs in
Divisions 3 and k of the Football League and Divisions 1 and 2 of the Rugby
League have been designated, requiring clubs to apply for safety certificates
before admitting any spectators.
     Secondly reports received from Chief Fire Officers indicate that all
uncertificated grounds of the Association Football League and of the 1st
and 2nd Divisions of the Rugby League have been inspected.   Spectator
accommodation at the larger cricket grounds, Rugby Union grounds, race
courses, motor racing circuits, greyhound tracks, tennis clubs and athletics
grounds has also been inspected.   Chief Fire Officers have sent copies of
their findings to the management of those sports grounds visited, indicating
what remedial measures have to be taken.   In some cases this will involve
complete closure of a stand until rebuilding or remedial work has been
completed.

     Fire safety standards at most of the soccer and Rugby League grounds
have been found to be generally satisfactory but some improvements have been
shown to be required and a number of potentially serious fire hazards have
been revealed.   These include stands which are wholly or largely made of
timber, unprotected voids beneath timber floors in stands, combustible
materials stored beneath stands and inadequate gangways or final exit doors.

     Management of sports grounds have responded in a co-operative way and
have either set necessary work in hand or are considering how best to comply
with the requirements.   The attention of the governing bodies of the main
sporting activities is also being drawn to the Report’s recommendations in
anticipation that full co-operation will continue to be given to ensure
proper spectator safety measures are in operation at all sports grounds.

     Thirdly the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Bill has been
passed and will be in force by the beginning of the football season.

     Fourthly, steps have been taken to enhance police effectiveness.
In England and Wales the Association of Chief Police Officers has introduced
a new system for exchanging information about the conduct of fans which
should assist in anticipating and preventing trouble.   Three of the Home
Office photographic vehicles will be available to be deployed at football
                                                        ___
matches, together with 2 experimental high-definition tripod mounted cameras.
This is in addition to the £ 500,000 worth of equipment purchased through
funds provided by the Football Trust.

     Fifthly, the Minister for Sport has helped to promote and draw up a
Council of Europe Convention on Spectator Violence.
INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS
INTERIM REPORT JULY 1985 ( CMND 9585 )




GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS




GROUND MANAGEMENT


RECOMMENDATIONS


1.       Evacuation procedures should be a matter of police training
and form part of the briefing by police officers before a football
match.    (Paragraph 3-9)-



2.       The local authority team responsible for issuing safety
certificates in respect of designated grounds should, as heretofore,
include police officers.     (Paragraph 3.15)



Certificating authorities and chief officers of police will be
invited to act upon these recommendations (see also Recommendation 10).




RECOMMENDATIONS


6.       Those managing sports grounds not governed by safety certificates
should give serious consideration, with the assistance of fire authorities,
to the presence in a ground of suitable fire fighting equipment.
(Paragraph 3-5*0


7.       Stewards at all sports grounds should be trained in fire fighting.
(Paragraph 3-55)


8.       In designated grounds it should be a term of the safety certificate
that an adequate first-aid room should be provided.    (Paragraph 3.99)
10.     Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire
precautions and fire-fighting (see R e c o m m e n d a t i o n 7 above) but should
also be trained in how best to help the police in evacuation.
(Paragraph 3-10^)


14.     Suitable and adequate exits should be provided in all sports
grounds.   (Paragraph 3-138)

15.    No smoking should take place in combustible stands, that this
should be a condition of entry to the ground that signs to that effect
should be prominently displayed and this should be a condition of
entry to the ground.     (Paragraph 3-1^1)


The relevant sports authorities will be invited to draw the attention
of sports grounds managers to these reconraendations, and certificating
authorities will be asked to consider reflecting the recommendations
in new or amended safety certificates as appropriate in the case of
designated grounds.     The fire and police services will be asked to stand
ready to advise on equipment and assist with training as appropriate.




RECOMMENDATION


9.      There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety
Executive and the fire authorities and local authorities as to how best
to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and reports.
(Paragraph 3-95)


The HSE has appointed a member of its Executive to review liaison
arrangements between its inspectors and the fire authorities.              He will
consult Government Departments and others in this review, the results of
which will be made public.




RECOMMENDATION


16•     Fire Authorities should Identify and visit all sports stadia in their
areas and should prohibit or restrict the use of any stands which, in their
view, constitute a risk to spectators because of the inadequacy of the fire
precautions.     (Paragraph 3-1*12)
Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales were invited by the Home Secretary
on 16 May to inspect all sports grounds and were reminded of the powers
available to them to take emergency action if, in their view, fire hazards
constituting a risk to spectators are revealed.   The Secretary of State
for Scotland similarly asked Firemasters to inspect sports grounds in Scotland.
Reports received show that fire brl^des have not hesitated to recommend
emergency action where necessary, including in a number of cases a prohibition
on the use of stands or a restriction on the number of spectators allowed
into them.




RECOMMENDATION


17.    In order to ensure a complete record of sports grounds a
local registration system should be set up.   (Paragraph 3-150)


Consultation will take place with the local authority associations to
establish how such records may best be compiled and maintained.     The
recent visits of the fire brigades fsee Recommendation .16) should have
in practice marshalled much of the relevant data already.




STRUCTURES


RECOMMENDATION


13-    Building of new permanent stands of combustible materials
should be prohibited as a general rule.   (Paragraph 3.132)


This recommendation will be given speedy and urgent consideration
by the Departments who are responsible for building regulations.
GREEN GUIDE


RECOMMENDATIONS


       The Green Guide should be amended to include in Paragraph 11 a
provision that, wherever practicable, roads within a quarter of a
mile of a sports ground should be kept entirely free of parked vehicles.
(Paragraph 3-35)


11.    Paragraph 6.1j4»6 of the    Green Guide should be amended to read:
"All exit gates should be manned at all times while the ground is used
by the public and be capable of being opened immediately from inside .
by anyone in an emergency."      (Paragraph 3-111)


12.    The Green Guide should be amended to contain a specific provision,
in relation to stewards,


       (i)        that they   should be trained and instructed to
       deal with any emergency relating to fire or evacuation
       (see also Recommendations 7 and 10);


       (ii)     that they should be.given written instructions
       about the action to be taken in cases of emergency;


       (iii)      that they   should receive practical instruction
       and training appropriate to their responsibility;


       (iv)    that no one should be employed as a steward
       unless they have been so instructed and trained; and


       (v)        that they   should be adequate in number, physically
       and mentally capable of performing their duties, effectively
       deployed, effectively supervised and readily identifiable.
       (Paragraph 3-117)


19 *   The next edition of the Green Guide should make it clear
that it applies to all sports grounds.      (Paragraph 3• 15‘4)
 These points will be noted for inclusion in the next edition of the Green
 Guide which will be needed after the Inquiry's final report is received.
 Action will not however depend upon the availability of a fresh edition and
 certificating authorities and chief officers of police (Recommendation 4)
 will be invited to take such steps as.are open to them now.




 CROWD MANAGEMENT


 RECOMMENDATIONS


 5•     Consideration should be given to making it a criminal offence
 in England and Wales to have a smoke bomb or similar device at sports
 grounds.   (Paragraph 3-42)


 22.   There should be a specific offence of throwing a missile at
 sports grounds. (Paragraph 6.57)


The case for inviting Parliament to create new criminal offences on
these lines will be studied urgently in connection with the Government’s
intention of introducing legislation in the next session of Parliament
following its review of the law relating to public order.




RECOMMENDATIONS


20.    Urgent consideration should be given by football clubs in
England and Wales to introducing membership system so as to exclude
visiting fans.     (Paragraph 6.48)


23 -   Football clubs should review their arrangements for entry and
the organisation of their turnstiles.     (Paragraph 6.62)


Both these recommendations are for football authorities and clubs, but the
Government hopes that they will be given serious consideration.    The
Government has been encouraging the Football Association and the Football
League to introduce a scheme of membership cards and the options are currently



                                      5
being considered in a Football League working group: that group's
attention will therefore be drawn to the Inquiry's Recommendation 20.
The governing bodies' attention will also be drawn to Recommendation 23
which might be influenced by decisions upon Recommendation 20.




RECOMMENDATION


21.    Closed circuit television should be introduced at League football
grounds in England and Wales and in the Premier Division in Scotland.
(Paragraph 6.54)


The Football Trust has allocated £500,000 for the provision of CCTV equipment   9
in League grounds during the 1985-86 season.    The Trust's attention, and
that of the Football Associations and the Football Leagues, will be drawn
to this recommendation.




MISCELLANEOUS


RECOMMENDATIONS


3.     Early attention should be given by the Home Office Directorate
of Telecommunications to consider the practicality of producing a more
suitable personal radio for the police.   (Paragraph 3.33)


18 .   Consideration should be given as how best to deal with temporary
stands and marquees   (Paragraph 3.151)


24.    Consideration should be given t o the_design of a standard,
efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits.   (Paragraph 6.63)


Each of these will be studied as the Inquiry advises.   Recommendations
18 and 24 may best be taken forward in the context of the Inquiry's next
stage and when it turns to examine the Green Guide as a whole.




                                 6
,PROVISIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS


 (To be reviewed in the Final Report)


 1.     I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the police should                  I
be given the unfettered right of search before entry to football grounds by                   '
statute.'   (Paragraph 3.41)


2.     I am m i n d e d    to recommend that Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971
should be amended with a view to giving the Fire Authority power in cases other
than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional            (Paragraph 3-61)


3-     Linked with the above, I am            minded to recommend that consideration
should be given to introducing legislation giving powers for the Fire Authority
to apply to the High Court.for an injunction (or to the Court of Session for
an interdict in Scotland) under Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971-
(Paragraph 3-6.1)


4.     I am m i n d e d        to recommend that Section 10 of the Safety at Sports Grounds
Act 1975 should be amended in like manner to Section 10 of the Fire Precautions
Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations 2 and 3) and an application to the
High Court for an injunction (or to the Court of Session for an interdict in
Scotland) should be an alternative remedy.           (Paragraph 3>76)


5.     I am m i n d e d to recommend thr<t the Secretary of State should exercise his
powers to designate all sports grounds, whatever their size to include indoor
as well as outdoor activities.           (Paragraph 3-145)


6.    I am minded         to   recommend immediate designation of any ground
capable of holding over 5,000 spectators, to cover all sports grounds,
not merely football grounds.            (Paragraph 3.14.6)


7-    I am minded         to   recommend that consideration should   be given to
providing the police with additional powers of arrest under the
Public Order Act, 1936.           (Paragraph 6.66)


8.    I am minded         to   recommend that consideration should   be given to
creating a specific offence of chanting obscene or racialist abuse
at a sports ground. (Paragraph 6.67)


These are noted and the Government will stand by to assist the
Inquiry in its further consideration of the matters.

       FOOTBALL SPECTATOR VIOLENCE - MEETING OF MINISTER'S WORKING GROUP


        Neil       Macfarlane,                 Minister              for           Sport, 'today                 chaired         a     meeting
 of    the    Working          Group          set         up       to co-ordinate measures to deal with foot­
 ball hooliganism.


        In a statement after the meeting Mr Macfarlane said:


        "My    Working              Group        today             continued              the       discussions                 between        the
 Government          and        the           football              authorities                on     measures             to     be        taken,
 jointly       and       separately,                 to    deal              with       the     problems            of     crowd       control
 and    safety        confronting                   the        game.               The        Football          League          presented        a
 memorandum and reported specifically on membership cards.


        "The        issue           of        membership                     cards       is      one        which          concerns            the
 responsibility                of        football              clubs              for    ensuring           safety         and       security
 within :their           own        premises.                  The           Government         expects             them     to take          that
 responsibility                seriously             and           regrets              the    delay.           I    am    glad        to     note
 that    the        Football             League           has        established                a     Working             Group        to     give
 this    option          the    full           but        speedy              consideration                it    requires.              I look
 forward       to     seeing             an    early           report,              which       will        be      completed           by     the

 hooliganism.             There           will       be        a    s t rengthened role                    for       the Police,             with

 restrict          alcohol          at        matches              and        on     journeys          to        and      from       them;     we

          ALCOHOL AT FOOTBALL MATCHES:   1TOUGH BUT F A IR MEASURES 1



           The Home Office today published a Bill to control tha sale and
  possession of alcohol at and on the way to and from sporting events.
  Commenting on the Bill the Home Secretary,    the Et Hon Leon Brittan QC HP,
  said,

           "We are putting forward tough but fair measures which go to the
           heart of the problem of drunken behaviour and hooliganism at
           football grounds.   The Bill is based upon the current Scottish
           legislation, but also reflects the difference between football
           grounds in Scotland and those in England and Wales.

           "Broadly the Bill will make it an offence to possess alcohol
          when entering a football ground or in football coaches or trains
          on the v/ay to a match.   Drunkenness in the ground or at the entrance
           to it will also   be made illegal.   The sale of alcohol inside grounds
          will be tightly    controlled, but clubs will be able to apply to local
          magistrates for an exemption order allowing them to sell alcohol
          in bars out of sight of the pitch: in considering the application
          magistrates will give particular regard to public order and safety
          considerations and the club's past record in this respect.

          "I have discussed these measures with HM Opposition and the Alliance
          parties and been assured of their agreement to^hem.        They share the
          Government's wish to do everything possible to remove this stain
          from a great British game."


 The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc.) Bill

          The Bill's provisions will apply to designated sports grounds and
 designated sporting events, (It is expected that the Secretary of State's
 initial designation order will relate only to football grounds and matches,
 including, in particular, Football League Clubs and international fixtures).
            Clause 1 prohibits drunkenness and the possession of drink on trains,
coaches and mini-buses on the way to or from a designated sporting event.
Offences in connection with possessing drink, drunkenness and possession of
a 'controlled container' at grounds are created by Clause 2.

            Clauses 3-5 place a general ban on the sale of alcohol within
designated sports grounds but provide for exemption orders to be granted
by magistrates if they are satisfied that public order and safety arrangements
would not be threatened.      Exemption orders will be valid for only five months
which means that football clubs obtaining exemptions early in the season will
need to reapply to the courts for fresh exeraptionsfor the second half of the
season.     Clause 6 empowers a police officer to close any bar in the ground if
trouble breaks out.      Clause 7 provides the police with the necessary powers
to enforce the provisions of the Bill and Clause 8 sets out the penalties.
These are outlined below.      Clause 9 includes an interpretation of the terms
used in the Bill; the main ones being:

            'designated sports ground' - means any place wholly or partly used
            for sporting events where accommodation is pi’ovided for spectators
            and which has been designated by the Secretary of State;
            'designated sporting event'- means any sporting event or proposed
            sporting event designated by the Secretary of State.

The provisions also apply to travel within England and Wales en route to
sports grounds and sporting events designated by the Secretary of State for
Scotland.     Matches played abroad may be designated for the purpose of
controlling drinking on special trains and coaches.      Clause 10 amends the
corresponding Scottish legislation.     The major provisions of the Bill are as follows:
Possession of drink and drunkenness:
            on coaches, trains and mini-buses -
            Alcohol will be prohibited on a public service vehicle
            or railway passenger vehicle which is being used for the
            primary purpose of conveying passengers to or from a designated
            sporting event.
            offences -   it will be an offence knowingly to cause or permit
            intoxicating liquor to be carried on such a vehicle; the operator,
            hirer or his servant/agent will be liable (Cl(2))
                     -            a person who has intoxicating liquor in his possession
            while on such a vehicle will be guilty of an offence (Cl(3))
                         it will be an offence to be drunk on such a vehicle (Cl(^))
         at sports grounds -
         Possession of intoxicating liquor or a 'controlled container'
         (i.e. a bottle, can or other portable container which is capable
         of causing injury) will be prohibited in any part of a designated
         sports ground from which the event may be directly viewed.
         offences -   it will be an offence to be in possession of intoxicating
         liquor or a controlled container at any time during' the period of a
         designated sporting event in any part of the sports ground from which
         the event may ba directly viewed (c2(l)(a)) or while entering or
         trying to enter the ground (e2(l)(b)).
                      a person who is drunk in any part of the ground during
         the period of a designated sporting event or who is drunk on entering
        a ground will be guilty of an offence (c2(2)).


Restricting the sale of drink within sports grounds
        The sale of intoxicating liquor will generally be prohibited during
         the period of a designated sporting event (cj(D).      However, clause 3 (2)
        makes provision for a magistrates court to grant an exemption order for
        licensed premises or registered club premises inside the ground, but
         only in respect of areas out of sight of the pitch."    In granting such
        an order the court must be satisfied that it is not likely to be
        detrimental to the orderly conduct or safety of spectators. (c3(6)).
        Where such an order already exists but a police inspector considers
        the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor at a particular designated
        sporting event is likely to be detrimental to the orderly conduct
        or safety of spectators, and it is impracticable for an application
        for variation of the order to be made to a magistrates court, he may
        give written notice to the holder of the order,   (or his designated
        representative) that the existing order should be modified or should
        cease to have effect (c3(7)t(9)).
        Clause 6(1) makes provision for any bar within a designated sports
        ground to be closed at any time during the course of a designated
        sporting event if it appears to a constable in uniform that the
        continued sale or supply of intoxicating liquor is detrimental to
        the orderly conduct or safety of spectators at that event.
        offences -    it will be an offence to sell or supply or to authorise
        the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor in contravention of conditions
        or restrictions imposed under Clause 3(10).
                     - it will be an offence to fail to close a bar if required
          by a constable to do so (c6(2))


Powers of enforcement

          Clause 7 provides a police constable with powers to enter any part
          of a designated sports ground to enforce the provisions of the Act
          (c7(1)), to search persons in or attempting to eater a ground (c7(2))
          to step public serrice vehicles and to search such vehicles or
          railway passenger vehicles (c7(3))•


Penalties for offences

          Offences will be triable summarily.             For the offence of:
              being in possession of intoxicating liquor on a vehicle (cl(3))
              being in possession of intoxicating liquor in or on entry to a
          designated sports ground during a designated sporting event           ( c 2 ( 1 ))
              selling or supplying intoxicating liquor in contravention of
          restrictions and conditions     ( c 3 ( 10 ))
              failing to comply with the request of a constable to close a
          bar (c6(2))
               penalty is a fine not exceeding £*400 or 3 months imprisonment
          or both.
          For the offence of knowingly causing or permitting intoxicating
          liquor to be carried on a vehicle; the penalty will be a fine not
          exceeding £1000 (d(2))
          For the offences of:
              being drunk in a vehicle (cl(*0)
          -   being drunk in or on entry to a designated ground (c2(2))
          the penalty will be a fine not exceeding £100.


Amendment of Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980
          Clause 10 of the Bill contains amendments to Part V of the Criminal
Justice (Scotland) Act 1 9 8 0 .   It extends the provisions of section 69 in
relation to public-service vehicles to trains; and it applies the Act to
sporting events designated under the present Bill and to designated sporting
events outside Great Britain, so that travel in Scotland en route to designated
sporting events in England and Wales or outside Great Britain would be caught
under the Act.
Notes to Editors


A public service vehicle has the same meaning as in the Public Passenger
Vehicle Act 1981 and includes buses, coaches and mini-buses which are used
for hire or reward.




The Bill does not extend to Northern Ireland.

SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS


The majority of sports grounds in South Yorkshire are "satisfactory"

from a safety point of view according to South Yorkshire County Councijl

Chief Fire Officer Mr Harry Wright.              In a report to the County Council
                                                                                          I
Fire Service Committee         Mr Wright said          that    aninitial survey had

revealed a total of 30         sports grounds at which         stands were provided

for spectators and accommodation provided for players and officials.

Only in four cases had recommendations been made for minor adjustments

and negotiations were now taking place to remedy the faults.


The report follows the recent Bradford City disaster in which more than

fifty people died.        The terms of reference of the review were to

examine all sports grounds of whatever size or sporting activity and to

give interim advice on any matter which gave rise to a risk of fire or

emergency evacuation.         Mr Wright said of the four grounds:             "I should

like to point out these faults are of a minor nature and are being

corrected with a tremendous amount of good m i l " .              He added    "I am

satisfied that any faults will be remedied by the start of the next

season if they are not, necessary action will be taken to ensure the

safety of the public".


The forthcoming "Summer" Officer Working Parties inspections (comprising

representative of the Police, the Fire Service, the County Council and

the District Council's Building Surveyor) will take into account the

lessons of the recent tragic events at Bradford and any revised advice

and requirements which may be issued by the Home Office.

COUNTY COUNCIL DENIAL


South Yorkshire Connty Council yesterday, denied that they threatened to
close Rotherham United Football Club's Millmore ground, after investigations
in 1980, showed that more exits were required, in case of an emergency.


Former police Superintendent, Douglas Lock, in yesterdays edition                            0+
                                                                                              ’   the
Morning Telegraph, 14 May 1985> said that when safety implementations had
beer, suggested by the Authority, "the directors were extrsmely reluctant to
do anything about it and we had to threaten to close the ground."


A County Council spokesman said, ”To suggest that Rotherham United had to be
threatened is a misrepresentation of the situation.                             There were differences
of opinion abo’it the means of implementing improvements between the County
Council's Officer Working Parties and the directors of Rotherham United, but
these w?re discussed and resolved.                 We never got to the stage where we were
'banging the big drum'."


The County Council has, since 1979, had a policy of "winter" and "summer"
inspections of all five Football Leagu» Grounds in South Yorkshire, by
Officer Working Parties (comprising representatives of the Police, the
Fire Brigade, the County Council and the District Council's Building Surveyor).
Officer Working Parties have met with Rotherham United Football Club 23
times since 1979*      Whilst former Superintendent Douglas L-ock was a
Sub-Divisional Commander at Rotherham for six months, he was not present at
these meetings.

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

    I attach a copy of a Press Release issued by the County Council
    today in response to requests for information by the media on
    the situation in South Yorkshire following Saturday’s tragic
    events at Bradford.

    It is reasonable to assume that revised advice and/or requirements
    will be issued by the Home Office in the near future, and naturally
    this will be taken into account at the forthcoming "summer"
    inspections by the Officer Working parties.

    In the meantime and recognising that the season has ended, I would
    particularly stress the vital necessity for safety stewards to be
    fully aware of and trained in their duties on the manning and
    opening of doors and gates on egress routes and in the use of fire
    fighting equipment.

                                                   Yours faithfully,



                                                (W) J ■ H-wris
                                                   Chief Executive.

    P.S. Could you kindly indicate whether the Club’s development
    proposals (outlined on a confidential basis at the meeting held
    at the Ground on 30th January, 1985) are, in fact, to proceed.

    I would add that the Building Authority advise that they hope to
    be able to let me have their report on the existing Ground very
    shortly.

         Of the five Footoail League Grounds in South Yorkshire, three (Barnsley,
         Rotherham United and Sheffield Wednesday) have already been granted General
         Safety Certificates by the County Council under the Safety of Sports Grounds
    ^ ^ A c t , 1975, following their designation by the Secretary of State b n the
         carrying out of improvements.

       The Bramall Lane Ground of the Sheffield United Football Club Ltd. was designated
       by the Secretary of State in July, 1984 on the Club's promotion to the Second
       Division.  The Club has already carried out a number of improvements to the
       Ground, the remainder to be completed during the 1985 close season.

       Only the Belle Vue Ground of the Doncaster Rovers Football Club Ltd. remains
       undesignated (the Club remaining in the Third Division), but the County Council
       is continuing to work on a goodwill basis with the Club.

       The County Council has also since 1979 had a policy of "winter" and "summer"
       inspections of all five Football League Grounds by Officer Working Parties
       (comprising representatives of the Police, the Fire Service, the County Council
       and the District Council's Building Surveyor).  Such inspections have been welcomed
       by the Football Clubs, who have always displayed a responsible attitude on safety
       matters.

       Naturally, the forthcoming "summer" inspections will take into account the lessons
       of the recent tragic events at Bradford and any revised advice and requirements

 SAFETY AT    SPORTS      GROUNDS        IW S O U T H Y O R K F H I ^ j*



 Of the five FootDaii League Grounds in South Yorkshire, three (Barnsley,
 Rotherham United and Sheffield Wednesday) have already been granted General
 Safety Certificates by the County Council under the Safety of Sports Grounds
 Act, 1975, following their designation by the Secretary of State bn, the
^parrying out of improvements.

The Bramall Lane Ground of the Sheffield United Football Club Ltd. was designated
by the Secretary of State in July, 1984 on the Club’- promotion to the Second
Division.  The Club has already carried out a number of improvements to the
Ground, the remainder to be completed during the 1985 close season.

Only the Belle Vue Ground of the Doncaster Rovers Football Club Ltd. remains
undesignated (the Club remaining in the Third Division), but the County Council
is continuing to work on a goodwill basis with the Club.

The County Council has also since 1979 had a policy of "winter" and "summer"
inspections of all five Football League Grounds by Officer Working Parties
(comprising representatives of the Police, the Fire Service, the County Council
and the District Council’s Building Surveyor).  Such inspections have been welcomed
by the Football Clubs, who have always displayed a responsible attitude on safety
matters.

^Naturally, the forthcoming "summer" inspections will take into account the lessons
 ) i the recent tragic events at Bradford and any revised advice and requirements
"which may be issued by the Home Office.

                        MINISTER FOR SPORT LAUNCHES PUBLIC CONSULTATION PROCESS
                                     ON SOCCER SPECTATOR VIOLENCE

    Announcing    the       publication        today     of    a    Departmental     report       on    soccer           spectator
    violence*, Neil Macfarlane, Minister for Sport, said:-


         "Everyone        is aware       of     the     Government's      determination          to     do        all     that    is
        possible,       with      the   football       authorities,      to     tackle    the    problem of              ’football
        hooliganism.* Working              together,         we have    taken a series of measures which,                         as
*       the report concludes,              have helped to limit violence associated with football.
        But    following       serious     incidents         towards the end of last season, my Ministerial
        colleagues        and I decided that            the time had come          for a review of our approach
        and of the        options for dealing with the problem.                      We therefore set                   up a working
        group    of    officials        from the       four Government Departments principally concerned
         (Environment,         Foreign     and Commonwealth Office,              Home Office and Transport)                      and
        it is their advice which is being published as a report today.


        "The     Report      contains         the     collective      views   of    the    Official          Working        Group*
        although       on     particular            issues    the    advice     emanates        from        the     responsible
        Departments.           My colleagues          and    I are grateful        to the Working            Group for this
        report and in particular                for     the speed with which it was. produced.                          We pushed
        them hard as         we thought         it important to form some views before a new domestic
        season opened.


        "We accept the thrust of this report.                       It is a reasonable and thorough assessment

        of    the problem and of              the possible options.             It rightly endorses the current
        partnership between the Government and the football authorities and the emphasis
        upon careful planning, preparation and coordination to deter and reduce violence.
        It    identifies      a   number       of    additional      measures    which     might       be    taken.         These
       measures       are mainly        for    the    football authorities,          but we      stand ready             to give
       all the help we can.              I hope the Football Association, the Football League, the
       Football Trust and others concerned will think about these options seriously in
       the next few weeks, as we propose to do.




       ‘FOOTBALL SPECTATOR VIOLENCE - Report of an Official Working Group                                    (HMSO £3.80p)
"What   we   are     starting        today    is a process of consultation.                    We   in Government
will think carefully about this report and its advice to us.                                   We seek the views
of all the other bodies involved,                    notably of course the           football        authorities.
 I wrote     to the Chairman of               the    Football          Association,the Football League and
the   Football     Trust                             two days      ago,   inviting them to join me over
the coining weeks to discuss it.


"We   look    also     for     the    views     of    the    general      public.      Football         hooliganism
affects and concerns many people and we have chosen to                              publish this advice from
our   officials      as    a   Departmental          report, in order        to     give as many people as
possible     the opportunity          to comment.           None of us would pretend that we have a
monopoly     on    ideas       to    combat    soccer       spectator     violence.        Other        bodies     and
individuals        have    different         experience      and    expertise       and    I    believe       it    is
important     to     enable     everyone       to    make    a   contribution.         The      start    of   a    new
domestic season is the right time to start such a debate.                                 I look forward to a
wide and fruitful one, inspired by this report, over the next three months.*

    HILLSBOROUGH ; COST OF INQUIRIES BY WEST MIDLANDS POT.TPE


     Thank you for your note of 25th May.   You explained that
both the West Midlands and South Yorkshire Police Forces took the
view that the Hillsborough investigation costs should be borne by
the Home Office since we had set up the Inquiry.


     I can understand that the West Midlands Police may be
reluctant to incur costs which are arguably unconnected with
their own policing function without a firm undertaking that the
costs will be met by another body. But that seems to me to be a
different matter from claiming that they have no power to meet
such costs; particularly when the costs have already been
incurred. Certainly it would be no defence to a claim brought by
a Sheffield hotelier in respect of accommodation booked by the
West Midlands Police that that force had no power to pay.


     I can see no distinction between accommodation costs and
other costs arising out of the investigation, all of which can be
recovered from the South Yorkshire Police Authority.

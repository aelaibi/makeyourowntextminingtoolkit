               SOOTH YORKSHIRE METROPOLITAN AMBULANCE SERVICE




A training and operational profile for personnel currently serving within
the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.


Note


SYMAS operate a progressive career development structure for all grades of
staff which ensures individuals are exposed to operational incidents in the
pre-hospital field before being considered for promotion.


Cadets


Cadets are super numery to SYMAS for a two year period.     During this period
the are seconded to every department within the service and undertake
practical exercises as part of their cadetship, for example a mock major
incident exercise.   They also spend time seconded to stations within SYMAS
and form part of front line emergency crews, acting as observers.    The
cadets receive regular practical and theoretical examinations on a
pass/fail basis.


Dedicated Day Transport


These are adult entrants into the service who undertake the N.H.S.T.A.
entrance examination and driving test.   The adult recruits are required to
successfully complete a three week induction course, two weeks which
consists of ambulance aid and a further one week driving course.     The two
weeks ambulance aid consists of anatomy and physiology, basic trauma
management, resuscitation, lifting and handling, service procedures for
example, major incident and infectious diseases.


At the end of the two week ambulance aid course a pass/fail examination is
sat prior to undergoing the driving course.   Skill and service procedures
are consolidated and developed by Station Officers as an on going programme
when new recruits reach station.
The dedicated day transport personnel are responsible for the safe and
effective movement of elderly patients in and around the county to day
hospitals.


Aabalanceaan/Hanan (full tine)


This status is gained by a promotion from dedicated day transport duties
for SYMAS personnel.   Newly promoted staff undergo a further one week
intensive training course with the objectives of reinforcing existing
skills and updating individuals with recent changes and trends.


Core subjects such as resuscitation, role at large scale incidents etc are
studied.   The course is on a pass/fail basis with the pass mark being 70%.


Individuals are crewed with qualified members of staff and are rostered to
work with outpatients and attend urgent and emergency calls as required.


Aabalanceaan (qualified)


These are personnel who respond to 999 and urgent calls.     They undertake a
six week residential ambulance aid course at a regional school.     Students
skills and knowledge are taken several steps forward in readiness for the
demands of front line duties.    Anatomy and physiology, advanced trauma
management, childbirth, major incident, special incidents for example
chemical, all form part of the indepth syllabus.


A two week driving course follows the six week course.     The driving course
is to the standard of that in the H.M.S.O. Roadcraft handbook.


Students undertaking this course must achieve satisfactory results in order
to obtain a pass result.
A probation period follows the formal training which concludes with a full
day assessment which is sat in the services In-Service-Training-Unit.


HB    United Kingdom ambulancemen-women have to requalify every five years.
      SYMAS personnel undertake a one week updating course every 2.1/2 years
      The syllabus includes resuscitation, anatomy and physiology, major
      incident procedures, drugs and service procedures.

With Mr G. L. Wilkinson's Compliments
                              STATEMENT


GERALD LESLIE WILKINSON states :

1   I was born on


2   I am employed as the Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer for
     the Hampshire Ambulance Service.


3   I commenced   my    career     in   the Ambulance       Service   as   a

    trainee    ambulanceman        with   the   Westmoreland       Fire    and

    Ambulance Service in April 1973.                  I took the 6 weeks

    basic ambulance aid training course at West Lea Training

    School run by Lancashire Ambulance Service in September
     1983,   following which       I studied     for    the   Institute of

    Certified Ambulance Personnel.


4   In 1977 I attended a two week supervisor course at the

    Ambulance Training Centre in Keighley and was promoted to

     Leading Ambulanceman in November 1976.


5   During the time which I spent as a Leading Ambulanceman I

     became involved in the training of personnel, both in the

     service and in outside organisations.                  This led to me

     qualifying as a DHSS Ambulance Aid Instructor in 1979.

    After obtaining this qualification I was used regularly

     to   instruct     both   in   service      and    at   West   Yorkshire

     Ambulance Training School, Keighley.


6   In May 1980 I was promoted to Station Officer at Penrith

     Ambulance Station.
    7    I took up a position as Assistant Divisional Officer (HQ)

         at South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service on 1st

         August 1983 and in late 1986 I was promoted to Divisional

         Officer       (Control   and Communications).                 I took up my
         present position with the Hampshire Ambulance Service in

         June 1988.


    8    In    about    early     1986    Mr.       Page   told   me   that   he    was

         delegating to me the job of preparing incident plans for

^        the 5 Football Grounds within the SYMAS region.                           Those

         are the grounds of Sheffield Wednesday, Sheffield United,

         Rotherham, Doncaster Rovers and Barnsley.                      It was about

         this time that the Popplewell Report was published and we

         were    concerned        about   the       safety   at   Sports      Grounds,

         particularly in relation to the possibility of fires.



    9    I am the officer referred to in Mr. Page's letter of 16th
         January 1986, which he sent to the 5 Football Clubs and I


•
         saw that letter shortly before it went out.


    10   The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday replied to the letter
         of 16th January by letter of 29th January addressed to

         Mr.    Page and Mr.       Page passed that letter to me.                      I

         telephoned the Football Club to arrange a meeting and

         spoke     to     Mr.     Chester's           secretary        to   make     the

         arrangements.              I also wanted the Police to be there

         and I believe they liaised with the Fire Service.




                                                2
The meeting at the ground did not take place until 16th
July     1986.         I    think       the     delays    were      caused    by

difficulties of all parties being available and I think,
although I am not sure, that the Club preferred to deal

with the matter in the closed season.



The meeting of 16th July was attended by myself, Station
Officers,     Higgins and                        a Police Inspector and

Police Sergeant,        and two people from the Fire Brigade.
When we arrived, we were introduced to Mr. Chester (the

Club    Secretary)      who      then    left    us    with                  (the

Groundsman) who showed us round.



It was during the tour of the ground that we discussed

with    the   Police       and    Fire    Service      where    the   casualty

clearing post/mortuary would be in the event of a major

incident, this was agreed to be the gymnasium.



Following        the       tour    we     were        taken    to     see    the

physiotherapist, Mr. _______ in his room.                     At that point I

believe that the Police and Fire Service representatives
left.         Mr. Higgins,                              and I spoke to Mr.

         about Ambulance Service cover.                   I told Mr.
that we could provide Ambulance Service resources for the

ground, but that this would involve a charge.                          He told

me that the Club would not wish to pay such a charge and

that they were happy with their current arrangements with

the     St.   Johns    Ambulance        Brigade       which   attended      their

matches and which gave first aid training to the Club's
personnel at the beginning of each season.                       He said that

whenever the Club had needed the ambulance service they

had relied upon making a 999 call.



I told Mr.               that, if we could not actually provide
an ambulance at the ground we would like to have two
officers       inside    the    ground        in   the    interest   of    crowd

safety.         I said that if an ambulance was required they

would     be   able     to    contact     Control        to   arrange     for   an

ambulance more quickly than the Club could do so.                          I was

talking about crowd safety,                but Mr.               did mention

that if a player was hurt he would certainly like an

ambulance to arrive as quickly as possible.


I suggested       that       the Club    should provide us with two

tickets in order that we could put liaison officers in

the ground so that they could get resources to the ground

as quickly as possible.                  Mr.         said that if I wrote
to the Club then he could arrange for two tickets to be

provided.


We discussed where these complimentary seats should be.

Mr.             offered       us   two    seats      at    the   back     of    the

trainers box at pitch level but,                    after discussion with
Mr. Higgins and Mr.                       \    I requested two seats in

the Stand.        There were three reasons for this :-


17.1      communication to Control by radio would be better

          from higher up in the Stand;
17.2      there would be a much better view of other parts

          of the ground from there;


17.3      there would be better access to a telephone and to
          the physiotherapists room.          We suggested two seats
          to Mr.         which were behind the directors' box
          and close to one of the exits that went down into

          the Stand.



I   subsequently       wrote   a    letter    in    the   name    of    the

Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer, addressed

to Mr. Chester at the Club,              that letter was dated 6th

August 1986.       I understand that subsequently the season

tickets were collected by Mr. Higgins or Mr.


I   had    previously     prepared        a   draft     incident       plan

applicable to all        five of the Football Grounds in our

region.       The station officers assigned to each of the

grounds     then   completed       the   plans     by   filling   in    the

appropriate blanks.            In the case of Hillsborough this

was done by station officers Higgins and                          .


At the meeting of 16th July we had discussed the question

of ambulance access to the ground but not access to the

pitch.      When that meeting took place the Spion Kop was

in the process of being built.
21   Prior to the meeting of July 1986 SYMAS had always had
     two ambulances on stand-by close the ground on the days
     of major matches, but following that meeting it has been

     possible     to have    one   ambulance   inside    the ground     for

     major matches and arrangements for this have always been
     made with the Police.


22   Once   the   incident    plans   had   been    prepared   for   all   5
     grounds I put copies into the Control Room.               I monitored

     the arrangements for Football Grounds for a short time,
     until my promotion to Divisional              Officer   (Control   and

     Communications).

          from higher up in the Stand;
17.2      there would be a much better view of other parts

          of the ground from there;



17.3      there would be better access to a telephone and to
          the physiotherapists room.         We suggested two seats
          to Mr. Smith which were behind the directors’ box
          and close to one of the exits that went down into

          the Stand.



I   subsequently    wrote     a    letter    in   the   name   of       the

Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer, addressed

to Mr.    Chester at the Club,          that letter was dated 6th

August 1986.       I understand that subsequently the season

tickets were collected by Mr. Higgins or Mr.                        L


I   had   previously    prepared         a   draft   incident       plan

applicable to all five of the Football Grounds in our
region.      The station officers assigned to each of the

grounds    then   completed       the   plans   by   filling   in       the
appropriate blanks.         In the case of Hillsborough this

was done by station officers Higgins and



At the meeting of 16th July we had discussed the question

of ambulance access to the ground but not access to the

pitch.      When that meeting took place the Spion Kop was

in the process of being built.
21      Prior to the meeting of July 1986 SYMAS had always had

        two ambulances on stand-by close the ground on the days

        of major matches, but following that meeting it has been

        possible      to   have   one   ambulance   inside    the ground     for

        major matches and arrangements for this have always been

        made with the Police.


22      Once    the   incident     plans   had   been    prepared   for   all   5

        grounds I put copies into the Control Room.                 I monitored

        the arrangements for Football Grounds for a short time,
        until   my promotion to Divisional              Officer   (Control   and

        Communications).




GERALD LESLIE WILKINSON



Dated
                will say as follows:-


1.   I was    born on    the 4th January         1952,   and   I live       at
                            Doncaster.      I am a station officer based

     at Doncaster, and I joined the ambulance service in 1973.                      I

     only remained with the service for a few months and then

     left, but in January 1975 I rejoined the service when it was
     known as Symas.      I was initially based at Bentley which is

     within the West Riding.            When I returned to the ambulance

     service,    I was   initially      a driver,      and   then   I became        a

     leading ambulance man in 1982 and finally became a station

     officer 2 or 3 years later.          I moved to Doncaster station as
     station officer in February 1987.


2.   My training involved attending a six week residential course

     at   Markfield.        I    have    also    undertaken         an    advance

     resuscitation course at Markfield a life saving course, and

     a number of refresher courses over the years.                       I have no

     formal   paramedic training although as             I am in charge of
     paramedic staff I have taken a basis induction course into

     all aspects of this particular training.



3.   I was off duty on Saturday 15th April 1989.                I was at home

     watching Grandstand when I became aware of the Hillsborough
     incident,    shortly       after   3.00    p.m.     The   pictures          from

     Hillsborough came up on the television, and I could see that
     the football match had just stopped as a result of a police
officer     running    onto      the    pitch.         I    observed        what      was

happening on the television, and after a couple of minutes I

was aware that something was wrong and it was not just a
matter of crowds invading the pitch.                   I called my wife into

the living room and said I was going to put on my uniform in

readiness, anticipating a phone call from work.                         Rather than

telephone work,       I drove straight down to Bentley which is

approximately       three   miles       from     home.           When   I     arrived,

ambulance                        |, who was off duty, had already come
into the station.        he had also noticed the incident whilst
watching television.



I telephoned Control            and    asked    them   if     they      had    a Duty

Officer at Hillsborough and whether they wanted me to take

over as Duty Officer for the rest of Symas.                       Alternatively I
suggested    that    I team      up     with    Mr                      and    take    a

vehicle down to Hillsborough.             It should be noted that there

is no one specific Duty Officer within Symas,                             rather all

station    officers    work      the     rota    and       take    turns      as    Duty

Officer.     Control informed me to take a vehicle with Mr

            and drive down towards Sheffield.                        Mr

drove the ambulance,          and     I would say that we Bentley at
approximately 3.30 p.m.               Before we had arrived at Tinsley

Viaduct,    we   heard      a    message        over       the    vehicle          radio

requesting all vehicles who were approaching Hillsborough to

locate at gate 0 on Penistone Road.
We approached Hillsborough via Herries Road South, and as we
were    driving    down,    I   noticed    a    large    number    of    people
walking all over Herries Road in every direction.                       We were

only able to gain access              through the crowds          slowly,   and

shortly afterwards I noticed a stationary ambulance vehicle

at the junction with Penistone Road.              Mr |              pulled up

behind     this   vehicle,      and    immediately       behind    us    was   a

Nottinghamshire ambulance vehicle.              Very shortly afterwards,
another three or four vehicles pulled up behind the notts

vehicle. I would say that the time was approximately 3.45 or

3.50 p.m.     From this position I could            observe a number of

Symas vehicles alongside the ground perimeter on Penistone

Road, which is marked with a red line on the attached plan.

I   also   specifically      recall     large    numbers    of     the   crowd

chatting and also smelling of alcohol.


Whilst stationary,         I heard on the vehicle radio that all

vehicles    were    requested     to     locate    at    Herris     Road    Bus

station.     Penistone Road was full with all types of motor

vehicles and people.         As the number of vehicles parked on

Penistone Road began to diminish, presumably having picked
up casualties from which the ground,              I realised that more

vehicles would be required shortly to enter the ground at

point A marked on the attached.            I got out of my ambulance

and    spoke to a police officer who was                 stood at point B

marked on the attached plan.            I informed him that a message

had been relayed advising that all ambulance vehicles were
     to go to Herris Road bus station.                   I could see an ambulance
     officer organising the loading of ambulances outside gate 0

     - it should be noted that gate 0 is a turnstile and it only

     allows access for pedestrians not vehicles.                       I informed the

     police officer that I required my vehicle and all vehicles

     behind      to    have    access   across     on    to    Penistone      Road.    I
     prompted the police officer to stop all traffic coming down
     Penistone Road from a northerly direction which aloud my

     vehicle       and    those    behind     to    cross       over    the     central

     reservation and turn right on to Penistone Road.                           When Mr

                      pulled up on Penistone Road,               I would say that

     there were only two ambulance vehicles ahead.


7.   At this point I noticed David Jones Speaking to the crew
     inside the first vehicle in the que, and then he went to the

     second vehicle, by which time I could hear him requesting

     the crew in the second vehicle to take all blankets off
     their vehicle.           When David Jones arrived at our vehicle, he

     acknowledged me, and then asked me to take a medical team,

     who    were      stood    alongside    him,    up    to    Barnsley      District

     hospital and to establish a liaison point at that hospital.

     The medical team were three             strong, and got into the back

     of    the   vehicle      and Mr                    then    drove    straight     to

     Barnsley District General, and arrived outside the casualty

     department.         I would say that we left Hillsborough shortly

     after 3.00 p.m. and arrived at the hospital at approximately
     4.20 p.m. / 4.25 p.m.
When we arrived at Barnsley District General I noticed the

entrance to casualty was full of medical staff, presumably
awaiting   admissions.          I   informed    Control     that   we   had

arrived.   I then got out of the vehicle and went across to

the   medical   teams   and   enquired    who    was   in    charge.      I
informed the person in charge, who was a sister, that I was

her ambulance liaison officer for this incident.                   I then
went back to my vehicle, at which point in time the station

officer            | arrived.       He had also been requested by

Control to attend Barnsley District General.


During my time at the hospital, I only recall seeing three
casualties from Hillsborough being admitted.              I continually

kept in contact with Control,         and my main concern was the

anticipated number of casualties, but as time elapsed I was

continually informed that the Northern General and the Royal

Hallamshire hospitals were coping.


I left Barnsley District Hospital at 6.10 p.m. when matters

were generally under control, and there            was also the facts
that Mr             was present and he continued to be the

liaison officer.    When I informed Control that Mr _________
and I were leaving, I was requested the ascertain whether a

patient was still at the Barnsley District General "nothing

to do with the Hillsborough incident",            and if so, to take
that patient back to Hampton on our way back to Doncaster.
The patient was still at the hospital, he was loaded on to
the ambulance and after dropping him off, Mr           and I

arrive back at Bentley at approximately 10.00 p.m.   We then

cleaned the vehicle, reported to Control that we had arrived

and were released to go home.
I                  born   on           L     I am   a   Q u a lified

Ambulanceman, employed by SYMAS. I am stationed at Batemoor.

I have been employed by SYMAS for 29 years.



I normally work shifts but on Saturday 15th April 1989 I was

off duty at my home.       The first I knew of an incident was
when I noticed on Teletext that reference was made to the

Liverpool match.      I did not take much notice because I am

not really interested in football.


It would be between 1600 and 1610       that I saw a news flash

on the television that indicated that there was some sort of

major incident at Hillsborough.


I avoided using the telephone because I knew they would be
busy so I went up to Batemoor on my motorcycle.         I used the

land line from Batemoor to ring Rotherham control and asked

what was happening.       I spoke to a control assistant.     I was

asked to make my way at once to Hillsborough.       I was joined

at Batemoor by                 I   He was also on his day off,

and together we took an ambulance to Hillsborough.



When we left Batemoor I used the radio whilst                   was

driving.   I used the emergency channel to try and contact

control; radio quality was poor and it was some time before

I got through.       We identified ourselves and headed for

Hillsborough.      It would be about 1630.
We drove to Leppings Lane and were soon engulfed in a crowd

of people.     Over the radio we heard a call from control to

go to Herries Road bus station.      It was a general call.    We

began to make our way towards Herries Road.          It was not
easy because of the crowds of spectators.     I did not see any

fighting and did not^egicounter any trouble with the crowd.

Eventually we arrived^Herries Road bus garage, and stood by

there for over half an hour.



Around 1745 we were told to go to the main gate on Penistone

Road.    We proceeded to the ground as instructed.    We parked

inside    the perimeter of the ground.         Several of our
officers were present in particular Alan Hopkins, Don Page

and David Jones.


After a while we were required to move bodies from the gym

to the public morgue.       We were not told when to move the

bodies because they had not     at that time been released.



Between    1830    and 1900      I assisted   in     the gym with

preparation of the removal      of bodies   i.e. to prepare   the

equipment for removal, not the     actual bodies     themselves.



Sometime later David Jones advised___________ and I that we
were free to go if we wished, as they were not at that time
ready to move the bodies.      We drove back to the Station and
      then signed off.



11.   I did not experience any trouble or violence from the crowd.

      Usually the radio contact is good with control at Rotherham,

      but on this day it was poor.



12.   All ambulance staff carry an identification card, and on the

      reverse of that card are instructions about what to do at a

      major incident.         It really applies to first arrivals at
      the   scene.    I had    no   need   to   refer   to   the   card   or

      instructions.

      trouble at Hi 1 l s b o r o u g h . "                All    the    serials       that were meal in g went                   to

      their        respe ct iv e        vans and          headed for H i l l s b o r o u g h Football               Ground.

      At about 3 . 2 0            pm    (1520)       we    ente r ed     the P en i st o ne Road        end of the

      ground and           on a l i g h t i n g      from the van             I saw a group of youths                 carrying

      a man from the g ro un d on an a d v e r t i s i n g                       hoarding,        the ma n was

      o b vi ou sl y dead.              At    this     time m ys e lf and the            rest     of the serial

      thought        that       the     trouble at the g ro u nd was an outbreak                             of violence.

      Wit h the others,                 I ran down the             s l ip wa y onto      the field and saw what                        I

      can only d es cribe                as mayhem.              The L ep pi n gs Lane          end half       of the       pitch

      was    covered w i t h            people m i ll i ng a r o u n d a nd bodies                laid on        the field

 ^    It was        obvious          to all       present        that    tempers wer'? running                high amongst

      the    hundreds           of fans who were                 not    injured but were           on the        pitch and             it

      a p p e a r e d to me          that     they w o u ld       invade       the H op end where             N o t ti n gh a m

      Forest        s u p po r te r s were.           This       became more          obvious w he n         the Notts

      The Liv e r p oo l          fans       thought       they were          clapping     because      the Liverpool

      peope were           dead or           injured.         I heard numerous             remarks a bout            this      from

      Li v e r p o o l    s u pp o rt e rs     and     some      ran towards        the Kop       intent       on fighting.

      I also        noti c e d       that m an y of the Liv er po ol                fans    on the      field were             under

      the    influence            of alcohol          and the          stench    of beer was very strong.

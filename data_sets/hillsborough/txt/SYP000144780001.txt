Subject :         Sheffield Football Disaster




                        I have attended at                                   which is the address
                  of a |
                       ______________ 126 years, who was subject of a report forwarded to
                  Police Station, in connection with the enquiry into the Hillsborough football
                  disaster in April. On interviewing^                 |he informed me that two
                  officers from the West Midland^ Force had already been to his address and
                  obtained a Witness Statement from him concerning the incident. He stated he
                  could add nothing further to that and that he, in fact, was located at the
                  opposite end of the Football Ground to where the disaster occurred.     In view
                  of these circumstances I have not obtained a Witness Statement from
                  and I therefore return this report for your information.

Liverpool      fans in the c e n t r a ^ c l o s u r e   of the Leppingsj*n terrace.

From    12 mid-day ( 120 0L ^ n t i 1 2.55 pm <1455)                t^jf^day I was stood at a

turnstile at the              f'rth Stand end of Pe           one Rd turnstiles,        searching

and c he c k inq^Jfb 11 j.ng ham Forest fSPf who were going on to the Ko p ,

When I arrived at the turnstile                   it was just opening.        From where I was

stood 1 could see fans stood on the opposite side of the road drinking

from ca ns .     Whilst       I was stood at the turnstile             I was approached by

five    Liverpool fans at               different times who stated that they had

tickets for the Hop but                 that they were afraid to go on the Hop and

wanted to go on the Leppings Ln terrace.                       1 advised them that if they

had Hop tickets then that was where they had to go but I did not see

them enter the ground'.                The t u r n s U ^ e whi ch I was stood at was never

crowded and the Forest fans w a «                 entering the ground easily and

quickly.     There were a few^forest                fans o b v i o u s l s ^ m m k who were

arrested.       As the time                 proached 3.00 pm CdfgQO) there were small

groups of fans w ho d ijlf not have t i cketjpand were attempting to jump

the turnstiles.         Ijlaw one fan get into the ground in this way before

I could get to him.             At 2.55 pm (1455)        that day X was called away from

from our serial to the gym area of the gr oun d.We were then told to go

as a Unit to the L e p p i n g y L n end of the

ground.     As I walked da&n the side of the pitch the game had already

started.     As I past jlne half way line there were three fans who were

sat    in front of             advertising hoardings at the side of the pitch and

hoardings and^then proceeded to the gorner of the Leppings Ln stand

and the Nortjl Stand where a gate to/the terrace was open.                           There were

fans on t h # track behind the goal/                  I stood at this point with other

            plenty of space.        I then saw Superintendent GREENWOOD go onto the

            pitch and the game was stopped.        I then walked from the corner of the

            ground to the right hand side of th ^- goa l.      1 went to the gate onto

            the terraced and assisted fansydirough the gate onto the pitch.             In

            front of me I could see PSy^AYNE stood on the fence between the

            enclosures       pulling people from pen three and out through the gate.

           Some of the fans were shouting that there was someone dead at the

            terrace     it appeared that an officer was giving     resuscitation to

            someone on the floor.        I saw a fan come up and attempt to kick the

           off i c e r s .   At this time the fence was being pulled in an attempt to

            break it by fans and police officers.        At this time an ambul an ce came

            onto the pitch and behind the goal.        1 went up to the rear doors with

           PC 1•141 S MITH waited for the driver to unlock them and took out a

           stretcher from the back.         With PC SMITH I took   it to where the fence

            hajd been broken and pul 1 ed a large male who appeared dead through the

      if enee and oxlL®— kfoe— al.rut.rhe r and then into the amb ulance .     I then

           assisted in pulling more fans onto the pitch.           I then looked round and

           saw bodies laid out on the pitch and fans and police officers          running

            up the pitch with advertising hoardings.         I then helped pull a male

            person who appeared dead onto the hoarding and ran to the other end of

             he pitch with him.        He was left outside the gym a n d then returned to

            the Leppings Ln end of the pitch.        There were still lots of fans on

            the pitch but all the bodies had been taken away and all the

          /advert isi ng hoardi ngs were dumped in the g o al mo ut h.

            A message was given out over the tannoy by Kenny DALGLISH and a

            further one to say that the game was abandoned and the fans began to

         JjL 1 eave   the ground.    I remained on the pitch and joined the rest of my

            serial from which I had become separated.        When the ground was empty

            we went as a unit out into Leppings L n .

              After a short while we returned to our transit by the gym from where

              we went out on a mobile public order patrol on Infirmary R d and

              Penistone R d.            Then later in the City Centre,       We returned to the

              ground at 8.00 pm (2000) when we were stood down and went off duty at

              *E ' DHG at 8.30 pm (2030) that day.

p-            During the incident I did not have a radio and therefore did not hear

              any orders given.                I feel that there were more officers in the same

              situation and that orders could be given out over the tannoy system to

              assist both the officer on the pitch and the fans.

              tape reference            (MAP7)    15.18.03.20 to 15.19.20.24 (Data Base) a

              sequence shows a grpriip of uniformed Police Officers removing the body

              ,of       a man from     P/ex\   4, through the b roken fencing.      The body is placed

              on a red stretcher and is then wheeled to a St Johns Ambulance which

              is parked art the pitch behind the goals at Leppings Ln.

              The faces of the police officers are not clear but I recall this

              incident and I w^a one of the officers

              At reference MflP/7 15.18.03.20 two officers are shown taking the

              stretcher from the ambulance.                I can be seen to the rear of the

              stretcher            ie closest to the ambulance.

              The body I assisted to remove is the male I refer to i n my origina1

           I have been unable to identify the other man that       I refer to in my

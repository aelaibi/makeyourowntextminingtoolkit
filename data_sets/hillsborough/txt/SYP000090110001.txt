            I was not on duty on 15.4.89 <150489) and at the time of the disaster

            was at home with my wife.            We heard about the tragedy at approximately

            4.45 pm (1645)         on the television.



            I immediately want         into   the hospital               wj/Ch the casual t ies .



            I live i n ______________ and had to pass the g round on the way to the

            hospital.         The traffic congestion as expected was severe but on making

            myself known to the police on duty I was escorted speedily around the

traffic to the hospital



On arriviru                 tal   (shortly after 5 pm)     (1700)   I. met Mr

WARDROBE   <Tcasualty Consultant) who asked me to go to the

physiotherapy department



The physiotherapy de par tmeypfX hj       n designated to treat the walking

wounded,



Whi 1st in the department     I was assisted by numerous physiotherapists

and two medi cal students .



we nurtured a laceration of a knee and attended to other minor cases.



I admitted one teenage female who had thoraci c ventebral            pain due to

compression.   She had lost consciousness and we admitted her to the

surgical wards for observations only.



There were only relatively few casualties          in the department and most

were seen and treated there prior       to discharge.



I left the department after seven       o c 1ock   (1900)on that evening.



Patients who had been admitted to       the orthapaedic ward were then seen

on ward rounds on the Monday morning.



I had no other further dealings with the injured.

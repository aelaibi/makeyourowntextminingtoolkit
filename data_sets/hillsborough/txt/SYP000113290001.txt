                     specific duty was in front of the uncovered seats halfway between the
                                                                              '- q s ,- = L C > S .

    ■A
                     the serial and I was not in possession of a radio.

                     I was stood near to a television camera when at about 2.30pm the

                     cameraman commented on how empty was the part of the ground allocated

                     to the Liverpool        supporters at that time.

                     The game had just started when I noticed that supporters behind the

                                 at the Leppings Lane end of the ground were trying to climb over

                            fence.      I could see Police officers helping the supporters onto

^              Du?   the eield at that end of the ground.                    Suddenly there were hundreds of

                     supporters on the pitch.          1 tried to help the supporters off the

                     supporters        I came into contact with were aggressive and tried to get

           ^^^^amongst              the Nottingham supporters who were sat in the uncovered seats

                     and consequently had to be advised and on occasions restrained.                            Due

         to the amount of Liverpool supporters on the pitch and the attitude of

        most of them I was fearful of a confrontation with the Nottingham

         supporters   in the uncovered seats.    It was clear that many of the

         Liverpool supporters had been drinking and many wanted to f i g h t .

         It was some time before the enormity of the incident was realised and

         my feelings about most of the supporters      I came into contact with is

         that I would compare them with enraged animals.       I am sure that they

         must have been aware that a major      incident had occurred and did very

         little to help the Police and in many cases added to the problems.

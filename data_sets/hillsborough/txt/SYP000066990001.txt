driving           he    is a van driver                and knows        the    route.      As we t r a velled to

S h e f f i e l d we encounter             two sets of traffic                  d e l a y s , one by Manc h e s t e r

which       held us up for a bou t                    twentyfive         minu t e s    this was      caused by the

to use         the     toilets     but         had only been there a few minutes.                          We    parked

near       to a K e n t u c k y F r i e d Chic k e n Sho p and went                    into a book makers

next       door      to use the          toilet.         On the way           to the ground         I saw a few

people         having a drink             from        cans    of beer,        but    I d i d n ’t see anyone who

itself at about 2 . 1 5                  pot    ( 1 4 1 5 ), on the way to the ground                  I saw a few

F’olice        standing arouyfd,                but    none       of them d i r ected us,         w hich way           to go

as all         the     other    f o u r had been to the                 c o r r esponding      fixture      last year

an d knew where                to go to get             to the gro

As we got            near to the L e p pings Ln entra                                            orough         I could

see a mass             of   people      g a t h e r e d by the tu                                ss of     people

where       not      formed up into queues as                       I w o u l d have    expected but            it

d i d n ’t w orry me           too m uch as            I have       been down to Wemb l e y w h e n             it has

been the          same.        I can recall             seen some Police men by the                    iron gates and

by the         turnstiles.              I also        saw some Police            horses     in the     s t r e e t , but

none       of them gave           direc t i o n s       to any of the           supporters.          I think          they

were       just w a t ching        the         crowd.

All      five     of us joined the mass                      of    people at        the back.      We joined            the

mass       just      by the     iron gates,             at this       time     there was       plenty      of    room to

move about and             I was    not      curshsd     in anyway.            The mass            of people

slowly m oved         forward towards              the    turnstiles          a nd as we moved              forward

we    slowly     became      packed       together.          When we where about                    Fifteen feet

away    from the       t urnstiles           it became       packed w h i c h was alright                   for me

and     ________because we are                 quite     brlg but the          other            three are

small.         As we got to the              turnstiles        of our         choice       I put my head against

the wall        to a llow the threir smaller                   ones    to get under my arm and

t h r o u g h the    turnstiles        sjo    a l t h o u g h the   crowd was            packed at

the    turnstile       I was       not V p d e r    a great         deal      of   pressure.

I     then went       through the turnstile                  by     this      time it was about             half        past

two    (1430), ^ w e n t y five           to three        (1435).        As     soon as we got              through

the    t u rnstiles we got s e a r c h e d by a P o l ic e m a n and woman                           but

they     d i d n ’t tell      us where         to go,      these where             the     only Police           I saw

betw e e n     us going      through         the   turnstiles and              getting           on to the       terracing

I saw a couple             of men who had yellow or                   orange        h jr f is    o n , 1 presume

they were        s t e w a r d s , taut they d i d n ’t direct                     to the         terracing.

As    soon as we got through                  the t u r n s t i l a i ^ w e    headed for the              tunne1

w h i c h we    saw as      soon as we had gotv^rirough the                         turnstiles.             At    no

time    did     I see any         other      d irections       to other         entrances           to the

t e r racing     but my four          friends        knew where         they were               going.     As we

ente r e d the       tunnel       we had free         passageway along                 it a l t h o u g h there

w h e r e a lot of         people     in it there was               no crush.            At no time         did    1' see

any fighting          or disorder            in the ground,           nor did         I see anyone           drinking

alcohol        I saw no one         entering           the ground          illegally             nor did I see         any

other    entry       points       open apart        from the turnstiles.

Once    I got       onto    the    terracing           I found the            it to fairly f u l l and had

to squeeze          our way down to the               front.        We went         down to the             from so

                            and                      could see as             they are           only small      and

would    not have          been able         to see the game            from the           back of the

terracing.

   Four      of us       including                                  uhere       leaning       one a barrier

   directly         in front          of the    front     security fencing with                                  right at

   the front          by the f e n c i n g.      While we where                leaning       on the barrier

   there was a really                  bad surge        from the        back w h i c h      crushed us a l l,         till

   it hurt        but     it w a s n ’t too      bad,     I ’ve     e x p e r i e n c e d this      before at     other

   matches        so we decided           to move        down to the           front with                         as we

   w o u l d have        been    crushed up against               the    barrier all          through the        game.

   W h e n we got down to the front                      of the     terracing we where                packed

   together         but there was          no    crush and         1 had my          right hand holding              the

   railings         so    I w o u l d n ’t squeeze        up against           the    girl    in front      of me.

   This      girl     had      long    brown    curly hair         down to the middle                of her     back,

   she       had ^ong       fi n g e r n a i l s with    pink/red nail           varnish on,          she was

   wearing a light               blue    sweat    shirt     top on wit h a picture                   on both the

jQ^H a c k    and f r o n t , she       had track        suit     trousers       on made       of the same

   m aterial        as the       top on her       feet where            training       shoes,       she was     in her

   late       teens      or e a rly twenties.             This     girl       was with another           girl    who

   had a white            coat on and had short                 blonde        hair    cut    in a bob.

   We    had been standing               there    for about         four       or five minutes w hen the

   teams       ran out,         I saw the       last     few Liverpool           players       run out and then

   the       crush came         really    bad and        I could not move any                 part of my body.

   All       I could see was            the girls        head who        had been standing             in front           of

   me after a few minu t e s               I was able           to move my head and                 I could     see

   some      of the front fencing                and the        pitch      immediatly         in front      of the

   fencing.           The      game was    still        going     on at this          stage    because      I could

   hear      eve r y b o d y    cheering       behind me.          I though          it w ould ease       off    like

   it had done            before w h e n we       had been by the               barrier       but    it d i d n ’t

   e v e rytime       I tried to br e a t h        I found         it more       d i fficult        every time        I

   tried.         The     girl    in front was           panicking and           screaming all           the    time

   and as the            crush got worse          s he screamed more.                  I was     s creami ng to the

   Pol i c e    to open gate as we where                   dying        but    they did not seem to know

what    to do.       The       gate may have       been open at this stage                  but     I c o u l d n ’t

see    it.

1    stopped      screaming and           panicking as       I star t e d to black           out,      so     I put

my bead back and tried to breath as                        best      I     could,     but   I only got a

very    shallow breath every so often and                       in between           I w o u l d get     buzzing

in my ears and every t h i n g w ould go                  purple.          The    girl    in front      of me

s t o p p e d screaming and stopped moving                   her m outh was           open only a small

way and she         looked d e a d.         All   the time      the       crush was       getting worse

and after about            ten minutes        I was      sick   thro u g h the        railings.

The n the Police           started     pulling at the fences' in front of us but they

could not move            it.      I can then remember                      screaming at

me    from the other            side     of the   r a i l i n g s but     I     cannot    remember what            he

was    shouting.          I looked at the          girl/in      front          of me and     I saw she         had

gone    very      pale and her           lips had started         to turn blue.             After       this my

head    just      started to go           completely and         I was         blacking     out and after

a period of time               X d o n ’t know how long         I started getting                better

breaths       and started          coming    round a l t h o u g h       1 still     felt    bad.       At about

the time                 was    shouting     to me from the              pitch     I can remember

feeling       people      having        hold of my     legs a n d trousers            trying      to    pull

thems e l v e s    up,    but    I could not       do a n y t h i n g about         it because         of the

crush and also            I was        blacking   out myself.

As    I got    better      breaths my head was             still         w h izzing/I     felt a       lad to my

left    sliding      down rny arm,          I m a n a g e d to get my a/m ar o u n d hi.s head to

keep him up suddenly there was a lot of sp a c s / a n d this                                lad was        lent

up agai nst        the    fence.         He was   only just       coyiscious and slowly got                    his

breath back.             He had blonde        hair and w a y wearing a                   short    sleeved

red    ’Liverpool         Ca n d y "   top he was     only / a b o u t        e i g hteen years     of age and

small.        I also      lent    up against       the    fence a n d got my breath and when                         1

looked ar o u n d there was               loads   of space all            around.        By this       time    I

had    lost    sight      of the two girls           in front        of m e .

As    I looked aro u n d        the    pen    I was      conscious      of       loads   of bodies        piled

as high as the front wall,                    these      bodies    came      out about       five feet

these       bodies where        to my      left and to the          back         of me where more           bodies

and also       to the       right,     these      bodies where          tightly      packed on the

floor an d you had to be                careful        to tread a r o u n d them.

I turned a r o u n d        to walk away from the fence an d was                          stubbling a r o u n d

t r e ading a r o u n d the        bodies,       I was    crying and         in shock.           I was    very

light       headed.       S u d d e n l y a man who       I    had seen struggling wit h a girl

me,    so    I drag g e d her with the help of Jfhe man to the side                                fencing        on

the    right       hand side       of the     pen and/some         how m a n a g e d to       pass    her

over.        She    had b 1a c k ha i r , loo^red about            thirty y e a rs and had a lot of

blood about          her mouth.         Hely hair        was      short and straight.              She was

heavy       build arid w hen weVl i f t             her over      the   fence       I remember seen          a

br o w n birth mark          o n j/e r s t o rna ch.      She had a dark            c oat on a n d I t h i n k

cordorouy          trouserj

We then st^tjro             passing     the dead and           injured over          the    side     f e n c i n g to

other       people.       The   dead and         injured where all               from the     front      corner

of the       pen    I cannot       d e s cribe      any of the      ones         I passed over,          all I can

say    is that       only one       of them         was a female.            I     passed over five          or

six    bodies       I can     remember about           four m e n helping me.               I looked up to

the    back of the          ter r a c i n g and                also,      helping to          pass    bodies

over    the    fencing       he was     two      or three y a r d s / a w a y      from me,       I shouted to

him,    if he was all           right and wheres                    ' he said "he was alri g h t                  and

so was              '    i told     him,           was alright                           and I then

helped       pass another          person over the/fence.                 I cannot         say    if he was        dead

or    injured they all             looked the        sapfe to me.

              then      r e membered a bout        h/s younger          brother               so went to the

mass    of bodies w hich was               still     in the     e n closure        to see     if he was

amon g s t    them.     There where          two    police men       pulling       bodies    out of the

pile and       passing       them to other men who where                   passing     the   bodies        over

the fence.          These are        the only two P o l i c e m e n        I can    remember        seeing       in

the enclosure.

              saw              head and shoulders              sticking      out    from the        pile    of

bodies       d i r ectly u n d e r n e a t h the front       fencing.        I couldn't        get to

        because       I w o u l d have had to step on the                  bodies    but                   could

get    to           so he was        screaming,       "Thais my/ brother"            but as     he tried

to    reach him a P o l i c e m a n        pushed him back,/it was all                 confused,       but

              m a n a g e d to get    to I         bind pulleijl a couple           of bodies        off    him

and    dragged him half             out,     I managed    to    yean over and he 1 p

drag    him out       the    rest    of the way                was   very blue and he had rnucse

on his face,          he had also          been sick.            carried               to the       side

■Fence and       passed him over            to other     pep'le.      We    ran to the        back    of

t e rracing and around              the    fencing and down to the              gate    that    leads       on

to the       pitch.     At    first       the Police w e r e n ’t going to           let us on to the

pitch but                     e x p l a i n e d we had just      passed his         brother     on to the

pitch and that we thought                   he was    dead so they          let us on.

We s e a r c h e d around on the             pitch for               as    there where aload of

bodies       on the    pitch and we even t u a l l y           f o u n d ______ with a Notts Forest

fan,             rna.s in    the    recovery       position and       the forrest          fan was

talking       to him and trying             to bring     him around.          The Forrest           fan said

a Police man          had seen to                  knd he was OK.

a n d told a P o l i c e m a n      to get       him to ambulance.           A P o l i c e m a n who was

hour     but              hadn't     returned so                       went with a P o l i c e m a n             to try

an d find him.             About an hour aftfer                           had gone                   returned after

been t reated at the Hallaroshire Hospital                                  so we went          to the Police

At    the Police          station they /could remember                                  going       in but       could not

remember which hospital                    h i    had been taken                to so we       left the Police
                                           }/
S t a t i o n and went        to the N o r t h e r n General                Hospital          as we thought          that
                                       /
was where                  had gon^f to.

On our arrival             there <ie spoke Police                    co-ordinator who                said he would

get    in touch with                   together we wa i t e d                   for    news    of               and at

a bout    10.30      pm    (£230)     a social              worker     found out where                          was and we

went     up to the war,£i and              found                   ^as with                  after       been    returned

to the     hospital         some     time        before.

         was    d i s c h a r g e d about m i d n i g h t          (0000)       and together we made                our

way    back     to L i v e r p o o l and         got       home about 2.0 0 am               (0200).

At    no time while           I was    in the ground did                    I see any          criminal          offences.

The    only     criticism       I have           got are        that    there where            not enough          people

in the enclosure             getting        the           bodies   out,     there where             enough       people    on

the    pitch helping.              If more            people       had been getting             them out          some

more     people      like I           Icould have             been saved.

             I would       not entirly blame           the Police       I think       the FA have also    got a

             lot    to answer       for,    because      of the ticket a l l o c a t i o n .
                                                                       /'              ,
             Whilst      I was at the hospital              waitip^      for           t saw the girl    in the

             white      coat who      had been standings in front                of me original.    She    carne

             over     to talk to me and            told j 6 e   that   her     friend with the blue

             tra c k s u i t was alive       b^ut c o u l d n ’t move     her    legs.

             Also when         I was w a i t i n g / o n the    pitch the       lad   in the Liverpool    shirt      I

             s aved from falling            down     came up to me and thanked me,

        - CONTROL ASSISTANT
(off duty)


Date:   18.4.89

Time:   1415-1435




I received a phone call at approximately 1545. I had a driving lesson
booked and was advised that I could carry on with this. I did get into
Control at about 1730 to find that the incident was largely under control
and I was mainly concerned with incidental calls: hospitals requesting
transfers, other services making general enquiries.

On my arrival everything seemed to be in hand and under control.

                                                -
I was        in company w i t h P C 1 0 9 ; K F o s t e r              from    11.00am         that morning.          We

were     c o ncerned wit h                 the a re a of B r a d f i e l d R o a d and the H i l l s b o r o u g h

sh o p p i n g    precinct.                We were       not    in p o s s e s s i o n of a radio.            Our    only

way    of knowing what was                        hap p e n i n g    e l s ewhere was       via P S P e r r y who     had a

radio,        who        kept       us u p da te d     periodically.

At    11 . 15am          I attended           the    ’T h r e s h e r ’ Off    licence         in Siiddlewood R o a d .
                                                          \
I n o t i c e d that            there wer e          seve'ral stacks           of    canned strong           lager

'Stella Atois*                  near       to the entrance             of the       shop.       Being a possible

t arget       I requested               that      the shop staff           remove        the    cans    to   prevent

a n y o ne    rushing           in and grabbing                them.     This was         done.

The    precinct and B r a d f i e l d R oad were                        p a t r o l l e d for    the next 2 .1/2

hours without               incident.               During      that    time a steady flow of both team

s u p p o r t e rs       passed        us ma k i n g    their way to_the             football          ground.      Several

supporters,               a g a in of both teams,                   enadfiried about Public Houses

open     in the           area. The          pubs      in our       v i c inity were        all    closed.

At    1.50pm         I    a t t e n d e d at      ’Thre^ner*          on iiiddl ewood Road.              Inside the

shop were a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 0 j / i v e r pool                supp o r t e r s all      of who m were

p u rchasing an aver a g e                    of d cans         of    l a ger/beer and bottles               of wins..

The    shop Mana g e r               had    lo/ked       the shop door          to    prevent       other     customers
                                \
entering.  I ente r e d X h e shop and s u g g e s t e d to the Mana g e r that he
                  V
ceased trading until a fter 3pm w hen the bulk of the supporte rs would

be at        the football               ground.         The Mana g e r was           only too       pleased to        comply

with     our      suggestion.                The 30        customers       in the shop were served and the

shop     ceased t r a d i n g .              On     leaving         the shop a group of appro:-: imate ly 50

Liv e r p o o l      supporters             had     formed a queue            outside       the shop.        They were

told     the shop had been                     closed.         The y d i s p e r s e d    in the d i r e c t i o n of

As   the     next      half    hour    lapsed       it became         obvious         that     the m a j o r i t y      of

the s u pp orters            passing     us were        from L i v e r p o o l       and    it a p p e a r e d    that       the

majority           had been drinking.              At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 3 5 pm a group of

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20 Liv e r p o o l    suppo r t e r s     crossed          the    road at      the traffic

light      j u n c t i on of liiddlewood R oad and B radf i e Id Road,                            about      100 yards

  rom us.           One of the        suppo r t e r s    stepped         in front          of a vehicle as              it

m o v e d off.         The    driver     s ou n d e d the      car h o r n , and the supporter

r esponde d         by pouring a glass              of beer over           the w indscreen.                The     car

then     s ped off and the sup p o r t e r mi n g 1ed                    in w i t h the        rest of his group.

I made my way over                  to the     scene of the           incident with P C F o s t e r .                   We

were     u n a c companied.           The    s u pporters all male               qui e t e n e d down w hen             they

saw us approaching.                   They w a l k e d off with o u t            further         incident.           A shop

k eeper      near      the    traffic       lights was washing                 the    pavement        down with

water as 2 members                  of the 20 supporters                 had vomi t e d on the f o o t p a t h as

they     passed.                                                     ,

At 3 . 1 0 pm that           day I was       conveyed         trf Po l i c e    Transit        together w i t h

PC Fo s t e r       to the L e p p                                                           nstiles.            We were

                                                              had been trouble                outside      the     ground

and we were            requirted to p^'trol             the    road outside            the ground.               After

                                                              ers   came       out of the stand,                 one a man

of 3 0 / 3 3 years was              crying     u n c o n t r o 1 l a b 1y and    saying 6 people were                    dead

This was           the first        inclin we       had of any fatalities.                      The     radio

m e s sages        w h i c h were   o ve r- he ar d     on other         officers          r a d i o ’s were      garbled

and gave no            idea of the          seriousness          of the        incident        inside      the ground.

We were       only 50 yards            from the         terrace.         After       approximately           1 hour          the

number       of fans         leaving     the L e p pings Lane             terrace          increased       from a

trickle       to a mass         exodus.         It was        obvious      that       the m a j o r i t y of the

L i v e r p oo l    s upporters       were     upset wit h the Pol i c e and they spoke                            of    ’the

g a t e ’ being        opened.        A g a i n we were        not aware         of anything           that       o c c urred

              The    crowds     d is pe r s e d and   I believe      we were lucky to       avert a riot            owing

              to    the    feeling     being    displayed.

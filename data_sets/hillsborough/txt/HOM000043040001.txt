         Dear S ir,


         Re: The Hillsborough Public Inquiry


         We are seeking to obtain a copy of relevant p arts of the o f f i c i a l
         t r a n s c r i p t of the preliminary or opening session of the Inquiry, which
         we understand was held at Sheffield Town Hall on Friday, 28th April
         1989.

         We understand from Messrs. Davies Arnold Cooper t h a t i t was upon th a t
         occasion t h a t Lord Ju s tic e Taylor de alt with the costs of legal
         representation of any party allowed rep resentation at the Inquiry and i t
         i s in the comments and decisions t h a t his Lordship made upon th a t
         subject t h a t we are in te r e s te d .

         For your information, t h i s firm acts for Applicants for Ju dicial Review
         of an order fo r the costs of another recent public inquiry and we are
         seeking fo r t h a t purpose to c o ll a te fo r purposes of comparison and
         analogy orders made in other recent public d i s a s t e r in q u irie s for the
         b en efit of persons who may be in a sim ilar position to our C lients.

         Messrs. Davies Arnold Cooper have a c le a r attendance note of the
         proceedings at the preliminary session of t h i s Inquiry, but inform us
         t h a ^ a o not have a copy of the o f f i c i a l t r a n s c r i p t and cannot therefore
         f u l f i l our request of them fo r a copy of i t . They have suggested th a t
         we w rite to you fo r t h i s purpose; hence our present enquiry.

         I f you could l e t us have copies of the relevant parts of th a t da/s
         t r a n s c r i p t of t h i s Inquiry, we would be most grateful to you and would
         of course be happy to pay any photocopying charges t h a t are involved.

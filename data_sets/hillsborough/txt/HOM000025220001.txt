The Allocation of FA Cup Final Tickets

                       Report of the Chief Trading Standards Officer
                        (Officer Contact - Peter Mawdsley 225 3322)

Introduction
 1. In May 1988 trading standards officers from Liverpool City Council carried out
     the first in-depth investigation into the allocation of tickets by the Football
     Association for the FA Cup Final.  In respect of the 1988 Final between Liverpool
     and Wimbledon evidence of the extent of ticket touting was gathered by means of
     a telephone hot-line for fans who had paid inflated ticket prices and by interview­
     ing fans arriving at Wembley Stadium on Cup Final day.  The results of the
     investigation were reported to the City Council in August 1988.

 ^^The     FA's allocation system in 1988 was approximately as follows:-

                   Finalists                      50,000
                   County Football Associations   27,000
                   Overseas Association              500

                   First Division Clubs            5,000
                   Second Division Clubs           5,000

                   Third Division Clubs            1,400

                   Fourth Division Clubs           1,400

                   Non-League Clubs                1,500
                   FA Council Representatives      1,250

                   Football Association            2,000
                   Wembley Stadium                   500

      It will be noted that almost half the available tickets were allocated to clubs,
      associations and individuals not connected with the two finalists.  Additionally
      no account was taken in the allocation of the average number of regular supporters
      following each finalist.

 3.   The evidence gathered in the 1988 investigation revealed:-

      a)   450 specific allegations of overpriced tickets from the hot-line
           and from enquiries made of approximately 5% - 10% of fans at the
           Final.  Details of all ticket serial numbers were passed to the
           FA;

      b)   the stamps of 56 Football Clubs or County Football Associations
           appeared on approximately 150 of the overpriced tickets, additionally
           about 300 carried no stamp to identify the source to which they
           were originally allocated by the FA;

      c)   many examples of forged tickets were evident at the 1988 Cup Final;

      d)   large numbers of Liverpool supporters had been able to purchase
           tickets from touts for the V.’ir.bledon end of the stadium leading to
           a breakdown in segregation arrangements;

      e)   a degree of ticket-related violence was observed outside the
           stadium with at least four ticket touts being attacked and two
           attempts being made by ticketless supporters to storm the gates.

                                                                                   c o n t :-
                                         - 2 -

4.   The Chief Trading Standards Officer's report concluded that the FA's
     allocation policy for tickets for the Cup Final could lead to:-

     a)   large supplies of tickets going to persons not wishing to
          attend the Cup Final;

     b)   ticket shortages amongst the supporters of one or both       j
          finalists;                                                   !

     c)   supporters having to pay inflated prices for tickets from
          unofficial sources;

     d)   a potentially lucrative market for ticket forgers;

     e)   the safety of supporters being put at risk due to failures
          in segregation arrangements and large numbers of fans
          travelling without tickets.

5.   Liverpool City Council subsequently supported all the recommendations
     included in the report which were as follows

     a)   the FA review their ticket allocation policy and provide more
          tickets for the two clubs in the Cup Final;

     b ) the FA take into account average home league attendances when
         apportioning tickets between the finalists;

     c)   the FA require all tickets to be stamped with the identity of
          the organisations to v/hich they are allocated;.
                                                         f
     d)   the FA conduct an enquiry with the aid of the serial numbers
          provided in the report to establish how those tickets came to
          be sold at inflated prices;

     e)   the FA take disciplinary action against those found to be in
          breach of FA rules;

     f)   the FA publish their ov/n report on the results of their
          investigations.

S.   A copy of the report was submitted to the Director General of Fair Trading
     under Section 2 of the Fair Trading Act 1973 alleging that the FA's ticket
     allocation policy acted against the economic and safety interests of consumers
     and was, therefore, subject to review by the Director General in accordance
     with his duty under that legislation.  Copies of the report were also
     submitted to the Minister of Sport, all Liverpool MPs, Liverpool and Everton
     Football clubs.

Responses to the 1988 Report
7. The report was sent to the FA on 25th July, 1988.     The FA decided to set up a
    special sub-committee of their Matches and Grounds Committee to consider m
    detail the evidence provided by Liverpool City Council's report.    To date
    (September 1989) no response has been received other than to acknowledge
    receipt, to indicate that their enquiries are continuing and to indicate that
    they will be producing a report into their investigations of Liverpool City
    Council's allegations which they m a y or may not make public.

8.   It is understood that the FA have provided an interim report to the Director
     General of Fair Trading indicating the action they have taken against clubs,

        City Council's report to have breached FA rules as regards tickets allocated             <
        to them.  The FA are understood to have issued penalties ranging from life               4
        bans to percentage reductions in tickets for certain periods of time.  It is
        believed that the Director General of Fair Trading has reserved his position
        and is awaiting a final report from the FA before deciding what action to
        take under the Fair Trailing Act.

   9.   Both Liverpool and Everson Football Clubs have indicated that it is their
        policy to press the FA for an improved allocation system giving a greater
        number of tickets to the two clubs participating in the Fk Cup Final.             Both
        clubs have reiterated this policy after consideration of Liverpool City Council's
        report. 3oth clubs have indicated that they' would be willing.to forgo the
        bulk .of- their allocation: of tickets .for all!.'Oupu.Finals..in...which they were not
        participants in order that sufficient numbers of tickets would be available
        to the supporters of those teams involved in the Final.

  The 1989 Cup Final
ALO.   Pending the final outcome of the investigation carried out by the special
       sub-committee of their Matches and Grounds Committee, the FA decided to
       allocate tickets for the 1989 Cup Final on the same basis as for 1988.
       However, in the light of the Hillsborough tragedy a decision was subsequently
       taken to offer the bulk of the tickets to Liverpool and Everton Football
       Clubs who each took 35,000 tickets.  The remaining 10,000 - 15,000 tickets
       were distributed by the FA on an ad hoc basis in view of the shortage of time
       available and no set allocation ratio was worked out for the remaining clubs,
       associations and organisations.                                      ■

  11.   Since the 1988 Final considerable alterations have been taking place at
        Wembley Stadium with more and more standing areas b'eing converted into seated
        accommodation.  This reduced the capacity of the stadium at the 1989 Final
        to approximately 85,000.  Had the FA decided to continue with their alloca­
        tion policy of previous years this would have meant a drop from about 25,000
        to just over 22,000 in the number of tickets allocated to each finalist, thus
        further exacerbating the ticket shortage problems and further fuelling the
        activities of the ticket touts.

  12.   In the light of the decision to distribute the bulk of the tickets to the two
        clubs involved, trading standards officers decided to conduct a further
        investigation into the activities of ticket touts to establish if the--improved
        allocation system did indeed reduce ticket touting and its associated-'problems
        as forecast in Liverpool City Council's 1988 Cup Final report. Once again a
        special hot-line was put into operation for people \x> report details of tickets
        bought from touts and a squad of 20 investigators from the Trading Standards
        Department attended Wembley Stadium on Cup Final day to take similar details
        from supporters arriving at the ground.   The 1S89 operation by trading
        standards officers exactly duplicated that of 1988, thus permitting meaningful
        comparisons to be made on ticket touting between the two years.

  The 1989 Evidence
  13.  Trading standards officers were given details, including serial numbers, of
       75 tickets allegedly purchased at prices above face value. That represents
       a reduction of 83% from the comparative figure (450) in 1988. Thus it will be         \
       seen that by an increase of 40% in the numbers of tickets allocated to each of        j
       the finalists an 83% drop in ticket touting was achieved. Appendix A gives            ?
       details of the 75 tickets involved.                                                   t

  14.   The highest price alleged to have been paid for an £8 ticket was £100, the           |
        lowest price was £10, with an average of £56. The highest price for an £18          ■|
        ticket was £200, the lowest £25, with an average of £104. Full details               f
        recorded were as follows:-                                                           I

15.   Of these 75 tickets none carried any stamp to indicate its origin.   Whereas
      both Liverpool and Everton Football clubs were exempted by the FA from stamping
      their names on their ticket allocation due to the numbers of tickets and
      shortage of time involved, it is understood that all other clubs, associations
       or organisations who received tickets had been instructed by the FA to stamp
       them.  It would appear, therefore, that FA rules are still being broken by
       some in this regard.  It will be recalled that last year over 300 examples of
      unstamped tickets were noted.

      Enquiries have revealed that 60 (80%) of the 75 tickets which were alleged to
      have been sold at prices above face value came from the 70,000 allocation
      shared between Everton and Liverpool.  Information from the clubs is that
      none of these tickets were allocated to staff.  Both clubs have cooperated
      fully with trading standards officers in their investigations.  It is
      inevitable under any allocation system that a small number of fans will
      pass on their tickets and it would appear that some touts obtained supplies
      of tickets in this way. It was noted that of the 75 tickets mentioned the
      majority were bought from touts outside Merseyside by fans living outside
      Merseyside.

17.   Once again this year numerous ticket agencies were jable to obtain supplies
      of Cup Final tickets, although the increased allocation to the two finalists
      will have significantly restricted the numbers available to them. Eleven
      ticket agencies were named by supporters as having been the source of their
      tickets.  Nine of the eleven agencies were based in London. Also, in contrast
      to the 1S88 Cup Final, no evidence of forged tickets came to light during the
      investigation in 1989.

18.   Observations by trading standards officers at Wembley Stadium on Cup Final
       day revealed that there were fewer ticket touts operating in the vicinity of
       the ground.    It was apparent that several thousand fans had travelled to the
       Final without tickets hoping to be able to purchase one on the day of the
       game.  The vast majority were to be disappointed and most dispersed as
       kick-off time approached.    There was, however, around kick-off time, a charge
       at a gate bj/-a number of fans which was repelled by the police.

19.   A further problem which was evident at Wembley Stadium this year concerned
       certain tickets having been sold for seats which, due to ground alterations,
       did not exist.  Additionally some tickets were sold for seats which turned
       out to have an obscured view, although the tickets were not marked as such.
       Other tickets were sold with an indication that they did have an obscured
       view and yet afforded little or no view at all.  These circumstances led to
       some people having to stand throughout the game whilst others missed the
       early part of the game whilst queuing to make their complaint. Trading
       standards officers are currently dealing with a range of complaints and
       attempting to secure redress for the.people affected.

20.         a) The 40% increase in the allocation of tickets to the two finalists        yg
                       in 1989 led to an 83% drop in ticket touting;

      b)   there was a significant decrease in ticket-related violence at the
           1989 Final;

                                                                             cont:-

                                              - 5 -

           c)   there appeared to be no forged tickets in circulation at the 1989
                Final;

           d)   FA rules regarding the stamping of tickets to identify the club,
                association or organisation to which they were originally allocated
                continue to be broken by some. Although Everton and Liverpool were
                exempted this year, no stamped tickets appeared in the survey.

     21.   The FA has indicated that the improved allocation of tickets in 1989 is a
           one-off decision.  It is understood that they will not decide on the allocation
           for the 1990 FA Cup Final until next year.  The evidence is clear from this
           report that the extent of ticket touting can be controlled through improved
           allocations to the participating teams.

     22.   It has become commonplace for large numbers of ticketless fans to travel to
           the Cup Final in the hope of being able to purchase a ticket from a tout on
           the day of the game.  This situation is the legacy of previous inadequate

•          ticket allocations over many years and the known situation of large numbers of
           tickets being available to touts due to the allocation system placing large
           numbers of tickets with persons who do not wish to attend the Final.   The
           improved system this year led to   far less tickets being offered outside the
           stadium and a continuation of the 1989 allocation system will lead to a
           reduction in the numbers of fanstravelling without tickets. ■

     23.   Although the segregation of fans   is not a serious problem at an Everton v
           Liverpool Cup Final, a continuation of the improved allocation system would
           lead to smaller numbers of fans being mixed because far less tickets would
           change hands after initial allocation.   Large numbers of touted tickets can
           nullify vital ground segregation arrangements.

     24.   In 1988 an estimated £250,000 was paid by supporters in enhanced ticket prices
           for the Cup Final.  In 1989 the vast majority of genuine supporters of the
           two finalists were able to obtain their tickets at face value thus depriving
           the touts and other greedy people within football of their usual lucrative
           dealings in connection with the FA Cup Final.

     25.   Although the FA were provided with 450 ticket serial numbers for investigation
           in July 1988 they have been slow to respond publicly in announcing the action
           taken against those found to be in breach of their own rules on FA Cup Final
           tickets.   Those who have been punished so far by the FA, and those tempted to
           misuse tickets in the future, would be far more likely to comply with ticket
           rules if they were to be named to the public after being shown to have broken
           the rules.

     26.   The clear indication from the comparisons between the 1988 and 1989 FA Cup
           Finals is that an improved allocation of tickets to the participating teams
           can lead to major improvements in terms of the safety of supporters and in
           terms of the economic interests of supporters.  Only the ticket touts lose
           out under an improved allocation system.  In the past, too many tickets have
           been given to clubs, associations and organisations who would not send
           representatives to the Final, rather tickets would be passed on for profit
           and would usually end up back in the hands of committed supporters but at
           vastly inflated prices.

     Recommendations
     27.  In the light of the evidence gained at FA Cup Finals over the past two years
          the Chief Trading Standards Officer now recommends that:-

           a)   the Football Association be requested to agree to allocate up to
                70,000 tickets to the cup finalists and to take into account average
                home attendances in deciding the ratio of tickets to be allocated;

                                                                             con t:-
                                         - 6 -

     b)   the Football Association be requested to investigate all
          allegations of breaches of their rules identified in this
          report;

     c)   the Football Association be requested to publish the results
           of their own enquiries into the evidence provided by Liverpool
           City Council's 1988 Cup Final report and publish details of
           those who have received punishments for breaches of FA rules;

     d)   the Football Association takes steps to ensure that all Football
          Clubs, Associations, Wembley Stadium, FA Council representatives
          and the Football Association themselves place their stamp on all
          FA Cup Final tickets allocated to them in order that the original
          sources of tickets sold by touts can be readily identified by
          fans;

     e)   the Director General of Fair Trading be requested to consider this
           report in addition to the Chief Trading Standards Officer's 1988
           report, and in line with his duty under section 2 of the Fair Trading
           Act, to take steps to ensure that the Football Association's future
           ticket allocation policy for the Cup Final does not act against the
           economic or safety interests of consumers;

     f)   a copy of this report be also submitted to the Minister of Sport and
          all Liverpool MPs.

     g)   a copy of the 1988 and 1989 reports into the allocation of FA Cup
          Final tickets be submitted to Lord Justice Taylor as evidence for
          Phase II of the Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.

Last/year        I a r r i v e d at    the g r o u n d s om e ti m e       b e tw e e n    1430 hours a n d      1445

F r o m what     1/ can recall         a bout my entry to the g r ou n d                    last year     itydfas

quite       orderly,

Therar was queues           to the      e ntranc e       but all was          passing off quite
                                                                                                         7
smoothly.

I remember          there was a P o l i c e m a n s ta n di n g         by each t u rn st il e a nd there

was a P olice         horse    in a m o n g s t    the   crowd.

I. w en t    th ro ug h the    t u r ns ti le     into the g r o u n d a nd w a l k e d to the              right

into Pen y f a          One.

The araft I was          s t a n di ng was      quite    full    a nd a gradual              b uiId up of

people made          the a r e a very tight.             This a r e a       became         clashed and

I was unable          to see     the    first      ten m i n u t e s   of the /fame until              people

b e ga n to spread out more.

I felt       then that      there a p p e a r e d too m a ny           people       in the g r o u n d at that

section.

1 can think of nothing                 else     that stands          out    from     last y e ar ' s match.

W h e n L iverpoo l      re ac he d this y e a r ’s Semi F inal                 of the F A Cup,

I said yes and           r e q u e s t e d that    he got me a s t a n d i n g             ticket   b ec au se   I

prefer       this    to s itting       down.

    Because      I live        in and know S heff ie ld ,              I d i r e c te d                  around       the

    Hillsborough.              We    parked on a hill.

    We   parked the          car at about           1400 hours.

    a normal       Saturday.

    L i m e r i c k Rd there was a Pub by the                     river.

    The Pub did not seem too full a nd either                                                                suggested

    that we have a drink as we had plenty of time before                                            the m a t c h started,

    I cannot       remember          the    name of the P ub           but    it was an unusual                name.

As we got to the door                       of the Pub a m a n on the                 door a s k e d w h e re we were

                When      I e nt er ed the g ro un d JL saw one y ou ng                     looking P o l i c e m a n s t a n d in g

                by the       left of the             gate 4s     I entered.

                I had my ticket               in     my hand and s howed           it to this         P o li ce ma n.

                He made       no    r e a c ti on to this        so   I put my ticket               back    into my        pocket.

                On my      left     behind the t ur n s t i l e s        e n tr an ce       I saw     a g ro up of a bo ut          si;-;

                to eight P o l i c e m e n           and on the other            side of the          c o n ce r ti n a gate was            a

                s im il ar    number.

                Upon      ent er in g    the g ro un d this w ay you              could see the tunnel                  e n t e r in g

                the te rr ac es and the                light at the top of              it.

                This,      a c c o m p a n i e d w i t h the P o l i c e m e n   either       side of the open gate,

                caused a f u n n el in g            effect and e ve r yo n e was m a ki n g             t ow ards     the tunnel.

                g round.

                Because       of the number             of   people     entering,           I had no       chance     of g e tt in g

                over      towards       it.

                It was       just    like a river of             people.

As     I was    leaving       the       tunnel      I saw a m an f al l in g backwards.

This     man a p p e a r e d to         be facing          the crowd        coming from the tunnel               a nd so

he fell        onto his       back.

I remember           that    the m a n had          light    curly hair w h i c h a p p e a r e d          to be

receding.            He was     in his        twenties.           He had fair         skin.        He a p p e a r e d to

be a big man and he was w ea r i n g a                                              c ol ou re d

shirt w ith some kind                   of    pattern on it.

I remember           that    his m o u t h was        open       and his arms were held up                   at his

sides.         His    eyes were         o pen and he was              not w e a r i n g    glasses.

T he   only other           thing      I can remember             is that      his     hair was       over   his ears

a nd   I think that his                shirt was a long s i o n e                          rolled up as o p p o s e d

to a short s le e v e d o n e .                                   /

Once     I had e nt e r e d P e n Four              the    orowd just         push ed me from b eh in d

f urther       into the       crowd      in a d/agonal             di rection,        t ow ards     the    corner

posts.                                        /

II was     very dif fi cu lt            Va b r ea th be cause it was so pack ed w i t h people

a nd so    I m a n a g e d to get my arms                  from my side a nd              place    them    in front

of my neck           just    b elow my jaw to enab le me to                       lift my head so that              I

could b reath fresh air.

T h er e was a s low          push from behin d me,                   not    like the normal           s urges     that

h a p p e n w he n someone            s cores a goal.

We w er e all         packed t o g e th er a nd so was m o v i n g as a block.

T h in g s at this          stage      now become a bit d i s o r i e n t a t e d a nd so the t hings

I now d es cr ib e may            not    be       in the    correct         order    of events.

I think        that what        happened          first was as            I was     being    push ed d o w n the

t e r r a ci n g steps       I b ecame a war e            that    I was      not s ta n di n g     on the    floor

a nd a p p e a r e d to be s t a n d i n g          on someone.

From    the w ay       I was      ho ld in g my arms             by m y     chin I was able           to   push a wa y

slightly and           look down.

I saw I was           s t a n di ng    on a torso.

                                                                                                             S 1S48

I saw what         looked        like a white         sports        shirt and       blond hair.

It a p p e a r e d as         if the      body was    on its side or face down.                      I believe

that     it was a body of a man.

Everybody around                started      shouting,       "There        s o m e b o d y down h ere."

I m a n a g e d to move a wa y from him.

I could not hear a ny s ound                     coming from the m a n a nd               I did not feel any

m o v e m e n t w he n     I was    s t a n di ng on his       body or arm.

1' was    still       being      pushed down towards                the    pitch.

I had the feeling,                 however,       that   the man          I was    s t an di ng    on was    picked

up by someone a f te r              I'd been pushed forward.

I think        it was         then that      I tried to turn a r o u n d to get out of                      the

g round.

I was     trying         to    look for      the tunnel        but    I only m a n a g e d        to half    turn

a nd so     I didn't           see the     tunnel.

I think        the next         thing     that    h a p p en ed was w h e n two      lads w er e    pushing

back a gainst            us m a k i n g   towards     the tunnel.

T hese    two    lads were m a k i n g a real               determined         effort.

One was        pushing         the other       from behind.

The    lad that was             being     pushed was a bout           s i x t e e n to s e v e n t e e n years.

He was slim and had a n ar ro w thin face.                                He was w e ar i n g a grey

c ol ou r e d t racksuit           top w i t h    red,   w hi te a nd       blue f l a s hi n gs     on the

s houlde r .

This     lad    looked very d istressed,                 his    face was          blue,   he was      s w e a t in g

and his eyes we re glazed.

His    head was          sw ay in g a n d he gave        the    i m p r e s s i o n of being d ru nk

although        I could not            smell     a ny drink as he           p assed a nd      I'm sure       he was

not drunk.

I think        this      lad had slight           curly b r o w n hair         that was       cut    short.

I cannot        remember m u c h a bout            the   lad that was             pushing    him e x ce p t he

a p p e a r e d older         than the     first     lad.      He    had dark hair a nd a dark                 top on.

The    next       thing    I rem em be r was         s o m e b od y s ho u ti n g who was a bo ut            eight

feet a w a y from me to my                  right and        slightly       in front.          T h e y were

shouting,          "Move    back,        t he r e ' s s o m e b o d y dead h er e. "

I looked over but                 could      not see a lot.            All      I could see       was      a small

circle       of people w it h a              very small        gap    in the middle.

The m a t c h      had not        long    s ta r t e d at    this    time a nd        I remember

s houts      coming       from the        front    of   "We're       g et t in g    real ly d e s p e r a t e     now."

I reme mb er         people       being     pulled up a t> th e         back.

T he y were        be i ng pulled up by fans^fnto                    the    seat i ng a r e a .

P e o p l e were      now c limbing          ov er ^ Th e    fence    onto      the    pitch.

I saw two or three                 climb jp*fer and          it a p p e a r e d that     the P o li c e     were

t r yi ng    to put t hem b a ^ T            into the       crowd.

M or e and more           people     got     over the fence a nd w er e h el pi ng                   o th er s    before

the P o l i c e      r ealised w hat was           happening.

A fter a short            time before          the m a t c h was      s t op p e d w i t h the fans          g e tt in g

onto     the      pitch,    there        b ecame a relief w i t h the               pressure      of      people

a r o u n d me.

I was       not being       pushed so hard a n d              I s t ar t e d    to have      room a r o u n d me

a lb ei t   only a foot or so.

I remem ber          looking      back a n d      I saw an e l d e r l y man

p o s s i bl y    in his forties.

He was w ea r i n g an old style                  suit w h i c h was a p lain dark                blue      in

colour.           He was w e a r i n g a light          red shirt          that was o pe n at the                collar.

He had dark hair w h i c h a p p e a r e d              u n g r o o m e d a nd was      quite     thick.          This

m an was         pinned a ga in st        a crash barr ie r          just      b el ow his     rib     cage.

He a p p e a r e d    to be       running      on the       spot and was           shouting,      "God,      G od ."

This man was           purple       in the face a nd           people w er e          stil   b e hi n d him,

p us hing a ga i n s t      him.

The    p ressure       had now been            rel ie v ed and       I had space a r o u n d me.

It w as     now that        I started         to feel       safe.

     I was aware         that, the gate leadjrf(g onto               the pitch was open a nd people

     we re going        t hrough onto       X tyr pitch.

     P e o p l e were    still     c 1 inking     over the fence w i t h the aid of fans a nd the

     Police.

     S ome    fans at the front were               pulling at        the wire m e s h i n g        trying, to

     break      it away.

     I d id not u n d e r s t a n d    this     because w here        I was     there was          no   pressure

     a nd    no pushing.

     I was      now a bout      half w a y down the t e r r ac i ng a nd a p p r o x i m a t e l y            in the

     middle.

     For     the next five m i n u t e s        or so     I was    just    s ta n di n g    on the      t er r ac i ng

     r e c o ve ri ng   f rom what     I had just undergone.

     I couldn't         see what was        hap pe n in g    on the    oj^-tch b ec au se         there was      so

     many     people     on the track a r o u n d the          pj^rch.

     A fter     this    time    1 saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y ten bodies       lying       behi nd      the goal

     mouth.        I couldn't       see a n y b r e ac hi ng      comi ng from these              bodies.

     Just     to the     left of these          b^raies     I saw a male        p e rs on being         revived.

     This man was         being treatjra by a St J ohns A m b u l a n c e                  woman.

     The m a n w o u l d be a g e d ^ b o u t     25 years a nd he was w e ar i n g                some    kind of

     greentop.

     At one      stage    I h eard a cheer          coming f ro m the         right        hand    corner     near to

       I d o n ’t know w he t h e r         it was shock            or what       but        I d o n ’t remember a lot

       a bout w a l k i n g to the town.

       Certainly         I cannot         remember any             incident of note.

       A bout a mile a w a y from the g ro un d                     I saw a g r o up of two y o ut hs a r gu i n g

       a nd   pushing       each other about.

       T here was a girl w i t h them a n d                   I think they w er e a r g u i n g               over       her.

       I c rossed the            road a n d w a l k e d      into the       centre          of S h e f f i e l d a n d    caught

       T here    is two         points     I w i s h to clarify.

       w it h her      shirt      open.       I now       remember        that she also             had a                top on.

       Secondly,        the man        I d e s c r i b e d f al li ng     on his back at the end of the

       tunnel.         I now remember             that     the     p at tern on his shirt was



       The only other             thing     I remember a bout             that        day was       o ut side    of the

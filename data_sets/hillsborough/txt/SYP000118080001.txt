            Following       the       briefing          at     Hillsborough            I was       deployed            along

            My    Serial    was       the       "Reception          Committee"          for    the       Notts .

problems,             although            it w a s      obvious             that a        large       number          of     fans

heading          towards          the       ground         had      been         drinking.

By 3 .00         p m t he        crowds         in H e r r i e s        Road/Penistone                    Road       had

thinned          out a n d        there         was     just       a     few      late        comers        rushing

towards          the     turnstiles               and      th p    odd drifter                 that       you

always         get w h o         turns       up at         every match and                     hangs       around

outside          th e    ground           un t i l     full       time       because           he    hasn't          go t    or

By 3.05          pm     I had        gathered my              Serial             together           a n d we     started

to m a k e       ou r w a y       towards            Claywheels              Lane       for m e a l .           At

this      time        I could hear                on th e         r a di o a       lot' of          transmissions

coming         from      the L e p p i n g s          Lane        end       of    the     ground with                regards

to     t he     crush       of    fans       outside          the        turnstiles             and       I h e a r d th e

we     were      stopped          on P e n i s t o n e        R o a d at          the     junction           of H e r r i e s

Road      by S u p t.         Chapman who               ordered             us    to    enter        the     ground

because          the L i v e r p o o l          fans       were        on    the       playing        area.           I took

my Serial             into       the      ground        from       the P e n i s t o n e            Road     e n d a n d we

entered          the     playing            area       between          the N o r t h S t a n d            and       the

Ko p .

On     entering          the      playing            area     I could            see a         large       number           of

fans      on     the     p i t c h at        the L e p p i n g s            Lane       en d    of    the     ground

a n d at       t hi s    time        I thought             that        there       had        been a       pitch

invasion and                t ha t     we    had      been        s en t     into       the     ground          to    clear

th e     pitch.          I along            with my Serial                   ran a c r o s s         the     pitch          to

offer      assistance                to     the      few    officers             who were            already          ther e .

At     first      I tried            to     talk      to    the        f an s    to     get     them       to m o v e        off

the      pitch        but     I was met              by h o s t i l e        reactions              and    phrases           like

" G et    fucked"           and      "There's           people          getting          killed           in t h e r e "

These      are        phrases          that       you      hear        regularly when                 you       ge t a

                                                                                                                  R 169

large        c r o w d w h o a r e all              pushing         and       shoving          so    I was        not

u nd u ly w o r r i e d a nd was                   still      treating             the    s i t u a t i o n as a

pitch        invasion.              It w a s        not     until        I got          nearer       to     the    fence

at    the L e p p i n g s          Lane       end    that         I realised             that       they were

telling        the       truth and             people        were        being          crushed        to    de a th .

On    seeing        what       was       happening           and        realising          t h at      there       wa s

already        a    large          crowd       of    police         and       fans       trying        to    get

people        out    of       the    terraces,              I tried           to    give w ha t           assistance

I could        to    the       injured             fans     who were              being    passed           out    onto

the    pit c h.          I w-as t r y i n g          to     give        reassurance             to     the w a l k i n g

wounded         but m o s t         of    the       time      I was          being       pushed and             jostled

by    other        fans who          did       not a p p e a r          to    be    injured          but     all      w ho

seemed        intent          on    blaming          t he P o l i c e         for w h a t       was       happening

and a        large       number          of    them appeared                  to h a v e       been       drinking.

It w a s      shortly after                   this       t h at    I saw a number                   of L i v e r p o o l

fans     rush       towards          the S p i o n          K o p as         if    they were           going       to

cause        trouble          with the             Forest         fans.           I assisted           in u s h e r i n g

these        fans    back          towards          the     Leppings              Lane    end and           then

carried        on g i v i n g a s s i s t a n c e            to     the       injured          fans.

A young        fan w h o           I think was              a young           girl a b o u t         1 1 -1 E y e a r s

old wearing              a    l i gh t    coloured            *T'       shirt       and    jeans          was     being

assistance           to       carry       the       fan a cro ss             the    pitch       to     the      corner

ambulance           was      waiting.               I put         the    girl       down and           at    th i s     time

she    already appeared                       to    be    dead.          I left          her    being

tended        to    by o t h e r         people          and went            towards       another           youth

who    was     l y in g       on    the       grass       gasping            for    breath          but w h o      wa s

not    being        tended          to.        The       ambulance            had       left    the       field       by

this    time        so       I along          with another               person who             I don't           know

carried          the y o u t h        off      the    pitch and             into       the G y m n a s i u m .

By     this      time       there       was     bodies        lyi ng        all       over     the      place          i ns i d e

and     outside         the G y m n a s i u m .            I left          the y o u t h w i t h          people

at     the Gymtiasium a n d                   returned        to     the        playing        area.

The     only      body       I handled was                 th e    aforementioned                   t ha t    I know

for     definite.              All      the     rest       I dealt          with were             the w a l k i n g

wounded.

During        the w h o l e          incident         there        was      a    lot     of    help       coming          from

t he    fans      on    the      pitch         but    all     the       time       there       was      that

nucleus          of    troublemakers                 who    seemed          intent          on g o i n g      round

stirring          up    hatred and              blame       towards             the P o l i c e .         I h a d to

break       up m a n y m i n o r          scuffles,           so m e       between          the     fans

themselves             and     some      between Police                    and     fans.

My     feelings         were         t ha t    as    a whole         we w e r e        not     given         enough

information about                     what      was    happening                and    it     seemed a         long

time       before       most         people         realised         t h at      it w a s      not      just       a

pitch       invasion.

A    lot    of    the       f a ns    I had         dealings         with        in the        playing         area

appeared          to: h a v e        been      drinking           heavily.

Once       all    the       bodies       had        been moved and                 the      game     had      been

abandoned             I gathered              my Serial           together            again       a n d we w e n t

back       onto       Herries         Road      to    carry        out      traffic           control         and       to

try and          keep a        path open             along        the      road       for     the    emergency

services.              We    remained           there       until          all     the      traffic          had

gone .

Whilst        carrying          out      Traffic           Control          I ha d       to    break         up a

skirmish          between Liverpool                    fans,         who        all    go t    out      of a M i n i

in t he       opposite          direction.                 The     Liverpool             fans       all      appeared

to     have      been       drinking           heavily.

                         surrounding         streets,      but    this       time   it s e e m e d     as   if all    the

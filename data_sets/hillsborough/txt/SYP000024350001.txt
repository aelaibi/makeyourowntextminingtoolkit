              HILLS30R0UGH DISASTER INSPECTION NOTES (R.M. FORD)



The following notes are a result of inspecting the Leppings Lane end of
the Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April 1989 (the day of the disaster and
16th, 17th and 18th April 1989).

Description

The Leppings bane end of the Stadium also known as the West End comprises
of both terracing and seating areas, the end being dominated by the West
Stand.  The total attendance capacity of the end being 14,565 this being
divided between 4,465 seating and 10,100 standing.

The entrance to the West End for both standing and seating spectators is
through 15 turnstiles which face onto a small reservoir area fronting
Leppings Lane.   This turnstile reservoir area also serves 8 turnstiles to
the North Stand.   On passing through the turnstiles spectators enter into
a large reservoir area to the rear of the West Stand.   This reservoir area
is divided by a brick, wall approximately 3 metres in height with a gate
access provided.   The reservoir area to the North of this wall is served
by 8 turnstiles numbered 9 to 16 which therefore effectively serve the
West Stand gangways UVWX and the standing area of the West Terrace nearest
to the North Stand.   The reservoir area to the South of the dividing wall
is served by 7 turnstiles marked A to G and serve the West Stand gangways
Y to Z and the remaining West Terrace.   This remaining part of the West
Terrace is sub-divided by radial fences so as to produce in effect the
Central Enclosure which is sub-divided into two and entered by a tunnel
running the width of the West Stand.   The remaining terraced area to the
South is entered by an access way to the South of the West Stand.   Each of
these terraced enclosures have specified crowd capacities.   These are:

     West Terrace North    (including North West Terrace)   5,300
     Central Enclosures                                     2,200
     West Terrace South                                     2,600

Full length of the West Terrace is fronted by a permimeter fence with
six access gates to the terracing from a pitch side track.  The areas of
the West Terrace inspected in detail on the above dates were of the
Central Enclsoure and the tunnel which provide the access to that
terracing.

Central Enclosure

The Central Enclosure of the West Terrace has been formed by the
positioning of radial fences which run the width of the terracing from the
front facade of the West Stand down to the pitch perimeter fence.   The
radial fences of the enclosure are 1.7 metres in height.  The enclosure
itself is divided effectively into two by a similar fence which in its
position divides the entrance from the tunnel into two to give an
effective entrance or exit width to each of the Central Pens of 1.8
metres.  For each of the Central Enclosure Pens there is one access gate
through the perimeter fence.  These gates are clearly marked with the
numbers 3 and 4.  For ease of identification the Central Terrace Pens will
be referred to with reference to the Gate Number.

2.1     Central Enclosure 3

2.1.1   General

        The entrance and exit to enclosure is via the tunnel already described
        previously, at the rear by the front facade of the West Stand, laterally by
        radial fences and at the front by a pitch perimeter fence.  The shape of the
        enclosure is almost square with the length being approximately 14 metres and
        the width approximately 13 metres.

        With the use of levelling equipment,    the terrace gradient was calculated to
        have a fall of 1:4.

2.1.2   Terracing

        The terracing  to the enclosure comprises of 33 reinforced concrete steps.
        The width of the terrace steps on average are in the order of 390mm with a
        riser of 90mm.   At the front of the terracing between the first step and the
        perimeter wall there is a trough 450mm wide and approximately 90mm deep.
        The general condition of the terrace steps can be said to be good, however
        on detailed examination 29 minor defects were noted; these in the main
        relating to small missing areas of step nosing.     The majority of these
        failures were   in the location of the 4 concrete joints that run the width of
        the terrace.   At the exit of the tunnel a 9" brick built wall extends by
        1.6m from the front facade of the West Stand.

        With the use of levelling equipment,    the terrace gradient was calculated to
        have a fa 11 of 1:4 .

2.1.3   Fences

        The enclosure is surrounded by 2 radial fences that run the width of the
        terracing and the front perimeter fence.

        Both radial fences are 1.7m in height and are constructed by the use of
        steel vertical rails*, the radial fence to the left of the enclosure when
        viewed from the pitch has one access gate of an overall width of 1.12m which
        abuts to the front facade of the West Stand.   This gate is 1.97m in height.

        The perimeter fence is constructed by the use of a steel framework with
        vertical structural struts being spaced on an average of 2.46m apart in
        which the various sections are infilled by mesh.  The mesh size varies in
        this enclosure with 3 sections being 75 x 150mm and 3 sections being 50 x
        50mm mesh.  The fence is topped by a meshed formwork that is angled in
        towards the terracing.  The inward angle of this formwork being
        approximately 45°.  The overall height of the perimeter fence is in the
        region of 3m measured from the bottom trough of the terracing.  The fence is
        so constructed that the structural steelwork is within the perimeter wall of
        the terracing.  The bottom of the mesh part of the fence is some 900mm from
        the aforementioned trough which therefore means that the bottom of the
        meshed sections of the fence below the height of the perimeter wall.   It was
        noted that on inspection after the disaster that the structural vertical
        struts to the left of the access gate, when viewed from the pitch had been
        outwardly bent by the pressure of the crown.  One meshed section of the
        fence had also been inwardly peeled back towards the terracing; this being
        probably achieved by the Fire Service at the time of disaster.  The
        perimeter fence into this enclosure had one gate of an overall width of
        860mm.  This 50 x 50 meshed gate was fitted with a quick release catch and
        had an access step from the terrace to the pitch level that was 318mm from
        the trough.  A detailed drawing of the section through the perimeter fence
        was undertaken.

2.1.4    Barriers

        This enclosure pen has 5 barriers which are numbered 149, 136, 136a, 124a
        and 125.  The most obvious detail noted about the barriers on inspection was
        that barrier 124a had collapsed with 2 vertical supports being bent by crowd
        pressure.  2 of the horizontal rails also had significant bends in their
        horizontal length.  It should be noted that the centre span rail was not
        within the enclosure on first inspection but found on the pitch and
        repositioned into the enclosure on the evening of the disaster.

        There are two types of barrier found in the enclosure, an old type installed
        at the time of the construction of the West Stand circa. 1966 and the new
        type installed at some subsequent time.   The older type barrier comprises of
        a number of horizontal 60mm rails which span between barrier posts.    The
        posts are constructed of 50 x 50mm angled steel formworlc strengthed by a leg
        angled down the terracing slope.  The overall height   of the older type
        barrier is seen to be noticably lower than the newer type. The new type
        barrier consists of 150 x 100mm box section vertical steel post with a 60mm
        tubular steel crossrail.    These are located with the vertical barrier posts
        on the centre of a terrace step from the positioning gave 3 rows of barrier.
        Gaps between the barriers on the length of the terracing were staggered with
        the following gaps being noted along each barrier line.

        The spacing between the barrier lines down the width of the terracing was as
        fo l l o w s :—

        Barrier Line 2 to Barrier Line 3 (124a & 125) - 3.505m

        Each barrier was measured and the following data obtained:-

        Apart from the obvious structural damage to Barrier 124A, damage was also
        noted to a vertical support to Barrier 136.  Evidence of the location of a
        former barrier was also seen.  The position of this barrier being towards
        the exit of the entrance tunnel; the former post of the barrier being cut at
        terrace step level.
 2 .2      Enclosure 4

 2.2.1    Genera 1
         This enclosure mirrors closely the Central Enclosure 3, previously described
         although dimensions and barrier layout do vary.  The enclosure is again
         bounded at the rear by the front facade of the West Stand, laterally by
         radial fences and at the front by a perimeter fence.   The radial fence to
         the right as viewed from the pitch divides the enclosure from a sterile
         radial gangway, tne width of which being 2 metres.   This gangway has an
         access gate through the perimeter fence onto the pitch side track.   Access
         to this gate is via 4 wooden steps from terracing level. The enclosure is
         again rectangular, the length of which being 14.475m and the width being
         13.17ra. The entrance to the enclosure again is via the tunnel entrance
         beneath the West Stand, the width of this entrance being 1.86m.   Other
         access points into the enclosure include the gate through the front
         perimeter fence and the access gate into the sterile gangway to the right.

2.2.2    Terracing
         The terrace steps, both in design and basic dimensions, are the same as in
         enclosure 3 with again 33 steps to the actual terracing.    From step 1 to the
         perimeter wall at the front of the terracing, a trough type gap is caused;
         the width of the space being 440mm.   At the front left of the terracing,
         there has been an adaptation of the terrace steps to allow a drainage gulley
         placed in the front trough.This adaptation results in a      cutting back of
         the first step by approximately 120mm along a 740mm length of the step. Due
         to the withdrawal from the stadium following instructions from Lord Justice
         Taylor, a detailed examination of the terrace defects was not undertaken,
         but I was not aware of any significant faults in the terracing.    The
         gradients of the terracing was again calculated to be 1:4.

2.2.3    Fences
         The radial fences into the enclosures of same design and height as those
         noted in enclosure 3 with of course the radial fence to the left forming a
         common dividing fence with enclosure 3.   The perimeter fence is a
         continuance of the perimeter fence described in enclosure 3 with the
         differences between the vertical structural supports of the fence being in
         the main spaced 2.4,6m apart.  Again there is I access gate through the
         perimeter fence from the terracing, the overall width of this gateway being
         780mm.  Access through this gate is gained by a step from the terracing
         which has a riser of 190mm.   From the step there remains a further rise of
         340mm to the perimeter track around the pitch.   The mesh to the fence is of
         a similar type to that previously described, with the mesh grid being in the
         main 50 x 50mm spacing.   Three sections of the mesh had been peeled back
         in towards the terracing at the time of the disaster.

2.2.4    Barriers

         There are 9 barriers within this enclosure.   These are numbered 126, 127,
         128, 132, 137, 138, 144, & 150.   The remaining barrier not previously
         numbered is part of barrier 125 whose span has been divided by the erection
         of the central radial fence.   For ease of identification this barrier is
         enumerated 125A.  Due to the greater number of barriers within this
         enclosure than encountered in enclosure 3, the spacing of the barriers are
         more complex.  Barriers 128 and 137 are each noted as having a significant
         bend in one of the barrier rail spans.   Due to the complexity of the spacing
         of the barriers it is not possible to tabulate spacings as previously
         undertaken in enclosure 3.   Each of the barriers are therefore identified
         below with various spacing dimensions.   Unless otherwise stated the barriers
         are also described by means of its design as described in enclosure 3. All
         barriers were located in the centre of the terrace, except for barrier 144
         which abutted to the nosing of the terrace step.
                                     -   5   -




Barrier 1 5 0 . This barrier is located 2.57m from the rear of the terracing
(front facade of West Stand)    The barrier itself has an overall length of
5.98m and is welded to the right hand radial fence as viewed from the pitch.
It is of a new design type.

Barrier 144 is placed 3.52m from the rear of the terracing and is placed so
as to allow a gap between the barrier and the central radial fence of
2 . 225tu . This barrier is of fairly recent construction but of the old          design
type.

Barrier 138    This barrier is placed 3.47m forward of Barrier      150 and       is
welded to the right hand radial fence.   The barrier length is      3.63m. Itis
of an old design.

Barrier 137 is located on the same terrace step as Barrier 138,    some 6.1m
from the rear of the terracing.  The barrier is 4.55m in length    and is so
placed to leave 4.505m gap between the central radial fence and    1.7lm gap
between itself and barrier 138.  This barrier is also of an old    design.

Barrier 132 is placed forward and to the left of Barrier 137 and leaves a
gap of 1.5m between the 2 barriers.  The barrier itself is 4.48m in length
with a gap of 215mm left between the barrier and the central radial fence.
This barrier is of a new design.

Barrier 128 is situated 3.465m forward of Barriers 137 and 138; the overall
length of this barrier is 6.87m and is so placed to leave a gap of 210mm
from the right hand radial fence.  This barrier is'of an old design.

Barrier 127 is located on the same terrace step as Barrier 128 and between
the barrier and Barrier 128 a gap of approximately 1.5m is found.   The
3arrier is placed some 2tn forward of 3arrier 132 and has an overall legnth
of 2._6m.  This barrier is of an old design but has the barrier rail
replaced with a 70mm pole, this pole extending by 80mm from the lefthand
vertical leg.

Barrier 125A is again on the same terrace step as Barriers
127 ana 128.   As this barrier is part of 3arrier 125 the barrier rail
actually passes through the central radial fence.   The location of this part
of 3arrier 125 is 1.99m forward of 3arrier 132 due to the projection of the
barrier rail from the vertical post, the effective overall width of the gap
between this barrier and 3arrier 127 is 1.9m.   The length of the barrier is
1.825m.  It isof the old design type.

Barrier 126 is placed forward of the gap between 3arriers 125 and 127 by
some 1.55m.    The barrier length is 2.26m and a gap between the barrier and
the central   radial fence measuring 1.58m.  The barrier is of a new design
type with a   7omm barrier rail.  This barrier is in    direct linewith the
front access gate in the   perimeter fence.  Further dimensions regarding
these barriers in this enclosure are as follows:-

 2.2.5       Barrier Load Testing

             During my inspection at the Ground on the 16th April 1989 Barriers 137 and
             128 were load tested by the Engineering Consultants of Sheffield Wednesday
             F.C.  in the attendance of experts from the Sheffield Health & Safety
             Executive.

             Barrier 1 3 7 . This barrier was tested beyond the guidance load of 400 lbs
             per linear foot and yielded at 500 lb per linear foot.    A 1.4 tonnes there
             was a 13mm deflection of the barrier; the barrier failing at a maximum of
             1.6 tonnes.

             Barrier 128     At the test load of 400 lbs per linear foot the barrier gave a
             4mm permanent set.    When the barrier was loaded to 1.4 tonnes a deflection
             of 15mm was noted.    The barrier recovered after release of the load.  When
             the barrier was further tested at 1.75 tonnes (25% over test load) a 27mm
       /,    deflection was noted.    At the test load 2.1 tonnes (50% over test load) a
             .V^fmm deflection was observed. To complete the measurements of both
             enclosures 3 and 4 the front facade wall of the West Stand which forms the
             rear of the terracing was assessed in relation to the vertical height from
             the terrace level at the tunnel exit to the top of the parapet wall which
             front the stand.    This was measured at 3.73m.

3.0         Access Tunnel

             As previously stated the entrance and main exit to both the central
             enclosures is via a tunnel which runs the width of. the West Stand. With
             reference to this tunnel, for means of identification, the opening to the
             terraced area will be known as the exit with the opening to the spectator
             reservoir opening area to the rear of the West Stand being identified as the
             e nt r a n c e .

3 .1        Description

            The length of the tunnel is 20.56m and has a apparent constant width on or
            around 3.62m; the headroom of the tunnel varies along its length with key
            dimensions being eirtrance gate 2.4m, tunnel height inside entrance 3.74m, at
            a distance of 4.7m into the tunnel the roof has sloped down to an RSJ which
            gives an effective headroom of 2.85m.   From this RSJ the roof is flat and
            therefore for a distance of 9.4m the height of the tunnel is 2.2m.   From
            this horizontal roof at a distance of about 6.5m from the exit the headroom
            increases, the roof at this point being the West Stand structural concrete
            steps.(9 No.)  The tunnel exits onto the terracing through a gateway 2.1m in
            height.  The exit gateway as previously described is divided into two by the
            central radial fence of the terracing so that the effective entrance to both
            enclosures 3 and 4 is 1.76m.   On either side of the tunnel exit there is a
            9" brick built wall which protudes 1.6m from the front facade of the West
            Stand.  Both at the entrance and exit to the tunnel there are wooden gates
            which are so hung so as to open into the tunnel.   It was noted that the
            gates to the exit were in fact padlocked in an open position on the day of
            the disaster.

3.2         Lighting

            Due to the tunnel's length, headroom and gradient the natural lighting can
            be described as poor; the natural lighting at the time of an event would be
            worsened as when any spectator stood in front of the exit gate there would
            be a signficant reduction in the light entering the tunnel.
       Artifical Lights are positioned within the tunnel; all of which are
       centrally located in respect of the width of the tunnel.  Due to the
       restriction in the inspection of the ground by Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry
       an assessment of the artificial lighting in respect to the tunnel was not
       undertaken.  It is not known whether the artificial light was actually
       switched on during daytime event.

3.3   Gradient

      The tunnel has an obvious downward gradient towards the terracing and in
      order to assess this levelling equipment was used and the gradients
      calculated,  uollowing calculation of these gradients the following was
      ascertained.  On entering the tunnel there is an upward gradient of 1:23 for
      3.56a; the gradient then levels out for a distance of approximately 2.25m
      and thereafter there is a downward gradient towards the terracing.  This
      downward gradient is sub-divided between a fall of 1:15 for 6.4m and then
      steepens to a fall of 1:6 for a distance of 6.35m.  The tunnel actually
      levels out approximately 2m from the exit gates and the exit onto the
      terracing is therefore level.

3.4   General

      A detailed inspection of the floor of the tunnel was not undertaken although
      no obvious trip hazards were apparent within the actual tunnel length.   It
      was also seen that at the entrance of the tunnel in the centre where the
      drop bolt to the entrance gate would seat, there is a raised concrete mound
      which has an overall height of around 40mm; the entrance gates to the tunnel
      were seen to be in poor repair and it is not known whether at the time of
      the disaster these gates were padlocked open as were the exit gates.

4.0   Reservoir Area to Rear of the West Stand

      No major inspection of this area was undertaken.   It was noted however that
      there were a number of moveable crowd control barriers within the area, but
      not so positioned to be effective as crowd control devices.    As described
      above, the reservoir area is divided by a brick built wall of an approximate
      height of 3m.  Within this wall there is a railed gate to allow access to
      both sides of the reservoir area.  This gate is normally locked on a match
      day so as to enable the segregation of supporters.    However on the day of
      the disaster this gate could not have been closed as a Portocabin had been
      placed in a position that the left hand gate, as viewed from the tunnel
      entrance, would not have been able to close.   The Portacabin was marked with
      the name of the hire company MHS and      had obviously      been used on the day of
      the disaster to sell programmes.

      Direction Signs at the Rear of the West Stand to identify standing areas to
      spectators entering the ground were noted to be only in two positions.  A
      large sign over the tunnel entrance to the central enclosure stating
      'standing' and a substantially smaller sign, again with the word 'standing'
      pointing to the south of the West Stand. There was no sign for 'standing'
      identification to the north terracing or to the north west terracing.  The
      only directional sign being noted referring to refreshments.

      There are two exit gates which serve the reservoir area, each gate serves
      one side of the dividing wall.  One gate is positioned directly across the
      reservoir area from the tunnel entrance.
Turnstile Area - no detailed inspection was taken of the turnstile area or
the boundary walls to the stadium.

                        TEXT PROCESSING SERVICES (TPS)



Thank you for your note of 10 February expressing thanks for the work undertaken by TPS
for the Hillsborough Scrutiny. It was kind of you to take the trouble to write - so many of
our customers take the services they receive for granted, and only contact us when they have
something to complain about.

I know that your note will be much appreciated by the staff.




                                      Trevor Cobley

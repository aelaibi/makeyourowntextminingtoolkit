                I am the L i c e n s e e ’s wife at               the

                                                   Sheffield,             and we have w or k e d at the              pub m a n a g e d

                by W h i t b r e a d for        15 years.

                On S a t u r d a y     15th A p r i l 1989        (150489),           I was working         behind the         bar;

                the       pub opened at          11.00 am    (1100 hrs).                 At this     time a group of

                Liv er po ol         s upporters    (10)    came to the               pub,    dressed      in team      colours.

                T he y were f ol lo we d by about             the same amount                  of   Forest     fans at       five

                past      eleven       (1105 hrs).         We then had a steady stream of football

                s u p po rt e r s and at        12 o ’clock        (1200 hrs)            they were all         in.      I w o ul d say

                there was about 80 Liverpool                       s upporters and 20 Forest                   fans,       in both

                the       lounge and games area,             w h ic h           is an adj oi ni ng     room.      Most     fans were

                d r e s se d   in team colours and all were mixing wit h each other and

                talking about            the    game.      I was          quite      busy,    making them        bar food,        pork

             sandwiches,           and the a tm os p h e r e was fantastic,             very friendly,       and we

             had      no problems w ith them w h at so ev er                inside    the    premises.     The

             m a j o r i t y were    dr i nk i ng    lager,   but     in mode ra t ion;       in respect     of the

             L iv e rp o ol    fans they were          in the older          bracket,       21 years and upwards;

             the Forest         supp or te rs were younger.                 The   lager they were d ri nking was

             in half        pints.      I think       this was       because      they knew they w o ul d        be here

             for some time.

             A   lot of the Liverpool                supporters       have    been to our        pub on other

             football         occasions.       The m a j o r i t y of L iverpool            supporters   left the

             premises         between a quarter           to two      (1345 hrs)       and twenty     past    two

             (14-20 hrs)        in cars and a Mini.                 No drinks were          purchased as off sales.

             The F orest        s upporters         d i d n ’t leave until        ten to three      (1450 h r s ); they

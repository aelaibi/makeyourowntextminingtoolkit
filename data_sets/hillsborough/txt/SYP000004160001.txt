previous          year's        experience,              it w a s       agreed        tha t    the       event       would       be

staged        in the         same     way.         Approaches             were       made     for       the     Clubs      involved

to    be    given       alternative               ends     of    the      ground       to     the       1988       semi-final.

In    relation          to     this,     approaches              to     the H o p      and     the S o u t h         Stand       are

from       the    So u t h ,    the     area       where        the     vast     majority           of N o t t i n g h a m s h i r e

supporters             would        travel,        and     the W e s t         Stand    and        Terrace,          and North

Stand,        are      approached            from     the       Nor t h ,      the    area     from w h ic h             the    v as t

majority          of L i v e r p o o l       supporters            would        travel.            These        areas      were

therefore           allocated           on    this       basis        and      any alteration                 would       have

resulted          in o p p o s i n g     f a ns     crossing            each     othe r,       therefore,                increasing

the       likelyhood           of    disorder         and,       in a d d i t i o n ,       excessive              disruption            to

the       residents          of S h e f f i e l d ,      causing          traffic       problems              before       and after

the       even t.

This       decision          was     in a c c o r d      with      the      recommendations                   of    the

P o p p i e w e 11 R e p o r t ,      regarding            the     need        for    opposing           fans       to    have       a

clear       differentiation                  of    spacial         separation           and        physical          containment

of    opposing          gro u p s .

This       d e c i s i o n was       accepted         by    the       FA,      the    Clubs        and     other         interested

previous        y e a r ’s P o l i c e       Planning            Team       and,     so    as    to    ensure          continuity,

a meeting          was     arranged          on 2 2 M a r c h          1 9 89    (220389),            similar          to    last

traffic        arrangements.

The     planning         then     continued             through          division          by C h i e f         Superintendent

regarding          developments.                  During         the     planning          period          I was       informed            by

aid     in r e s p e c t    of    horses          and    dogs.           It was       therefore             decided          to

utilise        mounted       officers             from Nottinghamshire                      and       Merseyside             as    they

The     determination                of m a n p o w e r       levels       in    connection                with any

ensure       flexibility                in the        deployment           of    resources.                 In th is         respect

Some     t ime       after       t h is      I went         to       the    pitch           and       spoke        to C h i e f

At    t ha t    time       there       was       a    lot       of    shouting              at    the        Leppings          Ln     e nd

all    the      casualities                were       taken away                from        the       ground.           We     then made              a

request         via    the       Police          Control             Room       for     this          to     be    done.

I then         returned          to    the       Police          Control             Room.            Detective           Chief

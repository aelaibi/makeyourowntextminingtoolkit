             five.       (1435)       On the w ay to the ground                    I remember         seeing    people

             e v e r y b od y a p p e ar e d to be    in high spirits.                   I cannot      recall     seeing any

             form of disorder             or fighting.           Upon arrival             at   the t urnstiles        1 could

             see a large          number/of       people a tt em p ti n g          to en t e/^the        ground.      The

             sweating a lot.              I got    the   impression          it was         o bviously very        packed

             inside     the    crowd.       T here were          no queues         as    such,     it was     just a mass           of

            coming     to    rest agai ns t       this       barrier       I became      conscious       of being

            crushed.         My

            of movement,              all,    wit h    pressure       from all       sides.        Ver y shor tl y after-

            coming     to    rest agai ns t       the barrier,             I some ho w m an a ge d to turn myself

            a r o u n d w ith my behind agai ns t              the    barrier and facing              the    back      of the

            terraces.         The     pressure was           becoming worse all             the time and           I could

            see    people      being       pulled up from the              terraces      into the seating area

           above.         My thighs were          becoming        very      painful      as they were         being

            crushed agai n st          the    barrier,        though       I did not have          d if fi c ul t y    in

           breathing.           I was       s creami ng      out to the       people       in the seats         to help us,

            do a n y t h i n g at all.          I became aware             of a young       boy who was         pressed up

           agai ns t me.         He was       scr ea mi ng     out    for help.          I c o u l d n ’t do a ny th in g

            for him as         I couldn't move.              By this        time   some     people wec-e being

            passed down towards               tJrte front      of the       pen over       peop'      s heads.          These

           were     o b vi ou sl y    fhj/fred people.           At about          twelve minutes           past      three

            (1512)     I felt        the    pressure      ease   off       slightly.        I remember        the      time as

            I had a glance a r ou n d at               the    pitch and       remember       looking at a clock.

           As     soon as the         pressure        eased off,       all    I w a nt e d to do was          get      towards

            the    back     of the     terraces,        to try and          create more        room for       injured

            people.         I m an a ge d    to make my way towards                the     back    of the     terraces,

            towards       the tunnel.           I did not see any             injured       people as such.                 I got

           to the tunnel             entrance and         remember         seeing a large man s ta ndi ng                   there.

           you mate.          The man was a bit abusive                     towards me.           The man was

         I did witness a bottle being                     thrown at a w i nd o w          in the     rear of the

         while    I was     in the y ar d           at the rear of the stand,                   having      got out    from

         the    terraces.        The    time w ou ld have            been about          three     thirty.         <1530)

         However,       I would think           this was       probably an act             of emotion,         not

              injured were              off     the    pitch and all           that was      left was a

              large      number         of    fans walking a r o u n d on the              pitch,      looking

              for friends           and       relatives        lost       in the   crowd.       Attempts         were

              made     to get all             the Liverpool           fans     back towards        the West

              S t a n d , h o w e v e r , most         of these ware          both a n n o y e d and

              d i s t r e s s e d at what          had happened.



              A cordon was              formed across           the       centre   of the      pitch as         it

              was    b e l ieved        that Liverpool              fans w o u l d try to get ac r o s s             to

              N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t     s u pporters        at    the S o u t h Stand,      who were

              singing and           shouting w hich a lot of Liverpool                          fans    saw as a

              direct      challenge.               I remained as            part of the        cordon across

              the    centre        of    the     pitch while          eventually        both sets       of fans

              had been        removed from the                 ground,       after w h i c h    I returned

              with PS MI L L E R and the                    remainder       of Serial      48 to the

              In a d d i t i o n    to       the a b o v e , I can         remember     the first

              ambulance,           (St Johns)           arriving          on the   pitch a p p r o x i m a t e l y

              ten to f i f t e e n minutes                  after    I got     into the ground.             I

              was    only aware              of the first S / Y o r k s h i r e a m b u l a n c e      crews and

              Fire Brig a d e           after about           half an hour after            first      going

              onto the        pitch and            cannot      say    if there were any at              the

              scene     earlier          than      this.       It was       only when most         of the

              fans    had been           removed from           the West S t a n d that           I saw     large

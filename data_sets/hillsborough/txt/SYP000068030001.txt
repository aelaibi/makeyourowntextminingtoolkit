At    1130 amyl       began m ou n t e d    patrol    duties at the groj^rfS and was
                                                                  l°UO
i nst r u c^/€ d to work      in a pa i r with PCI 226 ELL ISy e t f N o t t i n g h a m M o u n t e d

D e p t under         the dir e c t i o n of PS399 SORSBJfri^         Together with PC E L l I S           I

toured the area of the ground so as 1^5 f a m i l iarise                        him with all        of the

turnstiles,        entrances      and exits ~dx the ground.                  I ensured that he was

aware    of the fact         that all       the side    roads    between Pe n i s t o n e Rd and

L e p pings Ln were        closed with barriers and              residents      only were a l l o w e d

into    these     streets and that           the P e n istone Rd turnstiles were              for

N ot ti n g h a m Suppo r t e r s and Leppings Ln turnstiles were for Liverpool

s u p porters.

After    touring the         ground we took up position o e n i s t o n e                  Rd and as

the    numbers     of supporters           began to grow we j / o r k e d     outside      turnstiles

43 to 43 along with other m ou n t e d officers who were spread along

P en is t o n e Rd.     Other m ou nt ed officers          from the serial were working                   on

the    central     reservation and the opposite                 footpath of Pe n i s t o n e Rd

e ncouraging any supporters who were                    gathering      in groups      to    cross    the

road and enter          the ground.          There was a good         presence      of foot    patrol

officers        outside each tur nstile            in Pen i s t o n e Rd.     The   crowds    g a t hered

in numbers and as each bus                  load a p p ro ac he d they were d i r ected        to the

turnstiles        and   into the ground.             There were     qu^f      a number of

L i v erpoo l    supporters who were a ttempting Jtm                buy tickets and were

offering any amount            of money        to Nott in^aiTi supporters.            These

Li v erpool      fans were m oved          immediately and d i r ected away from the

ground.         There were      very many       people a pp ro a c h i n g   the ground who         had

been drinking alcohol             and the numbers who were arriving with                      cans of

lager and beer were more               than     I have ever seen before.

                                                                                                                  S 1229

 I remember                 hearing a request, on personal                    radio    for a ssistance        to       close

a Public House and PS SOR S B Y offered m o u n t e d a s s i s t a n c e                           but     this was

 turned down.

There was only one special                            train carrying Liverpool                supporters          to

Wads 1ey Bridge R a i 1way S t a t i o n and                           I heard     confirmation        byradio

 that           it had          arrived.        Very shortly after             I    heard    Inspector H A N D - D A V I S

 request              two more horses            to attend at Wads 1ey Bridge S t a t i o n and PC2 3 1 6

S CO T T and P W156 MAIN,                      who were     the       closest m o u n t e d officers were

directed               to attend.

The            crowd where          I was working          continued        to grow and       it seemed as

though            everyone was            carrying       cans^ 0 + alcohol.

 I remember                 hearing a radio                uest       for               Ln to be closed and

then            I heard n           o     t     h    i     n      g     ^      time.     I looked at my watch

at about 2. 3 5 p m S A h 35)                  and    I was a little           s u r p r i s e d because    the    crowds
                                V
outside               the       ground were still              very big and        previous      experience

of F .A.              Cup       semi    finals,      the   crowd have        usually started to thin

outside               the ground by that              time,

 I heard a request                      on the      Mfciio for more         horses                         Ln and a

further               four were         d^^cted       there am^JJ%<?Tf a further              request was mad?

and together with PS SOR S B Y ^ j ^ g a l 1 oped via the official                                  car     park to
                                        -------v
the L e p pings Ln end of J^He g r o u n d .

As we went a l o ngside                       the wall     of the S o u t h Enc l o s u r e     I could see

 people           e    n    t   e   the groun d through the                 large metal     door at the West

S ta n d         exjj^f         This    is gal^'MT; * .        I went       to this gate and        biocja^rifhe

entrance with my h $ y fs e and                       began to move           people back from the gate.
~ "r   '   '        ....
They were               very hostile            towards me and were a t t e m p t i n g          to get      past and

 into the ground J^ut together wit h PS SO R S B Y                                 I m oved the     crowd back and

 the gate w a s ^ r 1osed.                     Before    the gate was          closed    I could see         inside

 the turnstile area.                          There was a massive             crowd of      people who all

 a p p e a r e d to be pushing forwards                        into the terracing.              I heard the
                                                                                               PAGE         4
                                                                                               S 1229

folding metal      doors     close behind me and             I enco u r a g e d the   people      to

form an orderly queue.              Some with tickets           did so and entered the

g round via the turnstiles,               but a great many once they realised they

could   not get    in, wa l k e d away        into L e p p i n g s Ln,   shouting     obscene abuse

as   they went.     They obv i o u s l y had no tickets               or they w ould have joined

the queue.

As   people were     entering       the ground they were              standing     on empty alcohol

cans which were          littered    everywhere.          I then saw e x i t gat^y *B 5 , which

had been    closed whilst          I' was there,        open and fans aig^fri entered ths

g round.    I saw no am*          come o u t »

N e a r l y everyone/1     saw    left    in Leppings Ln w**s in possession of                 cans

of beer    or ysqer.

At appr o/imate ly 3. 10 pm         < 1510)      I werr€ w ith P S 3 9 9 , PC 's 3 5 7 , 2.472,    1498,

2613 y^md 2316 to the main Police Access                     entrance,      to the ground on

P en is t o n e Rd and    into the       ground to stand by at the            entrance     to the

playing area because             it seemed that a pitch            invasion was       likely.          On

my arrival     I could see down the side                 of the North S tand to the goal

a rea at the Spion Kop end of the ground.                       The    goal area was     empty and

I didn't    think the game          had started.

We were joined by Ins p. H AN D- DA VI S and then                  I heard a radio mess a g e

requesting     that a tem p o r a r y m o r t u a r y be set up in the gymnasium.                      I

saw many    injured and a pp ar e n t l y dead           people    being    brought    from the

playing area and we were m oved to the                    rear of the g y mnasium and still

on standby.       When the game was offic i a l l y a b a n d o n e d         I patrolled

P e ni st on e Rd and Herries Rd areas and then                   round the ground until

stood down.

I returned to N ia g a r a and finished duty at 8 pm                     (2000).

           Duties for Saturday 15th April             1989 (150489)



           My a s s i g n e d duty that day was t o ,direcJt traffic on point duty a t

           Rut l a n d ^ o a d   junction with Neepsent/Lane,             Sheffield 3, before the Semi

           Final and after          its conclusion,



           Sometime after 3.00 pm that day I was told along with other officers

            to go to Hillsborough Stadium as the re was a major                      problem.        I was

            taken from the Force Driving School                by a Police mobile,          to

           Hillsborough,          at that stage   it was assumed there was fighting or

            crowd invasion.



           When I arrived,          I ran onto the pitch, at the Hop end and I saw
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     S2728

hundreds of people on the pitch behind and in front of the L e p p i n g s

Lane goal area.



Only when I had reached all these          people did I suddenly become aware

of dead and dying    people all around me.



The Liverpool youths    I came across were angry about the conditions of

overcrowding   in the terraces,      crossed with grief.             I helped to try and

calm some of these    people down and offer words of comfort to those                       in

shock, and distress.
                                                 s'

At some stage I assisted      in getting injured supporters onto hoardings

for transportation towards jany available medical                 facilities.



During these times,    I became aware of Liverpool              youths getting angry

and aggitated at the Nottingham Forest supporters who w?re on the Kop

and shouting and mocking      ridiculing the d i s t r e s s e d ^ ! v e r p o o l

supporters.Also   I saw a banner being displayed/with words                    "Shankly 81"

referring to Bill Shankly deceased ex Liverpool Manager,                      who was and

still   is highly regarded.                           /

The Liverpool male supporters were verbally being aggressive using

obscenities and directing verbal a/use towards the Forest supporters,

it was obvious to me,    th e r e A c o u L q be rioting within the ground in the

midst of all the carnage      pri^jmt.



I spoke to several    groups of angry males,              and asked them to forgive

the Forrest supporters as they probably would not appreciate that a

disaster had occurred and maybe Forrest supporters thought                       it was a

pitch invasion.

This seemed to have a calming effect on some of these Liverpool males,

            but some were also   incensed and crying because of the     reference to

            Bill Shankly on the banner being displayed.



            At some stage,   I was   instructed to form a cordon, across the centre of

            the field as it was feared the Liverpool     supporters   in general would

            try and take revenge on the Forrest fans.



            After a short time   I continued to assist the   injured to reach medical

            facilities at the rear of the Kop,     in the now formed medical area ie

            the gym area.



            During the whole of that days duties?     I was not   in possession of a

            personal   radio, as my original   point of duties did not necessitate one

            to be issued.

           Further to my previous statement             (recollections)   undated.

           On the afternoon of 13th April          1989 (150489),    I dealt with several

            persons who were      injured or died as a result of the Hillsborough

           Disaster.

            I cannot recall     in any detail     descriptions of persons that             1 dealt,

           with, with the exception of one man who was very well                   built,



            I have examined a mortuary photograph of Colin Andrew SEFTQly (61) an*:

            1 recognise this as being a photograph of the man I rei&r to above

            (Ref.      )(Exh.       ).

            I have examined a photograph of the clothing worn by SEFTON on 15th

           Apri I 1989 (150489)      (Ref. N A 6 1 ) (Exh.      ) and I recognise this,

            particularly the grey track suit.
                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                       S2728A

I have also examined the following                          photographic        prints;

1)      <R e f . D E I / 1 1 ) <E x h .       )

Which shows myself at the rear of an advertising hoarding which is

being     carried by a group of football                       supporters.         The stretcher bears

the body of a person whose face is covered by a jacket.

2)    (Ref. PR6/A/3A)            (Exh.            )

Which shows a distant shot of the same group of supporters                                     carrying

an advertising hoarding.                   I believe         Iam    atthe rear        of   the hoarding

and     can be seen wearing my helmet and                       ayellow tabbard vest.

3)      (Ref. R J S 1 / 9 ) (Exh.             )

This shows a man lying on an advertising hoarding on the p i t ch .                                     A

group of supporters are bent over the body.                               The      picture clearly show

the body wearing grey track suit bottoms with a distinctive green and

red patch on the leg.                 I believe           I can be seen to the right of the

picture bending over the body.

4)    (Ref. SMIR/1/48)            (Exh.               )

This shows the same body as in previously mentioned photographs,                                        you

can see the same distinctive                  patch on the track suit                  leg.    The body i

on an advertising            hoarding,, attended by football                    supporters,      the same

supporters as pictured in the other                          photographs.          A policeman is

pictured with his back to the camera, wearing a flat hat,                                     this is not

me and I do not know the officers identity.

I am happy that the body shown on all of the previously m e n t io n e d

(four)     photographs is the same                    person, Colin Andrew SEFTQN             (61).

I have viewed Video Tape                  (Ref.       MAP/7)     (Exh. No.           ) and at Tape

Reference       15.30,40,07 to 15.30.41.14                     (Data B a s e ) .     I can be seen on

the bottom left of the screen, along with the same group of supporter

shown in the still             photographs            carrying the body of            SEFTQN. The        shot

is too distant to identify the                        body being      carried,       but   I can say     that

although I assisted to remove several                           bodies this group of fans did
                                                                                                         PAGE

         not assist me with any bodies other than the Jane I have identified a<

         SEFTON.

         I have indicated,           on a sketch plan of tj/ife p i t c h , the approximate

         location at which I first             came upo5»a_-SEFTON and assisted to place him

         on the hoarding,

         (I cannot recall whether or not I took the body to the Gym or left th

         fans prior to reaching the Gym„)

         I have indicated,           by means of a i/ue d o t , the position and have signs

          the plan.     (REf.     XES /1) (Exh, /          )

         I have viewed Video Footage/taken in the Gym                      (Ref. VRti/Z)         (Exh.        )

          At Tape Reference Q211             i/ea'l Time).     I can identify,         by clothing,          th

         body of Colin Andrew SEFTQN             (61)    lying on the floor to the bottom lef

         of the screen?        the        underpants are visible above the top of his

         jeans.

         I am unable to assist           in the identification of any other deceased

         persons that         I had dealings with at the Disaster.

                                                                                I E Shipley SIGNED

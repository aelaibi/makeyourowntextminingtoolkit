Dear Doctor Popper

Many thanks for your letter of 24 January 1990 which concerns Hillsborough
1989.

I enclose a copy of a letter sent by the Director of Public Prosecutions
which includes the latest forecast as to when a decision is likely to be
made in respect of the crime issues arising from my investigation.  The
Director of Public Prosecutions office has cleared the release of the
letter.

Let me say at once that in so far as I am concerned, there has never been
any misunderstanding of my role. However, I am grateful to you for
reminding me of its history.  I quite understand that the Coroner’s Officer
is a matter for you to resolve and I note that you have written to the
Chief Constable of Cheshire about the matter. My concern was in respect of
the Coronal Inquiry team, because now that my investigation nears its
conclusion I shall be withdrawing shortly from West Midlands back to my own
force in Cumbria.  The West Midlands investigating team are now being
posted to other duties so I sent my letter of 17 July to you so that the
process of getting the Coronal Inquiry Team together, could commence.

However, I note that you have copied your letter to the Chief Constable of
West Midlands Police so I am content to return to Cumbria and await
developments. Please disregard my letter of 17 July 1990.

Yours sincerely




CHIEF CONSTABLE

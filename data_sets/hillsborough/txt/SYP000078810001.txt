                 Further to my statement dated 2nd June                 1989   (020689)     in which I refer

                 to removing       injured and deceased persons from Leppings Lane end to the

                 gymnas i urn.



                 I arrived on the Hillsborough ground pitch at about 3.15 pm (1513) on

                 15th April       <130489),   prior to this       I had been engaged on duties at the

                 rear of the North stand,



                 After   initially forming a cordon with o t h e r of f i c:e rs, at t h e North e n d

                 of the pitch I made my way to the Leppings Lane end of the pitch,                               At

                 this stage there were numerous            police officers and fans on the pitch.

                 There were several        injured and deceased fans            lying on the pitch and I

                 assisted to remove about five people from the pitch to the tunnel area
                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                 S2307A

                    outside the gymnasium,


                            o a =t   ^rtw^en~i<siN/Gr     w-o / v £ d ina =t^>
                    Advertising hoardings were used to transport the bodies and I was

                    assisted mainly by fans although I recall PC NEILD,            from Hammerton

                    Road Police Station assisting with one of the bodies.             Of the five

                    people    I assisted to remove I would say three were definitely deceased

                    h o w e v e r , I am unable to give any descriptions of any of these persons

                    except that they were all male adults and were            clean shaven.     Nothing

                    about their dress sticks out in my memory.



                    In each case the injured/deceased was left in the tunnel area outside

                    the gymnasium and I returned to the Leppings Lane end of the pitch.



                    After    carrying the five   people off .1 went with the remainder of my

                    serial    to the rear of the West stand where there were a number of

                    deceased lying by the side of the       river



                    I assisted other    police officers and ambulance officers to load three

                    deceased into ambulances.       I cannot give any description of these

tW   f r v f ’f '   deceased.
W        i t

                    I then, assisted by other officers       including     Inspector BURNS,     placed

                    three deceased into a police transit van,          of which I was the driver.

                    I then drove the bodies to the gymnasium accompanied by other police

                    officers whose    identity I d o n ’t know.     1 think   Inspector BURNS

                    remained at the rear of the West stand.



CA T                I have today viewed video and photographs shown to me by Sergeant
vi&wvu              KILLOCH and PC          of the West Midlands Police,          I am unable to

                    identify any of the deceased with whom I had dealings,            with the
                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                        S2307A

       exception of one, a man I believe to be Derek George GODWIN                 <73).



       I recall    that one of the three bodies         that I took in the transit van

       from the side of the river to the gymnasium was wearing a red

       Liverpool    shirt, and I have viewed a photograph of clothing worn by

       GODWIN on the       15th April   1989 <150489)    (Ref NA75)   (Exh.        ).    This

       is a photograph of an identical         shirt as worn by the man that I placed

       in the transit v a n .



       I have v i ewed a photograph       (mortuary print)    (Ref            ) (Exh            )

       of Derek George GODWIN and I am reasonably happy that this is a

       photograph of the man to which I refer.______



       I have   indi cated on a sketch plan the approximate           position at which I

o rr   found the body of the man I believe to be GODWIN.               The position is

       indicated by a blue dot.          I have signed this plan (Ref GLT/i)

       (Exh           ).



       I would add that       I may be mistaken   in as far as I may have assisted to

       place the body of GODWIN in an a mb ul an ce as opposed to placing him in

       the transit.        I dealt with about six deceased at the side of the river

       and may have mixed them up in my mind.

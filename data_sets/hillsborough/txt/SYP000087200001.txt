                ( 11 00).           The    tickets          we    had were       for     the       Leppings       Ln     terraces            and    we

ye    got      to    the    gates          of    the      ground          at a b o u t      11.30 am           (1130).            There          was

something.                There       were       no      problems          with       fans     at     this         time,       th e    f ew

Prior       to      entering          the       g r o u n d we       were       sitting        down with              our      backs        up

           HILLSBOROUGH - RELEASE OF CRUSH BARRIER                  NUMBER   124A

           Thank you for your letter of 22 November 1989-  I note that Lord Justice
           Taylor has no further use for the barrier 124A as a result of the advice
           from Dr Nicholson and Professor M au n de r .

           I am currently waiting for a similar response from the Forensic Science
           Service when I will return the barrier to the owners Sheffield Wednesday
           Football Club and I will advise you when I so do.

           I note your comment that it is without prejudice to the interests of
           other parties concerned with the barrier.  I have an identical stance
           and so will make sure appropriate protections apply to us both.

HILLSBOROUGH - RELEASE OF THE CRUSH BARRIER NUMBER 124A


Thank you for your letter of 8 November in which you ask whether
Lord ^Justice Taylor has any further use for barrier 124A as part
of his Inquiry. I have shown him your letter, and he has said
that he has no further use for i t . Dr Nicholson's letter of 14
November confirms that neither he nor Professor Maunder has any
further need of it, so I can now tell you that, so far as the
Inquiry is concerned, it may now be returned to its owners. That
is, of course, without prejudice to the interests of any of the
other official;' parties who have been concerned with the barrier.

       HILLSBOROUGH - RELEASE OF THE CRUSH BARRIER NUMBER 1241

       As you know from correspondence I have copied to you, a number of parties
       to the civil action are requesting access to and samples from the broken
       barrier from Pen 3.  At the moment I am trying to establish from
       yourselves and Lord Justice Taylor, the Director of Public Prosecutions
       and HM Coroner, whether there are any objections to returning the barrier
       to the owners, Sheffield Wednesday Football C l u b .

      The purpose of this letter, therefore, is to seek Lord Justice Tay lo r 's
      view on the barrier and whether he wishes to retain it any longer for any
      reason, including any further tests.  You may care to raise the matter
      formally with Dr Nicholson to seek his opinion.  I have already broached
      the subject with him informally and he does not see any further need to
      retain the barrier on your behalf* unless you have any specific requests
      for him.  I would be grateful, therefore, to hear from you as to whether
      you have finished with the barrier.

      I have invited the Forensic Science Service to look at the barrier and
      review the work undertaken by Dr Nicholson and his staff.  In due course
      I will be advised by them as to whether they consider any additional work
      needs to be done from a criminal or Coronal perspective. For your
      information and without prejudice to the Forensic Science Service's final
      recommendation, it does appear that Dr Nicholson's work has been
      exhaustive.




   PLEASE REPLY T O T H E OFFICE A T . . . .       Ll?yd .House,_ Birmingham

As you know, the parties to the civil action, both the plaintiffs and
the defendants, are keen to obtain access for their own purposes.
Unless I am advised to the contrary I do not wish to obstruct their
research.  Of course, I recognise that once we have all finished with
the barrier it returns to the ownership of Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club and they must decide, through their solicitors, how they intend to
satisfy the other bids from the plaintiffs and other defendants.

However, as you know the interest in the barrier is not restricted to
the Director of Public Prosecutions, or’ myself' on his behalf.  Lord
Justice Taylor has an interest and once I have received the letter from
Dr Nicholson at the Health and Safety Executive declaring they no longer
have interest then J will write to him to seek his approval.    Furthermore,
HM Coroner at Sheffield will also want to give similar approval once
Dr’ Nicholson has issued his letter'.

All this might seem a little bit. bureaucrat! c but. given that the barrier
could be an Important part of any subsequent proceedings then 1. wish to
be assured that all parties 1 relate to have had every opportunity to
examine and carry out tests.  Having said that, 1 do hope that it will
not be long before 1 can release the barrier and certainly in plenty of
time for you to carry out what work you wish in good time for the
commencement of the civil case.

I tf’ust this letter is of assistance to yon. Please rest assured that I
will not delay the release of the barrier without good cause.

         Dear Miss Steel

         HILLSBOROUGH - CRUSH BARRIERS

         I have noted the contents of your letter dated 21 October 1989 and in
         particular your concern about the barrier and access to it.   The
         situation at present is that the Director of Public Prosecutions does
         not see any further need to retain the barrier.   However, this is
         subject to receiving assurances from the Health and Safety Executive, in
         writing, that they have no further use for the barrier.   Secondly, that
         the Director of Public Prosecutions has the opportunity of having a
         representative present at any future tests.   Thirdly, that an opportunity
         will exist to take photographs of such tests.   Fourthly, all reports and
         data are made available to the Director of Public Prosecutions/Crown
         Prosecution Service as early as possible after the tests.

         However, as you know the interest in the barrier is not restricted to
         the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Lord Justice Taylor has an
         interest and once I have received the letter from the Health and Safety
         Executive declaring they no longer have interest then I will write to
         him to seek his approval. Furthermore, HM Coroner at Sheffield will also
         want to give similar approval once the Health and Safety Executive have
         written.

         All this might seem a little bit bureaucratic, but given that thebarrier
         could be an important part of any subsequent proceedings then I wish to
         be assured that all parties I relate to have had every opportunity to
         examine and carry out tests.  Having said that, I do hope that it will
         not be long before I can release the barrier and certainly in plenty of
         time for you to carry out what work you wish in good time for the
         commencement of civil actions.




   PLEASE REPLY T O T H E OFFIC E A T              Lloyd House, Birmingham

    I have received other letters also requesting access to the barrier for
    the purposes of securing samples.  Consequently, I have agreed with the
    representative of the Director of Public Prosecutions' office that once
    I have all the assurances that we no longer need the barrier then he,
    Mr Kennedy, will undertake to contact you and the other representatives
    of the parties involved in order to discuss the best way forward.
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club who are ultimately the 'owners' of the
    barrier, no doubt will wish to have their say in respect of the way
    forward

    I trust this letter is of assistance to you.  Please rest assured that I
    will not delay the release of the barrier without good cause.  I have
    taken the liberty of copying this letter to the legal representatives of
    the other parties joined in the civil action.

         HILLSBOROUGH - CRUSH BARRIERS

         I am receiving a number of requests from parties to the civil proceedings
         for samples of the barrier in order to carry out their own tests over and
         above what has been undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive in
         Sheffield.

         As you know the barrier ultimately is the property of Sheffield Wednesday
         Football Club and whatever happens to it after we have finished with its
         use must be in consultation and agreement with them.  The Club's
         solicitors, Davies Arnold Cooper, have already written to me declaring
         their ownership and requesting access to it.

        At the present time I am declining such requests until

                   1.     The Forensic Science Service has had the opportunity to look at
                          the barrier and examine the Health and Safety Executive's
                          findings in their two reports, the second one at present being in
                          final draft form.

                   2.     I have a undertaking in writing from Dr Nicholson of the Health
                          and Safety Executive that he has no further tests to undertake to
                          the barrier.

                   3.     I have obtained the Director of Public Prosecutions' approval to
                          release the barrier.

                   4.     I have similar approval from Lord Justice Taylor.

                   5.     Approval from H.M. Coroner.




   PLEASE REPLY T O T H E OFFICE A T ...........
                                      2




Once I have that undertaking from the Forensic Science   Service and Dr
Nicholson then I will write to the parties at 3, 4 and   5, seeking their
respective formal approval to release.  The purpose of   this letter,
therefore, is to give preliminary warning of what I am   doing.

Once release has been approved by all the parties concerned then I will
write to Davies Arnold Cooper and other solicitors representing the parties
to the civil proceedings advising them that the barrier is now available so
they can workout amongst themselves and with the owners how they would like to
proceed with any tests.  This will be important because the tests may lead
to the destruction of the material and therefore could cause complications
later where perhaps like has not been compared with like.

Dear Ml

HUISBCRCOGH INQUIRY - BARRIER 124A

In your letter of 26 October 1989 you wrote concerning various matters which we
had previously discussed on the telephone. Hie one outstanding item concerns
barrier 124A. We have completed our studies on this barrier and have no
further use for it. I have discussed this natter with Professor Maunder and he
too agrees that no further work is required of HSE.

As you know, your colleague from the Forensic Science Service has examined the
barrier at our laboratories and will shortly receive a draft copy of our
metallurgical report. He will then be able to give his view on the need for
any further work.

As far as HSE are concerned, I am ready to release the barrier upon your
instruction following your communications with lord Justice Taylor, HM Coroner
and the Director of Public Prosecutions as outlined in your letter.

Two sets of the HSE photographs are enclosed as requested.                                 An invoice will be
sent to you in due course.

Yours sincerely

            HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

            I refer to your letter of 23 October and our recent telephone
            conversations.   The purpose of this letter is to confirm the agreement we
            made over the telephone.  We discussed the following points:-

                     1.     I have noted the reports etc, you prepared for Lord Justice
                             Taylor.  No doubt Mr’ Whalley will find that information most
                             helpful.

                     2.     I also note that you are about to prepare a second report which
                             is at present in final, draft.   I would like a copy and I would
                             seek your approval, subject to Lord Justice Taylor- agreeing, to
                             be able to submit that report to the Director of Public
                             Prosecutions for his i nforination.  I would also seek approval
                             from Lord Justice Taylor for the Forensic Science Service to
                             examine the barrier, to read your initial report and second report
                             presently in draft.

                     3.     I have noted the view from Health and Safety Executive Management
                             so far as your further involvement is concerned.  As we discussed
                             on the telephone today, the Director of Public Prosecutions is
                             attempting to involve the Forensic Science Service which may mean
                             there will be no need for any further H.S.E. Involvement, other
                             than perhaps the giving of evidence on findings you have already
                             made.

                                                                                                Con t ...




      PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                      Bj rrningharn

 /4.   I noted the copy of the Chief Constables' Working Party on
       Hooliganism at Sporting Invents and their invitation to you to
       contribute.  I have no objection in principle to you discussing
       the process you adopted, but 1 would like you to tread warily
       where you could supply information which could be material to
       any criminal proceedings.   Having said that you may well be able
       to get round that difficulty by concentrating on the processes
       rather than the findings.

 5.    A prime purpose of this letter’ is to address the issue of the
       barrier 126aand whether you have any further use for it.      As you
       know we have   received a number’ of requests for samples of the
       barrier from   solicitor’srepresenting civil litigants. What I
       need to establish from you, in writing, is whether in fact you
       have completed your’ tests on the barrier, that you are satisfied
       with the results and that you have no further’ use for’ the
       barrier.  At this time 1 am not interested in any other1 barriers
       you possess or any tests that you may undertake upon them.     Once
       1 have a letter from you indicating that you have no further
       interest in the barrier I will write formally to Lord Justice
       Taylor, U.M. Coroner and the Director of Public Prosecutions
       advising them accordingly.    I will seek from them letters
       indicating that they have no further interest in the barrier.
       Once I am in possession of ntl those letters then I, will advise
       the Director of Public Prosecutions who will progress the matter
       with solicitors representing the owners, Sheffield Wednesday
       Football Club and the other civil litigants.

 6.    As you know the pre-trial hearing took place this morning before
       Lord Justice Rose.   It may well be that as a result of what the
       Judge has said and in the light of a let,ter1 written by the
       Director of Public Prosecutions that attempts will be made to
       secure samples of the barrier in the very near future. (A copy of
       the Director of Public Prosecutions' letter which they may quote
       is attached for your’ information)  1 have since discussed this
       letter with the Director of Public Prosecutions' representative,
       Mr Kennedy, and he agrees that we must complete the procedures
       identified at (5) above before anything is released.    If you
       should have any undue pressure from any of the parties requesting
       samples, please decline their requests and refer them to me.

3ok forward to hearing from you in due course.

”s sincerely

          Dear Sirs

          HILLSBOROUGH - CRUSH BARRIERS

          I refer to your Letter of 20 October and my reply of 23 in respect of
          Hillsborough and your request for’ samples of the barrier 126a.

          Since my writing to you there have been further’ developments and I have now
          received an undertaking from the Director of Public Prosecutions that he
          has no objection to the release of the barrier and for samples to be made
          available to interested parties for further tests subject to three
          conditions which he lays down.  J understand that lie has written a letter
          to you stating what these conditions are.

           However, you will appreciate that the Director of Public Prosecutions is
           not the only one who has an interest in the barrier.   Lord Justice Taylor,
           on whose behalf I originally seized the barrier, has an interest, as does
           H.M. Coroner at Sheffield.   I have also received a letter from Davies
           Arnold Cooper, who as you know represent Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
           and who also want access to the barrier and who make it quite clear in
           their letter that their clients are ultimately the owners of the property.
           Because of these various interests the purpose of this letter is to inform
           you how I intend to proceed.

           The situation at present is that the Director of Public Prosecutions does
           not see any further need to retain the barrier subject to receiving
           assurances from the Health and Safety Executive, in writing, that they
           have no further use for’ the barrier and that the Director of Public
           Pr’osecutions has the opportunity of having a representative present at the
           time of future tests, that the opportunity will exist to take photographs
           and all reports and data are made available to the Director of Public
           Prosecutions/Crown Prosecution Service.


   PLEASE REPLY T O THE OFFICE A T
                                                 B i r m in g h a m                        Con t... .
However, as you know the interest in the barrier is not restricted to the
Director of Public Prosecutions, or’ myself' on his behalf.     Lord Justice
Taylor has an interest and once L have received the letter from Dr
Nicholson at the Health and S af e t y .Executive declaring they no longer
have interest then I will write to him to seek his approval.       Furthermore,
H.M. Coroner at Sheffield will also want to give similar approval once Dr
Nicholson has issued his letter-.

All this might seem a little bit bureaucratic but given that the barrier
could be an important part of' any subsequent proceedings then 1 wish to be
assured that ail parties I relate to have had every opportunity to examine
and carry out tests.  Having said that., I do hope that it will not be long
before 1 can release the barrier1 and certainly in plenty of' time for you
to carry out what work you wish in good time for the commencement of the
civil case.

I have received a letter from Hammond Suddards, who as you know represent
South Yorkshire Police, who have also requested access to the barrier for
the purposes of securing samples.     They have also written to the Director1
of Public Prosecutions seeking his permission for such samples.     It occurs
to me that Hammond Suddards may not be the only parties who wish to take
samples of this barrier and carry out further tests.     Consequently, I have
agreed with the representative of the Director of Public Prosecutions'
office that once f have ail the assurances that we no longer need the
barrier1 then he, Mr1 Kennedy, wil l undertake to contact you and the other
representatives of’ the parties involved in order to discuss the best way
forward.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club who are ultimately the
'owner’s' of the barrier, no doubt, will wish to have their1 say in respect
of the way forward.

I trust this letter is of assistance to you.  Please rest assured that I
will not delay the release of the barrier without good cause.

            Dear Mr Doyle

            HILLSBOROUGH - CRUSH BARRIERS

           1 refer to your letter of 18 October 1989 on this subject directed to me at
           Furnivat House, Sheffield.  Unfortunately, we vacated Furnival House in July
           and, whilst we did have a mail re-direction from that address, I do not
           seem to have received your letter'. Incidentally, to further complicate the
           position, given we are now responsible for the criminal investigation,
           Furnival House will re-open on Friday, 27 October.  Fortunately, a copy of
           your letter came to me via Mr Whatley who had copied it to me, together
           with a copy of your letter concerning the drawings prepared by Brade &
           Partners.  Regrettably, the letter did not arrive in time for me to respond
           to you before the commencement of today's preliminary pre-trial hearing,
           although I had tried to telephone first thing this morning.

           I have noted the contents of your' let,ter and in particular your concern
           about barrier1 124a and access to it.   The situation at present is that the
           Director1 of Public Prosecutions does not see any further need to retain the
           barrier subject to receiving assurances from the Health and Safety
           Executive, in writing, that Lhey have no further use for1 the barrier
           and that the Director of Public: Prosecutions has the opportunity of
           having a representative present, at, the time of future tests, that the.
           opportunity will exist to take photographs and all reports and data are
           made available to the Director of Public Prosecutions/Crown Prosecution
           S ervice.

           However, as you know the interest in the barrier is not restricted to the
           Director of Public Prosecutions, or myself on his behalf.    Lord Justice
           lay lor1 has an interest and once 1 have received the letter from Dr

H.M. Coroner at Sheffield will also want to give similar approval once Dr

         HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

         The purpose of this letter is to fo]low up a call made by my Detective
         Chief Superintendent Foster to you today to seek some involvement of the
         Forensic Science Service in our investigation into the tragic events at
         Hillsborough in April of this year.  1 understand from Mr Foster you are
         willing to assist and that you will be inviting a member of your staff,
         Mr P. B. Wilson, to undertake the work.

         As I see it at present, we would Jike Mr Wilson to view the broken barrier,
         identified as ’124a1, and to review the tests and results made by Dr
         Nicholson and his Health and Safety Executive staff.  We would be seeking
         an early indication from Mr Wilson whether he was satisfied with the
         tests/results and whether in his professional opinion more research needs
         to be done on the barrier.  If more work needs to be undertaken then we
         would negotiate that with you.

         I am also aware that parties involved in civil proceedings arising out of
         Hillsborough have an interest in testing the barrier.  The Director of
         Public Prosecutions has agreed in principle to releasing the barrier for
         tests subject to three conditions.   These are:-

                         (i)       samples/tests are in the presence of arepresentative
                                   nominated by the Crown Prosecution Service.




   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T                     Bi rmingharn
                                         -   2   -




        (ii)   photographs are to be taken whenever samples are
               obtained and copies provided to the Crown Prosecution
               Service.

       (iii)   all reports/data are provided promptly to the
               Crown Prosecution Service.



Whether the Director of Public Prosecutions will ask the Forensic Science
Service to undertake the representative role I am unsure but there could be
that possibility.  If so I would hope that the role does not become too
onerous for any of us.

To assist Mr Wilson's deliberations I enclose a copy of Dr Nicholson's
initial report to Lord Justice Taylor.  It was presented at the hearings
and therefore is in the public domain.

I would hope to meet with Mr Wilson in the near future and introduce him to
Dr Nicholson.  I would also make myself available to show Mr’ Wilson the
football ground if he wishes and to answer’ any questions about our
investigation and findings to date.  I understand that you have permitted
us to make our arrangements direct with Mr Wilson.

In closing may I take this opportunity to thank you for affording us the
assistance of the Forensic Science Service in this sensitive enquiry.

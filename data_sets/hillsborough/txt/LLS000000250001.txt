          All of which actions were, together with others,

consolidated by the Order of the Honourable Mr.Justice Rose dated

the 14th day of May 1990.




                   RESPONDENTS NOTICE OF ADDITIONAL

           GROUNDS PURSUANT TO R.S.C. ORDER 59 RULE 6(1)(b)




TAKE NOTICE THAT upon the hearing of the Appeal under the

Defendant's Notice of Appeal dated the 8th day of November 1990 from

the judgment of the Honourable Mr.Justice Hidden given on the
                                       t




31st of July 1990 in the above named consolidated actions, the

Plaintiffs in each of those actions intend to contend that the

judgment in each of their respective actions should be affirmed not

only on the grounds relied upon by the Court below but on grounds

additional to those grounds namely:




          1.      That on the basis of the admitted facts applicable

          to each, each Plaintiff was entitled to succeed without

          reference to a test of legal limitation on liability based

          on proximity, be that proximity of relationship or




                                   3
proximity of time and place, by virtue of the application

of the test of "reasonable foreseeability";




2.     That if it be correct in law to apply a test of

liability based upon proximity of relationship and a

further test of proximity in terms of time and place, then

in the actions of

               HAROLD COPOC

               STEPHEN JONES

               ROBERT SPEARRIT

       each Plaintiff contends judgment should be affirmed

on further additional grounds as follows:




       (i)     on the admitted facts applicable to each

               Plaintiff, the Plaintiff's material

               perception of the events of the Hillsborough

               Disaster came not only through direct

               witnessing of those events through the

               medium of a live television broadcast but

               also through the witnessing o.f and

               participation in events making up the

               "immediate aftermath" of the Hillsborough

               Disaster that is to say   (a) in the case of

               HAROLD COPOC through searching for his son

               in Sheffield during the hours following the

               Hillsborough Disaster and in the discovering

               and seeing in the course of that search his

               son's body in the Sheffield Medico-legal
        Centre;       (b) in the case of STEPHEN JONES

        through searching for his brother in

        Sheffield during the hours following the

        Hillsborough Disaster and       (c) in the case

        of ROBERT SPEARRIT through searching for his

        brother in Sheffield during the hours

        following the Hillsborough Disaster and

        discovering and seeing in the course of that

        search his injured brother in the intensive

        care unit in a Sheffield Hospital;




(ii)    such direct perception of events through

        search for (in the case of STEPHEN J O N E S )

        and through search for and discovery of

        their respective loved ones (in the case of

        HAROLD COPOC and ROBERT SPEARRIT) in the

        hours immediately following the Hillsborough

        Disaster was and is sufficiently proximate

        to the events of the Hillsborough Disaster

        as to give rise to liability in the

        Defendant for psychiatric injury caused by
                                                 *




        such perception;




(iii)   further in the case of ROBERT SPEARRIT it is

        contended that in the basis of the admitted

        facts applicable to him;       (a) his

        relationship with his nephew was

        sufficiently proximate in terms of


                  -   5 -
                            relationship and          (b) his search for and

                            discovery in Sheffield of the body of his

                            nephew in the temporary mortuary in the

                            gymnasium at the Hillsborough Stadium was
                                     •%
                            sufficiently proximate to the events of the

                            Hillsborough Disaster in terms of time and

                            place, as to give rise to liability in the

                            Defendant for psychiatric injury caused by

                            the Plaintiff's fear and concern for the

                            well being of his nephew and by his

                            perception of events in the course of the

                            said search and discovery.

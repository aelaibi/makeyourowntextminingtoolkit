Liverpool F.C
Anfield Road
Liverpoo1                                17 April,1989



Dear Sirs ,

I am a season ticket holder (Anfield Rd) and attended the
semi-final at Hillsborough on Saturday 15th April. I was
accompanied by my youngest son who had a ground ticket which
we were able to exchange for a North Stand seat outside the
ground.

My Views on the tragedy are as follows

  1.   The obvious discrepancy between the area allocated
       to Liverpool and the Notts Forest Supporters

  2.   The police operation was hopelessly inadequate
       compared to the matches held at Anfield and other
       football grounds I have attended over the past
       40 years.

  3.   The praiseworthy efforts of St.John Ambulance Corps,
       supporters, and the doctors I observed were frustrated
       by a. lack of medical equipment of all kinds.

  4.   The so-called security barriers should have been
       removed more quickly and removed permanently from
       all grounds, in the interest of safety-;  '


My view is that we should withdraw from the F.A. Cup
Competition as a mark of respect to the deceased and the
spur to the F.A. with a view to improving the ticket
allocation e t c .

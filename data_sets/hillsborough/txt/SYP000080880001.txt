As    I ar rived     I noticed a huge mass                 of    people,    who were all            trying    to

get    into the turnstiles.                 I looked to find turnstile                  !,B"»       I had a

ticket    for the Leppings              Ln terrace         (£6).      The   entrance m ar k e d on the

ticket    is turnstile           ”8".       I could only see            "A" and    l!C H , so       I made my

w ay towards        the turnstiles           and the       crowd was moving as other                  people

were    turned away to go to another                      turnstile.        We asked a P o l i c e m a n who

told us that         turnstile        “8 !l was     round the         corner    to our       right.     As    I

w a l k e d around to my         right,      I saw the          crowd walking      forward,          I joined

them and       I found myself           entering the ground by a large blue g a t e ,
                                                          /'
which    had been opened.               There was a P o l i c e m a n and P o 1icewoman who were

standing       in the entrance at             the gat/*,        the    crowd was walking             past    them

and    into the ground.              I held my Jacket             in my hand,      but as       I entered

the g round no one asked to see/it.                         I a tt en d e d the semi-final             last

year and at that          time       enters/ the terrace               by using    the tunnel,              I then

made my way across             the    ter/aces       to   the far       left   terrace        by the N orth

Stand.        Due   to this      I we/t      down the t u n n e l this year,             thinking       that       I

could a gain get across I                I e ntered the tunnel              and noticed how dark                  it

was.     I made my way forward.                   T. had no problems walking                  the    length of

the    tunnel,      but wher/ I got          to the terrace           end   I. came against a wall                 of

people,       who were    standing          in the mouth of the tunnel.                      Because    of the

people    corning aloiig the tunnel                 behind me,         I was   being     pushed forward

into    the    crowd. / I looked at the               pitch and saw that               the    players were

about    to kick      cyff .     I m a na ge d to move          to my    left to avoid the flow of

people    coming ^but of the tunnel.                      I found that         I was    feeling       very

uncornf o r t a b l e !and that       I was    not    in control         of my own movements.                 If

the    crowd m oved      I had to move with them.                      I tried very hard to make my

way slowly to my          left,       the    crowd was          letting me move with            it to my

left.     1 found myself against                  the end of a barrier,                due to the height

of the barrier         it was        being    pushed       into my groin.          I mana ge d to get

a r o u n d b ehind the        barrier,      then    I lost my footing.                I fell       nearly to

my knees and         I grabbed hold of the                barrier,         w hich was      now    level       w it h

my    chest.     A sudden        pressure was          then against me           pushing my         chest          onto

the barrier.           It was     very    painful,        I m a n ag ed to     push myself          up,       I

a g a i n managed to get ar ou nd              the end of the barrier,                putting       it behind

me.     I was aware       that a young            lad had fallen to the floor,                     a short

distance       in front       of me.      I saw that          the    people around him were

pushing against          each other           to give him       room to get          up.     This       lad was

helped up and he a p p e a r e d          to be alright.              I a gain started to make my

way to my left.           Just     before       I came across          the barrier          I saw that a

Police Officer          had    ran onto        the    pitch and stopped the match.                       I could

see    people    climbing       over     the fences.           It was       obvious     to me that            this

was    not a normal       crowd problem,              my father was also             on the terraces                in

pen 4,     the same      pen as me,           I became     very w o r ri ed for his safety.                       With

the    people    climbing       out    I found that           very slowly the           pressure was

easing.        The   people around me were very upset and distressed.                                     I

continued to make my way                 left,       to the side f e pci n g , intending                 to       climb

over    into    pen 5.        I. m a na ge d to
                               reach the ferhce, I got too close to the
                                          /
fence and got stuck next to the fence, /fhere was a lad about 16 years
                                       //
next to me, who was saying that he cojdldn *t breath. Some others and

then climbed up myself.                  As    I w a y climbing        over    I cut my          left    leg on

the    top of the fencing.               I was/assisted             down the other          side    but       I fell

to the floor,           I got     up and h£l ped some other                  people     over the fence

and then       I went    down onto        tae     pitch.       I saw a lot of           people      lying          on

the    floor,    some were        be in g/ gi ve n the kiss           of    life,    some heart massage

a nd some      being    treated fof           cuts,    etc.     I tried to          ignore what was

happ en in g and find my father,                     I w an de re d aro un d for about             13—20 rnins.

I then saw my father,              he was       still     standing         in the    terrace.           I waved

for    some minutes       until       I att ra ct ed his attention.                  I could       not get          to

him because          people were       still      being    helped over         the    fencing and out of

              the safety gates,              I then sat down         and cried,    it was      then    beginning         to

              hit me that          something       terrible    had   happened.     I looked up and              saw a

              body    lying on the          pitch.      I, saw someone    put his       jacket    over his head.

              I then realised that                he was   dead.     I then made my way back onto                 the

              terrace,         the end pen next         to the North S ta nd and sat           down.     I knew my

              father was alright             so    I got out    of   the way.

              I heard a loudspeaker ann ou nc em en t                was made asking       supporters        to

              remain      in the ground.            I saw a lot of people          leaving     so 1 decided to

              leave.           I made my way under         the North terrace and out of the

              turnstiles.           I left the       ground by going      through an open blue gate

              (gate B).           I had just      got   onto the street when my father                came up me.

              I couldn't          speak,    I found     I was dazed and         that   I c o u l d n ’t talk.      We

             made     our way back towards              the   car and met       up with

             We got back           to the    car and decided to make             our way home.         The   car

              radio was         on as we drove and we heard that about 74 people had died.

             We turned off the mai n                road and tried to find a            'phone box.          I 'phoned

             home and then we made                our wa y home,

Sheffield.               Nobody          was    drinking           on       the      coach     t h at      I know         of    but       I saw

people        drinking             from     cans      on    the        road       leading          to    the       football          ground.

We    arrived           in S h e f f i e l d     at       12.55        pm a n d        parked        in a s i d e         r o ad

somewhere           off       Pennistone             Road       or H e r r i e s        R o a d.        I remember             there       were

factories           nearby,           about      f iv e     minutes            walk      to    the       ground.            There         were

plenty        of    police          standing          on    corners            of      side     roads         leading          to    the

ground.            We    knew where             we were          going         as      I was       th^e^l^ast             ye a r .

Everyone           was     behaving            themselves              no     signs      of /^Trunks           or     fights         on    the

way    to     the       ground.

I was        with                                     when       we     got y b         the    g r o u n d at         1.10      pm a       fe w

form     queues.              We    entered          through 8              turnstiles             and     handed         in our

tickets,           we    kept       the     stub.          When        we     g ot     through          the    turnsitles             we w e r e

searched           by a P o l i c e m a n .           I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r           seeing          any      stewards          either

at    the     turnstiles              or    in the         ground.             We      went     to      the    toilet          and    then

followed           where        everyone         else       was        going.           I didn't           se4      any     signs         to

d i d n ’t see          any     gates       open and            d i d n ’t see          anyone          climbing          in.        The

tunnel        was       quite       free       and    found        a    place          in P e n      3 easily.              There         were

about        forty       people          in t h e r e      at    the        time.         I d i d n ’t see            any      stewards

either        at    the       entrance          to    the       tunnel         or      on the        t e r r a c es.        There was

no    trouble           or a n y o n e      drinking            either         in the         ground          or    on    the       terraces.

We    got     to    our       position          on    the       terrace           at    1/15       pm a nd w e r e          quite

policeman who                  was     standing              at       the       gate.            I was           in t hi s          position             for

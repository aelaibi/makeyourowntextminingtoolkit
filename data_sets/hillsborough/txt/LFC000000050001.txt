Dear Miss Steel,

         Thank you for your letter dated 9th May.
you require on stewarding and First A i d p r o v i s i o n a t A n f i e l d o n
match days, prior to the Hillsborough Disaster, is as follows.

         In the Safety Certificate which is issued by the Liverpool
City Building Surveyor, the establishment for first team matches
calls for a total of 116 stewards.   The minimum number of
stewards and their function and distribution are given below.-

            Exit Stewards                                 1*1
            Relief Exit Stewards                          15
            Crowd Stewards                                  ^
            Safety Stewards                              JLi
                                                         116

          On average the club employ 194 stewards per game. The
 number and functions are as specified above, with a substantial
 increase in crowd control stewards to a total of 70.

          In addition, there are 2 I/C stewards and 7 head stewards
 controlling the 5 main sections of the stadium,
 attending club car parking and ticket offices, 23 1°™*'9
 internal room stewards, 6 stewards covering players and other
 V.I.P. entrance areas and 5 administration stewards.
 the stewards' instruction and training includes sessions in the
 monthaofAuguat and January « = h „..r, .ddraaaed by r.pr...ntatlv..
 Of the Local Authority, the Police and the Fire                 x
 Perimeter stewards are used at the close of each match and total
 12 in number.
           On arrival the stewards are briefed by the I/C steward
  before being assigned to the appropriate task and issued with a
  coloured numbered jacket.

                                                                  contd...
                            -     2   -


         After the stadium is open to the public, communication
between chief stewards, club officials, police and duty stewards is
by portable radio (6) and internal manned telephone points (24)
situated in every area of the stadium.    The internal telephone
control and communication centre also houses the crowd control
computer and printer, together with a television screen receiving
CCTV scanning by police personnel from 7 cameras covering inside
and outside the stadium.    The police have 2 separeate rooms for
control within the stadium.

         Two First Aid rooms at Anfield are situated at either end
of the ground in the Paddock Enclosure.   The St. John Ambulance
Brigade cover every event at the ground with 24 officers and
members present, with an ambulance in attendance, with 30
stretchers available.

         With regard to the "make-up" of the supporters entering
the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough this is difficult to
proportion with any accuracy.

         I trust that this information will be helpful to the
Hillsborough Steering Committee and if you require anything further
please do not hesitate to contact me.

                                Yours sincerely,

   STATaj_ENT_ON_HILLSBORO__byJ______________

I arrived at the ground at just after 11am,I was there to
produce the Outside Broadcast for BBC Radio 2.On my way
through Sheffield I was horrified jso see there were no AA
signs for the match,but stacks for the World Snooker and
a Photographic Exhibition. This cannot have helped some
drivers arriving late in the city with Hillsboro their
ultimate destination.

                        On reaching my seat in the commentary
position - located in the press box - I remarked to my
colleagraes that there were vast ope©, spaces still left on
the North Stand,A$ suc$ an advanced stage - fifteen minutes
from kickoff - we all agreed that there must be horrendous
traffic problemsjoutside and that the game might have to be
delayed, as it was two years earlier for the last semi-final
I had attended at Hillsboro, Coventry v Leeds,

                        At 3,03 I noticed that the action behind
the Liverpool goal was not the ordinary jostle you associate
with a large cup-tie crowd,Photographers were unusually active
and far too many were trying to get from the terraces onto the
pitch.At 3,06 I noticed a press photographer pushing a constable
onto the field of play to tell the mdbs& xx referee to get the
players off the fieId.This incident,plus the sight of fans
trying to clabber from the terrace to the upper ifegSBBer tier at
the Leppings Lane End made me aware that tragedy larked.In 15
years of repprting English   League soccer matches,you develop
an instinct for trouble and I knew this was a bad one.
                             At 3.09,after our first live report
into Sport on Two,I told '            to anchor our coverage from
the commentary position while Alan Green and myself went down to
the dressing-room area,We stayed there till 18,00 when Sport on
Two went off the air - assembling information to pass to
       and conducting eyewitness   interviews,My initial impression
was that nobody knew what was going on, that the fans and
ambulance services were more switched on.Officials at the club
remained tight-lipped for lon^periods, the Football Association
representatives (Graham Kelly and G]_en Kirton) could not give us
anything official until the game was definitely postponed - and the
police spokesmen were very uncommunicative,We had to rely on the
evidence of our own eyes while estimating the amount of fatalities.
At a© stage until the police press conference at 19.00 were we
given estimates of the dead or injured by the police.Judging by
the amount of walkie-talkies thrown onto the pitch by distressed
constables,! suspect that the police were having dreadful problems
of communication themselves,Tv,ere was confusion about the location
and availability of the public address system and it took ages
to get Kenny Dalglish onto the mike to try to     defuse the
situation.


                      My overall,lasting impression is that of a
complete breakdown in communications,of a gradual,dawning awareness
of the tragedy among officials representing the club and the police
- and the inevitable withdrawal of co-operation at official level
as we tried to separate rumour and half-truth from reality,T^e basic
error seemed to stem from a failure to recall the teams to the
dressing-rooms once the police request for a ddlay had been passed
on to the F,A, and Wednesday officials near the tunnel at 2,55,

                 FORWARD TOWARDS THE TURNSTYLES TO KEEP THE ROAD CLEAR. IT WAS
                 IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE OUTSIDE THE TURNSTYLE. INSIDE THE GROUND THERE
                 WAS NO MARSHALLING FROM THE TURNSTYLE AREA AT ALL. THE TWO SIDE

AT 1440HRS THE CROWD WAS SO GREAT THAT MY ARMS WERE CRUSHED TO MY SIDE. I WAS
ONLY HELD UP BECAUSE WE WERE CRUSHED TOGETHER. I HEARD PEOPLE SCREAMING AND
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BREATH.I WAS BEHIND A BARRIER AND IN FRONT OF US WAS THE
BARRIER WHICH COLLAPSED. WHEN FOREST HAD A CORNER THE CROWD SURGED FORWARD
AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCES THE POLICE WERE PUSHING THEM BACK.
I SAW AT LEAST NINE BODIES, PEOPLE TRYING TO REVIVE THEM. NO ONE KNEW WHAT
WAS HAPPENING AND THE POLICE APPEARED TO BE CONFUSED THERE WAS NO
COMMUNICATION. NO ONE USED THE TANNOY TO TELL THE FOREST FANS WHAT WAS
HAPPENING AND THATS WHY THEY WERE TAUNTING US.
THJ^PRESS WERE MORE INTERESTED IN GETTING PICTURES OF FANS MISBEHAVING.
IW A S NOT UNTIL 1615HRS THAT I COULD LEAVE THE STAND DUE TO THE PRESSURE OF
PEOPLE. I TRAVELLED DOWN WITH FRIENDS BUT THEY WERE IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE
STAND.

CALLER FEELS THAT THE MAIN PROBLEM WAS THE TUNNEL BEING UNATTENDED AND PEOPLE
NOT BEING DIRECTED TO THE OUTER PENS. THERE WAS A SERIOUS OVERSIGHT WITH
REGARDS TO THE CONTROL INSIDE THE GROUND. IT WAS MUCH MORE ORGANISED LAST
Y K AND PEOPLE COULDNT GO WHERE THEY PLEASED AS THEY COULD THIS YEAR. I ALSO
S l f THAT POLICE OFFICERS WERE WITHOUT RADIOS WHICH I FELT COULD HAVE BEEN
USED TO RELAY MESSAGES ABOUT THE KICK OFF BEING DELAYED. I DO FEEL THAT THE
POLICE HAD NO OPTION BUT TO OPEN THOSE GATES.

I WENT ON MY OWN TO THE MATCH.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WHEN I WAS GOING TO THE MATCH I SAW A LOT OF
LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS DRINKING AND A LOT OF EMPTY BEER CANS LITTERED AROUND
THE AREA •
IN MY OPINION THE POLICE WERE TOTALLY DISORGANISED OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND
THEY WERE UNABLE TO CONTROL THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE GROUND.
I AM UNABLE TO COMMENT ON WHAT WENT ON INSIDE THE GROUND.

THERE WERE WERE LOSING CONTROL. IT WAS REALLY BAD ORGANISATION. I SHOWED MY

THERE WERE NO SIGNS, NO STEWARDS, AND NO POLICE TO DIRECT PEOPLE TO THE EMPTY
STANDS SO EVERYBODY WENT DOWN THE TUNNEL TO THE CROWDED PEN, FORTUNATELY I
KNEW THE WAY TO GO TO THE EMPTY PENS.   I THOUGHT THE POLICE WERE FULL OF
APATHY AND NONE OF THE UNIFORM PC'S HAD RADIOS ONLY THE PS'S. IF IT HADN'T
BEEN FOR THE ST JOHNS AMBULANCE AND THE SUPPORTERS FAR MORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE
DIED BECAUSE THE POLICE DID NOT SEEM ABLE TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION.
WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE GROUND I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES, POLICE OFFICERS
WERE STILL STANDING AROUND DRINKING CUPS OF TEA. SOMETHING ELSE UPSET ME AND
THAff WAS THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE DEAD BODIES WERE NOT COVERED UP.

OPENED. THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HAD GONE BEFORE ME, SO I MOVED THROUGH UP THE
STEPS TO THE UPPER PART OF THE STANDING AREA. I WENT TO THE MATCH LAST YEAR
AND THE THING WHICH STRUCK ME ABOUT THIS YEAR WAS THE CONSIDERABLE LACK OF
STEWARDS WHICH WERE AVAILABLE TO TELL PEOPLE WHERE TO GO. IF PEOPLE DIDNT
KNOW WHERE TO GO THEN THEY JUST HEADED THROUGH THE TUNNEL. THE TERRACES ON
THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT OF THE GOAL WERE EMPTY.

               SHOVING, SOME PEOPLE HAD FALLEN DOWN BUT THEY GOT BACK UP AGAIN.
               IT WAS CHAOS, PEOPLE WERE SHOUTING AT THE POLICE TO PUSH
               EVERYBODY BACK. THERE WAS ONLY A POLICE OFFICER ON A HORSE HE

I PUSHED MY WAS TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WHERE I GOT CRUSHED UP AGAINST A
RAILING. I WENT UNDER THE RAILING AND THERE WERE ABOUT 8 OR 10 POLICE
OFFICERS STANDING ACROSS AN ALLEY WAY. I SAID TO THEM TO GO AND HELP OUTSIDE
AND THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. ON MY LEFT WAS A GATE, A POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS
VERY CONCERNED AND A STEWARD OPENED THE GATE AND I WENT INTO THE GROUND.
NOBODY ASKED TO SEE MY TICKET. TO MY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT TEN PEOPLE WENT THROUGH
THE GATE ASWELL. ONCE INSIDE THE GROUND THERE WERE NO STEWARDS OR POLICE
OFFICERS AROUND. LAST YEAR I WENT TO THE GROUND AND REMEBERED WHAT IT
W A R L I K E IN THE CENTRE PENS, I STARTED TO WALK DOWN THE TUNNEL IT SEEMED
b J R k DOWN THERE SO I TURNED AROUND AND PUSHED MY WAY BACK OUT. THERE WAS
NOTHING OR NOBODY TO SAY THAT THE CENTRE PENS WERE PACKED AND NOT TO GO DOWN
THE TUNNEL. I WENT TO ONE OF THE SIDE PENS IN THE RIGHT HAND CORNER. BY THIS
TIME THE PLAYERS WERE ON THE PITCH. WHEN THE GAME STARTED I WASN'T WATCHING
THE MACTH, ALL I COULD SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING INSIDE THE CENTRE PENS. I COULD
SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING, I SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE, THEY GOT ONE
BLOKE OUT AND THEY WERE PUMPING ON HIS CHEST. THE POLICE SEEMED TO BE
STANDING AROUND. IT WAS AS IF THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THE
FANS WERE TRYING TO HELP EACH OTHER. AN AMBULANCE CAME ONTO THE PITCH,
INSTEAD OF COMING STRAIGHT ACROSS THE PITCH HE SLOWLY DROVE AROUND THE EDGE.
THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY ORGANISATION, ALOT OF POLICE OFFICERS WERE JUST
STANDING AROUND, FANS WERE BREAKING DOWN BOARDS AND USING THEM AS STRETCHERS,
THEY WERE CARRYING THEM PAST THE POLICE THAT WERE JUST STANDING THERE I
COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. A FEW DID HELP THOUGH.

THE TICKET WE HAD MEANT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WHERE THE CRUSH HAPPENED, BUT THE
PLACE WAS JUST TOO FULL. I'M TALL AND I COULD SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. I COULD
HEAR PEOPLE CRYING AND MOANING BUT I NEVER THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE WERE DYING. I
COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN NEAR ENOUGH TO HELP ANYONE BECAUSE OF THE FENCES. I FEEL
THE WHOLE THING WAS SO BADLY ORGANISED AND THE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE HELPED
MORE. I WAS ANNOYED AT THE PRESS TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS - THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN
PEOPLE WERE DYING. I WAS ON THE FIRST OF THE SPECIAL TRAINS, AND GOING BY THE
TIME I GOT THERE, EVERYONE ELSE MUST HAVE GOT TO THE GROUND LATE.

I THINK A BIG PROBLEM WAS THE FENCES ON THE TERRACES LEADING THROUGH TO THE
SIDE PENS . I WOULDN'T SAY THE POLICE WERE WRONG BUT WHO EVER WAS IN CHARGE
DIDN'T APPEAR TO DIRECT THE BOBBIES.I GOT OUT ONTO THE PITCH ABOUT 3.05, A
FEW SECONDS BEFORE THE GAME WAS STOPPED. THOSE OF US THAT HAD GOT OUT, AND
ALSO THE POLICE WITH US DID NOT KNOW AT THAT STAGE WHAT WAS GOING ON.
OBVIOUSLY WHEN THE REAL PANIC SET IN, I WAS OUT OF IT. I WENT TO THE MATCH
ALONE.

COMMENT TO A POLICE OFFICER PRESENT THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE SERIOUSLY INJURED IF
SOMETHING WASNT DONE ABOUT THE CROWD TRYING TO GET IN.THERE WAS NO
ORGANISTATION O/S THE GROUND.IN MY OPINION IF THE GATE HAD NOT BEEN OPENED
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEATHS O/S THE GROUND.

IT WAS A TIGHT SQUEEZE EVEN TO GET MY TICKET OUT OF MY POCKET. THIS OCCURRED
AT ABOUT 2.25PM. THERE WAS A SORT OF COURT YARD BEHIND THE STAND AFTER GOING
THROUGH THE TURNSTILES. IN THAT YARD FROM WHAT I REMEMBER THERE WERE NO
STEWARDS/POLICE DIRECTING PEOPLE TO THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE
GROUND.STRAIGHT AHEAD OF YOU WAS A TUNNEL AND YOU COULD SEE THE GROUND AND
THAT WAS THE OBVIOUS DIRECTION FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE TO THE PITCH, BUT IF YOU
KNEW THE GROUND YOU COULD GO EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT TO A SPOT THAT WASN'T
DIRECTLY BEHIND THE GOAL.IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF MY FRIEND THAT WE STOOD WHERE
W ^ I D . THERE WAS NOBODY FROM THE CLUB OR THE POLICE TO SHOW US THIS
WAY.WHERE I STOOD EVEN AFTER THE GAME HAD STARTED WE HAD PLENTY OF ROOM.I SAW
THE PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE RAILINGS AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED ON THE
PITCH OTHERWISE MY VIEW WAS OBSURED BY THE CORNER OF THE WEST STAND.MY FRIEND
TOLD ME THAT AT ABOUT 2.30PM THAT THE PEN BEHIND THE GOALS WAS OVER CROWDED
BUT THE PENS EITHER SIDE WERE RELATIVELY EMPTY. THE POLICE TENDED TO TREAT
THE SPILLAGE ONTO THE PITCH AS A VIOLENT SITUATION AND DEPLOYED A LINE OF
OFFICERS ACROSS THE PITCH. THESE OFFICERS JUST STOOD THERE.
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH                              LIVERPOOL AND WITH 5
OTHERS BUT I'ONLY KNOW THEM BY THEIR FIRST NAMES

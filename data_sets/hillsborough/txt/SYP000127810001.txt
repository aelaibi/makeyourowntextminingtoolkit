           I am a married man and I live at the above address with mywife and

           family.     I am employed by the

           I am the father of Steven Joseph ROBINSON,            17 years,    the middle of

           five children.        Steven was born on 11 August      1971 at Trinity Mood

           Nursing Home, Bootle 20, M e r s e y s i d e .   The delivery was fairly normal.

           He attended Sacred Heart High School, Liverpool Road, Crosby,               left

           school at sixteen and went st raight into an apprent i ceshi p as an auto

           electrician with North Western Buses, L iv e r p o o l .

           As a child Steven did not suffer from any major i1l nesses,

ailments Steven has always been in fine health.            He did have a small

scar on his forehead from a childhood fall.            Steven's GP was




On Saturday 15th Apri          19S9 (150489) Steven was going to Sheffield

Wednesday Football Ground at Hillsborough to watch Liverpool F.C play

Nottingham Forest F.C.in the semi final off the F.A. Cup.             I d o n ’t

know what Steven had to eat that morning but he would normally have

Shredded Wheat cereal.

He took a packed lunch with him consisting of a couple of ham rolls,

a yoghurt,         two apple pies and two chocolate covered biscuits.

Steven was going to the match with two friends,

1. Tommy HILTON

2.

They were to travel to Hillsborough by coach, and to that end I

dropped all three lads off at St Peters Church, Tower Hill, Kirby,

which was to be the pick up point for the coach.

At that time Steven was wearing a black leather j a c k e t , a red and

white sweatshirt and blue jeans and red and white high ankle

t ra i n e r s .   I left them at that location at about 0945 - 1000 hrs.

The three lads had told me that they would be at the standing end of

the ground.

Later that afternoon I became aware of problems at the match via the

television.         For the rest of the afternoon and evening I attempted to

trace Steven by way of the emergency telephone and telephoning the

Sheffied h o s p i t al s .   The emergency 1ine was constantly engaged and at

2300 hrs that night my wife and I decided to travel to Hi 1 lsborough

to try and get some information.

At 0200 hrs Sunday 16th April          1989 (160489)   I attended the Sports

Hal 1 at the Hi 1lsborough F o o t b a l 1 Ground where I identified Steven to

Police Sergeant 2798 Reeve.

At 1730 hours tuesday 25th April         19S9 (250489)    I was shown the

following propertys

1. Yves Saint Larent Red/White Sweatshirt

2. Pair blue Yankee Denim Jeans

3. Pair                boxer shorts

4. Pair Nike Court Force trainers

5. Pair Black Terry Towel socks.

At that time I identified this property to PC

There is property still outstanding which Steven had with him.

He was wearing his black leather         *IDENTIKIT’ make jacket which has an

imitation crocodile skin pattern to it, and a gold coloured 1 ining

with green diamond stitc h i n g.      The initials    ’S J R ' may well have been

written on the inside la b e l .      Also missing    is a black leather insert

for a wallet containing his identity card with photograph whi ch was

issued by his e m p l oy e r s . North WEstern Buses which he used as a bus

p as s .   He did not use his ful w a l l e t , just this i n sert.   His National

Insurance Card was also in the insert, together with his Union card.                 <

TGWU).      His driving 1icence is missing from the house and so may well

also have been with this property.

Steven did not wear jewellery of any description,            nor a watch.    He

did not wear glasses.

His full description is as follows.

White male 17 y e a r s , 5'10" well buiIt and in proportion,         dark brown

           At   10am (1000) Wednesday 22 March 1989 (220389),                I attended a

           planning meeting at Hammerton Road Police Station,                  chaired by Chief

           Superintendent MOLE to discuss the organisation of the F.A Cup Semi

           Final    tie between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs..

           On Monday 27 March 1989 (270389),           I was promoted Chief Superintendent

           of *F* Division and assumed responsibilities for the forthcoming

           football match,

           In the period which followed leading to the semi final                    I liaised with

           Assistant Chief Constable           (Operations) Mr JACKSON regarding the

           a r ra ng em en ts «

           At 10am <1000) Wednesday 29 March 1989 <290389)y I had a meeting with

           Superintendent MURRAY,           Chief Inspector BEAL and Inspector SEWELL in

           my office to discuss the operational               order and our arrangements for

           the day and to ensure these were progressing satisfactorily.
                                                                         PAGE


At 2.30pm    (1430) on 10 April   1989 (104089)   I had a meeting with the

Sector Superinte nd en ts » representatives from "D" Division* Road

Traffic and British Transport Police to discuss our arran ge me nt s.

At 2pm <1400) Wednesday 12 April      1989 <120489),    I held a press

conference at Hammerton Road Police Station and met with media

representatives.

At 10am <1000) Friday 14 April      1989 <140489),    I held a pre match

briefing    in the North Stand at the Hillsborough Football Stadium for

officers of Inspector and above.       See Appendix    'A'.

The purpose of this was to give a full briefing to supervisory

officers and then for them to have the opportunity to examine their

respective areas of responsibility and familiarise themselves with

the ground.

I conducted the main briefing with Superintendent M U R R A Y , and then

the respective area Superintendents held their own briefings,            in and

around the ground,, dealing more specifically with their needs, and

requirements of their areas of res ponsibi1i ty.

At 10am <1000) Saturday 15 April      1989 (150489),    I briefed the

officers on duty for the semi final tie in the North Stand of the

Hillsborough Football Stadium.      See Appendix     'B'.

It was a shortened version of the previous day"s briefing.

Superintendent MURRAY,    Detective Sergeant CHARLESWORTH and Inspector

SEWELL also dealt with matters such as Emergency Evacuation

Procedure,    Crime Intelligence,   and Administration.

On completion of the briefing I spoke with officers           in the ground and

toured the area.

I re-entered the ground about 1.15pm (1315) and in due course made my

way to the Police control Box about      1.50pm (1350) and liaised with

Superintendent MURRAY.

We left a short time later to see the referee and linesmen to advise
                                                                        PAGE


them of our emergency procedures.

They were on the pitch and eventually they left and we followed them

to the o f f i c i a l s   room.

On leaving there about 2pm          (1400) we returned to the Police Control

Box and met with Mr JACKSON, Assistant Chief Constable          (Operations)*

In the Control Box were the regular operators - POL PS GODDARD,          PC

RYAN and PC BICHARD,

I had a general discussion with Mr JACKSON about the operation,          which

was progressing sat isfactorily at this stage.          He left a little while

1a t e r .

About 2.30pm       (1430), when examining the ground situation,    I noted

that the Spion Kop was almost full with the Nottingham Forest fans,

and that was the general view in respect of their other areas of the

ground.

A number of Liverpool          supporters had obtained tickets for the Spion

Kop and were accommodated in the North East          part of this section of

the ground.       They were segregated from the Nottingham Forest

supporters      by a line of police officers.

The North Stand for Liverpool          supporters was possibly half full at

this time,      the West Stand was filling,     but there was space at the

front and sides of the Leppings Ln Terrace.           I asked for a tannoy

message to be relayed for fans to move forward and spread along the

ter ra c e.

I can recall about this time Superintendent MARSHALL asked for

Leppings Ln to be closed and saw on the CCTV monitor the crowd

situation and a SYPTE double decker bus passing.

I was aware of a crowd build up but traffic was still able to floM.1

and I questioned in my mind the need for the closure.

At this time there must have been some difficulty in closing the road

because I remember more than one request for this to be done as
                                                                     PAGE


though the first had not been implemented.

I was aware from the CCTV monitor of the increasing number of

supporters   in Leppings Ln and in those waiting to enter the ground.

Whilst examining the situation outside I visually made an assessment

from the Control Box of the way in which the ground was filling and

asked Superintendent MURRAY for his assessment of the situation,

bearing   in mind the crowd outside and the space inside at this time.

This was about 2.30pm (1430) and he said that with half an hour to

kick off we should get them all    in on time.

About this time I asked Superintendent MURRAY to clarify with me the

circumstances under which we would consider delaying the kick off.

We had previously agreed that if there was an identifiable problem,

e.g. a serious    incident, accident on the motorway or fog on the

Pennines which would prevent large numbers of fans arriving on time

we should consider a delay as opposed to those who had been brought

to the area within a reasonable time but had chosen not to enter the

ground as soon as possible.

I took the view that at this time,    with all the information

available,   there were no grounds to delay the kick off.

Between 2.30pm (1430)   and 2.40pm (1440)   the crowd continued to

increase and I monitored the Liverpool fans on the Spion Kop and

actions being taken by officers there.

I examined the situation at the Leppings Ln End of the ground from

the CCTV monitor and saw the increasing crowd situation.

I was aware that action was being taken to increase the number of

officers at this location as horses and reserve serials were being

directed to assist by Control Room personnel.

In addition, a tannoy message was being relayed to the crowd outside

at the Leppings Ln end to ease back and not to push forward against

the turnstiles.
                                                                        PAGE   5


About 2.40pm      ( '1440) the radio developed a fault and there were

obvious communication difficulties.

A request was made for a Communications Officer to attend and repair

the fault and he arrived almost immediately.

He restored communications and we were able to contact officers once

more.

The crowd was continuing to increase at the Leppings Ln end

turnstiles, and Superintendent MARSHALL asked for POL PC BUXTON to

attend with the Land Rover which is equipped with a public address

faci 1 ity--

In addition,      at 2.44pm (1444),   I requested a traffic mobile to assist

and for continued tannoy messages       to the crowds outside to relieve

the pressure upon the turnstiles.

The crowd had by now increased considerably and fans were beginning

to climb over the walls      into the ground.

The crowd situation was changing rapidly,        it had increased in

numbers. Superintendent MARSHALL had asked for a vehicle with a P.A.

facility,      tannoy messages were being relayed to ease pressure. Mounted

officers were having difficulty and extra resources had been sent to

assist.

I looked at the situation on the Leppings Ln terrace and saw there

was room for supporters,      and considered because of the deteriorating

situation whether or not to delay the kick off to ease the

difficulties*       I looked through the Control Box window to my right

and saw a half circle of press photographers on the pitch at the

players5 tunnel,      obviously waiting for the teams to appear, and at

that point , whilst considering the position,       the first team ran out

onto the pitch*

I considered this option had been removed.

I looked at the CCTV camera trained on the service road at the
                                                                            PAGE


Leppings Ln end showing Gate C, and a Mounted officer was in some

difficulty as his horse was being jostled by the crowd.

It was about this time,      -14,47pm that the first message came over the

radio from Superintendent MARSHALL with a request to open the gates.

I again looked at the CCTV monitor showing Gate C and my immediate

reaction was not to do this.        We had supporters outside the ground

who may not have tickets,       some may be   drunk   or worse for drink,    they

were not co-operating with the police         nor responding to our

requests,     To open the gates and allow them into the ground would

defeat our objective that no one would get in without a ticket,              who

was drunk or may be carrying weapons.

The crowd situation was extremely difficult           and this was an unusual

request,    and whilst   I was considering the position,      assessing the

space    in the ground and looking at the CCTV monitor,        I saw Gate C

burst open and supporters enter the concourse area at the rear of the

Leppings Ln stand and terrace.

I remember thinking,      'the gates's open anyway*s       I had not given

permission,    but at that point a Mounted Officer retrieved the

situation and closed the gate.

A further message came over the radio from Superintendent MARSHALL to

open the gates and he used words to the effect that if the gates were

not opened someone was going to be killed.

This was an urgent message which conveyed to me by the tone of his

voice that this was a serious situation and was a demand rather than

a request.

The previous thoughts crossed my mind once again about monitoring and

control of supporters entering the ground.

It was a serious step to take.        I looked at the CCTV monitor - there

was crushing outside,      supporters were climbing over the turnstile

walls,    officers were under    pressure.
                                                                          PAGE


On the inside of the ground there was space in the terrace,          there was

space on the inside of the turnstiles          in concourse, and room to ease

the situation*

If the gates were opened there may be crushing and injury on the

inside but the mesaage I was receiving from the outside was that

unless I opened the gates and eased the pressure people would be

seriously injured or killed*

Superintendent MARSHALL is a very experienced police officer and if

he wanted the gates opened,       which is not normally a consideration,

then the situation must       be very serious indeed,

Whilst    I am considering    the position and considering the options

Superintendent MURRAY said to me,

"Mr DUCKENFI ELD, are you going to open the gates?"

I remember standing there and saying my thoughts aloud so that

others,    if they heard it, would realise it was a considered

decision.      I said,

"If t h e r e ’s likely to be serious     injury or death I ’ve no option but

to open the gates - open the gates".

Superintendent MURRAY passed this message.

About this time I heard another radio message from soneone who said

words to the effect,

"It does not matter whether you open the gates or not, this           g a t e ’s

going in a n y w a y " ,

I was advised this was       *A ’ Gate.

I took this to mean that crowd pressure on a particular gate was such

that it was in danger of collapsing and people being injured.

My immediate reaction to that was that if a gate collapsed due to

crowd pressure those immediately in front of the gate would fall and

no doubt be injured.       In addition,    those falling may be trampled upon.

The gate to the North Stand was opened and I immediately issued
                                                                       PAGE     8


instructions for extra resources to be deployed into the area to

provide cover on the landings and prevent a pitch invasion from non

ticket holders,

I also asked for manpower for the perimeter track to monitor the

pos i t i on .

I watched the Leppings Ln terrace        intently for any developments as a

result of the gates opening*

In taking stock of the situation I looked at the West Stand and it

appeared full*      The centre two pens of the terrace appeared to be

almost full,     but there was still some room at the front of the two

wing pens.

I saw a PC opening either Gates 3 or 4 from the Leppings Ln terrace

onto the perimeter track and a handful of people were coming out on

to the track and walking towards Gate 1.        They seemed to be calm and

appeared to stand aimlessly on the track without any direction*           The

policewoman standing at Gate     1* who was only a few yards away, was

totally unaware of their presence.        There was   room at the front of

this   pen and there was a need to open this gate and allow these

people into this part of the ground.        Chief Inspector McROBBIE who

was in the Control Room in civilian clothing went down on to the track

to assist her and draw her attention to what was happening*

There was an increasing number of people coming onto the track from

Gates 3 and 4 area.      Mo radio traffic was being received and I was

still unable to assess the situation but considered there may have

been a pitch invasion or that people were being taken out for re­

location in the two wing     pens.

I asked for Superintendent GREENWOOD to go to Leppings Ln end and

find out what was happening.         I saw him coming from the players’

tunnel,     walking along the perimeter track towards the Police Control

Boxand the incident behind the Leppings Ln end g o a l .      An increasing
                                                                    PAGE


number of people were now being helped on to the track through the

gates and some were climbing over the perimeter fencing on to the

t rack *

The supporters from this   location were now spilling on to the track

and were standing on the grass behind the touch line.       I was not

aware of any radio messages but then saw Superintendent GREENWOOD

standing head and shoulders above the people at the back of the goal,

presumably standing on an advertising hoarding and waving his arms.

He was waving his arms and crossing them as he did so, which

indicated to me he wanted the game to be stopped.       I agreed the game

should be stopped and I sent Superintendent MURRAY from the Control

Room on to the track to stop the game.     I then saw Superintendent

GREENWOD running onto the pitch to stop the g a m e »   Superintendent

MURRAY then returned to the Control Room.

I saw officers trying to indicate to fans in the rear of the pens to

move back.

People we re spilling onto the pitch ad were moving further across and

towards the centre line*    I was still unaware of any radio traffic

and exactly what the problem was , but some people were now sitting on

the pitch*

The Assistant Chief Constable   (Operations) Mr JACKSON joined me in

the Control Sox and asked for an appraisal    of the situation.    I was

unable to give an accurate account of what the situation was other

than a possible pitch invasion which had resulted in us stopping the

game.

The Assistant Chief Constable   (Operations) went to the pitch and a

short while later returned*

Superintendent MURRAY was asked to return to the pitch and try and

get it cleared so that from the Control Sox we could assess the

situation,   especially as now people appeared to be on the pitch who
                                                                              PAGE


were injured.

An ambulance was requested but I was unaware of any radio message

asking for this and was still relying on my visual assessment of the

s ituation.

It was difficult to assess as the crowd was flowing onto the pitch in

increasing numbers,      police officers were present, and there was a

movement of supporters towards the centre              line-

I M/as concerned about the c r o w d      situations a difficult situation was

developing and we could not control the pitch.                 It was necessary to

form a cordon to continue segregation and further assistance was

requested to help with the increasing injuries I could see in front

of me from the Control Box.

I called for    ’Operation S u p p o r t ’ *    In turn I was aware of a request

for a fleet of ambulances,         and as a result of that message I became

aware of the gravity of the situation.

I then began to give instructions              to the Control Room staff in

conjunction with Mr JACKSON for the implementation of the Major

Disaster Plan.

I asked for the Casualty Bureau to be set up, to warn hospitals of

the large number of injuries,          any doctors     in the ground to Leppings

Ln goal for deployment,        off duty police officers to be called to duty

and rendezvous at Hammerton Road Police Station*

Mr JACKSON supplemented my requests, asking Superintendent TORR to

attend in respect of the Casualty Bureau? Detective Chief

Superintendent ADDIS to attend to co-ordinate the investigation side

of the enquiry.      I asked for a Counselling Service and Victims

Support Staff*

I was aware of a request for wire cutters and following on from that

the attendance of the Fire Service.

Whilst all this was taking place I asked POL PC BRYAN to continue
                                                                    PAGE   11


broadcasting for calm among the supporters and for them to clear the

pitch so we could determine what people were injured and where

because the fans were milling around and obstructing the view.

Advertising hoardings were by now being broken up for use as

stretchers and injured people were being removed across the pitch

towards the exit by the police room.

Fans were distressed and a single ambulance was in position behind

the Leppings Ln goal.

The Fire Service cleared a gangway near the Police Control Box in

front of the South Stand to remove casualties from the ground by a

more expedient route.

Superintendent MURRAY returned to the Police Control Box and told me

that there were many injuries and possibly some fatalities.

I was   later requested to attend the Board Room with Mr JACKSON,    the

ACC   (Operations) and left Superintendent MURRAY in charge of the

operation in Police Control.

We attended the Board Room within the Directors Lounge at the

football   club and saw officials of both clubs and the F.A.

I was asked for an assessment of the situation and I told them there

had been a serious   incident and a large number of casualties.

I was told by one gentleman that he had seen two dead supporters on

the pitch.

I related the situation as I saw it at that time, and that in my view

the game would have to be postponed but that I did not want this

communicating to the crowd.

The reasons for this were that they may create an additional      public

order problem - at this state I did not have the manpower to deal

with this - and it was essential that all the casualties and dead

were removed from the area before any announcements were made*

It was agreed the game would be postponed but that no one in the
                                                                             PAGE     12


crowd would be told until        I gave permission.       Mr JACKSON reinforced

this,    and we very quickly left.

I returned to the Police Control        B ok   with ACC   (Operations) and

continued to monitor the situation.            The rescue was progressing, we

now had fatalities and a temporary mortuary had been arranged in the

gymnasium,

I was approached in the Police Control Box by Mr CLOUGH and Mr

DALGLEISH.

They asked for an assessment of the situation and whether or not the

game was postponed.         I told them it was my intention to postpone the

game but asked them not to tell anyone and gave my reasons for this.

Mr CLOUGH left but I asked Mr DALGLEISH to make an announcement to

the Liverpool        fans for calm and to bear with us for the time being.

It is my view that this was beneficial to the operation.

The rescue operation progressed and eventually,             about 4pm (1600)   that

afternoon,        there was only one casualty awaiting transportation to

hospital and the point had arrived where the crowd could be told of

the situation.

I asked for an assurance that all trains and buses were available to

transport the supporters away from the ground, all available officers

were patrolling the streets and that we were ready for the crowd

d is pe rs al .

The final ambulance        left the ground and an announcement was made by

Superintendent MURRAY to the crowd that the match had been postponed

and they were asked to leave.

The crowd applauded the decision and left without any major difficulty.

After the ground and the surrounding area had cleared Chief

Superintendent MOLE arrived and took over responsibility for the

ground.

I left the Police Control Box with Mr JACKSON and walked across the
                                                                                     PAGE


         pitch to the Police Room*      We met with Mr BARRON, a Director of

         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,         and passed comment about the

         disaster - he was in tears but praised the police operation*

         I left the football ground for Force Headquarters about 5.15pm

         (1715),    together with the Assistant Chief Constable        (Operations) Mr

         JACKSON and Superintendent MARSHALL.

         On arrival at Force H e ad qua rt er s, about 5,45pm (1745),       I met with the

         Deputy Chief Constable, Mr HAYES,         and in due course the Chief

         Con st ab l e.

         About 9pm (2100)    that evening   I left Force Headquarters for Niagara

         Police Sports Ground to meet the Minister for Sport who M/as due to

         arrive by helicopter to meet with the Chief Constable.

         He arrived about    10*20pm (2220) and I escorted him to the football

         ground where he met with Mr- WRIGHT,        the Chief Constable.

         I was present M/hi 1st h e toured t h e   ground and met w i t h   the   press«

         When he concluded his visit to the football stadium,           I escorted him

         to Force Headquarters to see Mr HAYES,         the Deputy Chief Constable*

         I returned to the Police Sports & Social Club at Niagara and

         counselled oficers who had been involved in the events that afternoon

         i>/ho had just retired from duty.

         I eventually returned to Hammerton Road Police Station and went off

         duty at 1.30am (0130).

            At 10am (1000) Wednesday 22 March 1989 (220389),             I attended a

            planning meeting at Hammerton Road Police Station,             chaired by Chief

            Superintendent MOLE to discuss the organisation of the F.A Cup Semi

            Final tie between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs.

            On Monday 27 March 1989 (270389),           I was promoted Chief Superintendent

            of 'F' Division and assumed responsibilities for the forthcoming

            football match.

            In the period which followed leading to the semi final             I liaised with

            Assistant Chief Constable         (Operations) Mr JACKSON regarding the

            ar rangements.

            At 10am (1000) Wednesday 29 March 1989 (290389),             I had a meeting with

            Superintendent MURRAY,         Chief   Inspector BEAL and Inspector SEWELL in

            my office to discuss the operational order and our arrangements for
                                                                       PAGE


the day and to ensure these were progressing satisfactorily.

At 2.30pm (1430) on 10 April    1989 (104089)   I had a meeting with the

Sector Superintendents,   representatives from *D' Division, Road

Traffic and British Transport Police to discuss our ar ran gements.

At 2pm (1400) Wednesday 12 April    1989 (120489),    I held a press

conference at Hammerton Road Police Station and met with media

representat i ves.

At 10am (1000) Friday 14 April    1989 (140489),    I held a pre match

briefing   in the, North Stand at the Hillsborough Football Stadium for

officers of Inspector and above.     See Appendix    'A'.

The purpose of this was to give a full briefing to supervisory

officers and then for them to have the opportunity to examine their

respective areas of responsibility and familiarise themselves with

the ground.

I conducted the main briefing with Superintendent MURRAY,         and then

the respective area Superintendents held their own briefings,          in and

around the ground,   dealing more specifically with their needs, and

requirements of their areas of responsibility.

At 10am (1000) Saturday 15 April    1989 (150489),    I briefed the

officers on duty for the semi final tie in the North Stand of the

Hillsborough Football Stadium.     See Appendix    *B' «

It M/as a shortened version of the previous d a y ’s briefing.

Superintendent MURRAY, Detective Sergeant CHARLESWORTH and Inspector

SEWELL also dealt with matters such as Emergency Evacuation

Procedure, Crime Intelligence,   and Administration.

On completion of the briefing    I spoke with officers      in the ground and

toured the area.

I re-entered the ground about 1. 15pm (1315) and in due course made my

way to the Police control Box about    1.50pm (1350) and liaised with

Superintendent MURRAY.
                                                                       PAGE


We left a short time later to see the referee and linesmen to advise

them of our emergency procedures.

They were on the pitch and eventually they left and w e       followed them

to the o ff ic ial ’s room.

On leaving there about 2pm (1400) we returned to the Police Control

Box and met with Mr .JACKSON, Assistant Chief Constable       (Operat ions ).

In the Control Box were the regular operators - POL PS GODDARD, PC

RYAN and PC BICHARD.

I had a general discussion with Mr JACKSON about the operation,         which

was progressing sat isfactor i ly at t his stage.    He left a little M/hi le

l at e r.

About 2.30pm (1430), when examining the ground situation,        I noted

that the Spion Kop was almost full with the Nottingham Forest fans,

and that was the general view in respect of their other areas of the

ground.

A number of Liverpool supporters had obtained tickets for the Spion

Kop and were accommodated in the North East part of this section of

the ground.     They were segregated from the Nottingham Forest

supporters by a line of police officers.

The North Stand for Liverpool supporters was possibly half full at

this time,    the West Stand was filling,   but there was space at the

front and sides of the Leppings Ln Terrace.         I asked for a tannoy

message to be relayed for fans to move forward and spread along the

terrace„

I can recall about this time Superintendent MARSHALL asked for

Leppings Ln to be closed and saw on the CCTV monitor the crowd

situation and a SYPTE double decker bus passing.

I was aware of a crowd build up but traffic was still able to flow

and I questioned in my mind the need for the closure.

At this time there must have been some difficulty in closing the road
                                                                      PAGE


because   I remember more than one request for this to be done as

though the first had not been implemented.

I M/as aware from the CCTV monitor of the increasing number of

supporters   in Leppings Ln and in those waiting to enter the ground.

Whilst examining the situation outside      I visually made an assessment

from the Control Box of the way in which the ground was filling and

asked Superintendent MURRAY for his assessment of the situation,

bearing in mind the crowd outside and the space inside at this t i m e .

This M/as about S.30pm (1430) and he said that with half an hour to

kick off we should get them all      in on time.

About this time I asked Superintendent MURRAY to clarify with me the

circumstances under which we would consider delaying the kick off.

We had previously agreed that    if there was an identifiable problem,

e.g. a serious incident,   accident on the motorway or fog on the

Pennines M/hich would prevent large numbers of fans arriving on time

we should consider a delay as opposed to those who had been brought

to the area M/ithin a reasonable time but had chosen not to enter the

ground as soon as possible.

I took the view that at this time, with all the information

available,   there were no grounds to delay the kick off.

Between 2.30pm   (1430) and 2.40pm    (1440) the crowd continued to

increase and I monitored the Liverpool fans on the Spion Kop and

actions being taken by officers there.

I examined the situation at the Leppings Ln End of the ground from

the CCTV monitor and saw the increasing c r o w d   situation.

I was aware that action was being taken to increase the number of

officers at this location as horses and reserve serials were being

directed to assist by Control Room personnel.

In addition, a tannoy message was being relayed to the crowd outside

at the Leppings Ln end to ease back and not to push forward against
                                                                     PAGE


the turnstiles.

About 2.40pm <1440) the radio developed a fault and there were

obvious communicat ion difficulties.

A request was made for a Communications Officer to attend and repair

the fault and he arrived almost immediately.

He restored communi cat ions and we were able to contact officers once

more.

The crowd was continuing to increase at the Leppings Ln end

turnstiles-, and Superintendent MARSHALL asked for POL PC BUXTON to

attend with the Land Rover whi ch is equi pped with a public address

facility.

In addition,    at 2.44pm <1444),   I requested a traffic mobile to assist

and for continued tannoy messages to the crowds outside to relieve

the pressure upon the turnstiles.

The crowd had by now increased considerably and fans were beginning

to climb over the walls into the ground.

The crowd situation was changing rapidly, it had increased in

numbers, Superintendent MARSHALL had asked for a vehicle with a P.A.

facility,   tannoy messages were being relayed to ease pressure, Mounte

officers were having difficulty and extra resources had been sent to

ass is t»

I looked at the situation on the Leppings Ln terrace and saw there

M/as room for supporters, and considered because of the deteriorating

situation whether or not to delay the kick off to ease the

difficulties.     I looked through the Control Box window to my right

and saw a half circle of press photographers on the pitch at the

pla ye rs ’ t un ne l, obviously waiting for the teams to appear, and at

that point, whilst considering the position,      the first team ran out    .

onto the pitch.

I considered this option had been removed.
                                                                             PAGE


I looked at the CCTV camera trained on the service road at the

Leppings Ln end showing Gate C, and a Mounted officer was in some

difficulty as his horse was being jostled by the crowd.

It was about this time,     14.47pm that the first message came over the

radio from Superintendent MARSHALL with a request to open the gates.

I again looked at the CCTV monitor showing Gate C and my immediate

reaction was not to do this.       We had supporters outside the ground

who may not have tickets,     some may be      drunk   or worse for drink,    they

were not co-operating with the police          nor responding to our

requests.     To open the gates and allow them into the ground would

defeat our objective that no one would get in without a ticket,               who

was drunk or may be carrying w e a p o n s .

The crowd situation was extremely diffi cult           and this was an unusual

request, and whilst I was considering the position,            assessing the

space in the ground and looking at the CCTV monitor,            I saw Gate C

burst open and supporters enter the concourse area at the rear of the

Leppings Ln stand and terrace.

I remember thinking,     'the gates *s open anyway* s       I had not given

permission,    but at that point a Mounted Officer retrieved the

situation and closed the g a t e .

A further message came over the radio from Superintendent MARSHALL to

open the gates and he used words to the effect that            if the gates were

not opened someone was going to be killed.

This was an urgent message which conveyed to me by the tone of his

voice that this was a serious situation and was a demand rather than

a request.

The previous thoughts crossed my mind once again about monitoring and

control of supporters entering the ground.

It was a serious step to t a k e .    I looked at the CCTV monitor - there

was crushing outside,     supporters were climbing over the turnstile
                                                                                            PAGE


M/alls,   officers   were   under     pressure.

On the inside of the ground there was space in the terrace,                            there was

space on the inside of the turnstiles                in concourse, and room to ease

the situation.

If the gates were opened there may be crushing and injury on the

inside but the mesaage I was receiving from the outside was that

unless I opened the gates and eased the pressure people would be

seriously injured or killed.

Superintendent MARSHALL is a very experienced police officer and if

he M/anted th e gates o p e n e d ,   which is not n o r m a l l y a c o n s i d e r a t i o n ,

then the situation must         be very serious i nd ee d.

Whilst    I am cons idering     the pos it ion     and considering the opt ions

Superintendent MURRAY said to m e ,

"Mr DUCKENFIELD, are you going to open the gate s? ”

I remember standing there and saying my thoughts aloud so that

o t h e r s , if they heard it, would realise it was a considered

decision.      I said,

"If t h e r e ’s likely to be serious injury or death I ’ve no option but

to open the gates - open the gates".

Superintendent MURRAY passed this message.

About this time I heard another radio message from soneone who said

words to the effect,

"It does not matter whether            you open the gates or not, this                 gate's

going in a ny w a y " .

I was advised this was        ’A ’ Gate.

I took this to mean that c r o w d        pressure on a particular gate was such

that it was in danger of collapsing and people being injured.

My immediate reaction to that was that if a gate collapsed due to

crowd pressure those immediately in front of the gate would fall and

no doubt be injured.         In addition,        those f a l 1ing may be trampled upon.
                                                                    PAGE


The gate to the North Stand was opened and I immediately issued

instructions for extra resources to be deployed into the area to

provide cover on the landings and prevent a pitch invasion from non

ticket holders*

I also asked for manpower for the perimeter track to monitor the

position.

I watched the Leppings Ln terrace      intently for any developments as a

result of the gates opening.

In taking stock of the situation I looked at the West Stand and it

appeared f u l l .   The centre two pens of the terrace appeared to be

almost full,    but there was still some room at the front of the two

wing pens.

I saw a PC opening either Gates 3 or 4 from the Leppings Ln terrace

onto the perimeter track and a handful of people were coming out on

to the track and walking towards Gate 1.       They seemed to be calm and

appeared to stand aimlessly on the track without any direction.          The

policewoman standing at Gate 1, who was only a few yards a w a y , was

totally unaware of their presence.       There was room at the front of

this pen and there was a need to open this gate and allow these

people into this part of the ground.       Chief Inspector McROBBIE who

was in the Control Room in civi1ian clothing went down on to the track

to assist her and draw her attention to what was happening.

There was an increasing number of people coming onto the track from

Gates 3 and 4 area.       No radio traffic was being received and I was

still unable to assess the situation but considered there may have

been a pitch invasion or that people were being taken out for re­

location in the two wing p e n s .

I asked for Superintendent GREENWOOD to go to Leppings Ln end and

find out what was h appening.      I saw him coming from the players"

t u n ne l, walking along the perimeter track towards the Police Control
                                                                    PAGE


Boxand the incident behind the Leppings Ln end goal.       An increasing

number of people were now being helped on to the track through the

gates and some were climbing over the perimeter fencing on to the

track.

The supporters from this location were now spilling on to the track

and were standing on the grass behind the touch line.       I was not

aware of any radio messages but then saw Superintendent GREENWOOD

standing head and shoulders above the people at the back of the g o a l ,

presumably standing on an advertising hoarding and waving his a r m s .

He was waving his arms and crossing them as he did so, which

i ndi cated to me he wanted the game to be stopped.     I agreed the game

should be stopped and I sent Superintendent MURRAY from the Control

Room on to the track to stop the g a m e .   1 then saw Superintendent

GREENWOD running onto the pitch to stop the g a m e .   Superintendent

MURRAY then returned to the Control Room.

I saw officers trying to indicate to fans in the'rear of the pens to

move b a c k .

People were spilling onto the pitch ad were moving further across and

towards the cent re line.    I was still unaware of any radio traffic

and exactly what the problem w a s , but some people were now sitting on

the pitch.

The Assistant Chief Constable    (Operations) Mr JACKSON joined me in

the Control Box and asked for an appraisal of the situation.       I was

unable to give an accurate account of what the situation was other

than a possible pitch invasion which had resulted in us stopping the



The Assistant Chief Constable    (Operations) went to the pitch and a

short w h i 1e later returned.

Superintendent MURRAY was asked to return to the pitch and try and

get it cleared so that from the Control Box we could assess the
                                                                       PAGE


situation,   especially as now people appeared to be on the pitch who

were   injured.

An ambulance was requested but I was unaware of any radio message

asking for this and was still      relying on my visual assessment of the

situation.

It was difficult to assess as the crowd was flowing onto the pitch in

increasing numbers,      police officers were p re sen t, and there was a

movement of supporters towards the centre line.

I was concerned about the crowd situation: a difficult situation was

developing and we could not control the pitch.         It M/as necessary to

form a cordon to continue segregation and further assistance was

requested to help with the increasing injuries I could see in front

of me from the Control Box.

I called for      ’Operation Support".   In turn I was aware of a request

for a fleet of ambulances,      and as a result of that message I became

aware of the gravity of the situation.

I then began to give instructions to the Control Room staff in

conjunction with Mr JACKSON for the implementation of the Major

Disaster Plan.

I asked for the Casualty Bureau to be set up, to warn hospitals of

the large number of injuries, any doctors       in the ground to Leppings

Ln goal for deployment,      off duty police officers to be called to duty

and rendezvous at Hammerton Road Police Station.

Mr JACKSON supplemented my requests,       asking Superintendent TORR to

attend in respect of the Casualty Bureau;       Detective Chief

Superintendent ADDIS to attend to co-ordinate the investigation side

of the enquiry.       I asked for a Counselling Service and Victims

Support Staff.

I was aware of a request for wire cutters and following on from that

the attendance of the F ire Service.
                                                                                PAGE       1


 Whilst all this was t^akTng pTlace I asked POL PC BRYAN to continue

(
'-trroadca^iXng for calm among the supporters and for them -Ho clear the

 pTXch so we could determine what p e o p l e w e r e   injured and w h s r e     ~ '~ 3

 because the fans were milling around and obstructing the view*

 Advertising hoardings were by now being broken up for use as

 stretchers and injured people were being removed across the pitch

 towards the exit by the police room.

 Fans were distressed and a single ambulance was in position behind

 the Leppings Ln g o a l .

 The Fire Service cleared a gangway near the Police Control Box in

 front of the South Stand to remove casualties from the ground by a

 more expedient route.

 Superintendent MURRAY returned to the Police Control Box and told me

 that there were many injuries and possibly some fatalities.

 I was later requested to attend the Board Room with Mr JACKSON,                 the

 ACC   (Operations) and left Superintendent MURRAY in charge of the

 operation in Police Control.

 We attended the Board Room within the Directors Lounge at the

 football   club and saw officials of both clubs and the F*A*

 I was asked for an assessment of the situation and I told them there

 had been a serious incident and a large number of casualties.

 I was told by one gentleman that he had seen two dead supporters on

 the pitch.

 I related the situation as I saw it at that time, and that in my view

 the game would have to be postponed but that I did not want this

 communicating to the crowd.

 The reasons for this were that they may create an additional              public

 order problem - at this state I did not have the manpower to deal

 with this - and it was essential that all the casualties and dead

 were removed from the area before any announcements were m a d e .
                                                                        PAGE   12


It was agreed the game would be postponed but that no one in the

crowd would be told until       I gave permission.   Mr JACKSON reinforced

this, and we very quickly l eft.

I returned to the Police Control Box with ACC        (Operations) and

continued to monitor the situation*        The rescue was progressing, we

now had fatalities and a temporary mortuary had been arranged in the

gymnas ium.

I was approached in the Police Control Box by Mr CLOUGH and Mr

DALGLEISH.

They asked for an assessment of the situation and whether or not the

game was postponed.        I told them it was my intent ion to postpone the

game but asked them not to tell anyone and gave my reasons for t h i s .

Mr CLOUGH left but I asked Mr DALGLEISH to make an announcement to

the Liverpool fans for calm and to bear with us for the time being.

It is my view that this was beneficial to the operat ion.

The rescue operation progressed and eventually,        about 4pm <1600) that

afternoon,       there was only one casualty awaiting transportation to

hospital and the point had arrived where the crowd could be told of

the s ituat ion.

I asked for an assurance that all trains and buses were available to

transport the .supporters away from the ground, all available officers

were   patrol1ing the streets and that we were ready for the crowd

d isp er sa l.

The final ambulance left the ground and an announcement was made by

Superintendent MURRAY to the crowd that the match had been postponed

and they were asked to le av e.

The crowd applauded the decision and left without any major difficulty*

After the ground and the surrounding area had cleared Chief

Superintendent MOLE arrived and took over responsibi1ity for the
                                                                                PAGE


I left the Pol ice Control B o k with Mr JACKSON and walked across the

pitch to the Police Room.       We met with Mr BARRON,          a Director of

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, and passed comment about the

disaster - he was in tears but praised the police operation.

I left the footbal1 ground for Force Headquarters about 5 . 15pm

<1715), together with the Assistant Chief Constable                (Operations) Mr

JACKSON and Superintendent M A R S H A L L .

On arrival at Force Headquarters,        about 5.45pm <1745),         I met with the

Deputy Chief Co ns t ab le , Mr H A Y E S , and in due course the Chief

Constable,

About 9pm <2100) that evening I left Force Headquarters for Niagara

Police Sports Ground to meet the Minister for Sport who was due to

arrive by helicopter to meet with the Chief C o n s ta b le .

He arrived about    10.20pm (2220) and I escorted him to the footbal1

ground where he met with Mr WRIGHT,            the Chief Co ns ta b le .

I was present whilst he toured the ground and met with the press.

When he concluded his visit to the footbal1 stadium,                I escorted him

to Force Headquarters to see Mr HAYES,            the Deputy Chief Constable.

I returned to the Police Sports & Social Club at Niagara and

counselled oficers who had been involved in the events that afternoon

who had just retired from duty.

I eventually returned to Hammerton Road Police Station and went off

duty at 1.30am <0130).

           1   am a Police Constable       in the South Yorkshire Police stationed at         ?F 5

           Divisional Headquarters,        The Common, Ecclesfield.     I have worked

           in this same Division since joining the Police           in 1969,

           I have, during this time,        been involved in the policing of numerous

           football matches of all categories at Sheffield Wednesday Football

           Club.     For about the last five seasons,       I have worked in the ground

           control    located between South and West Stands and have done so for the

           majority of games,       including all those of a major n at u re .     This

           control boK overlooks the terraced area of the West Stand*

           At S.00am       (0800) on Saturday 15 April    1989 (150489),   I commenced duty,

           with PS 616 GODDARD,      at the Ground Control at Sheffield Wednesday

           Football Club in relation to the Liverpool FC -v- Nottingham Forest FC

           Cup Semi Final*       At the time I carried out certain routine checks,

           including tests of the public address system.            Work was being carried
                                                                               PAGE       ;


out on one of the speakers at the rear of the Ground Control by an

engineer.      At his request I tested that speaker.        All appeared in

order.      The cameras    in the Control Room were switched on.       A fault was

found on the camera to the Leppings Lane/West- Stand end (mounted near

electronic score board).         The engineer attended and attempted to

rectify this fault.        Only a partial   improvement   in quality was

obtained and he informed me that this was the best he could achieve on

that day.      The work took probably in the region of an hour.



During this time        I also spoke to Operations Room at     ’D 1 ’ Control.        I

advised that we were now operational and checked with them regarding

any reported movement of supporters or any problems or points of

interest there may be.         There was no information of any consequence.

During this time        I also spoke with Mr LOCK,   the C l u b ’s Security

Advi se r .



About 9.30am     (0930) officers started to arrive in the North Stand and

at 10.00am     (1000?   the briefing commenced in that     location.



At about this time we were joined in Control by Police Constable 1370

BICHARD.



After the briefing was completed Superintendent MURRAY attended at

Cont ro1.



My duties that day were to mainly deal with the telephones and the

public address     system in the Control Room.       Sergeant GODDARD was to

operate the radio, although these jobs would obviously overlap during

the day.      There are three telephones     in the Control Room.      One is a

direct outside     line;    the second an internal SWFC telephone;      the third
                                                                         PAGE        3


is an extension from Hairroerton Road Police Station*       The public

address system is an extention from that operated by the DJ in the box

below Police Control.      The Police have the facility to override any

t ra n s mission„



The ground for this purpose is divided in North, South, West and the

Hop (East?-      Facility is provided to speak separately to spectators         in

each of these sections or all at the same time.         There is also

facility to speak to the rear of these Stands and turnstile areas.



About 11.15am (1115)     the majority of the serials were out from the

briefing/meal*      A message from Mr LOCK was passed to the effect that

although turnstiles were not due to be opened until        12 noon (1200),

operators were starting to arrive and some turnstiles        could be opened

at police request.      About this time were the first reports of

supporters arriving by mini bus and cars and attending at local           pubs.

The majority of reports at this stage related to the Nottingham

s up p orters.



At 11.20am (1120)     radio checks were commenced and at this time the

majority of serials were     in location.    Coaches were also starting to

arrive.    There were numerous   radio and telephone messages being passed

at this stage.



In addition to the radio and Ground Control operating on Channel 25

there was a Club radio giving direct        contact to Club officials.     A VHF

set monitoring channel     1 which was the designated channel for traffic

involved in this operation was monitored by PC BICHARD.            Further sets

were available to monitor     channel   19, the designated channel for CID

personnel and also channel 35 which was for        *F1" Control.
                                                                         PAGE




As time progressed radio and telephone traffic           increased and although

it became very busy it appeared about normal for this type of

occasion.      The vast majority of telephone calls       received by me were

from Police Officers-      However, a number of members of the public

spoke to me regarding complaints?

Some of these were?

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

These calls are related to the behaviour of football supporters at

local pubs.

The complaints related to supporters urinating in the street,

footpaths,     gardens and other locations    in view of residents and the

public,   together with other drunken behaviour         including throwing beer

glasses and bottles.

These messages were passed to police mobiles in the are for attention

where possible.

As far as I recollect the main pubs involved were?

1.   The Horse and Jockey

2.   The Middlewood    Tavern

3.   The Pheasant

4.   The Fox

5.   The White Horse

The vast majority of telephone calls from the public would have been

made to Police H ea d qu a rt e r s, Operations Room,   or more probably to

local Police Stations.      Members of the public would not normally

telephone direct to the Police Control.
Spectators had been entering the ground steadily throughout this

period.     As far as I recall there had been no major     problems at any

trunstiles    involving delays or queues.

About E . 10/2.15pm (1420/1415)    I looked around the ground and could see

that the Spion Kop and the South Stand were almost full.        These were

the areas allocated to Nottingham supporters.

The North Stand, West Stand and Leppings Lane area,, allocated to

Liverpool    had still not been filled and there was still     room in all

sections of these areas,

From about 2.30pm (1430)      number of spectators were growing outside the

Leppings Lane end of the ground*       Telephone and radio traffic was

constant at this t i m e „   Radio transmission/reception was very poor.       A

civilian member of the Communi cat ions Department,, Andy SANDERSON

attended at Ground Control.

He informed me that he had been monitoring the radio and that there

wase a fault and it was necessary to change the radio.        A 'Back Up

Set' was in position in the Control Room.       Andy disconnected the

original    set and connected the spare set.    I ’m not sure what he did

but throughout this procedure messages were still        being received for

the majority of the time, although it was not possible to transmit.



The change over took only a few minutes,       possibly three or four.     I

recall that the hand telephone set would not work when Sergeant

GODDARD tried to use it.       Andy checked the radio,   there was still no

response*     I told him to switch on the talk through facility*      When

this was done radio communications were restored by the use of a

personal    radio on talk through as an alternative to the hand set*

Throughout this time queues had continued to build up in Leppings

Lane*     It was then that I saw that the turnstiles,    the approaches and

Leppings Lane itself were full of supporters as far as I could see on
                                                                          PAGE    6


the monitor.



In my experience I have         never seen so large a crowd gather so quickly

so late outside       these or any other turnstiles.

I would estimate the numbers as several thousands.           In addition to

this very few people appeared to me to be entering the ground through

the turnstiles.        Radio messages were still    constant and at this stage

there were reports of crushing outside the turnstiles.           Extra serials

of officers and       mounted section we re deployed.   A message was   passed

over the public       address   system for the information of Liverpool

supporters at the turnstiles.         I cannot remember the exact words I

used but I asked them to stop pushing;         that people were being crushed

and that there was still        room in the ground for them to be

accommodated.

This I repeated several times.           It apparently had no effect as reports

were still being made over the radio of the seriousness of the

situation at the turnstiles.



Whilst this was taking place messages were still being passed by

telephone       into the Control Room.



In a dd it io nr a number of supporters were climbing directly in front of

the Police Control from the terraces of the Leppings Lane end into the

uncovered seating area of the South Stand.          This was dealt with by

officers nearby deploying along the front of Ground Control as best as

possi b l e .



During this time requests were made for the turnstiles/gates to be

opened due to the crushing.
                                                                           PAGE        7


"C5 gate was at this stage opened,      although by whom I do not know.            A

number of supporters entered through the gate before a mounted officer

held back the crowd and the gate was then closed.         A short time later

a radio message was received,       I believe from Superintendent Marshall,

directed to Control with words to the effect of        ’Open the gates or

someone will be k i ll e d" .   I believe that a further similar message was

also passed by a different officer to the same effect, although I

cannot be certain of this or who the officer was.



Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,      who was   in control,   then gave the

instruction that the gates be opened and the message subsequently

passed over the radio.



The gates were    opened and a large number of the crowd entered*            The

problem at the    turnstiles was then apparently eased.        I cannot be

certain of the    exact time this happened but I would estimate       it     at

shortly before    the match was due to commence.

I did not particularly notice the game start but play was under way

when supporters started climbing the fences onto the perimeter track

at the Leppings Lane end.

Officers were on the perimeter track and were apparently trying to

prevent this.

There were no more reports of any problems or any indication visible

to me as to why this should be occurring.        The numbers climbing over

increased and large numbers were spilling onto the playing area.

Instructions were given for the match to be stopped.           This was done by

Superintendent Greenwood going onto the pitch and speaking to the

refe r e e .

A number of officers had been deployed into the Leppings Lane end from

other parts of the ground.
       *

                                                                                     PAGE   8


            The gates     in the perimeter track were opened and more spectators were

            coming onto the pitch*         I only became aware of the true seriousness of

            the situation when a radio message was received to the effect that

            there were people dead*        This appeared to me to be some minutes after

            the game had been stopped.



            Instructions were given for operation support to be called-         All

            available manpower was directed to the Leppings Lane end of the

            ground-      By this stage radio/telephone messages to Control were

            constant*.    Large number of supporters were on the pitch and it was
X
            impossible to see if any injured persons were amongst them.



            On instructions from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,        I passed

            messages over the public address sytem, asking that the playing area

            be cleared,     that supporters move on to the perimeter track,    in order

            that the injured may be given assistance.



            The operation to remove the dead and injured from the ground went on

            for some time u n t i l , when the last ambulance had cleared the area, the

            crowd were informed over the public address system by Superintendent

            Murray that the game would obviously not continue.         The crowd slowly

            left the ground.      Throughout all this time I remained in the Control

            Room and did so until our job was completed at 10.30pm <2230)«

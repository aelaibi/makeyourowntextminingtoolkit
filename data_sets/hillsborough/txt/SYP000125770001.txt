            VERY FEW POLICE OFFICERS AND THOSE THAT WERE THERE WERE UNABLE TO
            DEAL WITH THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THERE. I COULD SEE OFFICERS TRYING
            TO KEEP CLOSED A BLUE GATE, BUT WHEN THEY TRIED TO PASS THROUGH A

EITHER FANITED OR BEEN INJURIED, THE GATE WAS OIPENED AND THEY ALL JUST
RUSHED THROUGH THE POLICE COUOLD NOT STOP THEM. ONCE THEY WERE THROUGH THE
BLUE GATE THEY WERE AT THE TURNSTILES AND THEN TO THE RIGHT OF THE TURNSTILES
THAT WERE THE GATE WAS OPENED, I WAS CAUGHT UP IN THE CRUSH AND WAS JUST
PUSHED ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE.
ALL I COULD SEE ONLY I GOT INTO THE GROUND WAS A TUNNEL, DOWN THE TUNNEL I
COULD SEE THE PITCH AND THE PLAYERS ON THE PITCH, I COULD NOT SEE ANY
STEWARDS OR SIGNS TO GO ANYWERE ELSE I THERE FORE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS THE
ONLY WAY ONTO THE TERRACES.
I WAS BRUISED AND BATTERED AND ONCE INTO THE CENTRAL AREA I WAS PUSHED
FCM&RDS AND TO THE RIGHT, I GOT TO THE FENCE AND WAS LIFTED OVER ONTO THE
S l W TERRACE.
WHAT HAPPENED THEN ON THE PITCH I'M SURE YOU KNOWN ABOUT IT WAS JUST ;LIKE ON
THE TELEVISION, WITH PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND NOT REALLY ORGANISED BUT TRYING TO
DO WHAT THEY COULD THOUGH SOME DID JUST STAND THERE AND DO NOTHING I'M SURE
THEY WERE IN A DAZE.

SEE INJURED PEOPLE ON THE FLOOR. AT ABOUT 1515HRS I ONLY SAW ONE AMBULANCE,
THERE WAS NO BACK UP EMERGENCY SERVICES. BACK UP POLICE ARRIVED AND WERE
DEPOLYED ALONG THE HALFWAY LINE ON THE PITCH. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO
CLEAR THE TUNNEL AND THEN THE TERRACES - THE POLICE WERE BADLY DEPLOYED. NO
COORDINATION FROM THE PARTS OF SHEFFIELD FA, THE POLICE AND EMERGENCY

                LEPPING LANE ENTRANCE I MUST STRESS THAT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OR
                STEWARDS TO DIRECT THE FANS INTO THE DIFFERENT PENS. AT 2.20
                PENS 3 AND 4 WERE FULL. AT ABOUT 2.30 THERE WAS AN ANNOUNCMENT

FROM INSIDE THE GROUND ON THE TANOY SYSTEM ASKING LIVERPOOL FANS IN PENS 3
AND 4 TO MOVE FORWARD AS MORE FANS WERE ENTERING THE GROUND.THIS WAS
IMPOSSIBLE AS IT WAS FULL AT THIS STAGE.PEOPLE WERE PUSHING AND SHOVING EACH
OTHER AND MY OPINION WAS THAT THERE WAS TO MANY FANS IN THE 2 PENS ALREADY AT
THIS STAGE. JUST BEFORE THE KICK OFF THERE WAS A SURGE OF FANS FORWARD AND I
WAS PUSHED FROM MIDDLE OF THE TERRACE TO NEAR THE FRONT.PEOPLE WERE GETTING
CRUSHED AT THIS POINT. I THEN SAW A FEW FANS TRYING TO OPEN THE GATE NEAR TO
THE PITCH BTN PENS 2 AND 3. THE OPENED IT AND 2 GOT OUT BUT THEN IT WAS SHUT
AGH3.NOBODY COULD MOVE IN ANY DIRECTION. THEN THE GATE AT THE FRONT OF PEN 3
OR 4 WAS OPENED AND SOME PEOPLE MANAGED TO GET OUT

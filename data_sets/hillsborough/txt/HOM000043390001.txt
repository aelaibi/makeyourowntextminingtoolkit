      Dear Mi and Mrs Chuich

                      H ILLSBOROUGH STEERIN G G R O U P M EM B ER S

            Thank you for your letter o f 2 July about the Hillsborough Steering G roup
      members. Your letter has now been passed to me for reply.

               I am sorry to hear o f the difficulties you are experiencing in trying to resolve
      this legal matter, but regret I am unable to help you. As my colleague Ms Beazley has
      previously explained to you, it is not possible for the Court Service, the Lord
      Chancellor or indeed any Government official to intervene or comment on, any case
      that is or has been before the courts. This is certainly not through any lack o f concern
      but to uphold the principle that the judiciary are independent o f Government and its
      administration.

                As you are aware from Ms Beazleyâ€™s letter o f 18 April, the Court Service
      Customer Service Unit can only investigate complaints about the administration o f the
      courts, but unfortunately could not investigate the matters to which you are referring
      as it is not the responsibility o f this department.

             I regret that I cannot help you but have placed your letter on file.

                                          Yours Sincerely




                                          Alison Couch

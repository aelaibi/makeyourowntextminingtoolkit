TAYLOR REPORT: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW OFFENCES AND PENALTIES:

(i)     TICKET TOUTING OFFENCE           [70]
(ii)    OFFENCES IN THE GROUND           [71]
(iii)   USE OF ATTENDANCE CENTRES        [72]
(iv)    USE OF ELECTRONIC TAGGING        [73]



The Home Secretary has seen your submission of 11 July.

2    He considers that there is a case for a ticket touting
offence limited to football, where there is a particular
problem of people travelling without tickets and then causing
trouble.  He is also in favour of tjie three proposed offences
in the ground, which he considers would have a greater
deterrent effect than the one offence of disorderly conduct.

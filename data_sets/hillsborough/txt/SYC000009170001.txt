          Your letter has eventually reached me        at ray office in m y   new   position in
          Cheshire.

          1 have read your letter and note your disappointment. However, it would be
          inappropriate for me to make any comment about what you! have to say. Clearly
          you feel very strongly about what has gone on and therefore I would suggest
          that you raise yoyr concerns with your Solicitor in order that he can take up
          any unanswered issues at the forthcoming Inquests which I think you will know
          b y now commence in Sheffield on Monday, 19 November 1990.

     H ow can  the D.P.P. come   to this  decision  after  all  the
     evidence you collected ?   Nearly 16 months on and nothing to
     show for it, or d o n ’t ordinary people get Justice in this

          Our Ref: Hills/Sol/4/SLP/JT                                        17th September 1990



          Dear Sirs,

          Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


          If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
          of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
          on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
          due course.

          I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
          evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
          coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
          inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

          Subject to the Coron ers’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
          under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
          witnesses who wish to give evidence.   I am at present engaged in considering
          this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

          Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
          to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
          appropriate details of any witness or witnesses w hom you would like me to
          consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

          May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
          attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

          I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or.
          names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
          to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

          I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
          heard from you by the end of Seopgatber I will assume you have no names to
          submit.

          Yours faithfully.

We confirm that Mrs Joynes has asked us to attend the Inquest on her behalf

are able to attend with our client.

We await hearing from you.

                     Thank you for your letters dated 21st August, the contents of which we note
                     We trust you have now received a reply to your earlier letter dated 10th

                     writer's absence from the office on holiday.

                     We note all that you say and have advised our clients accordingly.

Mrs. G. Joynes,




Dear Mrs. Joynes,

Ret NICHOLAS PETER JOYNES No 45

I have had a letter from Lees Lloyd & Whitley in responee to one of
mine to say that they are acting for Nicholas's parents but that you are
separately represented.
I do not know whether this information is correct or indeed if you are
represented whether your representation extends to the inquest.

It is of course a matter entirely for you whether you are represented
or not but it would be helpful if you could please let me know whether
such representation exists and whether or not you wish me to keep in
touch with these solicitors in connection with inquest matters, or
indeed if you are happy with communications to be channeled through
Nicholas's parents solicitors.
Whilst writing to you I would take this opportunity of mentioning that
because of the involvement of the Director    Public Prosecutions it
will not be possible to resume the inquest for some considerable period
of time and there will be a delay before I am in a position to say
anything definitive about this.


Yours sincerely.

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990*

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,

                  Dear Sirs,

                  Re:      Nicholas Peter Joynes (deceased)
                          Our Client - Gillian Joynes_________

                 We are instructed by the above named in relation to whom you have been
                 dealing direct in relation to the adjourned inquest.

                  She has telephoned us and asked to write to you in relation to the
                  Coroner's decision to take evidence only as to matters arising before
                  3.15pm on the day of the disaster .    *■

                 Nicholas Joynes was pronounced dead at lfi.OOhrs, at the temporary mortuary
                 in the gymnasium at Hillsborough stadium by Dr. Byrne.          Our client
                 therefore wishes evidence to be given as to what happened upto, say 4.15pm
                 or 4.30pm.         client understands that the adjourned inquests are in
                 relation to^why/the disaster occurred and what its cause was but it seems
                 to us thatCa^uestion of how the emergency services coped on the day and
                 whether more lives could have been saved is of relevance and therefore
                 evidence should be given in relation to matters arising upto 4.15pm or
                 4.30pm at the very least. We trust that our client’s views will be given
                 due consideration.
9L'
                 In addition, we understand that you now have a list of doctors that
                 attended the dead and injured during the afternoon. Our client has been
                 given to understand that her late husband was attended to by a student
                 doctor and our client therefore wonders whether you have available in your
                 possession information in relation to student doctors which may assist our
                 client in tracing the particular doctor who treated her late husband.

                 She does of course know the identity of the doctor who pronounced her
                 husband dead but she would very much like to meet the student doctor who
                 treated her husband*

Dear Mrs Joynes
Thank you for your note regarding Mr Thomas. I think Mr Beechey
has had a word with you and probably the best way of dealing with
your concern is to try and see whether we can get Mr Thomas to
come along tnd give evidence.
Yours sincerely

         Mrs.   P. Joynes,




         Dear Mrs. Joynes,

         Thank you for your letter of the 16th of October.  You will of course know
         that the Inquests themselves are resuming on the 19th of November 1990.

         I have arranged to meet some of the legal representatives to discuss
         procedural aspects on the 30th of October 1990.  I think it might help you to
         understand the purpose of that meeting if I enclose a copy of the letter
         which I wrote to those legal representatives who I contacted.

         You will see that I specifically provide in that letter that members of the
         bereaved families can attend, subject to the capacity of the court.

         However, I must make it clear that there will be no opportunity to ask
         questions nor will there be any evidence taken at this meeting.  You will
         remember that the Inquests are being conducted with a Jury and clearly the
         evidence must be presented to them.

         Yours sincerely,

  Dear Ken

  Re:        HILLSBOROUGH

   I am enclosing our Counsel's copy of West Midlands Composite Album No. 1. As you
   know it is not possible to obtain further copies of these from the West Midlands
   Police, and I would therefore be grateful if you could provide me with four full
   copies of this Album, which will have to be done on a print from print basis.

   In the meantime, I look forward to receiving a copy of the BBC's Compilation Tape
   from the Inquiry, which is now required as a matter of urgency.

  Many thanks for your help.

   Yours sincerely

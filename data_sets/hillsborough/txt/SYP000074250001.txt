Serial       7 was    del e g a t e d    to the S pion Kop entrances                  to    carry out

sporadic       checks      for weapons,           etc,    carded         by fans.          Inspector     Calvert

carried out his own briefing                      on thj^ k o p and        instructed that we             could

not    carry out the duties a p p o i n t e d               but w ould       remain on the kop near                 to

a sterile area kept               for LJivrp^fol supporters.                  This a rea was           taped    off

by red and white             banded taTpe together w ith a serial                          of Officers

dividing       the N ot ti n g h a m Forest           suppo r t e r s    from the      'sterile area*.

(In this area there are                   no escape gates            or footpaths away from the

sp i k e d fencing and          raised above           ground      level     at one end).



As    time    passed the        crowd began           increasing and at 2 .1 0               pm (1410 hrs)          I

saw four youths making                   their way along          the kop and selected a

v i ewpoin t      in front      of the Liverpool              supporters.            This was a

deliberate,          intended,          selec t e d   position       by the youths.             They

im m e d i a t e l y began     chanting and jeering at the Liverpool                            supporters.

           •Police S e r geanj i W p l e s           was with a further         unit    of O f f icers   cordoning

           off    the sterile area.              I a p p r ai se d him of the      situation       in relation to

           the youths         concerned.         I returned t^TViy unit and decided to prevent

           further       trouble and a s e r i o u y ^ i t u a t i o n    developing,        that the youths

           w ould    have to be spoken t j/and               removed from the ground.              All   four        were

           arrested       for being          drt^^: at a sporting        event and taken to the Police

           room.



           On writ i n g      out      the   report    for the eventual         atten d a n c e at Court,       I

           heard a message              from an Officer       o ve r ^tj>e^pe r sonal     radio    requesting         for

           the gates to be op e n e d at the Lec>fmigs Ln end.                          A second    request was

           made and the order was                given/^to open the gates.               I did not hear any

            radio messages after               tha/c for some     time,    until       I returned to the            kop.
CAT        On entering         the kop afx the          rear from the      large       central    stairway      I saw

            nume ro|s men o pep^y u r inating agai n s t                fences all -along this footpath,

            in f u l l V v i e w x ^    w omen and others at t e n d i n g      the match.        The youths         were

            too    numerous      to warr a n t any ac t i o n being        taken against          them and a

            stream of urine was               c onst antly flowing along          this gangway.          The    stench

            of urine and alcohol               was    ever   present.     The    crowd had       increased      to

           such an extent              that we had to force        our way along the f o o tpath to our

           allotted        position where            the Liverpool      fans were       segregated.       There was

           a strong       smell        of alcohol      on the kop terraces.



           On     reaching     the are a m e n t i o n e d we were       d i r e c t e d by Inspector Calvert

           to a t t e n d at the oppostie              end of the kop and         remain there.          I could

           see    that all was           quiet and that we w ould have             been more gai n f u l l y

          were      seating        pee pie aioefund the            running    track    behind the Liver pool              goal

          than the          crowd overflowing.



          We     returned to the             location with           Inspector Calvert and               I saw that       the

          players        had      left    the field and the game had been stopped.



          N o t t i n g h a m Forest       fans were not aware               that an area had been a l l o c a t e d

          to the L iverpool               fans,    and a large number were a ttempting                      to make

           their way          into what         they   considered ample           standing      room.       This

           obviously          caused great         confusion and           c e rtainly annoyance           to a number

           of spectators.                We s tr en gt he ne d the       cordon between the separate

           fact,i.ons of fans.



          At     this     point     it still       a p p e ar ed    to be a crowd overflow               problem with

           the    odd     injury from what a p p e a r e d to be over c r o w d i n g .                  I was    not aware

           that a n y thing         drastic, had taken place.                  Only when       I saw the odd

          s tr etcher with what a p pe ar ed to be a body being                             carried on it that             the

           se r i o u s n e s s   began to unfold,           an d then only slowly as the                  picture

          developed.              The moo d      of the    crowd on the kop was a n t a g o n i s t i c            towards

           the Liverpool            fans.        It a p p e a r e d that     they too were unaware               of the

          s e r io u s n e s s    of the     incident.

had taken           place was      developing,            I i n stigated the           release         of fans         from

the sterile area              through       the N o t t i n g h a m supporters.                 This a c t i o n was

successful           due to a m a jo ri ty of the s u pporters accepting                               the

due     to any noise          being     created by th e / c r o w d because                they were all

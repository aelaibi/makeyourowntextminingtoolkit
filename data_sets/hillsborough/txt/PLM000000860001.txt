      CALCULATIONS OF..COLLAPSE.LOAD OF CARRIER 124A BY PROFESSOR R SMITH.
      DEPARTMENT OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING. .UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD
      Dr Nicholson has asked me to send yo u this facsimile transmission of the draft
      report prepared by Professor R Smith on the. collapse load of Barrier 124A.
      Please accept my apologies for the Quality of the diagrams in the report, but
      the originals were not very clear.
      As you will see from the contents of the report, particularly Fig 2, Professor
      Smith assumed that the tube formir]|g the upper rail of Barrier 124A had a
      uniform wall thickness and considered thicknesses of 4 mm, 2 mm and 1 mm.
      RLSD has calculated the Plastic Section Modulus of the tube each end of spans
      2/3 and 3/4 where failure occurred. The results of RLSD's calculations are
      shown on the four sheets following Professor Smith’s report. Numerical
      integration, assisted by computerised calculation of the areas associated with
      each 2 mm elemental strip, was u s e d .to determine each Plastic Section Modulus.
      The basis of our calculations was the cross~section shown on each sheet, this
      being re-constructed from the measurements made at each end of the tubes which
      had formed spans 2/3 and 3/4. This work was undertaken whilst Professor Smith
      was making his calculations of collapse load.
      RLSD then calculated a uniform wall thickness which corresponded tc. to each
      Plastic Section Modulus using 60 fflm for the external diameter of tx»e tube, as
      assumed by Professor Smith. The results of RLS D ’s calculations are summarised
      below.

      I have calculated the uniformly distributed load to cause plastic collapse of
      span 3/4 (with clamped ends} as being 10.91 kN/m, using the expression in
      Section 6 of Professor Smith’s rejsort, with the appropriate Plastic Section
      Moduli for Ma and Me from the Table above. I calculated the collapse load to
      be 8.78 kN/m if span 3/4 is simply supported at end 4.
       Almost all of Span 3/4 of Barrier 124A can be subjected to a crowd depth uf
       7 m, or 18 steps of the terrace. 1 used a formula suggested by my colleague
      _ _ _ _ _ _ , and subsequently developed by Professor Smith to that shown in
       Appendix 2 of his report, to calculate the packing densities to cause span 3/4
       of Barrier 124A to collapse, I used the parameters adopted by Professor Smith
       and calculated that 8.2 persons/sq m on 18 steps behind barrier 124A would

        cause span 3/4 to collapse if both ends were clamped. If end 4 were simply
        supported then a packing density of approximately 6.6 persons/sq m on 18 steps
        behind Barrier 124A would cause span 3/4 to collapse. HSE s estimates of the
        packing density behind barrier 124A were 8.1 persons/sq m (2nd row)and
        7.6 persons/sq m (3rd row].

     Collapse loads have been calculated for the spans 2/3 and 3/4 of hairier 12 4A
     which^Ss broken down during the Hillsborough Stadium incident. If the
     barriers had been of the original thickness at the supports, loads of 2.2 and
     1.6 times the test load of 6kN/m would have been needed to collapse the barrier
     at spans 2/3 and 3/4 respectively. If the wall thickness had been reduced to
     Uttcti, these ratios fall to 1.4 and 1.25 x test load.

      These figures have been compared with barrier loads generated from a 'leaning
      crowd' irtodel. In Unm thick condition for a crowd of measured density -8/m ,
      the barrier would have been broken dcwn by a crcwd of a p p r o x i m a t e l y 5.8m depth
      behind the barrier. A crowd of sate 7m depth existed directly behind span 3/4.
      I f t h e crowd density of 5.4/m2 is assumed, the same tube would have required
      about 7.5m of crtswd to break it dcwn. It's survival would have been marginal.

       X       Introduction
               During the incident which occurred at Hillsborough Stadium on
               15 April 1989, two bays of barrier 124A, Fig 1, were broken dran. This
               r e p S a t W s to calculate collapse loads for the barrier and to conpare
               these loads with the pressures likely to have been generated by the crov. .

               Examination and irechanical testing of the broken b a r r i e r by staff of the
               Health and Safety Executive ( H S E ) W , revealed that the horizontal tube
               had been manufactured from wrought iron and was probably over sixty y
               old   The upriqht supports were mad© frcsn mild steel. The tube was
               attachS to^the upripits by straps, underneath which considerable corrosion
               of the tube had occurred.

       2       Material properties
               Tensile tests from 2 specimens taken frcsn the tube gave average tensile
               strength of 366MPa, 0.2% proof stresses of 259MPa and an estimated elastic
               limit of l50MPa. For calculations of plastic collapse loads a flow stress,
               calculated as a mean of the tensile strength and 0.2% proof stress, equal
               to 312.5MPa was used. A value of Youngs Modulus of 190GPa was assumed.

        3      fi&ction properties of the barrier tubs

               Second moments of a*sa, I for a tube of outside diameter D and wall
               thickness, t were calculated from the formula.

                Fully plastic moments were calculated as a product of the flow stress fly

                Values of these functions are calculated in Appendix 1. pie original tube
                had an outside diameter of~6pityn and an approximate wall thickness of 4mm.

           4    F.lafltic deflections under test loading

                The elastic deflection at the centre of a beam of length L, built    at
                both ends and subjected to a uniformly distributed load w, is given by
                wLy384EI.v^ If the ends are simply supported, the deflection is
                increaseed by a factor of 5.r
                For a span between supports (L) of 2.2m, subjected to the test loading of
                6kN/m, a figure prescribed by the "Green Guide” ' t a central deflection
                of 6.9mm is obtained. If the ends are free, the deflection increases to
                34. Siroti. The deflection observed from actual test records correspond more
                closely to the fixed end condition. In the calculation which follows, the
                central span (2/3) of barrier 124A has been treated as having fixed ends.
                The outer span (3/4), probably nearly approximate to this, but for
                comparison, calculations have been repeated treating end 4 as simply
                supported.

         For the span 2/3, the clairping m£8n£rits      WL^/12. First yield will
         i-Y-y-HTT when these moments equal 2-CyI/D. If the estimated elastic limit of
         the material (150MPa) is assumed, then first yield corresponds to 3. 4kN/n\,
         or just over half of the test load. 0.2% proof stress gives a first yield
         load of 5.9kN/m. Subsequent loading up to test loads of 6kN/iii will be
         elastic because of the strain hardening capabilities of the material.

     6   calculations of plastic collapse loads

         Hie wall thickness of the tube under the straps at 2, 3 and 4 was found to
         be much reduced by corrosion. Hie reduction in thickness was not uniform
         round the circumference; calculations of the exact fully plastic moments of
         the as-measured sections are continuing. Hie following calculations are
         based on the plastic moments of the original tube (wall thickness 4nm) i and
         values for uniformly reduced wall thickness of 2 and num. Using the
         measured flow stress (312.5MPa), and Appendix 1, the following fully
         plastic moments were obtained (OP constant 60mm):

           evidence, together with the bent shape of the tube after the incident,
           supports the view that barrier failure occured by plastic collapse of the
           tube. If prior collapse of the legs had taken place, the tube wuld not
           have been bent in the manner which was observed.

           A irtodel of the build up of crwd pressure due to spectators leaning forward
           to obtain a better view has been develcped, see Appendix 2. Figure 2 shows
           the barrier forces generated by crcwds of densities 10, 8 and 5.4/m on a
           terrace of step height and width matching those of the site of the
           incident. The test load of 6kN/m corresponds to a crowd of approximate
           depth 6.2m behind a barrier if the density is 5.4/irf. This reduces to a
           crowd of depth of 4.2m if the density increases to 10/itr. Density
           measurements taken from photographs have given a density of 8.11m behind
           barrier 124A and 7.5/m2 behind beirrifcr 149.

           Bracketed values for the collapse loads of tubes of 4, 2 and imm have been
           added. The upper value corresponds to both ends clamped (Span 2/3), the
           lower value to one end clamped,./$he other sinply supported (Span 3/4). For
           a density of 8/m , the approsdmate'tolljjp3® loads for 4, 2 and 1mm tubes
           correspond to 7.2, 6.4 and 5.8m of crowd. Since the Span 3/4 of barrier
           124A was unprotected by barrier 136, a crcwd of 7m was able to exert
           pressure on this part of the barrier. Given the approximation of the crowd
           loading model, these figures adequately explain the collapse of the
           barrier. If the crcwd had been restricted to 5.4/m , then the depths
           needed to collapse the 2 and 1mm thick tubes are 8 and 7.5m, which are just
           in excess of the depths whidl existed and indicate survival of the barrier
           perhaps by a very small margin.

     For the person immediately behind the barrier, if the barrier is at the push
     height, then clearly Pa would be transmitted to the barrier. In general the_
     barrier is lower than this, and the push is probably transmitted to the barrier
     by berriing at mid-height for the few nows of people just behind the barrier.
     If this were not so, the person at the barrier would be subjected to a large
     turning moment. The exact details of this force feed to barrier height are not
     yet clear, but for this purpose it is assumed that Pn , where n is the
     number of steps behind the barrier in question.

     If the step width is w and the crowd density N/m2, then we obtain the
     force/unit length of the barrier as:

                   F/unit length - N w mar H ain 6 /   (   l + _h

              At     11.15 myself               and     PC    2127 Smart              took        up     our a l l o t e d p o s i t i o n ,     this

              was     Penistone            Road        junction          with Bicketon                   Ro ad.

               1 stayed            at    that     position          all       day,      from         1 1 . 15am    to   approximately

              5.00pm when                I made        my way       to    the N o r t h S t a n d .

              At     the      start       of     my     duties,          at     11.15amthere               was     very    few      f a n s of       any

              supporting                team     to    be     seen.

              At ab out            midday        fans        started          to a r r i v e .       Al l f a ns   were      in     good spirits

              with      no     hint       of     trouble           at    all.

              S o o n after             midday      I n o t i c e d rts&ny m o r e               fans    arriving.           To     me   they

              seemed          to    be    going        in any, -d ir e c ti o n w i t h                Liverpool        fans      walking        from

              the area o f th e g round towards C l a y w h ee 1s d i r e c t i o n .
                        ?'                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                                           R33Q

Many    fans          were        asking           if    there          were        pubs     open       and where          they      were.

I also       noticed              fans        of    both          p e r s u a t ion       having        no    tickets       and      asking

where       they       could            get    them.

At    ahout        I E . 3 0 pm         1 noticed             a    I a t of         f a ns w e r e      car ryi ng        dri nk »     I      saw

four    youths           in       particular                 who     each       h a d a six            pack    a pie c e .       Another

group       each       had a S            litre          plastic             bottle        of     cider       each.

There       were       also         a    few       f an s     who       were        definitely           drunk       and were         being

helped       by       friends.                But       s t il l     the      rnood w a s         good.

At    about       2 . 5 0 p m PC          2127          left       for       h is    meal        break       planning        to r e t u r n        at

about       3.30pm           so     I could             have         a meal          break.

At    about       3.00pm            1 heard             a huge          roar        from     the       crowdinside           the g r o u n d ,

so    1 assumed              th e       game       had       started.

At    this       time        the        streets          were        still          full of        people,        t hi s    t i me    in a

hurry       to    get        to     the       ground.

from    my       position               I could          see       the       other        en d    of    the    streets        which         was

also    patrolled,                  and       I could             see    all        the    fans        were    rushing        to     get      to

the    ground,          this            being       th e      Leppings              Lane     entrance.

AT, a b o u t     3.30pm            I realised                something              was     not       right    at    the     g r o u n d as
                                                                                                                                      1-


the    crowd          were        quiet        but       I did          not    k n o w w h a t.

Shortly          after        Liverpool                 fans       were       coming         up    to m e      and    saying         things

like    "How          does        it     feel       to       be a m u r d e r e r ? "             The    fans     were      obviously

very    upset          and        in te a rs .

At    one    point           I could           see       a    lot       of    ambulances               leaving       the     ground,          from

the    p o in t       Penistone               Road       passes          the        ground,        about       Gate       0 on     the

attached          map,        all        of    these          ambulances              were        speeding        away with           their

driver,          a t t e n d a n t s » giving                 heart          massage.

I then       realised               soinethi ng              serious          had     occurred           and was          about      to     leave

my    post       to    go a n d          assist          when        a Forest             fan a p p r o a c h e d     me    and      asked

what    had       happened.                   1 told          him       "I    don* t k n o w           because       we    haven't          been

                                                                                                                                                R350

             At    this      point        we     were      joined        by a n       upset      Liverpool              fan who          said    there

             was      hundreds           dead       in t h e r e      and     then had          a go at        the       Forest          fan.        I

             stopped         them        from       fighting.            This       changed       my     decision             to    go a n d     I

             decided         to      stop      in    case       something           similar        occurred.

             This      s o rt       of   occurrence             happened        regularly             afterwards              until

             approximately 4 . 15pm.                        I assumed           by     that      all     the       rival       fans       had

             di s per sed.

             We    were      instructed              to    return        to    th e    North      Stand        at       about       5.00pm..

             At    5.20pm           we w e r e      debriefed about                 the    incident           and       it w a s     only       then         I

             new what           had      h a pperted.

             At    6.00pm           I mealed         at    Claywheels           and       at    7.10pm        we       were    transported

             b ac k    to D o n c a s t e r         where       at 7 . 4 5 pm       I went       of f    duty.

            my     FEELINGS

             Afterward              I was      angry^at          my    decision           to    s t a y at     rny post            and    not    go

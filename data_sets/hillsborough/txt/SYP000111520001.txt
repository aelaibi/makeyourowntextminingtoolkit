                Briefing in North Stand.         Duties to include security of car park and

                BBC units situated in Leppings Lane car park, turnstiles                 19-22 for

                t hie Mo 11 s . fans.   Barriers were erected and manned by Police officers

                at two points creating a sterile area.                One barrier at the end of

                South Stand at a point level with turnstile E, the second at the side

                of blue steel gates near to main entrance to Leppings Lane.                        Once the

                19-22 turnstiles opened there was a steady flow of N o t t s . Forest fans

                all of which were very well behaved.

                At approximately 2.30pm I had cause to escort two Liverpool fans from

                the sterile area back to the Leppings Laag__ajnd.               I remained at the

                Leppings Lane end due to the large amount of fans.                 I was in company

                with other officers.        I assisted with the crowd control. The CMjrw^

                seemed to be rnc^eas^jmjy^ry^rUb^r^               he second.      The fans were very

                aggressive and a^s iv e, towards officers.             I could see fan^^^Jivbing

                over turnstiles and o v e r ^ h e   top    the gates.          The whole crowd

                seemed to be pushing forward continually.               Mounted Police arrived
                                                                                                            PAGE          Z

           from the sterile area and attempted to push the fans back.                                 The

           horses were being pushed about and hurled abuse and anger at by the

           fans.     The fanS^, the                  of whom a £ £ ^ @i | Ny y^ e , were nuns^^^cnrse

           f^jim^     The horses managed         for a short time to move the fans clear of

           the blue gates.         It then became apparent that there was some sort of

           trouble to the front of Leppings Lane as most of the Mounted Section

           moved in that direction leaving one Mounted officer,                            the fans were

           again pushing towards the blue gate.                   There was continual abuse from

           the fans,       A short time later recall the bljaer^ja^tes^being cyjMjrned^

m          The f c n ^ ^ ^ ^ T g ^ ^ ^ n e ^ a ^ ^ t e ^ ^ ^ ^ e r fans were pushing,      rujirungu      fighting

           c<aM^UjK^UTr^Dugh.       Again anger and abuse was directed towards Police

           officers.       One fan was pulled from the crowd with two cans of beer.

           Others asked if they could stand with us as they were frightened.                                          I

           have no recol lection ^of^an^^^ewands^che^ckijTg^^i^^^s, I s a ^ n e ^ of

           gates were eventually, after a short time,                    pushed together to allow

           only one/two fans through             at a time.       Fans were filtered through by

           the Mounted Section and told to have ticket? in full view for

           examination.        I was not aware of any stewards.

                 gangway a n d onto the pitch.      I could see a lot of f a i i ^ r u n m n g about

                 on the pitch shouting.       I immediately ran to where I could see farts

                 c^imb^Kj over the metal     fencing of the West Stand terracing directly

                 behind the goal.     I ran towards the fencing.          I could see fans being

                 lifted up onto the second tier of terracing.             When I reached the

                 fence I could not believe what I saw.          I sa\j^na^es; of people, young

                 her eyes were closed,     it was obvious she was dead.            As I continued to

                 look I realised What had happened and s a w m o r e p e o p l ^ q u a s ^ d

                 against the fence                                , s^m^j^^nj^ov^Tng, o|||y^s

                 crying out for help others screaming         in shock,     other f a n ^ w e r ^ j j j a O k ^ g

                 over other people.      The fans were still      climbing over the metal fence.

                 I ran to where a gate had been opened I could see fans being crushed

                 as they tried to      escape through the gate.        I went back to the fence,

                 climbed onto the advertising boards and began to pull people up from

                 behind the fence.       I recall a supervisory officer pulling me and

                 shouting   "Tell them to get back away from the fence".                 I started to

                 shout to the fans as instructed.         Numerous fans then ran to the left

                 side of a dividing fence and started to shout abuse at me saying "Why
            IH
     ,(6         don't you do something.       People are dying you bastards."                "It's your

                 fucking fault you bastards."         "Why don't you get in here."               I shouted
Qei'AlU          until   I was hoarse.     I went back to the fence,        it was horrific,             I

       At        could not get over the fence,        I couldn't get into the terracing to

                 help and people were dying in front of me.            I went back towards one
{^     (J
        tJfi     of the gates I could see Police officers inside the terracing being

QfJO             pulled back,    pushed and abused as they tried to climb over the

                 dividing fence.      I could see bodies being passed over the fence,                        some

                 were dead,   Some almost dead others badly hurt.             I began to help to

                 carry the bodies onto the pitch,        other officers taking over.                 I
                                                                                      PAGE         '

helped another Police officer carry two women who appeared to be OK.

I attended to both of them until an ambulance man arrived and another

Policewoman.       I again went back to the fencing and continued to help

to carry people out.          I was continually pushed out of the way by fans F

who by this time were helping the Police with the injured.                         I heard a

supervisory officer stood nearby shout get all the fans back off the

pitch to make room for the injured.                I turned and attempted to move

wandering fans towards the            centre of the pitch again coming up

against anger and abuse.            I can remember seeing other Police officers

trying to resuscitate people who were dead.                   I again went back to the

fencing by which time the terracing was clearing.                     There was still

bodies at the front.          I can remember seeing a young girl

approximately       1h-~ 17 years squashed against the fence again,                blue, her

eyes open,                                                  she was still      clinging to

the fence with her right hand, her face turning a pale yellow colour

again she was dead.          I tried again to get through the gate I was this

time elbowed out of the way by a fan.                 I d o n ’t know how long all this

took to happen,       it seemed like a life time.              I then noticed most of

the fans walking on the pitch begin to run towards the                      •Hop'' end of

the pitch where the Notts. Forest fans were.                    My initial thought was

"Oh my god,       if they get to them the same sort of thing is going to

happen over there'.          I set off running and began to pull the Liverpool

fans back.        They were very angry and abusive,             the fans were then

cordoned off by a line of Police officers across the centre of the

pitch.     I can remember seeing ghc^^KyjjyjjJjyy^s whilst             I was ijj^the rro^st

of the incident standing and t a k U i ^ ^ h ^ t o ^ r a p h s , o n e j i a ^ s t o o d at^ the

When all the fans had left the stadium,                 I Walked back towards the

terracing and saw the blue barriers that had giv*n way.                        The pressure
                                                                                     PAGE   5

         must have been unimagineable.      They looked like two pieces of twisted

         pipe cleaners.

         There is much more that I can remember but it is very jumbled and

         comes back or»ly as flashes in my mind and I cannot remember at what

         point it happened.      Iwill never as   longas I live forget the      sight

         that met my eyes as     I reached the fence,   the    feeling of being useless

         and very frustrated     because I could not    help   the people who were

         dying in front of me.

     11 DIVISION - 1AGKENTH0RPE, »B* GROUP



     I arrived on duty at Hackenthorpe Police Station at 8*30 a.m. on Saturday 15th April, 1989

     I was assigned to Serial 5 with other officers, SGT Hodgetts.      Conveyed to Hillsborough

     football ground.   Briefing in Worth Stand*    Duties to include security of car park and

     BBC units situated in Leppings Lane car park, turnstyles 19-22 for the Notts fans*

     Barriers were errected and manned by Police Officers at two points creating a sterile

     area.   One barrier at the end of South Stand at a point level with tumstyle E, the

     second at tie side of blue steel gatesnear to main entrance to     Leppings Lane* Once

     the 19-22 turnstyles opened there was a steady flow of Notts Forrest fans all of which

     were very well behaved.


     At approximately 2*30 p*su I had cause to escort two Liverpool fans from the sterile

     area back to the Leppings Lane endt     I remaned at the Leppings Lane end due to tie large

     amount of fans*    I was in company with other officers IK I assisted with the crowd

     control.   The crowd seemed to be increasing in numbers by the second.    The fans were

     very aggressive and abusive towards Officers*     I could see fans climbing over turn­

     styles and over the top of the gates.    The whole crowd seemed to be pushing forward

     continually.   Mounted Police arrived from the sterile area    and attempted to push thefans

     back.   The Horses were being pushed about and hurled abuse    and anger at by the       fans.The

     fans, the majority of whom, arrived late were mostly worse      the ware for drink.    I was

     informed by word of mouth that the 'kick off had been delayed       for 15 minutes,       this

     message was ssLayed to the fans.   The horses managed for a short time to move the fans

     clear of the blue gates.   It then became apparent that ihere was some sort of trouble

     to the front of Leppings Lane as most of tie mounted section moved in that direction

     leaving one mounted Officer, the fans were again pushing towards the blue gate.       There

     was continual abuse from the fans.    1 short time later recall the blue gates being opened*

     The following scene was terrible, fans were pushing, running fighting their way through

     the gates like a stampeed, people were being carried through.      Again anger and abuse

     was directed towards Police Officers.     One fan was pulled from the crowd with two cans

     of beer.   Others asked if they could stand with us as they were   frightened.   I have no
,*       ‘                                                                                        iI
                                           -   2   -


' recollection of any stewards checking tickets, I saw one of tie stewards stood flat against

     a wall to avoid being injured,    The gates were eventually, after a short time, pushed

     together to allow only one/two fans through at a time.         Fans were filtered through by

     the Mounted Section and told to have tickets in full view for examination.          I was not

     aware of any stewards.


     At 3 p.m.   I can recall hearing the crowd inside the pitch cheering, I assumed they

     had gone ahead with tie match*   This aggrivated the fans outside*       The atmosphere became

     quite volatile*


     A short time time Inspector Harvey who was stood close by me received a radio message

     that the fans had invaded the pitch, all available officers onto pitch.         Myself, DC

     Fairclough, DC Craigie, Inspector Harvey and other officers immediately ran back towards

     the blue gates in the sterile area, ran past the Police Control Bo o t         nng the gangway

 and onto the pitch.       I could see a lot of fans running about on the pitch shouting.

     I immediately ran to where I could see fans climinfe over the metal fencing of the West

 Stand terracing directly behind the goal.             I ran towards the fencing*   I could see fans

 being lifted up onto the second tier of terracing.            When I reached the fence I could

 not believe what I saw.       I saw masses of people, young people squashed against the fence.

 I saw one girl, her lips were blue, her face was purple, she had vomit around her mouth

 and nose, her eyes were closed, it was obvious she was dead, as I continued to irJyV I

 realised what had happened and saw more people squashed against t he fence horrifically

 disfigured, seme not moving others crying out for help other screening in shock, other

 fans were walking over other people.          The fans were still climinjj over the metal fence.

 I ran to where a gate had been opened I could see fans being crushed as they tried to

 escape through the gate.       I went back to the fence, climbed onto the advertising boards

 and began to pull people up fro® behind the fence.            I recall a supervisory officer

 pulling me and shouting "TILL THEM TO SET BACK AWAYFROM THE FENCE"            I started to shout

 to 'the fans as instructed.      Numerous fans then ran to the left side of a deviding fence

 and started to shout abuse at me saying "WHY DON’T YOU DO SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE DYING YOU

 BASTARDS"       "IT'S YOUR FUCKING FAULT YOU BASTARDS"       "WHY DON’T YOU GET IN HERE".   I shouted

 until I was hoarse.       I went back to the fence it was horrific, I could rot get over the
                                       -   3 -

’ fence, I could’nt get into the terracing to help and people were dying infront of me.

, I went back towards one of toe gates I could see Police Officers inside the terracing
/
  being pulled back, pushed and abused as they tried to climb over the dividing fence*

 I could see bodies being passed over the fence, some were dead, some almost dead others

 badly hurt.   I began to help to carry the bodies onto the pitch,       other officers taking

 over.   I helped another Police Officer carry two women who appeared to be O.K.       I attened

 to both of them until an ambulance man arrived and another Police Woman*        I again wnet

 back to the fencing and continued to help to carry people out.        I was continually pushed

 out of tie way by fans, who by this time were helping the Police with the injured.         I

 heard a supervisory officer stood near by shout get all the fans back off the pitch to

 make room for the injured.    I turned and attempted to move wandering fans towards the

 centre of t he pitch again coming up against anger and abuse*      I can remember seeing ofther

 Police Officers trying to resusitate people who were dead.        I again went back to the

 fencing by which time the terracing was clearing*        There was still bodies at 'he front

 I can remember seeing a young girl approximately 16-17 years squashed against the fence

 again, blue, her eyes open,                                       she was s ti U clinging to

 the fence with her right hand, her face turning a pale yellow colour again she was dead

 I tried again to get through the gate I was this time elbowed out of the way by a fan*

 I don't know how long all this took to happen, it seemed like a life time*        I then

 noticed most of the fans walking on the pitch begin to m m towards the *Kop’ end of the

 pitch where the Notts Forrest fans were.        My initial thought was *0H MY GOD, IF THEY

 GET TO THEM THE SAME SORT OF THING IS GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THERE"        I set off running and

 began to pull the Liverpool fans back they were very angry and abusive, the fans were

 then cordoned off by a line of Police Officers across the centre of the pitch*        I can

 remember seeing photographers whilst I was in the midst of tie incident standing and

 taking photographs, one was stood at tie side of me.       Why was he not helping, they are

 like vultures, picking up the worst photograph they could, it sickened me*


 When all the fans had left the stadium I walked back towards the terracing and saw the

 blue barrieas that had given way*   The pressure must have been unimaginable*      They looked

 like two pieces of twisted pipe cleaners.
There is much more that I can. remember but it is very jumbled and comes back only as

flashes in my mind and I cannot remember at what point it happened.   I will never

as long as I live forget the sight that met my eyes as I reached the fence, the feeling

of being useless and very frustrated because I could not help the people who were dying

infront of me*

entry       into       th^gT'ound.               This       went       on    fftr a p p r o x i m a t e l y       SO    minutes             or

so.        Some    of    the       fans     that, h a d       scaled          the      fence      were       standing             on       the

brickwork          above       turnstiles              9-16       and       some     of     these      were       waving          red

coloured          tickets          to    annoy        the    other          fans     q,ut©ueing        to    enter          the    ground.

At    this       time    I was          pimTejt^Sr^inst                the^ w a l l       and    struggling             to    stand          up

scared       I might          be       pushed     over.           The       pushing        and    crushing             continues             and

I cannot          understand             why      mounted           officers              hav e not b ee n d e p l o y e d             to

Sometime          before       1500.

The    fans       are    now       beginning           to    thin       out     a    little       and       the     crushing               and

pushing          has    reduced          dramatically.                  I    can     see       a moinVted         officer          near

the    dividing          fence          telling        fansto           get     off       the    fence       but       some       are

ignoring          him    and       sti ^_l^<rllmbing              over       into      the      ground.

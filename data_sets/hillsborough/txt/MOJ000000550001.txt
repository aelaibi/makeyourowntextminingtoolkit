                   T hank you for m y copy o f your letter to John M orris o f 9 February’. I have not. o f course,
           seen L ord Justice S tuart-S m ith's report: the following rem arks are based on the com prehensive
           sum m ary in your letter.


                     T he questions in respect o f the publication o f die D P P ’s advice in 1990 and 1997. and the
           lack o f justification for fresh crim inal investigations, are o f course for John, but if lie is content, I
           w o u ld be too.


                    M ore generally, I agree with your conclusions on Lord Justice Stuart-Smith*s work.
           T hough u will undoubtedly be disappointing for the fam ily support group, I support the proposition
           that the G overnm ent response should m ake clear that there are no grounds for a further public
           inquiry', nor for further investigations into the police conduct in respect o f the am endm ent o f
           statem ents. T also agree with your com m ents about the later evidence on the state o f the ground,
           though that is not prim arily a m atter for me.


                   The final point c o n c e r n s the relationship between judicial enquiries into m ajor disasters and
           coroners inquests into the resultant deaths. The recom m endations o f the H om e Office w orking
           group are in m y v i e w entirely sound. W here it is possible to certify that a properly-constituted
           judicial inquiry w o u l d exam ine all the necessary issues, it m e r e l y prolongs and exacerbates the
       . I istress o f bereaved relatives to have to contem plate the p r o s p e c t o f a coroner’s inquest as well. I
'f '   11 therefore a 2rce w «h the proposal to accept the working group’s recom m endations in principle,
           recognising that tine necessary prim ary legislation m ay have to wait for a suitable opportunity.

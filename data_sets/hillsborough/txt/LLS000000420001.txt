STATEMENT OF     ANTHONY DENIS LEIGH




                 LIVERPOOL

                 Telephone C/o Mother


X am 24 years of age, my date of birth being the


I am presently employed as .                  kith

St Helens/ Merseyside.       My average net income is



                                                                      and we have a
 I live at the above address with my girlfriend

 daughter               / who is       ears of age.


 On Saturday the 15th April 1989 I went to watch Liverpool Football Club

 play Nottingham Forrest in the F.A Semi Final which was to take place at

 Hillsborough Football Ground/ Sheffield.

 I had previously purchased a stand ticket but swopped this for a Leppins Lane

 Ground ticket.    With'me were                 and


 We got into the ground about 20 or 30 minutes before the match was due to

 take place.     The kick off time was 3.00pm.. We were therefore in the ground

  somewhere between 2.30 and 2.40pm.      When we .got in we where at the back.       I

  can remember a short time later the teams being lead out by the announcer

  of the tannoy system.

  X recall Alan Hanson's name being called and a shout went up from the

  crowd.    There was a surge and I was pushed, forward.

  I expected the crowd to come back from the surge as normally happens at

  the match but this did not.

  The pressure began to get worse.       People started to panick.    Straight away 1

  realised that this was not a normal crush.          I could not breath and could not

  move my arms.     People around me were gasping for breath.       I began to get

   separated from roy mates.

   Although we started standing at the back" when we first got into .the ground,

   I finshed up at the front and which is clearly seen on the picture in the

   Daily Mirror newspaper on page 13.       This newspaper I have handed to my

   Solicitors.    This shows me at the front.
It was not until I saw the newspaper that I first realised that I was so

close to the front and I also noticed that the friends whom I was with are

shown a good few yards away from me and which is clearly shown on the front

page of the same newspaper.

people in the crowd began to really panick.           There was a young lad.      He was

only young, and he was close to me.          I can recall that he had his head to the

back of the crash barrier and he was blue in the face.           He was just staring.

I managed to get one arm free and I hit him to try and bring him                around. I

remember shaking him.


Suddenly,       a lad next to me hit the bar.     He shouted in pain and said he would

not move.        I was very frightened about the bar.      By     the bar, I mean thecrash

barrier.        I then     hit it.   After that theevents were    blurred.


I recall being lifted up.            I can remember thinking     'I am going to lose my

balls'.     I then remember being lifted up further and found myself dropped onto

the pitch.


I realised that I had hurt my right leg.          I feltsomething in my leg go when        I

hit the -floor.          I was dazed.   I was just lying on the ground.      Ican recall

looking    to    see Bruce   Grobbelaar,   theLiverpool Goal Keeper.         Hewas just

staring at the crowd.         He looked dazed.


I think the game was still going on.         With that# I felt two Police Officers

lift me up.       I heard one say ’get him of the fucking pitch' or ‘get off the

fucking pitch'.


They physically threw me onto           the advertising board aroundthe running track.

I could hear people in the crowd telling the           police that there was problems

and not to be so rough.


I was then picked up by a St John's Ambulance man.         My legs were strapped

together and I was taken away.           I was taken to the first aid roomand from the

there to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.


The staff there were absolutely brillant and just fantastic.           They deserve all

the credit for what they did and for what I myself saw.

but I am in the process of changing G.P's at the present time

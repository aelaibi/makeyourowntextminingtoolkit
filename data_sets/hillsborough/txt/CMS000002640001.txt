    Dear Lord Ferrers,

    You may recall that some eighteen months ago in company
    with my Member of Parliament Stephen Dorrell we had a brief
    meeting.

    We would be grateful if we could now make arrangements to
    have a more detailed meeting with you in light of the Taylor
    Report recommendations.

    We would be quite happy to share a meeting with representatives
    from the Football Supporters Association if you so wish.

    I look forward to hearing from your secretary in the very
    near future with a choice of alternative dates.

    Thank you in anticipation.


    Kind


    Yours sincerely,




   A. M. KERSHAW.

            I am a single man and live at the above address with rny parents.

            On Saturday April      15th 1989 (150489)     I went to Hi 1 lsborough,

            Sheffield,      to watch my team Liverpool     play Nottingham Forest in the

            F »A. cup semi final match.

            I travelled to the qround on a normal scheduled train from

            Station to Sheffield station arriving at about           10.30am (1030).     At the

            Station the Police      put us onto special     buses to take us to the ground,

            we had to pay a pound for this which included the return bus journey

            to the station.

            I h a d *nt got a ticket for the game so I bought one for twenty five

            pounds from a 'ticket t o u t 0 in Leppings Ln»       The face value was siK

            pounds and it was for the Leppings Ln terraces.

            I travelled to the game with a friend of mine named
                                                                                    PAGE     2


w h o ’s telephone number is                               has been seen by the

Police from the inquiry.

When we got off the special           bus which dropped us off near to the

ground,,              and I went into a nearby pub. I can't remember the

name of itbut I remember walking through apark to get there.                         There

was a lot of Liverpool        fans drinking       in the pub,   so much so that the

Landlord closed the doors.            He was    letting people out,     but   not

allowing anyone else in.            1‘ d i d n ’t see anyone drinking   in the streets.

We arrived at the entrance to the ground at about 2.00pm                  C'1400).

There were no queues at that time and we went through the turnstiles

easily.      I c a n ’t rememnber    if there were any Police or Stewards

outside the turnstiles.

Because of       my injuries sustained at the match             my memory of what I did

once through the turnstiles were               very vague. I remember

standing on the terraces at the Leppings Ln and with the goals to my

left.      I remember going off the terraces to get a programme, and 1

remember going to the toilets,           but I c a n ’t remember anything else

about that day.




At the match I lost my beige           "b l o u son 5 sip up jacket with a crew neck

collar and foldaway hood which sips into the collar.

                                                          The cuffs were button

type.      It was waist length with elastic gathering and was made of

cotton.      The lining was s h i n e y .   1 purchased it the day before from

                            I also    lost a pair of size 8,      lace up suede
                                                                              PAGE      3


         shoes,' whith a dot hole pattern.

         I did not go to the match at Hillsborough last year,      in fact that was

         the first time I had visited the ground.

         I have been given details of the    ’Help L i n e 5 and the facilities which

         are offered.

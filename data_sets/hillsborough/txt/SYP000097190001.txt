              relevant.           The    players        were      already        out    on the          ground

              so    there    was    little          scope    to    stop       the   ma tc h .

E N D OF   REPORT
        PROOF OF EVIDENCE TO JUDICIAL ENQUIRY IN RESPECT OF POLICING
          OF F.A. CUP SEMI-FINAL - LIVERPOOL v NOTTS F SAT 15.4.89.

Meeting held to discuss the above in the office of Mr. Hayes, DCC.

Present, ACC (Ops), ACC (SS), Chief Superintendents Mole and Wain, Chief
Inspectors Drabble, Brooke and Bettison.

Mr. Hayes explains purpose of meeting to draft proof of evidence in
preparation for meeting with counsel on Weds. 26.4.89.  Refers to letter
dated 20. 4. 89 which lists six areas for consideration in submitting proof
of evidence on behalf of the Force.

It is anticipated that Lord Justice Taylor will begin hearing eveidence on
15. May 1989 and proof of evidence is required at least two weeks before
enquiry begins.

DCC:-      Refers to letter from Force solicitors Hammond Suddards dated 21
           April 1989 which clarifies many of the points raised in letter of
           20. 4. 89.

            Re. item 1 of that letter CC already written to Mr. Dear
            requesting return of negatives and a copy of the video tape.

           Re. item 2 of that letter CC writing to Mr. Dear requesting that
           where any officer gives a statement a copy might be provided to
           the Force.

            Re. item 3 any orders, logs, etc. maintained in connection with
            the match should urgently be gathered together prior to handing
            over to West Mids. enquiry team. Chief Inspector Brooke to
            arrange.

           Re. item 4 Mr. Woodward QC wants to visit a football match in
           near future. Chief Inspector Bettison to provide list of games.

           Miss Norcliffe from Hammond Suddards is point of reference in
           absence of solicitor Mr. Metcalf. Will be talking with counsel
           later today.

           Chief Inspector Drabble to hold documents from Cleveland enquiry,
           provided by solicitors as exemplar in drafting our own proof of
           evidence. This is to remain confidential.

           Meeting with counsel on Wednesday, preliminary hearings on
           Friday, therefore require the proof by the Wednesday meeting.

           Realise that point 6 on letter 20. 4. 89 - The events which
           occurred - will pose greatest difficulty. What we want is an
           objective statement.
C .S.Wain   Can we speak to the officers involved.

DCC:-       I think so, I'll clear that with counsel.

CS Mole     Mr. Jackson and I are already working through the history of
            policing football matches etc.

DCC:-       Have a look at the Popplewell Enquiry report.

CS Mole:    Point 3 on that letter is also well advanced. Cl Beal has looked
            back over a 15 year period, He's got plans of Hillsborough is
            referred to all major events with police there, our policies as
            regards the green booklet and the Popplewell report. We have got
            details of all the semi-finals since 1948 and we particularly
            comparing the events of 1988/89 which were quite similar.

            I've also done a paper on point number 5. This addresses the
            differences between 1988 and 1989 and how they were organised.
            The bases on which certain decisions were made.   Sergeant Booth
            as prepared comparative maps showing* the deployment of officers
            in 1988 and 1989.

DCC :-      What about item 4.

CS Mole:    That's my background to arranging for the policing of the match -
            i t 's done .

CS Wain:    Were there any discussions with the F.A. before hand.

CS Mole:    No. Telephone calls and we decided it could be done on the same
            terms as last year.  I particularly took note of Popplewell
            recommendation 57 which talks about segregation.

DCC         What about item 2, a task still to be done. Dig out the papers
            relating to the court case with Sheffield United, these provide
            the background to our policing of football matches in the county.


CS Wain:    Mr. Mole's opinions and knowledge are vital in this area.

DCC:-       Whose going to take item 2 on board.

ACC (SS) recommends that Superintendent Nettleship covers that - resolved.

DCC:-       That just leaves item 1.   Chief Inspector Bettison to provide
            that summary.

            What we are about is producing a proof of evidence covering items
            1 - 6 as far as we can by Wednesday.
CS Mole:-     Regarding item 6 Superintendent Anderson is doing some work on
              contingency plans/the casualty bureau etc.  Is that of any help?


DCC:-         No, they don't want that they want an objective over-view
              perhaps showing the chronology of events concentrating on
              Leppings Lane. Any difficulties, for example communications
              problems.

              Incidentally, counsel wants a demonstration of our
              communications set up. Chief Inspector Bettison resolves to
              discuss with Superintendent Parker.

              Miss Norcliffe talked about a simple bland over-view.

CS Mole:-     The timescale of the progress of the match might be relevant.
            . The players were already out on the ground so there was little
              scope to stop the match.

DCC           That is a fact which CS Duckenfield can comment upon, I don't
              think we can speculate.

CS Wain:-     What about the statements that are mentioned in this letter.

DCC:-         No can't have those for Wednesday.

              Counsel wish to know how many statements we are talking about at
              various cut-off points, e.g. Chief Inspector and above,
              Inspector and above and so on. Chief Inspector Brooke tasked
              with discovering those figures and responding to DCC.

CS Wain:-     Wasn't there a questionnaire asking who was involved.


DCC:-         This was to pin officers' locations down and was passed, I
              think, to West Mids.  I also sent out a request that all
              officers prepare an aide memoire.

CS Wain:-     Have we got any o f those?

DCC:-         No, we have some debriefing tapes, there may be some useful
              information in there.

              I have asked two officers from Commercial Branch to prepare an
              interim report on the events as documented on film and tape, you
              ought to have a look at that.

CS Wain:-     But we are being asked for statements.
DCC:-        That's been rescinded.  Counsel realise that West Mids. are
             taking statements, however, CC has asked Mr. Dear to provide us
             with copies of these statements.


CS Wain:-    Item 6 is the area of difficulty we've got to decide how much of
             preliminaries are required.

CS Mole:-    It must start from briefing.


CS Wain:-    There are going to be crucial elements.  I'd like to know how
             deep we are expected to report on those elements.

DCC:-        You ought to join me when I speak to counsel this afternoon
             these are very relevant points that need to be squared.

     RELEASED ME FROM THE BARRIER ENABLING ME SOME RESTRICTED BODILY MOVEMENT.

     Q4S

     DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,    IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT? (BRIEFLY)

     YES, THREE LARGE SURGES. THEY WERE NOT THE USUAL TYPE OF SURGES ASSOCIATED

     WITH FOOTBALL MATCHES.     THEY WERE 3 LARGE CONTINUOUS FORWARD SURGES WITH
                                                                               PAGE

 WAS BEING FILLED BY MORE PERSONS FROM THE REAR.


Q17

 (546

 047

 TO THEIR FEET, EVENTUALLY A GIRL CAME TO VIEW, SHE WAS ASSISTED BY OTHERS IN

        CROWD TO THE REAR AND RIGHT OF HER ORIGINAL POSITION.    I DO NOT KNOW WHAT

 BECAME OF HER.

 APPROXIMATELY 3.40 PM (1540).

 G31

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 THE CRUSH HAD EASED AND I WAS ABLE TO MAKE MY WAY TOWARDS THE TUNNEL..         I MET

 UP WITH          AND STOPPED FOR A CIGARETTE MIDWAY.   IT WAS AT THIS POINT I SAW A

 A TALL BLONDE WPC AT THE ENTRANCE SHOUTING,    "COME ON LADS GET O U T ’   WE MADE
                                                                             PAGE   9

 OUR WAYS OUT AFTER THAT.     I CAN SAY THAT THE ONLY SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION I HEARD

 WERE BY THAT WPC.


G19

 Q32

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 WHEN I WAS IN THE CRUSHED CROWD I WAS ABLE TO TURN AROUND FOLLOWING THE

 THIRD SURGE.   THERE WAS A POLICE OFFICER ABOVE MYSELF.    I SHOUTED TO HIM FOR

 HELP BUT HE APPARENTLY IGNORED ME.     I BELIEVE IT WAS HIS DUTY TO OFFER

 ASSISTANCE TO ANY PERSON.

 G53

^YOU    HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IT APPEARS TO ME THAT DUE TO THE ACTIONS OF SOME OF THE POLICE, THAT THEY HAD

 NOT GRASPED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION.

 053

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON TH          THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS SEEMED TO BE STRIDING AROUND DOING NOTHING WHILE

OTHERS & FANS WERE WORKING EXTREMELY HARD.      ALSO DOZENS OF OFFICERS FORMED A

 CORDON ALONG THE NORTH STAND WHICH WAS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY.      I THINK THAT THIS

WAS POSSIBLE DUE TO A TOTAL BREAKDOWN IN COMMUNICATION & SUPERVISION.

 THE OFFICERS DEPLOYED ALONG THE NORTH STAND MUST HAVE THOUGHT THERE WAS A

PUBLIC ORDER PROBLEM 8, THEY WERE ACTING AGGRESSIVELY TOWARDS FANS IN THE STAND

 BY THEIR PRESENCE.     THEY WERE EVENTUALLY MOVED TO ANOTHER AREA.

Q15

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IT SEEMED INITIALLY THAT THE OFFICERS DIDN’T APPRECIATE THE SEVERITY OF THE

 INCIDENT, THIS WAS BORNE OUT BY FANS WHO HAD CLIMBED OUT BEING PUSHED BACK

 INTO THE PENS.     THEN SUPPORTERS WHO BY NOW WERE ON THE PITCH GRABBING AND

 PULLING AT THE FENCING WERE INITIALLY ST                                _      ‘M

 30 SECS LATER POLICE OFFICERS STARTED HE                                        3PE

 NOBODY COULD GET THROUGH IT BECAUSE OF T                                        ?GE

 SPACES IN THE FENCE THAT COULD ALLOW PEC

 THERE WERE POLICE OFFICERS STANDING AROU                                        i

 DIDN’T SEEM TO HAVE ANY DIRECTION OR LE<6                                           IN

 THAT THEY TOOK NO INITIATIVE.     ALTHOUGH THERE WERE APPROX 12 WHO SEEMED TO BE

 DOING SOMETHING.

 jj^WAS BAD TO SEE OFFICERS STOOD AROUND NOT DOING ANYTHING OR NOT TRYING TO DO

 ANYTHING, AND THE PEOPLE IN THE CROWD BEGAN TO DEVELOP A HATRED OF THE POLICE


G16

 AS IT WAS CLEAR TO EVERYONE WHAT THEY WEREN'T DOING.

 THERE WERE NO TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENTS TO HELP AND WHEN IT WAS LATER USED YOU

 COULDN’T HEAR IT.     THE SUPPORTERS TOOK THE INITIATIVE TO USE THE ADVERTISING

 HOARDINGS TO USE AS STRETCHERS AND EVEN THEN THERE WERE A LARGE NO OF OFFICERS

 STANDING AROUND NOT HELPING.

 I COULDN’T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE WERE SO MANY OFFICERS STANDING ACROSS THE

 ^p>TH OF THE PITCH NOT HELPING, THEY EVEN CLOSED RANKS AFTER OPENING TO LET

 STRETCHERS THROUGH.     AFTER INITIALLY PREVENTING WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN A PUBLIC           ;

 ORDER SITUATION IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HELP WAS NEEDED BUT THEY JUST STOOD THERE

 LIKE ROBOTS.     IT SEEMED THAT THE POLICE HAVING MADE THE DECISION TO TREAT IT

 AS A PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION COULDN’T CHANGE TO TREAT IT IN ANY OTHER WAY.

 OTHER THAN A FEW INDIVIDUALS WHO DID HELP.

 THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO PROPERLY POLICE THE CROWD AT THE GROUND.      ON THE

 ROADS IN, THERE WERE OFFICERS AT JUNCTIONS ROUNDABOUTS & SHOPS.      BUT APPROX

 50 YDS FROM THE GROUND ENTRANCE POLICING STOPPED.       THERE WERE INSUFFICIENT

 NOS AT THE. GROUND.   AS YOU WALKED TO THE GROUND YOU COULD CLEARLY SEE PEOPLE

 CLIMBING INTO THE GROUND AND OFFICERS STANDING IN LEPPINGS LANE, STANDING AND

 TALKING, MUST HAVE SEEN WHAT WAS GOING ON, MADE NO MOVE TO STOP IT.

 TOGETHER WITH MY COLLEAGUES WE REMARKED THAT THERE MUST BE OFFICERS THE

 OTHER SIDE THROWING THEM OUT.    BUT ONCE IN THE GROUND WE SAW ONLY 2 OFFICERS

 WHO COULD DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.

 THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE GROUND IS BAD EXPECTING SUCH A SMALL AREA TO DEAL WITH

 S ^ M A N Y FANS.

 DRUNKENNESS WAS NOT A PROBLEM.    I SAW NOBODY DRUNK.

 STEWARD, A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OF OUR OWN ACCORD.


Q1S

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

NO.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER   THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 ^ T I ALLY WHEN PEOPLE WERE COMING OVER THE FENCES , THEY WERE BEING PUSHED

BACK BY POLICE OFFICERS. AT ONE STAGE THE GATE TO PEN 4 WAS OPEN,         I D O N ’T

KNOW ABOUT PEN 3 ’S GATE, BUT WHILE PEOPLE WERE BEING GOT OUT OF PEN 4, A

POLICEMAN PUSHED A CHAP BACK INTO PEN 3.

 THERE WERE PEOPLE SPILLING ONTO THE PITCH IN QUITE LARGE NUMBERS BY THEN AND

THE BOBBIES AT THE FRONT REALISED WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THEY STARTED ASSISTING

 PEOPLE TO GET OVER THE TOP.

 ONCE THE INSPECTOR WENT ON AND STOPPED THE GAME, THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOME

ANNOUNCEMENT STRAIGHT AWAY,    BUT THERE WAS N’T, FROM THAT POINT   ONPOLICE

OFFICERS ARRIVED FROM OTHER    PARTS OF THE GROUND AND WHILE SOME GOT      ON AND

h H_PED   PULL PEOPLE OUTf OTHERS STOOD ROUND AND DID NOTHING.

 THERE WAS ROOM ON THE TERRACE IN THE PENS 6 & 7 AND A POLICEMAN OPENED THE

 GATE. THEN HE JUST STOOD THERE, PEOPLE WALKED PASSED, AND EVEN JUMPED INTO THE

 NORTH STAND. NO ONE WAS DIRECTED INTO THAT AREA AT ALL.

 THE FANS THEN TOOK THE INITIATIVE IN PULLING THE FENCING-' DOWN, GETTING THE

 HOARDINGS TO USE AS STRETCHERS AND ADMINISTERING FIRST/AID.        IT LOOKED BAD WITH

 ONLY ABOUT 5 POLICEMEN GIVING MOUTH TO MOUTH AND HEABTT MASSAGE WHILE THE

 CIVIES DID THE MOST OF IT. IT SEEMED AN AGE BEFORE yTHE FIRST AMBULANCE ARRIVED

 AND IT WAS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. WHEN POLICE REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVED THEY WERE

 DEPLOYED VIRTUALLY SHOULDER TO SHOULDER ACROSS TME HALF WAY LINE, ONLY                >

                                                    Cp S
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               GSL611

 BREAKING RANKS TO ALLOW STRETCHERS THROUGH.

 THERE HAD BEEN ONE BRIEF SURGE OF LIVERPOOL FANS TOWARDS THE FOREST END BUT

 THAT FIZZLED OUT BEFORE THESE REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVED, AND THEY WERE NOT NEEDED

 THERE.     THE NUMBERS OF OFFICERS DEPLOYED THERE WAS EXCESSIVE.      IT WAS THE

 CAUSE OF MUCH ADVERSE COMMENT WHICH WAS BOTH ABUSIVE AND OFFENSIVE FROM THE

 SPECTATORS IN THE STANDS.

 THE DECISION TO LEAVE THE OFFICERS THERE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN MADE IN

 FEAR OF A PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION WHICH DID NOT EXIST.


Q19

 Q54

 £     THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO   ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE FENCES AT SPORTING VENUES MUST      COME DOWN AND PROPER FIRST AID FACILITIES

 MUST BE PROVIDED, FOR THE NUMBERS THAT ATTEND, ON A RATIO BASIS.

 BUT PRAISE FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED.        (fhA              A

 THE FENCING AT THE FRONT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COME DOWN EASIER

 PERHAPS WITH PEGS HOLDING THEM WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT.

 THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE STEWARDS. THE GATES AT THE BACK OF THE PENS

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH LARGER.

 THE TUNNEL GATES SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED BECAUSE THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

 THATS WHERE EVERYONE HEADS FOR.

ATTEMPTING TO GET OUT OF THIS AREA BY WHATEVER MEANS POSSIBLE OVER THE FENCE,

 BUT THE POLICE WERE PUSHING THEM BACK INTO THE AREA,   I D ON’T THINK THAT THEY,

 THE POLICE, REALISED WHAT WAS GOING ON, SO IT WASN ’T HANDLED TOO WELL AT THAT

 TIME, BUT AS SOON AS THEY DID BECOME AWARE, THEN THE POLICE AND EVERYONE ELSE

 DID THE BEST THEY WERE ABLE TO DO TO ASSIST,   I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ENOUGH

 POLICE COVERAGE AT THIS STAGE OR MEDICAL AID AND ASSISTANCE.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 CROWD CONTROL BY THE POLICE, TOGETHER WITH GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE

 SITUATION BY THEM, OUGHT TO BE GIVEN BETTER MORE THOUGHT.   MORE EXIT GATES

 ONTO THE PITCH TO ALLOW FANS THE CHANCE TO GET OUT MORE QUICKLY.   SIGN POSTS

AND STEWARDS.   THE FA GIVEN MORE THOUGHT TO THE SIZE AND FOLLOWING OF FANS TO

 THEIR DESIGNATED AREAS.

 (3) THERE WAS TOTAL LACK OF C O O R D I N A T I O N BY THE POLICE DUE IN MY OPINION TO

 A COMPLETE LACK OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THEREFORE NO POSITIVE LEADERSHIP

 OR DIRECTION.

 (4) I SAW GROUPS OF POLICE STANDING AROUND AT THE TIME WHEN THE FIRST

 AMBULANCE WAS LITERALLY TRYING TO THREAD ITS WAY THROUGH BODIES LYING ON

 THE PITCH, THEY DID NOT ASSIST THE AMBULANCE AT ALL.


Q18

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 J^LST    I FEEL IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CRITICISE THE OPENING OF A GATE ON THE

 OUTSIDE OF THE GROUND TO PREVENT POSSIBLE INJURIES,       IT IS OBVIOUS THAT FURTHER

 CO-ORDINATED ACTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO GUIDE PEOPLE TO THE EMPTY PARTS

OF THE TERRACES ON THE INSIDE OF THE GROUND, AND INDEED TO HAVE CLOSED OFF THE

 TUNNEL SECTION HAD ANYONE BEEN AWARE THE PENS 3 AND 4 WERE IN FACT FULL.

 CLEARLY ALSO THE GAME SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN DELAYED IN VIEW OF THE FACT

THAT MANY SUPPORTERS WERE STILL NOT IN THE GROUND.         ALSO, NONE OF THIS ACTION

 MAY HAVE BEEN NECESSARY IF THE POLICE HAD VETTED FANS ENTERING LEPPINGS LANE

 AT THE BEGINNING, FOR SUCH FANS WHO DID OR DID NOT HAVE TICKETS.

 ^ I S   IN MY OPINION 'CRIMINAL' THAT THE LIVERPOOL FANS WITH THEIR 'KNOWN'

 HIGH ATTENDANCE WERE ONCE AGAIN FORCED TO ENDURE THE SMALLER PART OF THE

 GROUND COMPARED WITH THE AVERAGE ATTENDANCE OF THE NOTTS FOREST SUPPORTERS.

 <344

 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH,    IF SO, CAN YOU SAY WHAT TIME THIS

 HAPPENED?

 IT GOT WORSE, MORE CRAMPED, BUT I WASN’T IN FEAR OF MY LIFE WHERE I WAS

 STANDING.

 <343

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,    IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT?

 (BRIEFLY)

 NO.


 m

G14

 047

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 NO, I SAW PEOPLE BEING BROUGHT OUT OF THE TUNNEL, AND LYING BY THE EXIT GATE.

 SOME OF WHOM WERE BEING GIVEN THE KISS OF LIFE.

 <348

        YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,   IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NO, EXCEPT TO LIFT A COUPLE OF PEOPLE INTO THE STANDS.

 <349

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE OUTSIDE WITHOUT TICKETS OBSTRUCTING PEOPLE WITH

 TICKETS THAT I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A REASON WHY EVERYONE WAS SO LATE

 GETTING IN AND THE GATE HAD TO BE OPENED.

 G32

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.


Q16



 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WERE POLICE IN THE STANDS WHO TRIED TO STOP F diS CLIMBING UP AT FIRST,

 THEY SHOULD HAVE SEEN WHAT WAS HAPPENING EARLIER. / IT TOOK A WHILE BEFORE ANY

 AMBULANCES GOT THERE.     THE POLICE SEEMED TO BE TOO EASY GOING, THEY WEREN’T

 DRAGGING PEOPLE OUT.     THEY MADE A CORDON ACROSS? THE PITCH WHERE THEY STAYED

 EVEN AFTER IT WAS OBVIOUS THERE WAS NO CROWD ^NVASION.          I D O N ’T THINK THE

 POLICE DID ENOUGH TO ASSIST IN THE HEART M A N A G E / K I S S OF LIFE,

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE POLICE HAD ALL THE SIDE ROADS BLOCKED O F F , THEY COULD HAVE BLOCKED THE

 MAIN ROAD, AND CHECKED TICKETS AT POINTS ALONG THE MAIN ROAD, BREAKING UP THE

 CROWDS AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WITH TICKETS DIDN’T GET THROUGH.

 WITH THE AVERAGE GATE SIZE OF LIVERPOOL AND NOTTS FOREST, LIVERPOOL SHOULD

 HAVE HAD MORE TICKETS.

 THERE WERE LOADS OF POLICE ALL THE WAY ALONG THE MAIN ROADS FROM THE

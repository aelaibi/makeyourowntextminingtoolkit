Dear Mr Jones

I understand from my Listing Officer that you have telephoned to say that on
reflection you do not wish to give evidence.

Bearing in mind the availability of witnesses I had taken the decision that I
would respect the wishes of the bereaved who were at Hillsborough as to whether
or not they wished to avail themselves of the opportunity of giving their
account of the events.

In the circumstances I do not insist that you should come, although in the
light of earlier communications I had thought that you might have wanted to put
your account to the Jury.

If on further reflection you change your mind with regard to giving evidence,
please get in touch with my Listing Officer and we will try to fit you in
before the Inquests have concluded.

Yours sincerely




S L Popper
H M Coroner

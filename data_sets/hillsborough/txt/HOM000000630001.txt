           Liverpool,         L3IDX.       I live at the a bove addr e s s w ith my mother



           On S a t u r d a y 15th A pril        1989,    I a t t e n d e d the F.A Cup Semi     final

           H i l l s b o r o u g h Football    Ground     in Sheffield.

           I t r a v e l l e d to S h e f f i el d w i t h s even friends,     split b e t w e e n   two cars.

           One   of these friends,             had sold me a s t a n d ticket for           the Leppings

           Lane S t a n d     (cost £12 - seated area) .

           On the w a y       to S h e f fi el d we e x p e r i e n c e d a slight d elay   in Manch e s t e r

           due   to road works.            I think en route         to the game we s t o p p e d at the

           S i l v e r Fox    pub at S t o c k s b r i d g e .   In there   I consumed three pints of

           lager,    and      outs i d e   in the car I ate some s a ndwiches           I had bought        w ith

           me.     In the pub I swap p e d my stand               ticket w i t h a lad I got         talking

           to.     In re t u r n I got a L e p pings Lane s t a n d i n g ticket v a l u e £6.00p

           and £5.00         cash.

           In all    the time I was            in this pub,       I did not see a n y b o d y who appeared

drunk.         Most    p e o p le were         having      s a n d w i c h e s or a roeax and one or        two

d r i n ks    just.

W h e n we     left    the pub at about                 1400 hrs,        we e x p e r i e n c e d normal delays

in the        traffic due          to lots of p e o p l e g o i n g           to the match.        Also    the

Po l i c e wer e s t o p p i n g all           the coaches and m i n i - buses,            but     the cars

w e r e not     stopped.           We    f in a l l y a r r i v e d    in S h e f f i e l d at a bout 1430 hrs

and p a r ke d      in M a r i o n Rd,         opposite Sheffield Wednesdays                  training ground

We   then w a lk ed         the    rest of       the journey,            d o w n M i d d l e w o o d Rd and turned

left     into L e p p i n g s      Lane.        On    the way         to the gro u n d we received no

d i r ec ti on s    from Police           or    S t e w a r d s and we f o l lowed      the s t e a d y stream

of people.            There was a goo d atmosphere,                         and a sense of excitement                at

the prospect           of    the m a t c h      to come.

I a rr i v e d at      the L e p p i n g s      Lane e n t r a n c e at       1440 hrs.     Outs i d e    the

gr o u n d    there was no form of queueing,                           just a m e l e e of people perhaps

2,000        - 3,000.        In amongst          these p e o p l e       there were     two p o l i c e m e n on

horseback,          shouting,           "Get Back,        Push B a c k , ” to the crowd.            These w ere

the only P o l i c e me n          I saw.        I did not see any stewards.

B ec a u s e of the huge crowd at                     the e n t r a n c e   I was stuck b e t w e e n     two

turnstiles          for about           30 seconds.           I then m a n a g e d   to get      through a

turnstile          somehow,        where       I had my       ticket chec k e d and        I was allowed

into    the ground.               I did not          see any gates being opened,               I only saw

people co m i n g       through          the    turnstiles.

Once    inside        the g r o un d all         I c ould see was a tunnel                and I headed for

that along w ith             e v e ryone       else.      At about h a l f w a y along        the tunnel         I

could see          the p it ch and c ould see B r u c e Grobelaar,                      in the ground           in

the goal mouth.               I could not see any Po l i c e officers                      or stewards          in

this area at all .

At   the end of the               tunnel       I went     to the       left w here    I was    faced w i t h a

wall    of pe o p l e       in a solid mass.                I h ave since        returned     to

H I L L S B O R O U G H on T u e s d a y 18th April             1989.      It was only         then that            I saw

for    the first        time      the barrier           fencing       betw e e n pens       3 &. 4, and            the

fencing at         the ends of pens              3      '4.      I thought         at    the time of the m a t c h

that w h e n     I got       to the end of the tunnnel                     that     it was all        one      large

terrace.         I e n t e r e d pen 4 about              1455 hrs and stood               ini t i a l l y at      the

b a c k by the end of             the tunnel.             I have      indicated          this area      in square

n umber      J1 on the gri d of page                  5 in S u p p o r t e r s Q u e s t i o n n i a r e .

(Q/              }.     At     this    time     I was s t a n d i n g next          to a friend called

                           A bo u t   two m i n u t e s      later    I felt m ore and m o r e               intense

pressure        fro m be h i n d      and    I was g r a d u a l l y m oved         forward,       until       I

found myself           forced up agai n s t             a crush bearrier                situated    in the area                  i

the grid        r e p r e s e n t e d by square         L6    in S u p p o r t e r s Q u e stionnaire.             I was

c r u s h e d agai n s t     the barrier,            w h i c h dug    into my pelvic are a across my

hips and pelvis.                 I am five       feet        eight    inches       tall and for         the

barr i e r    to be p u s h i n g      into my pelvis              I w o u l d have       to hav e been carried

off    the gro u n d or else             the barrier was bent down as u s u a l l y                      they are

at stom a c h      level       on me.        Whe n    I r e v i s i t e d H i l l s b o r o u g h on Tuesday

18th April         1989      I noti c e d     that      this barr i e r was bent,              curv i n g

downwards.            I sa w            was next          to me,      either at m y side or on the

other     side of       the barrier,           pushing me a w a y from the barrier                       but he was

unable       to do anything.                After     about one mi n u t e                  was no     longer

there.        I r e m a i n e d crushed up against                   the barrier          for the next

fifteen or         twenty minutes.              After         ten m i n u t e s   I had no en e r g y left,                  I

was be gg i n g people            to get me off.               I w a 3 having p r o blems breathing

because       I could not mov e m y stomach.                         A l s o my arms were          trapped and I

could not move             in a n y d i r e c t i o n as I wa s compl e t e l y             immobilised.                 I

do not       remember        b e i n g r e l e a s e d from the barrier and I think I m a y have

lost c o n s c i o u s n e s s    for a few seconds               on more         than one occasion.

E v e n t u a l l y I was      aware     that I was off              the barrier and w a s m o v e d by the

  low of the crowd,                  f or w a r d    to the f e n c i n g onto         the pitch.           I remember

as    I moved        forward         that people wer e              lying on. the floor,             whether      they

were     alive or dead               I cannot         say.    The next      thing I k n e w I was up agains

the    fencing        at     the front at the very b o t t o m of the pen,                           leading to

the pitch.           I tried         to c li m b a fence wit h small                  ch a i n ' l i n k s but was .

I managed           to throw one            leg over         the    top and felt myself              falling off         th

fence        towards       the pitch.               I remember being prepared                  to hit       the floor       o

that side.           I was      just      r e l ieved     to be out.           As    it was a man wit h a

Liverpool           accent      caught me and broke m y fall.                        This m a n s u pported me an

half d ra g g e d me onto               the grass         of the pitch,             w here    1 lay down       in the

was    I alright,           had I b r o ke n anything.                 I remember            looking at       the m a i n

that     it was       1545 hrs and               I thought         it was   half-time.

A fter       a few m in u t e s some             fans put me onto an a d v e r t i s i n g board and

c ar r i e d me to the N orth S tand at the Spion Kop end.                                      A f t e r about

a n ot h e r   twenty m i n u t e s        of just        lying there wit h                     talking to me all

the    time,        I was     carr i e d on the board                to an area on the east                 side of

the n o r t h stand.             A ft er     another p e r io d of w a i t i n g             I was put onto a

was so easy.             I had been        told    to expect          to have m y ticket

            eq ui pm en t a v a i l a b l e    in situ,    eg stretchers,         oxygen,      first aid

            kits,    wire c ut t e r s and         there was no e v i dence of an e m e r g e n c y

            c o n t i n g e n c y plan.

            As    far as the p os i t i o n of w here we had to stand,                   I feel       that

            as the       fans f r o m Liverpool         al w a y s   travel   in several      thousands

            more     than any other            team then we s h o u l d have been a l l o c a t e d

            the S p i o n Kop area w h i c h has a far greater capac i t y                    than

            L e p pi ngs    Lane stand.

            I agree        to a t t e nd at any Court          or other h e a r i n g   in c o n n e c t i o n

            wi t h   the judicial          inquiry     into    the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster.

hand    side    of the       goal mouth.            The    reason we were             in the        centre and

half way down the             terrace      was      because you            can get a better               view of the

pitch and       the    players     by     looking         over     the     top of the         perimeter           fencing,,

T h e terraces we r e f i 1 1 i n g up slowly and w e a 11 s t ood w i t h a no t h e r

person d i r e c t l y      in front      of    us and      then one         of the      pressure          barriers

w hich acts         as a cushion whe n            the     crushing and swaying                 takes       place.            As

we stood       there     Christopher           D E V O N S I D E was     i m m e d i a t e l y to my      right        next
                                                    -

At about       3.0 0   pm    (1500)      later      the    game     started and just after                     the

referees w h i s 1 1e was         blown        I f e 11 a sudden           surge     forw a r d whi ch is

usually       normal     in the    terraces          but    on this o c c a s i o n        it never          came       off

and was a steady             pressure      from the         rear       crushing you forw a r d -against

the    spectators        in front       of you.           I. was    directly        in front         of    the     gate

in the       perimiter       fence and         it was      opened        by someone w h i c h          caused me to

be forced down and thro u g h the                    gate       on to the f l a y i n g        area.         As    I was

forced       forward     I lost    sight        of C h r i s t o p h e r   who    I think was             he m m e d    in

by one       of the    internal         pressure        barriers.          When     I got      on to the           pitch

I went       back    to the fencing            to see      if    I could see him but                 I couldn't.

There was       people all        over     the      terraces        serningly being            pressed         towards

the fencing.           I then helped a n o t h e r              supporter        thro u g h    the     gate and

t hen w e n t to have a n ot h e r look a r o u n d for C h r i s t o p h e r .                     I the n saw him

being       carried    out    from the         t e r races and being             laid down on the                 playing

area    near    to the       goal mouth.           A11empts         were     then made         to r /s vive        him
                                                                                                                 P AGE
                                                                                                                 S 1180

                but he never           came    round.     I then decided          to pick him up       and    carried

                h im in my arms          over    to the C lub G ym n a s i u m area where        he was      e x a mined

                by a man who           I believe was a Doctor.                 I then helped    to   carry

                Christopher           inside    the   gy m n a s i u m where    1 gave   his d e t a i l s to a Police

M L             Se r q e a n t ..    I then made my way back            into the ground        in an effort       to

                locate Mr DEV'ONSIDE,             but after a little while               I left and    r e t urned     to

                where      the      car was    parked.      I later    saw Mr DEVONSIDE' and e x p l a i n e d to

                him what         had happened.

                                                                                           J L Kenworthy SIGNED

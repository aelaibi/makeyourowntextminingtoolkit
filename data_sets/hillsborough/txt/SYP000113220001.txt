            These     notes are made         by me     in the   context    of having     just    two weeks

             pr eviously     returned to operational               duty after a three year attac hm en t

            to the Home Off ic e Central               Plann in g Unit,    Pannal Ash,      Harrogate.           My

             duties    there were         those    of a director       of studies    involved     in the

             observation,        recording and e va lu at io n of human           c om mu ni ca ti on skills.

            At the time        of the      crisis at the football          o peration    I was    very much

             the    new boy and found myself             very much using my obs er va ti on s          skills

             t hroughout     the       incident whilst at the same time being               involved       in

             it.    These    notes       therefore are      intended as feedback         for any       possible

 operational          order was sent to me w ith                  copies      for the two sergeants

who were to work with me.                       My first        task was      to attend a pre-brief

for     Inspectors and above                in the N orth S tand at the S he f fi e ld

W e d n e s d a y ground at         10am on F ri d ay          14 April      1989,    the order         stated

that     full     serial      orders w ould be handed                 out on that date,           in fact          I

received them by divisional                      mail    previously.

FRIDAY       14 A PR I L    1989

On this date           I came on duty at R a w m a r s h Police S ta t io n and                    in the

company of my colleague                   Inspector J oh n N ew ey from this                 stat io n also,

we t r avelled to H i l l s b o r o u g h S t ad i um and took up a position                        in the

N o r t h Stand of the ground where                     briefings       normally take           place.

A   public address            system was         used to speak          to the a ss e mb l ed officers,

its quality was             poor dependent             upon whom was          speaking     into    , however,

it was      possible        to    hear all       the    i ns tructions        clearly.      We were well

seated and well             informed        in writing         off    our duties.         It is fair          enough

to say that at this                 point     it w ould    have       been    possible     to    put the       plan

into ope r a t i o n without a verbal                   briefing.         Other      officers and myself

however       had not been emp loyed at the                     ground       recently or        in some       cases

previously,          it was with          interest       that    I awai t ed      the    interpr et at io n

an d   I needed to be able v is ually to familiarize myself wit h the

identity of the ground                  commanders most              of whom    I knew but had not

seen for an amount               of time.          I shall write          the next       piece as       I

remember        it happening,           I took a few brief              notes     of devi at io ns          on my

operatioal         order      but    nothing       compr e he ns iv e as most of what was                     said

was a reiter a t i o n of the w r it te n                instructions.

The    principle a d dr es s          to the ground            commanders was           given by Chief
                           ° Ib
S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u ck e n f i e l d who   spoke    from    pre-prepared notes w hich

were     in effect a r eiteration of the w ri t te n operational                                plan.        The

whole     of the o perational               scenario was         related to us           clearly and with

emphasis        on the      public      safety aspect.               I made a few brief           notes on
the w r i t te n order       in relation to where             to    collect    radios,      meals and

reporting       off    duty,    these matters were            not    clear    in the writ te n

orders,      however     they would have          been known to persons att en di ng                 these

functions       regularly,

We were       then further add re ss ed by S u p e rintendent ilLLLjja^. who                  re­

e mphasised the         public    safety procedures            to be followed          in case the

g round had to be evacuated,               the e va cu at io n       procedure       had been tested

and had a p p ar e nt l y      been found to he excellent.

My overall        r eflection of this         period of time was              that    I know how

difficult       it is to address a large a ud ie nc e and to get over all                            the

inform a t io n to everyone,            in fact    I found myself missing               chunks      of

information at times and trying                   to    confirm      it with a n eighbour           only

made me miss          further    information.          The    next     part of my experience

leads me to          infer   that the     commander's addr es s           should be very brief

and that       the    larger    group    should have         been broken down         into   smaller

more m an a ge ab le     groups w hich could be briefed                   by their respective

g round      commanders      thereb y giving the          opport un it y for more           interactive

feedback       to be obtained       on grey areas.

Other     officers      then spoke       to us,   I cannot         now    remember who       they were

or    what   they said       because     by now my a t t e n t io n       had gone because          of

repetition of the w r it te n order.

More    practical       relief    came    i mmediately whe n the             larger    group broke up
                                                                                         o               b2~
w ith their       respective      ground    commanders,            in company with^sujyt^^

C h a p m a n we wal k e d the area of concern               in Herries Road and were               given

a visual       e x p l a n a t i o n of our duties.       Supt.      C h ap ma n pointed     out all

the    places    of concern to me and gave me further                        verbal    instructions

to not allow Notts,             supporters     to de-bus           at the D ev on sh ir e    public

house and the Five Arches                public    house      in Herries Road.           The buses

a nd min i - v a ns were       to be directed          to their      d esignated      parking    places

near the ground          before    d is embarking        passengers.          I was    told what         to
                                                                                                       PAGE

do before,         during and after the match.                       In particular         to have    both my

serials        in P e ni at on e Road by kick-off               time.      This     i ns tr uction was       to

prove most         fortunate           in the    light of subsequent            events.       This

particular         form of briefing              I found most         beneficial      and the extra

information          I gleaned was duly noted on my briefing                          notes.
                                                                  to       '
Just     before      12 noon that           date     Inspector N ewey and myself              took a

police      vehicle       to the area of Herries Road and obtained a good view

of the task          in hand,           liy job therefore was            to supervise        two    serials

of    police officers             in Herries Road to            police the arrival            of the

Notts,      football           fans    before and after         the match.

S AT UR DA Y    IS A PR IL       1989

This     day commenced at Sam when a number                          of C2 Sub Divisional

personnel        and myself            paraded for duty at R aw ma r sh Police Station.                       We

boarded a bus and t ravelled via R o t h e r h a m DHG to H i l l s b o ro u g h

Stadium,       a rr iv in g at 9 . 30am.             At    10am we were     seated        in the N orth

Stand.         I was Sub Sector 23 and                    r esponsible    for serials 57-58.            1 had

two officers absent                   from the serials,         PC                            and PC

               one from each serial.                  I gave the       sergeants      their writ te n

operational          orders and          informed them of the deviations                    given to me by

S u p e r i n t e n d en t Chapman.         Chief
                                                                       •o -3>S"immediate
                                                      I n sp e c tor P r i ce, my

supervisor         for    the     durati on      liaised wit h us and           criminal      information

about     travelling Liverpool                  pickpockets was          dis se mi na te d amongst      the

serials.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    10am the briefing            of the    entire     contingent        of Police

officers        commenced.            Chief S u p e r i nt e nd e nt D uc k en f ie l d    repeated his

well     struc t u r e d addr es s        in the same manner as the                 previous       day and

all    ground      commanders           stood up and         i dentified themselves           to the

collected officers.                    A ga in the    problem of a ddressing              large    crowds was

apparent.          I was        quite aware        that a large        p roportion of the           collected

police officers                in my vicinity were            not    listening,      neither was       I to
                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                      R 251

some    extent.           Supt.     Murray         repeated the evac ua ti on                 procedure             details

and CID officers               spoke about           their    role    in the operation,                       most of

this was          verbal      input and soon forgotten,                 I cannot              remember most                of

it.     The       public, address            system was       functional          but brought                 out some

derision from officers who had heard                            it before.               I remember                thinking

that    the       pyramiding        of    information similar               to the           previous          day would

have    been more            effective,        conversley you          cannot          then ensure                 that

everything w ould be said that                        needed to be said by individual                                sub"

sector        commanders.

The serials            then d ispers ed and collected                  radios and meals,                       a nd at

10.30am r e f r eshments w ere                 consumed       in the form of a p ac ked                        lunch that

people        smiled and made            do.       A point     of    concern at this time was                             that

we were given             personal       radios       (Inspectors and Sergeants)                            of the older

type which were               in fact        the     last     type of radio              I had used

o perationally.               I found        mine     quite    functional              and audible             but not as

good as the            latest models.              What was a little              confusing was                    that       it

s tated quite            clearly       in the w r it t en order         that           personal             radios would

operate        on channel         23,     this had also         been emph as is ed v er bally at both

briefings.            Whe n the        personal       radios were       isued to us                    I was       told that

they were          set on the          correct       channel,       w it hi n the next half                    hour       I

found that            this    was      not    so and    re-set the          radio to the                    proper

frequency.             I later      heard that several               other       people           had had to do the

same    thing,         it doesn't always              do to take things                 for granted.                 No

confusion was             caused       by this,       messages       were       still        heard off

frequency          but    c om nm ni ca ti on was       nat ur al ly    better           on the             correct

frequency.               The overall           evalu at io n of this            is that in future I would

personally               check all       radios       issued to my group.

At    10.45am          this    date      together wit h both my serials we w al k ed to
Herries R oad - A 6 1 0 2 - a n d            spaced officers           in pairs along a two mile

stretch of this          road.        This    particular       road was        being    used as the

mai n a p p r oa ch    road for vehicular             traffic       from N o t ti n gh a ms h ir e and

contained two          public houses          on the    route.        We took up position on the

road and officers were                s ta tioned at        both    public     houses with

instructions          to turn away buses and m in i -v a ns                from the      public

houses.        I was    joined by Chief             Inspector Price and Supt.                 C ha p ma n was

visible     in a police         vehicle along          the     length of Herries Road

throughout       our time       in that       location.

At this early time             in the    proceedings          comfriuni cat i on by radio was good

with some       c o ns id er ab ly heavy verbal             traffic a lot of the traffic                  on

the    radio    seemed un ne ce ss ar y from my              point of view and event ua ll y                  I

did the usual          s ub -c on sc io us thing of filtering                 out only the

information that             seemed    pertinent       to my particular            command.        I found

no    reason to use the          radio myself          as most       of my     c om mu ni ca ti on had to

be done v er bally to the officers                    in my    command without           radio     contact,

in fact     I had only to            respond to the          radio      twice,    once    to     locate

myself    for Supt.          C h ap ma n who then gave me            verbal     instructions and

once    to take a message             for a serial          sergeant     to    contact R o t h e rh a m CID

on an urgent a d m i n i s t r a t i o n task.          Sgt.       1771 J oh nstone      in fact did

this by public          telephone.           Most    of the    radio traffic           that    I can

remember was about             the    location of travelling               groups      of fans and

trouble     spots      elsewhere       in the       city.      G e n e r al l y I found the      radio

c om mu ni ca ti on a de qu at e      however       I felt     sorry for the       controller           who

must    have had a lot on his                plate.

My    instructions as          stated were          complied with and Chief              Inspector

Price and Supt.          C h ap ma n were      in constant          s up er vi si on at all       times,          as

time went by,          and    it is now difficult             to be specific about

intermediate          times,     vehicular          traffic    e ventually gave way to

considerable          foot    traffic    in Herr ie s Road,            several walk in g         fans
                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                R 251

reported to me that                buses had drop pe d them off as far away as

B u r n g r e a v e Road,    some 2 to 3 miles further away than the                      1 to 2 miles

we were a l re a dy d i st an ce d from the ground.                  Most   of the enquiries

from Notts,         fans were about              how to get    back to B ur ng re av e R oad a ft er

the match.

It was quite a pp arent              that a p roportion of the Notts,               fans were

taking a dvantage            of the fine weat h er and the              long m arch to equip

t h emselves with a de quate               refreshments,       about 50% of the        people

walking     down Herr ie s Road were                carrying    packs and     cans of beer and

lager,     however,         there was       no u n pl ea sa nt ne ss and no       incidents within

my sight.

The D ev o n s hi re      public     house at the top of Herries Road                 soon filled

w ith families w ith              pre-arranged       luncheon bookings and           instructions

were    left with the             supervising PCs          to direct all    other     persons

arriv i n g at the D ev on sh ir e           to the football         ground area.

At    12 noon this date             I liaised wit h S up e ri n te n de n t C h ap m an at the

Five Arches         public        house at the j un ct io n of Herries Road and               (Teynham

Road?).       This was        in response          to a radio    call,    on arrival       at the Five

A rches    I saw that         the    public house was full            to brimming wit h a queue

outside      10-20 persons           long.        A door ma n was operating a p er- capita

basis     of entry and exit,               the    pub was    noisy but was well        s up er vi se d by

officers.         Many Notts,         fans who       could not enter        the    public house went

i mmediately to a nearby o ff-licence and                       consumed     cans and bottles         of

beer    in the      pub     car    park.     The off-li ce nc e was       event ua ll y    p ractically

bought out        of stock,         again there was          no trouble and everyone was             in

good heart.

2.30pm       This    s it uation      continued just          like   this and at      this   time    1

was    concerned to advise m atch                  control    that Herries Roa d was         now a

solid     phalanx of         people all walking             to the match,     still    about 50% of

them were       carrying alc oh ol ic             drink,    they were    noisy but not
                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                       R251

quarrelsome.

2 . 45pm        The Five Arches        pub is still       full    but the       car     park    is now

d evoid of        people all      of whom are        now walking        the    remaining mile to

the ground.           There      is plenty of noise           from pedestrians          and     passing

vans,      we have      no trouble      here    but the       radio    is alive w it h         incidents

of fighting and d runkenness at other                     locations.           The s ub co nscious

filtering         effect    of    listening     to radios       precludes me fro m trying to

remember where           these events were situated.

2.30pm          The   pub is three      quarters       full and without           problems.        I

instruct all my officers                to follow       the    crowd to the        ground and

regroup         in P e ni st on e Road,       this    is p re -a rranged and           is done

princi pa ll y        by hand signals         passed up the       chain of officers along

Herries Road.            I now     personally        commence    to walk       towards H i l l s b o ro u gh

roughly between two groups of police                      officers,       some well        in front          of

me and a few behind me.                 I am alone at          this time.

The    next      part of this        report    is the most       pertinent        part and       it has

been difficult           to separate      fact from fiction so                I have d e ci de d to

record my thoughts as they appear                      to have    occurred at the              time.     I

have    included all          my thoughts       irrespective          of their accuracy.

Wh il s t walking        down Herries Road,            towards Hillsborough,              I can hear          on

the    radio      reports     from    inside and outside          the ground           relating mainly

to what         I assume    to be the Leppings Lane              end of the ground.               I hear

about      crowd trouble with           lots of pushing and shouting,                    it was

possible         to hear    the noise      of the      crowd on the       radio system           in the

b ackground of the officer's                  transmission.           The sound of the           crowd was

a la rm i n g    in so m uch that       it did not       sound    right,       it is difficult           to

say why but           the sound fr ig ht en ed and        perturbed me quite              strikingly.

1 can hear Supt.            Marshall      on the      radio asking       for     *A*    gate    to be

opened.          I know Mr.       Marshall     quite well       due to work in g w ith him and

knowing         him for man y years.           I know him to be an intelligent and
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        R 2 51

sound    policeman quite           pragmatic at times and                certainly an e x pe ri en ce d

police manager.            What    I can hear on the          radio       now therefore           takes     on

an eiree aspect           fro   I can hear Mr,       Marshall        pleading        p er si stently for

a gate to be opened to avoid                   loss of    life and the wor d            * catastrophe *

is used several           times    to emphasise      the need for the              crowd situation

to be relieved.            I believe      I heard a request for the start of the

m atch to be dela ye d and a reply to the                    effect that          it is now too            late

as the     players       have   set off for the          pitch.      Supt.       Marshall        persists

wit h his    requests       with heart         rending    pleas to open a gate,                  his

request     is refused and          clarified by          control and e ve nt ua ll y the

decision to open the gate                is taken but        several       dif fi cu lt ie s      seem to

be met during        the    process      of getting       officials        to a c t u a l l y    physically

open the g a t e .

At this     time    I paused to speak wit h              Insp.    Wallace and a group of

officers     in a team van near to the               ground,        we    pass    comment        to each

other about        the    requests      for the gate to be opened,                 we form the

opinion that        the    pleas    to open the gate will                be the    quote        of the

year,    we were     not to know the true            pontent        of our       observations.             We

spoke a little about              the   commu ni ca ti on    process at this time w hich

s eemed to have a missing               link    in it.      Supt.    Marshall        could still           be

heard    patiently but          passionately asking           for the gate to be opened

w i t h the eiree        sound of an angry         crowd in the background.                      I walked

on towards     the P e ni st on e Road end of H i l l s b o ro u gh Stadium.

3.00pm      I a p pr o a c h e d the ground,       X saw my       police officers               being

redirected to go           into    the ground and         I hear     the    radio message

"Everybody      onto the        pitch    immediately".           This was        repeated three

times    I think.

3.02pm      I a p pr o a c h e d P enistone Roa d where           I saw about          100-200 fans

w aiting    to effect       entry to the S pion Hop,              there was        no trouble and

only normal        cheering       could be heard from the ground.                      I a ss u me d that
                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                             R 2 51

a pitch invasion had taken              place and my officers were             clearing      the

field.        I entered     the ground and went          to the    pitch entrance      to find

my serial,         I went   s pe ci fi c al l y down the slope       between the N or th

S t an d and the S p i o n Kop and met d ir ectly w ith Supt.                M ar sh who    greeted

me and       requested me to take        charge      of a group of officers at the

S p i o n Kop end and to face and            control     the Notts,      s upporters at this

end.     I collected a group of officers                 just arriving and spread them

along    the end of the        pitch?    a number      of dogs and handlers were

present and          Supt. M ars h gave       i ns tr uctions    for them to be kept        out of

sight so as         not   to aggr avate      the   crowd.     He told me then that

probably more        than    30 people were         dead at the Leppings Lane            end of

the field.          I then looked s p ec if ic al ly towards            that end and saw

police       officers    and fans    rendering       first aid to people        on the      pitch,

there were more          than enough officers          present to       contain the

situation.         People were      climbing       over the fence,       through the       gates

and up the front          of the    rear stand.        That a ct iv it y seemed to go on

forever.        It seemed quite       calm at this time           but nothing      could be

heard for the sound of the Notts,                   supporters     jeering at the Liverpool

fans,    they also       thought    it was a pitch        invasion.       It was    so noisy       it

was    not    possible    to hear the     radio at all.

Looking at the          incident    from the other       end of the field,          it seemed

well    organised.        Senior    officers were        present and      people were being

m o ve d and a t t e nd e d to.     I a s su me d that   sufficient       persons were

present      due   to a line of officers            containing    the    incident a cross      the

■field of play.

I then turned rny a t te nt io n to s upervising my                line of    containment

facing the other way,             not an easy task when you want             to get stuck          in

w it h your     section who are       in the thick       of   it, most     of the    officers at

the Spion Ko p end were            feeling    the same      but wit h the strong       command

reinforced by Supt.          C h ap ma n and Chief Supt.         Nesbit who were

fopus our a t t e n ti o n on the Notts,             supportes,

I cannot      under any       circumstances         be precise about time at all             during

this    stage the extent          of the disaster was           now known to officers             but

not a p p a r e n t l y to the Notts,       supporters who were jeering and .chanting

abuse at everyone.             On this basis         I myself went       to the    crowd and told

people at the front what              had happened.           I a sked officers wit h me to do

the same,       we told them people were              dead and    injured and a sk ed them

not to jeer.             The mess ag e was soon       passed back       into the    crowd who

were    quick      to respond and at the            same time dead bodies were             being

placed near the S p io n Kop end for                 collection.        This    sobering sight

soon    changed the jeering           to applause       for the efforts of the             rescuers

who were      by now bringing         injured an d stretcher            casualties to the exit

areas.      An unusual        aside at this         point   is the fact        that the bodies

that were       being      placed down at the         point   near me all        seemed to be

heavily built males w hic h seemed to                  contradict       later    reports    of young

people being         the m aj or i t y of victims.

Two B r i t is h T r an sp or t Police      had s o me ho w m a na ge d to get i nv ol v ed at

the S pion Kop end of the ground.                   They had spotted           five Liverpool

fans    in the S pi on Kop end,          they were      removed and went          to the North

S ta nd for their own safety.

My group p er sisted          in m ai nt ai ni ng   our su pe rv is or y   role at the S pion

H o p end of the ground when the ground s ud denly became                         invaded by

press    p h ot ographers who went amon gs t            the a ct ivity at all           parts of the

ground.       At this       stage the fans and ourselves            broke up the

ad ve rt is i ng    hoardings     to use as stretchers,           the    crowd was      by no^ well

subdued as         the   reality of the s i tu at io n pervaded the ground,                 it

see me d as     if an etern it y had passed.

Su dd en ly with ou t warn in g a charge            by Liverpool        fans    in the casualty

area took       place as they a tt ac k ed the          photographers          on the   pitch,     many

of them were a s s a u l te d before we were able                to quell    the matter         by

reasoning wit h them and asking                them to    return to the        casualty area

and be of use.         No arrests were made,             it was a case of the

photographers        pride    being    injured,     they were frightened.             They were

m ar s h a l l e d together and told to stay          in the      penalty area at the S p i o n

H o p end.    Most    of them       chose to put their          cameras    on the    floor and

ceased     recording,     some of course         did not.        In response      to this the

ground     commanders     brought a further          cordon of police         officers         onto

the    pitch to    contain the        casualty are a more         securely,     this was well

a p p r e c i a t e d by everyone    in particular       the    photographers who were not

happy.

Now    commenced a long succ e ss io n of           casualty movem en t       off    the      pitch

and out of the gro un d by what a p p ea r ed to be a well                   o r ga ni se d    chain

of events.        Look i n g ar ou nd 1 could see that many               people and       police

officers were        now declining        into shock.          I have an awa re ne ss         at this

stage that a police           counselling area had been set up at C lay wheels

Lane and that        officers who were a f f e ct e d should gather              there.         I don't

know where      I got this      notion but       I sent    two of my team to C laywheels

Lane,    they had become most           upset at the movement             of bodies     before        their

eyes.This     p r ocession of the dead a nd           injured past our          point      seemed to

continue to an eternity.               I myself    cried on a number          of occasions            and

the tension       p h ysically and m en ta ll y was aweinspiring.                I felt alert

but out of time,        most strange.          At this moment a S u p e r i nt e nd e nt         not

k nown to rne a d d r e s s e d all    sections    of the       crowd wit h a loud hailer

asking    f o r ■co-operation.         He was a p p l a u d e d by the     crowd.     I then

h eard Kenny D a l g l e s h on the tannoy         system doing        the same     thing.

The    next a w a r e ne s s was an intention       to cancel       the match,      the dogs

were    brought    out to face the           crowd at the Spion Kop end             in case of

problems     by the Notts,          crowd.    The a nn ou nc e me n t was    given on the

t annoy system that          the match was       cancelled and could the             crowd delay

                                                                                                         R 251

their     exit from the           ground for five minutes              to f acilitate           removal        of

casualties.          No    problems arose and the dogs were                       removed,      within

minutes        of this a n no un ce me nt         the S pion Kop emptied orde rl y as                    if by

magic.

I redeployed my group of officers                      outside    the ground            in Pen is to ne

Road to supervise             the    removal       of the   crowd by bus            to the train

station.         Outs id e    the ground most officers             seemed           fully e mp lo ye d but

some who had been called                   in later    seemed at a loss,              drivers       in

vehicles were         d ir ec te d by me to escort a mbulances and foot officers

were d ir ected to           collect       relatives    together       for    i d en ti fi ca ti on

purposes at the            gy mn as iu m and to direct          persons       to the force           coaches

being used to transfer                  relatives     to the    receiving           hospitals.

It was        now at this        time     that the greatest       toll       of     officers       seemed to

take    place,      most     of the work was done and an amount                        of a i ml es sn es s

seemed apparent.             Man y officers          now seemed    in shock and there was

much evidence         of tears.           A number     of senior officers               had    looks     of

sheer    exha us ti on on their             faces.     Most    of us were at this               stage

involved        in consoling         each other and trying             to get a cup of tea.

I was     requested at           this     point    by Supt.    Bates    to go mobile with my

serial        and s upervise        the    crowd    in Herries Road.              U n f o r t u n a t e l y we had

a r ri ve d    in a bus and         I had no       idea where my serial              was.      We were all

well    d ispersed        by now.         In view of this at 5.30pm we were                     given an

order    to     re-group      in the N orth Stand.             A good decis io n at             just     the

right time.          We    regrouped and sat down for a spell,                         everyone was

dist re ss ed      but we were all willing              to keep going.

It is at this          point      that my direct        involvement with this                  event

ceases,        however     the    series     of next events       is pertinent              in providing

me and a group of officers with an a l te rn at iv e                         objective         that helped

us   c on si derably       in managing        the trauma of the          past hours.

I was a p p ro a ch e d      in the stand by Inspector Cooper with                          instructions

from Supt.        Bates      to gather     together a team and to go to B a r ns l ey

liortary to set up a body reception                    facility.      I called together a

group of C2 officers              present    in the      stand,   they were a m i xe d bag           but

at    least    I knew most        of them.       The   sit ua ti on was     e xplained to    16

officers       that we had another           grim job and they were            given the option

not to go,        they felt       that   it was    better    to have an o bjective and we

all went       to C l ay wh ee ls Lane where after           brief    refreshments and

obtaining       transport,        I left a S er ge an t and 3 PCs           in the    counselling

area.        I was   pleased they opted out,              they did not       look well.      They

were    told to settle           down,   debrief and       return to C2 to       complete duty.

Notes made at time             re comments on o rg an is a ti o n made          on o peration

order whilst         incident      ongoing and day after.

1.     D r i nking   on route seemed excessive and a challenge                        to the fans        to

beat the gates a nd the               clock.

2.     Vehicles      were     being    parked miles away and fans were walking 4-5

miles and       calling       in pubs and beer-offs.

3.     Last minute       rush to ground - a lot of                people   (thousands)          left   it

until     last minute         beer drinking       for    hours.

4.     Radio    c om mu ni ca ti on was    heavy at all       times and was on talk

t hrough - most m e s s ag es were             pertinent,    some were       not - I felt as

though       I w ou l d have      liked a back to back        system with my serials

in order       to    control      them more.      The y were dispersed and             lost     in the

crowd.        One    of the    serials were        not   entirely known to me.              I would

have    preferred to be with my own                 people who      had another        commander.

The sets we were using were                of an older       type,     a de qu at e   but   could be

better.        There     is a tend ency to filter           out     information from the

barrage       of m e s s a ge s and    listen m os t ly to those        concerning yourself.

I can only          recall    the more    poignant m es sages and not              verbatum,

3.     In ground        I was aware of the effect             of shock and feelings              of

h e l p l essness      in oficers      of all    ranks.      I observed however as soon as

a verbal       chain of       i nformation took over an air             of o bj e ct i vi t y took

over and everyone             became    busy standing        in one    place a l t h ou g h

n ec e s s a r y was    frustrating       but at      least objective        verbal

encouragement was             given by myself and senior              officers.        This was        good.

6.     The    crowd was       uninformed,       it caused abuse but          not      panick.

Vertical       feedback       from the officers           to the    crowd quic kl y      perculated

and seemed to help a great                 deal.      The   crowd was then s upportive and

encouraged the           rescuers.      E xc ellent      feelings    of accom pl is hm en ts .

7.     When we       regrouped         in the N S tand after           the main thrust         of

a c t i v i t y this was a good           idea and a l lo w e d       us to sit a while and talk

to one another.              However      it was     difficult       to     identify the ground

commander         at this      point     due to a ct iv i ty outside the ground with

d ispersing        crowd.

I had been asked a number                  of times       for e mergency numbers           by fans,         I

did not know at             the time      but    it was      given at the first         regroup.

8.       Officers      in shock and trauma were                consistently helped by

colleagues with empathy and understanding,                             it seemed to help some and

make      it worse      for others.            Officers are         reluctant at these         times to

show emotion as they see                  it.     However      there was far more          concern than

I have seen          in the      past.     I was most         impressed by this         support      system.

9.       T r ansport arrangements,              w h erever    I went      I saw transport       being

a r r a n g e d e x c e l le n tl y   in all    cases.

10. First meal            of the day was          biscuits,         fruit    loaf,   crisps,    apple and

a fruit       drink.        Most      people    d is liked    it.     The    cooked meal    at Claywheels

Lane      looked excellent             but most     could not eat sweet hot drinks were

m uc h    in demand.

11. The       debrief and             reception on return C2 was excellent -- officers

arrived,        met Cl Line were            given tea nd allo we d to talk the matter

over,      c on se quently my shift were quick to                     regain o bj e ct i vi t y and deal

with their         feelings.           The Special       Cons ta bl es are to be highly

commended for their                   presence and empathy,           a good end to a rotten day.

12. Cha s ti se me nt         of the      press - on a number             of occasions     the fans         of

all      den o mi na ti on a t t ac k ed the       press     photographers        for   peering      into

people's          death and distress            on the field.         With the size       of the zoom

 lenses on the           cameras        I felt that      they should have been well                 out of

the way.           I felt     no sympathy for them but                I was objective        enough to

 rescue them from these assaults                     and     redirect       the fans to more         urgent

work.        No    serious       injuries were       o bs er ve d but       it f r ig ht en ed the

                                                                                                            R 2 51

photographers who            in the m aj or i ty          put their            cameras    on the ground and

sought         refuge behind       police        lines.        Some      of    course    did not as wi tn es s e d

by the         popular    press.

•13.At all        times    I was    impressed by the actions                      of officers         in my

immediate         command    in relation to their                   a pp roach to        people      in the

ground,         it was    s ympathetic and helpful.                     Some     confusion      reigned but

this     required strong           instructions           to      put    right - We needed to know

muster         points for    relatives?           it e ve nt u al l y         came but most       officers

did not have            radios.

•14. The        pitch and the Leppings Lane                    stand was         in full     view of the

police         control    point    if it had not           been so this matter w ou ld have

been horrendous.

15.    The ground needs            to be all        seats.          I have       been to H i l l s b o r o u g h

only four times            in my life.           I have always                thought    that   it    looked

like a bolt-on t ec hn ol og y and dangerous.                             I do not as an          individual

go to football            matches     for    this     very        purpose.

16.    In the      position       I was     situated       I ex pe ri en ce d strong            verbal

command from senior               oficers.         It was well            received and a p p r e c i a t e d „

Once     the     initial    shock was over we were well                         lead as other         officers

a rr i v e d    later    however    they had to first                   realise the shock and then

regain objectivity.                My experience           was      that       these    officers

your     orders a little out of context                        to me but as soon as they became

fully      informed       I found myself           being       s p ec if ic al ly s el ec te d       for    sound

operational         use.

17.    In c o nclusion my overall                opinions are             of a well       perceived         plan of

action by the            police made        very sour          by drunken and            late arrival         of

fans and         persons    not e nt itled to enter                 the ground.           D e ci si on s made to

ease terrifying            problms      for sound human                 care    reasons a compounding of

variables         coming    together        to    create a disaster               that    it was      not

possible          in my min d      to p r e - c o n c e i v e .     It seemed a simple and usual
W           *                                                            P AGE    18

                sort of crowd surge,       its effect was      tragedy.

                  think    I behaved well    and   I know my officers       should be proud of

                themselves.     The   press aft er ma th   is sickening     and n o n - s u p p o r t i v e ,

                The fans   have a great     deal   to answer   for,    it is after all all             about

                           human behaviour     gone wrong.      That    is the sickening            bit.

               This statement            is about    the    incident at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football         Ground,

               P e n i s t o n e Road,    Sheffield,       on Saturday,          15th April,       1989    (150489).

               I became aware            of having     to attend       the FA Semi-Final            by the usual          and

                customary means           of teleprinter m e s sages             followed by an a d v i s o r y

               minute with details             of Officers         in my    command and fina l l y a full

               Operational        Order was sent           to me with       copies     for the      two Ser g e a n t s

               who were      to work with me.              My first       task was     to at t e n d a pre-brief

               for      Inspectors and above,           in the N o r t h Stand at the S h e f f i e l d

               Wed n e s d a y Gr o u n d at   10.00am on Friday,             14th April,         1989    (140489),       the

               order      stated that       full     serial    orders would          be handed out        on that

               9.00am      (0900),       Friday,     14th April,       1989      (140489)

               On this date         I came on duty at Rawrnarsh Police S t a t i o n and                     in company

               of my      colleague,       Inspector John Newey from this                      station,   we travelled

               to H i l l s b o r o u g h S ta d i u m and took up a position              in the N o r t h Stand         of

               the ground where            briefings       normally       take    place.

               A public address            system was       used to speak          to the a s s e m b l e d Officers

               The      principle addr e s s       to the ground          commanders was          given    by Chief

were    in effect a reiteration of the w r i t t e n operational                                    plan.       The

whole     of the operational             scenario was           related to us                clearly and with

emphasis       on the    public safety aspect.                    I made a few brief                   notes      on

the writ t e n order           in relation to where               to   collect          radios,        meals and

reporting       off duty.            We were    then further add r e s s e d                 by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

M ur ra y who    r e-e-mphas i sed the          public       safety      procedures             to be followed

in case       the ground had to be evacuated,                       the evacu a t i o n           procedure         had

been tested and had a p p a r en tl y been found to be excellent.

S ubsequently,         when the        largest      group broke          up with their                respective

g round    commanders,         in company wit h S u p e r i n t e n d e nI C h a p m a n we walked

the area of        concern       in Herries Road and were                   given a visual

e x p l a n a t i o n of our   duties.         S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Chap m a n    pointed out all

the    places    of    concern to me and gave me further                          verbal          instructions

to not a llow N o t t i n g h a m supporters               to de— bus at          the D e v o n s h i r e Public

House and the Five Arches Public House                            in Herries Road.                    The buses

a nd min i - v a n s were      to be directed to their                   d e signated           parking        places

near    the ground before              d i s e mbarking      passengers.           I was          told what         to

do before,       during and after              the match.           In particular               to have        both my

serials       in P e ni st on e Roa d by kick-off               time.

Just    before     12 noon       (1200)      that date,         Inspector N e w e y and myself                      took

a Pol ice vehicle         to the area of Herries                    Road and o b t a i n e d a good view

of the task        in hand.           My job therefore was to supervise                              two serials

of Police O f f icers           in    Herries Road          to Police         the arrival              of the

N o t t i n g h a m football     fans before and after                 the match.

Saturday,       15th A p r i l r      1989     (150489)

This    day    commenced at           8 .00am     (0800)      whe n a number        of CS           Sub

responsible            for t r i a l s       57^58,    I had two Officers absent                    from the

serials,         PoTirce Con s t a W r e 2 9 4 D F a r n s w o r t h and Police Con s t a l b e                  794

Palmer,        one from each serial,                   I gave      the Sergeants           their written

Operational            Orders and        informed them of the directions                        given to me by

Su p e r i n t e n d e n t    Chapman.        Chief    Inspector Price,             my    immediate

supervisor           for the duration            liaised wit h us and               criminal        information

about      travelling Liverpool                 pick-pockets was d i s s e m i n a t e d amongst                   the

serials.

At a p p r o x i ma te ly          10.00am    (1000)    the briefing           of the entire            contingent

of Police O f f icers                commenced.        Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d

repeated his well                  s t ructur ed address         in the same manner as                 the

previous         day and all           ground    commanders          stood up and          identified

themselves           to the         collected Officers.             S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mur r a y    repeated

the    e v acuation           procedure       details and CID Officers                   spoke about          their

role     in the operation.

The    serials        then d i s persed and            collected        raios and meals,             and at

10.30am        (1030)         refreshments were           consumed        in the form of a packed

lunch.

At    10.43am        (1045)        this date,     together with both my serials,                            we walked

to Herries Road - A 6 1 Q 2 -■ and spaced Officers                               in pairs along              a two

mile     stretch of this               road.

This     particular            road was being used as the main a p p r o a c h                      road for

vehicular         traffic          from N o t ti ng ha ms hi re and contained two                   public

houses       on the          route.     We took up position on the                    road and Officers

were     stationed at both               public       houses with         instructions          to turn away

buses and m in i- v a n s             from the    public       houses.         I was      joined by Chief

Inspector Price and S u p e r i nt en de n t C h a p m a n was visible                          in a Police

vehicle along                the    length of Herries Road              throughout         our time          in that

location.

At this        early time            in the    proceedings         c o m m unication by radio was                  good
                                                                                                        PAGE

with    some    c on s i d e r a b l y heavy verbal         traffic,       I f o u n d no     reason to

use    the    radio my s e l f as most          of my      commu n i c a t i o n had to be done

verbally to the O f f icers              in my      command without          radio     contact,       in fact

I had only to          respond to the           radio twice,         once to locate myself               for

S u p e ri n t e n d e n t C h a p ma n who then gave me verbal              instructions and once

to take a mess a g e          for a serial          Serge a n t    to contact R o t h e r h a m CID on

an urgent a d m i n i s t r a t i o n task,        S e r geant     1771 John s o n     in fact did this

by public       telephone.           Most    of the       radio traffic        that    I can     remember

was about       the    location of travelling                groups     of fans and trouble              spots

elsewher e      in the       city.      Gen e r a l l y   I found the      radio      commu n i c a t i o n

adequate.

My i n s t r uctions as stated were                 complied with and Chief                Inspector

Price and S u p e r i nt en de nt C ha p m a n were           in constant        s u p e r v i s i o n at all

times,       as time went       by, and        it is now difficult             to be specific about

intermediate          times,    vehicular         traffic     e ventually gave way to

c onsiderable         foot    traffic       in Herries Road,           several      walking      fans

reported to me that             buses had dropped them off as far away as

B ur n g r e a v e R o ad some 2 to 3 miles               further away than the             1 to 2 miles

we were a lr e a d y d is ta n c e d from the ground.                   Most    of the enquiries

from N o t ti ng ha m fans were about                 how to get       back to B u r n g r e a v e Road

after    the match.

It was quite a p p a r e n t         that a p r oportion of the N o t t i n g h a m fans were

taking adv a n t a g e       of the fine weather             and the     long m arch        to equip

themselves       with a d e q u a t e     refreshments,           about 30     percent      of the      people

walking       down Herr i e s Road were             carrying       packs and     cans      of beer and

lager.        However,       there was       no un p l e a s a n t r i e s and no     incidents within

my sight.

The Devon s h i r e P u b l i c House at the top of Herries Road soon filled

with families with             pre-arranged           luncheon      bookings and         instructions

were    left with the          supervising Police Const a b l e s               to direct all           other

persons a r r iving at the Devon s h i r e                   to the football            ground area.

At   12 noon    (1200)      this       date,,     I liaised with S u p e r i n t e n d e n t C h a p m a n at

the Five Arches Public House at the                           junction of Herries Roa d and

(T.eynham Road)?         This was          in response            to a radio         call,    on arrival           at

the Five Arches        I saw that the                public       house was full           to brimming with

a queue    outside     10-20       persons         long,        A doorman was           operating a per-

capita basis        of entry and exit,                 the    pub was noisy but was well

super v i s e d by Officers.             Many N o t t i n g h a m fans who              could not      enter       the

public house went           i mmediately to a nearby off-licence and                                consumed

cans and bottles         of beer         in the        pub car        park.       The   o f f - l icence was

eventual ly     pr a c t i c a l l y bought out of stock,                    a gain there was          no

trouble and everyone was                 in good heart.

2.30pm    (1430)    - This     s i tua tion          continued         just     like this and at this

incidents      of f i g h t i n g and d runkenness at other                       locations.

2.50pm    (1450)    - The     pub was           thr e e - q u a r t e r s    full and without

in front    of me and a few behind me.                          I was alone at            this time.

the   radio    reports        from    inside and outside          the ground       relating mainly

to what     I a ss u m e d    to be the L e p pings Lane          end of the ground.              I heard

about    crowd trouble with             lots of    pushing and shouting,               it was

possible to hear             the noise    of the     crowd on the         radio    system    in the

background of the Officers                transmissions.           The    sound of the       crowd was

alarming      in so m u c h that        it did not     sound      right,     it is difficult           to

say why but the sound f r ightened and                   perturbed me quite              strikingly.

refused and       clarified by control and e v e n t u a l l y the d e c i s i o n to open

the   process     of g e t t i n g .officials      to a c t u a l l y   physically open the

group of Officers             in a team van near         to the ground,           we   passed     comment

to each other about             the    requests    for the gate to be opened.

message - " Everybody onto the                pitch    immediately" - this was                     repeated

three times       I believ'e.

3.0 2 pm    (1302)    - I a p p r o ac he d P e n i s t o n e Road where. I saw about                 100— 200

fans waiting       to effect        entry to the S p i o n Hop,         there was no trouble

and only normal        cheering       could be heard         from the ground.                 I assu m e d

that a pitch       invasion had taken place and my Officers                         were       clearing

the field.        X entered the ground and went                to the      pitch entrance                 to

find my serial.          I went s p e ci fi ca ll y down the slope                between the North

S t a n d and the S p i o n Kop and met d i r ectly with S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marsh

who    greeted me and        requested me to take            charge of a group of Officers

at the Spion Kop end and to face and                    control     the N o t t i n g h a m

supporters      at this      end.     1 collected a group of O f f i c e r s             just arriving

and spread them along              the end of the       pitch,    a number         of dogs and

handlers were        present and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M arsh gave          instructions             for

them to be kept        out of sight          so as not to a g gravate             the   crowd.            He

told me then that         probably more         than 30      people were          dead at the

Leppings Lane End of the field.                     I then   looked s p e c i f i c a l l y    towards

that end and saw Police Officers and fans                      rendering          first aid to

people on the        pitch,    there were more          than enough O f f i c e r s           to    contain

the    situation.      People were        climbing      over the fence,            through the

gates and up the         front      of the    rear stand.

It seemed quite        calm at this          time   but nothing       could be heard for the

sound of N ot ti n g h a m    supporters       jeering at the Liverpool                 fans,        they

also    thought    it was a pitch         invasion.

L ook i n g at this    incident       from the other         end of the        field,         it seemed

well    organised,     senior Officers were             present and        people were              being

m o v e d and a tt e n d e d to.     I a s s u m e d that sufficient         personnel             were

present due       to a line        of Officers       containing     the    incident across                 the

f ield of    play.

at the S pion Hop end were              feeling     the       same   but with the strong

command      r e-inforced     by S u p e r i nt en de n t Chap m a n and Chief

S up er i n t e n d e n t Nesbit,   who were      encour a g i n g and giving support                 to

No t t i ng ha m supporters,

I. cannot,     under any      circumstances,            be    precise about       times at all

during    this stage,        the extent      of the          disaster was       bow    known to

Of f icers    but not a pp ar en tl y to the N o t t i n g h a m s u pporters who were

jeering and        chanting abuse at everyone.                    On this      basis,     I myself went

to the    crowd and told            people at the        front what had happened,                    I asked

Officers with me to do the same,                   we    told them people were                dead and

injured and asked them not to jeer.                          The message was          soon    passed back

into the      crowd who were quick           to    respond and at the same                   time    dead

bodies were        being    placed near the S p i o n Kop end for                 collection,             this

sobering     sight soon       changed the jeering                to applause      for the efforts

of the    rescuers who were            by now bringing            injured and stretcher

casualties        to the e:<it areas.          An unusual aside at this                   point      is the

fact    that the bodies         that were      being         placed down at the           point      near me

all    seemed to be heavily            built males w hich seemed to                   contradict          later

reports of young           people     being the m a j o r i t y of victims.               Two B r i t i s h

Tr ansport Police O f f icers           had become           involved at the S p i o n Kop end of

the ground.         T hey had spotted five Liverpool                    fans    in the S pion Kop

end,    they were      removed and sent           to the North S tand for their                     own

safety.

My group      persisted      in mainta i n i n g    our s u p e r visory        role at the Spion

Kop end of the         ground when       the ground s u d denly became                 invaded by

press    photographers who went amongst                      the a c t i v i t y at all      parts    of the

subd u e d as the          reality 01" the s i t uation         pervaded the ground.

Suddenly,         without warning,          a charge       by Liverpool        fans    in the   casualty

a r e a took       place as they a t ta ck ed the           photographers        on the     pitch,       many

of them were a s s a u l t e d before we were able                   to quell     the matter        by

reasoning wit h            them and asking         them to return to the              casualty area

and be of use.              No arrests were made,            it was a case of the

photagraphers            pride    being     injured,    they were        frightened.        They were

m ar s h a l l e d together      and told to stay           in the     penalty area of the Spion

K op end.         Most     of them    chose to       put their      cameras     on the    floor and

ceased       recording,        some of      course   did not.        In response-to         this    the

ground       commanders        brought a further           cordon of Police O f f icers            onto

the    pitch to         contain the       casulaty are a more          securely,       this was well

a p p r e c i a t ed   by everyone     in particular         the    photgraphers who were               not

happy.

N ow    commenced a long succ e s s i o n of            casualty movement             off the   pitch

and out of the ground by what a p p e a r e d to be a well                        organised        chain

of events,             Looking ar o u n d    I could see that many             people and Police

O fficers were           now declining          into shock.

This     procession of the dead and                  injured    past our       point seemed        to

continue for an eternity.                    I myself      cried on a number of occasions

a nd the tens i o n         physically and m e n t a l l y was awe            inspiring,     1 felt

alert      but out       of time?    most       strange.     At this moment a

w ith a loudhailer asking                 for    co-operation,       he was a p p l a u d e d by the

crowd,       I then heard K e n n y D a l glesh         on the tannoy system doing                 the

same     thing.

The     ne::t Police        i n s t r uctio n was an    intention to          cancel    the match,        the

dogs were         brought      out to face the         crowd at the S p i o n K o p end         in case

of     problems        by the N ot ti ng h a m    crowd.     The anno u n c e m e n t was    given on

the tannoy system that the m atch was                           cancelled and        could the      crowd

delay their         exit from the ground for                    five minutes        to f a cilitate

removal       of casualties.                 No   problems arose an d the dogs were               removed.

W i t h in minutes       of this a nn ou n c e m e n t         the S pion Kop e m p t i e d orderly.

I redeployed my group of O f f icers                         outside   the ground       in P e nistone

R o a d to supervise             the    removal       of the    crowd by bus to the           train

station.        Outside          the ground most O f f icers             seemed fully employed              but

some who had been                called       in later seemed at a loss,               drivers    in

vehicles were          d i r ected by me to escort ambulances and foot Officers

were    directed to           collect         relatives       together    for    identification

purposes at the gym n a s i u m and to direct                       persons to the Force            coaches

being    used to transfer                relatives       to the     receiving       hospitals.         I was

requested at this                point by S up er in te nd en t Bates            to go mobile wit h my

serial    and supervise                the    crowd    in Herries Road.           U n f ortunately,      we

had arri v e d      in a bus and              I had no       idea where my serial was,            we were

all well       dis p e r s e d    by now.          In view of this,        at 5. 3 0 p m   (1730)      we were

given an order           to      re— group in the N or t h Stand,               a good d e c i s i o n at

just    the    right time.              We    re-grouped an d sat down for a spell,

everyone was          d is t r e s s e d but we were all willing                 to keep going.

It is at this          point       that my direct             involvement with this           event

called together a group of R a w m ar sh Officers                          present      in the stand,

they were a m in e d group but at                      least    I knew most        of them.      The

job and they were                given the          option not to go,       they felt that          it was

better to have an objective,                         and we all went to C l a y w h e e l s Lane

     This statement is about the incident at Hillsborough Football Ground,

     Penistone Road, Sheffield, on Saturday, 15th April 1989-

     I became aware of having to attend the F.A. Semi-Final by the usual and

     customary means of teleprinter messages followed by an advisory minute with

     details of Officers in my command and finally a full Operational Order was

     sent to me with copies for the two Sergeants who were to work with me.                                                        My

     first task was to attend a pre-brief for Inspectors and above, in the North

     Stand at the Sheffield Wednesday Ground at 10.00 a.m. on Friday, 14th April

     1989, the order stated that full serial orders would be handed out on that

     date, infact I received them by Divisional mail previously.

     These documents can be produced by me if required.

     9.00 a.m. Friday, 14th April 1989

     On this date I came on duty at Rawmarsh Police Station, and in company of my

     colleague, Inspector John Newey from this station, we travelled to

            Hillsborough Stadium and took up a position in the North Stand of the ground

            where briefings normally take place.

            A public address system was used to speak to the assembled Officers.

            The principle address to the ground commnders was given by Chief

            Superintendent Duckenfield who spoke from pre-prepared notes which were in

            effect a reiteration of the written operational plan.                   The whole of the

            operational scenario was related to us clearly and with emphasis on the

            public safety aspect.          I made a few brief notes on the written order in

            relation to where to collect radios, meals and reporting off duty.

            We were then further addressed by Superintendent Murray who re-emphasised the

            public safety procedures to be followed in case the ground had to be

            evacuated, the evacuation procedure had been tested and had apparently been

            found to be excellent.

            Subsequently, when the largest group broke up with their respective ground

            commanders, in company with Superintendent Chapman we walked the area of

            concern in Herries Road and were given a visual explanation of our duties.

            Superintendent Chapman pointed out all the places of concern to me and gave

            me further verbal instructions to not allow Nottingham supporters to de-bus

            at the Devonshire Public House and the Five Arches Public House in Herries

            Road.    The buses and mini-vans were to be directed to their designated

            parking places near the ground before disembarking passengers.                     I was told

            what to do before, during and after the match.                 In particular to have both my

            serials in Penistone Road by kick-off time.

i           Just before 12 noon that date, Inspector Newey and myself took a Police

            vehicle to the area of Herries Road and obtained a good view of the task in                     ^

        hand.     My job therefore was to supervise two serials of Police Officers in

        Herries Road to Police the arrival of the Nottingham football fans before and

        after the match.

        Saturday, 15th April 1989

        This day commenced at 8.00 a.m. when a number of C2 Sub-Divisional personnel

        and myself paraded for duty at Rawmarsh Police Station, we boarded a bus and

        travelled via Rotherham DHQ. to Hillsborough Stadium, arriving at 9-30 a.m.

        At 10.00 a.m. we were seated in the North Stand, I was sub-sector 23 and

        responsible for serials 57-58, I had two Officers absent from the serials,

        Police Constable 29^0 Farnsworth and Police Constable 794 Palmer, one from

        each serial.      I gave the Sergeants their written Operational Orders and

        informed them of the directions given to me by Superintendent Chapman.           Chief

        Inspector Price, my immediate supervisor for the duration liaised with us and

        criminal information about travelling Liverpool pick-pockets was

        disseminated amongst the serials.

        At approximately 10.00 a.m. the briefing of the entire contingent of Police

        Officers commenced.        Chief Superintendent Duckenfield repeated his well

        structured address in the same manner as the previous day and all ground

        commanders stood up and identified themselves to the collected Officers.

        Superintendent Murray repeated the evacuation procedure details and C.I.D.

        Officers spoke about their role in the operation.

        The serials then dispersed and collected radios and meals, and at 10.30 a.m.

        refreshments were consumed in the form of a packed lunch.

        At 10.45 a.m. this date, together with both my serials, we walked to Herries

        Road - A6102 - and spaced Officers in pairs along a two mile stretch of this

        road.

        This particular road was being used as the main approach road for vehicular

        traffic from Nottinghamshire and contained two public houses on the route.

        We took up position on the road and Officers were stationed at both public

        houses with instructions to turn away buses and mini-vans from the public

        houses.     I was joined by Chief Inspector Price and Superintendent Chapman was

        visible in a Police vehicle along the length of Herries Road throughout our

        time in that location.

        At this early time in the proceedings communication by radio was good with

        some considerably heavy verbal traffic.                  I found no reason to use the radio

        myself as most of my communication had to be done verbally to the Officers in

        my command without radio contact, infact I had only to respond to the radio

        twice, once to locate myself for Superintendent Chapman who then gave me

        verbal instructions and once to take a message for a serial Sergeant to

        contact Rotherham C.I.D. on an urgent administration task, Sergeant 1771

        Johnson infact did this by public telephone.                      Most of the radio traffic that

        I can remember was about the location of travelling groups of fans and

        trouble spots elsewhere in the city.               Generally I found the radio

        communication adequate.

        My instructions as stated were complied with and Chief Inspector Price and

        Superintendent Chapman were in constant supervision at all times, as time

        went by, and it is now difficult to be specific about intermediate times,

        vehicular traffic eventually gave way to considerable                          traffic in Herries

        Road, several walking fans reported to me that buses had dropped them off as

        far away as Burngreave Road some 2 to 3 miles further away than the 1 to 2

        miles we were already distanced from the ground.                 Most of the enquiries from

        Nottingham fans were about how to get back to Burngreave Road after the

        match.

        It was quite apparent that a proportion of the Nottingham fans were taking

        advantage of the fine weather and the long march to equip themselves with

        adequate refreshments, about 50% of the people walking down Herries Road were

        carrying packs and cans of beer and lager.               However, there was no

        unpleasantries and no incidents within my sight.

        The Devonshire Public House at the top of Herries Road soon filled with

        families with pre-arranged luncheon bookings and instructions were left with

        the supervising Police Constables to direct all other persons arriving at the

        Devonshire to the football ground area.

        At 12 noon this date, I liaised with Superintendent Chapman at the Five Arches

        Public House at the junction of Herries Road and (Teynham Road)?                 This was in

        response to a radio call, on arrival at the Five Arches I saw that the public

        house was full to brimming with a queue outside 10-20 persons long.                 A doorman

        was operating a per-capita basis of entry and exit, the pub was noisy but was

        well supervised by Officers.           Many Nottingham fans who could not enter the

        public house went immediately to a nearby off-licence and consumed cans and

        bottles of beer in the pub car park.             The off-licence was eventually

        practically bought out of stock, again there was no trouble and everyone was

        in good heart.

        2.30 p.m. - This situation continued just like this and at this time I was

        concerned to advise match control that Herries Road was now a solid phalanx

        of people all walking to the match, still about 50% of* them were carrying

            2.45 p.m. - The Five Arches pub was still full but the car park                      was now

            devoid of people         all     of whom were now walking the remaining mile to                 the groun

            there was plentyof noise from pedestrians and passing                    vans, we    had no

            trouble here but         the     radio was alive with incidents of               fightingand

            drunkenness at other locations.

            2.50 p.m. - The pub was three-quarters full and without problems.                       I

            instructed all my Officers to follow               the crowd to the      ground andre-group         in

            Officers, some well in front of me and a few behind me.                       I was alone at    this

            time.

            Whilst walking down Herries Road, towards Hillsborough, I heard on the radio

            reports from inside and outside the ground relating mainly to what I assumed

            to be the Leppings Lane end of the ground.                   I heard about crowd trouble with

            lots of pushing and shouting, it was possible to hear the noise of the crowd

            on the radio system in the background of the Officers transmissions.                          The

            sound of the crowd was alarming in so much that it did not sound right,                         it is

            difficult to say why but the sound frightened and peturbed me quite

            strikingly.       I heard Superintendent Marshall on the radio asking for 'A' gate

            to be opened, I know Mr. Marshall quite well due to working with him and

            knowing him for many years.            I know him to be an intelligent and sound

            Policeman, quite pragmatic at times and certainly an experienced Police

            manager.      I could heard Mr. Marshall asking persistently for a gate^to be

opened to avoid loss of life and the word 'catastrophe' was used several

time to emphasise the need for the crowd situation to be relieved.                   I heard

a request for the start of the match to be delayed and a reply to the effect

that it was now too late as the players had set off for the pitch.

Superintendent Marshall persisted with his requests to open a gate, his

request was refused and clarified by control and eventually the decision to

open the gate was taken but several difficulties seemed to be met during the

process of getting officials to actually physically open the gate.

At this time I paused to speak with Inspector Wallace and a group of Officers

in a team van near to the ground, we passed comment to each other about the

requests for the gate to be opened.

Superintendent Marshall could still be heard patiently asking for the gate to

be opened with the sound of an angry crowd in the background.                   I walked on

towards the Penistone Road end of Hillsborough Stadium.

3.00 p.m. - I approached the ground, I saw my Police Officers being

re-directed to go into the ground and I heard the radio message - "Everybody

onto the pitch immediately" - this was repeated three times I believe.

3.02 p.m. - I approached Penistone Road where I saw about 100-200 fans

waiting to effect entry to the Spion Kop, there was no trouble and only normal

cheering could be heard from the ground.                  I assumed that a pitch invasion had

taken place and my Officers were clearing the field.                   I entered the ground

and went to the pitch entrance to find my serial.                  I went specifically down

the slope between the North Stand and the Spion Kop and met directly with

Superintendent Marsh who greeted me and requested me to take charge of a

group of Officers at the Spion Kop end and to face and control the

        Nottingham supporters at this end.             I collected a group of Officers just

        arriving and spread them along the end of the pitch, a number of dogs and

        handlers were present and Superintendent Marsh gave instructions for them to

        be kept out of sight so as not to              aggravate the crowd. He told me then that

        probably more than 30 people were              dead at the Leppings Lane End of the field.

        I then looked specifically towards that end and saw Police Officers and fans

        rendering first aid to people on the pitch, there were more than enough

        Officers to contain the situation.             People were climbing over the fence,

        through the gates and up the front of the rear stand.

        It seemed quite calm at this time              but nothing could beheard for the sound of

        Nottingham supporters jeering at the Liverpool fans, they also thought it was

        a pitch invasion.

        Looking at this incident from the other end of the field, it seemed well

        organised, senior Officers were present and people were being moved and

        attended to.       I assumed that sufficient personnel were present due to a line

        of Officers containing the incident across the field of play.

        I then turned my attention to supervising my line of containment facing the

        other way, not an easy task when I wanted to get 'stuck in' with my section

        who were in the thick of it, most of the Officers at the Spion Kop end were

        feeling the same but with the strong command re-informed by Superintendent

        Chapman and Chief Superintendent Nesbit, who were encouraging and giving

        support to everyone, we eventually managed to focus our attention on the

        Nottingham supporters.

        I cannot, under any circumstances, be precise about times at all during this

        stage, the extent of the disaster was now known to Officers but not apparently

to the Nottingham supporters who were jeering and chanting abuse at everyone.

On this basis, I myself went to the crowd and told people at the front what

had happened.        I asked Officers with me to do the same, we told them people

were       dead and injured    and asked them not to jeer.              The message was soon passed

back       into the crowd who were quick to respond and                 at the same time dead bodies

were being placed near the Spion Kop end for collection, this sobering sight

soon changed the jeering to applause for the efforts of the rescuers who were

by now bringing injured and stretcher casualties to the exit areas.                        An

unusual aside at this point is the fact that the bodies that were being placed

down at the point near me all seemed to be heavily built males which seemed

to contradict later reports of young people being the majority of victims.

Two British Transport Police Officers had become involved at the Spion Kop end

of the ground.        They had spotted five Liverpool fans in the Spion Kop end,

they       were removed and    sent to the North Stand for their own safety.

My group persisted in          maintaining our supervisory role at the Spion Kop end of

the ground when the ground suddenly became invaded by press photographers who

went amongst the activity at all parts of the ground.                       At this stage, the fans

and ourselves broke up the advertising hoardings to use as stretchers, the

(Jrowd was by now well subdued as the reality of the situation pervaded the

ground.

Suddenly, without warning, a charge by Liverpool fans in the casualty area took

place as they attacked the photographers on the pitch, many of them were

assaulted before we were able to quell the matter by reasoning with them and

asking them to return to the casualty area and be of use.                       No arrests were

made, it was a case of the photographers pride being injured, they were

        frightened.      They were marshalled together and told to stay in the penalty

        area of the Spion Kop end.           Most of them chose to put their cameras on the

        floor and ceased recording, some of course did not.                  In response to this the

        ground commanders brought a further cordon of Police Officers onto the pitch

        to contain the casualty area more securely, this was well appreciated by

        everyone in particular the photographers who were not happy.

        Now commenced a long succession of casualty movement off the pitch and out of

        the ground by what appeared to be a well organised chain of events.                   Looking

        around I could see that many people and Police Officers were now declining

        into shock.

        This procession of the dead and injured past our point seemed to continue for

        an eternity.       I myself cried on a number of occasions and the tension

        physically and mentally was awe inspiring, I felt alert but out of time;                      most

        strange.     At this moment a Superintendent, not known to me, addressed all

        sections of the crowd with a loud hailer asking for co-operation, he was

        applauded by the crowd, I then heard Kenny Dalglesh on the tannoy system doing

        the same thing.

        The next Police instruction was an intention to cancel the match, the dogs

        were brought out to face the crowd at the Spion Kop end in case of problems by

        the Nottingham crowd.          The announcement was given on the tannoy system that

        the match was cancelled and could the crowd delay their exit from the ground

        for five minutes to facilitate removal of casualties.                   No problems arose and

        the dogs were removed.          Within minutes of this announcement the Spion Kop

        emptied orderly.

        I redeployed my group of Officers outside the ground in Penistone Road to

        supervise the removal of the crowd by bus to the train station.                      Outside the

        ground most Officers seemed fully employed but some who had been called in

        later seemed at a loss, drivers in vehicles were directed by me to escort

        ambulances and foot Officers were directed to collect relatives together for

        identification purposes at the gymnasium and to direct persons to the Force

        coaches being used to transfer relatives to the receiving hospitals.

        I was requested at this point by Superintendent Bates to go mobile with my

        serial and supervise the crowd in Herries Road.                      Unfortunately, we had

        arrived in a bus and I had no idea where my serial was, we were all well

        dispersed by now.        In view of this, at 5.30 p.m. we were given an order to

        re-group in the North Stand, a good decision at just the right time.                         We

        re-grouped and sat down for a spell, everyone was distressed but we were all

        willing to keep going.

        It is at this point that my direct involvement with this event ceases.

        I was approached in the stand by Inspector Cooper with instructions from

        Superintendent Bates to gather together a team and to go to Barnsley Mortuary

        to set up a body reception facility.              I called together a group of Rawmarsh

        Officers present in the stand, they were a mixed group but at least I knew

        most of them.      The situation was explained to sixteen Officers that we had

        another grim job and they were given the option not to go, they felt that it

        was better to have an objective,and we all went to Claywheels Lane transport

        garage where after brief refreshments and obtaining transport I left a

        Sergeant and three Police Constables in the counselling area.

RE:       AUDIT TRIAL OF POLICE OFFICERS SELF TAKEN STATEMENTS,
          OR "OFFICERS RECOLLECTIONS"

Following on from my initial examination of the South Yorkshire Police Document Files from
which I prepared a schedule, a copy of which I gave to you when you visited Sheffield on
24 September 1997, I have now completed a further examination of non-indexed document files
within the Hillsborough archives.      In particular I have examined the personal files of
Chief Inspector Norman Bettison and Chief Superintendent Donald Denton and within these files
are a number of documents relating to the above.

I have produced a second schedule and copies of the appropriate parts of the documents
referred to which together with the first schedule show how in date order from 17 April 1989 to


a)       The decision that officers should make records of their recollections was arrived at. (NB1)
     i



b)       Solicitors acting for South Yorkshire Police were consulted. (D2)

c)       The officer leading the investigation for West Midlands Police was aware. (D10)

d)       How South Yorkshire Police officers were made aware of what should be included in their
         statements. (D18)

e)       The discussion with Counsel which shows he was aware of "Self-service" statements. (D28
         and NB2)

              Tel: 0114 220 2020 Fax: 0114 252 3855   Superintendent Hepworth
              Direct Dial No:
                                                      Tel
f)   That Counsel for Lord Justice Taylor was aware of self-service statements. (D46)

g)   That statements would be vetted by South Yorkshire Police legal representatives prior to
     them being forwarded to West Midlands Police. (D48, DD1)

h)   That Counsel for Lord Justice Taylor requested statements be made by officers from other
     forces to the criteria adopted by South Yorkshire. (D51)

i)   That it was made clear to officers when statements were requested from them that they
     would be subjected to vetting by solicitors prior to being forwarded to West Midlands Police.
     (DD2, DD5).

j)   That requests from West Midlands Police for officers' statements were recorded, that
     arrangements were made for the statements to be obtained, they were forwarded to
     solicitors for vetting and the solicitors comments were retained. (DD3, DD4, DD5, DD6 and
     DD7)

k)   That the requests for statements, the forwarding of them for vetting and returned comments
     can be married together. (DD2 and DD3 with DD4; DD6 with DD7)

I)   That on 23 May 1989 therefore was circulated about amendments to statements, following
     concerns expressed by some officers. (D62)

m)   That updated guidance on statement content was given to officers along with the request
     for their statement. (DD8)

n)   That Treasury Solicitors acting for Lord Justice Taylor were aware of police officers initial
     submissions, amendments to them and the production of signed final versions and
     therefore by implication Lord Justice Taylor was also aware. (D90 and D91)

Once again I do not feel I can take this subject any further forward without actually interviewing
people involved in the process.

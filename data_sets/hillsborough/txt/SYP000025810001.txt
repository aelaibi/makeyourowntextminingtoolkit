           Dear Mr. Jones,

           Hillsborough Stadium - General Safety Certificate - Spion Kop Capacity

           I refer to your letter of 4th May and to my reply of 12th May which by now
           you should have received.

           I note that my letter does not in fact refer to stewarding which you mention
           at the end of the second paragraph of your letter. I can confirm that
           according to the file the only mention of extra stewarding is in my letter
           to the Club dated 27th August, 1986 (document reference 3.171). As you can
           see the letter indicates that extra stewarding was to be provided during the
           next two matches to the satisfaction of the fire service and the police. As
           far as I am aware the Council has received no advice as to requirements for
           permanent additional stewarding at the Kop.

           If you need any further information please do not hesitate to contact me.
          fk
           Yours sincerely,




           Acting Head of Department.

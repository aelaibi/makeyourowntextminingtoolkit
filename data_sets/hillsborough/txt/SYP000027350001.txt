            Dear Assistant Chief Constable, Mr Jones

            I refer to our previous correspondence in respect of Lord Justice Taylor's
            inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster, and enclose five statements from
            West Yorkshire officers who attended Sheffield on the day in question.

            I also enclose a copy of a statement and correspondence addressed to the
            Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police dated 18 April 1989 for your
            information and attention.

            Because of annual leave and other commitments a number of statements remain
            which will be forwarded direct to you at the earliest opportunity.

            If there are any difficulties in this connection perhaps you would be good
            enough to ring me direct on the extension shown.

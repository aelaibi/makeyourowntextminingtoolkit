            My name is                           and I live at the above address with my

            family and have/done for 6 years.           I am currently attending

            Liverpool       supporter and have been all my life and have been

            attending the matches for about          10 ysrars.

            On Saturday 15th April       1989 (15048/)        I attended Sheffield Wednesday

            football groun/ for the cup semi/final match be                             ^ e / pT»ool

                                   car. We suffered no traffic delays on the way and

            eventually arrived at Sheffield at about half past twel_ve.                         I can't be

            specific where            parked the car but it was about ten minutes walk

            from the ground.      We went straight to the ground and although we saw

           Police    in presence, we knew roughly where the ground was and didn't

                 seeing anybody drinking alcohtyf on the way to the ground and arrived

                 at the gates at about half p/st two. There were no queues outside
 5 o . £
      !_ • L_ • the ground only a huge mass/ of people. Me and                went to the

                 right hand side of the rrifcyfs of people because there was more room than

                 the majority of people had, who were crushed on the other side of a

                 barrier.   We stood near to the blue concertina gate which opens onto

                 the S Stand alleyway.    It was   closed at the time and there was one

                 Policeman there together with a mounted Jj/oliceman who wasn't doing

                 much to control the crowd.     1 saw about^twenty or thirty people

                 climbing the turnstiles walking above/the entrance,          I think   it was to

                 escape the crush rather than to e^te^ without         paying. After about 5 or

                 10 minutes, an Officer    came down frorn the S StancLralley and knocked on

                 the gate and a steward opened it, the Officer t^en said,          "Let these

                 in," and he opened the gate. There must have yfceen about three

                 hundred people managed to get in before the/gates         closed again.     I

                 looked around as I had lost             by thejjf, and in fact I didn't see

                 tunnel, an/ could see to my front a mass of people down the Jmier end.

                 over to the left hand pen, which I b e l i e v ^ is Pen 4.    I moved into

                 the pen but became stationary about t j / i i feet into t h e 1 crowd, which was

                 very tight and crowded,    much more/Co than the Hop normally. The match

                 had just started when the croy/T suddenly surged forward,         probably due
VClQC            to the influx of people f r< m the tunnel. To my left was a man about 28
    O f-f-
                 years of age who had his arms around his girlfriend in front of him.

                 As the crowd surged forward suddenly he must have panicked and

                 suddenly turned round and head butted me on my left cheek.             I had said

              nothi ng to provoke the attack and like I said I think must have been

              due to the panic. Anyway he got carried away across to my left and I

             went forward with the surge.                                                    A?    /V"

              I ended up on a barrier down by the fence with the bar sticking                                         in my

              left    hand    side    of   my   pelvis,      as     my    body   was    turned    to   the   right.    I

2)01          couldn't       move    anywhere     as   people         crowded     all    around    me,   I was   panic
CO/y^>IO££
              stricken and was seriously worried for my lif^f. In front of me on the

              barrier was a lad about 30 years of age witp                               blonde collar        length

       ®      hair and clean shaven. He was bent double/over the bar and looked very

              blue in the face. He was totally motidnl^ss and I presumed him to be                                                y

              dead.    I somehow managed to help him up over the bar and together with

              others,    passed him up and over and he was passed down to the front

              that was the last I saw of that chap. When he had gone I became aware

              of another man, about 40 years of age with short dark hair and wearing

              a dark jacket. He was fairly fat and appeared unconscious but not

              dead. His head was trapped between the bar of the barrier and the back

              of somebody in front. As we managed to free him from the bar,                                      I held

              his head across the crux of my arm and saw his eyes flicker. He was

              then passed forward to the front of the crowd above everyone's heads.

              Eventually after about              15 minutes the crowd eased off slightly and I

              was able to get away from the bar and hobble forward towards the hole

              in the fence where the wire had been pulled down.                                  I was assisted by

           0 fJPg°Ple as * was having difficulty walking.                              As I g o t /#o the fence I saw

              I went through the fence and onto the pitch $m d sat down. All                                     round me

              were people milling around and eventually someone came to me and

              offered me water.            After a while I managed to get to my feet and

             walk around looking for                              and                     eventually found me and

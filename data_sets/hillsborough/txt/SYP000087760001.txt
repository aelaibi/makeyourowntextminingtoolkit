I got my ticket          for the m atch from Liverpool                  Football        C l u b , it was a

six    pound ground ticket                for the Leppings       Ln terracing.



At about 9.00am          (0900)          on the morning      of S a t u rd a y    15th April     1989



               to meet a number             of friends who were also               travelling        to

Sheffield       for the semi-final



There were about             fifteen of us travelling               to S h ef fi el d    in three

separate       cars.



In my    car    I was    taking



                                         he has just m oved and         I d o n ’t know his          new

address and also my                late friend Peter McDONNELC.



ihere were another                two    cars   t r/jfve 11 i ng wit h us to Sheffield,          one was

being driven by                                     I don't     know his address,            but his

telephone       number       is                         there were     four      passengers     in

               car     but         d o n ’t know the details         of the      passengers.



 he gthar       car was       being       driven by

                                                                    , there were either              three or

four    passengers       in his          car,   again    I don* t know their         details.



After   sorting        ourselves          out the three      cars    s.et off for S h e f f i e l d at

about   9. 2 0 a m   (0920),        all    travelling      together.



The    route we took was                the M62 to Leeds and then the Ml m o t o r w a y to
                                                                                                               PAGE           3
                                                                                                               S3202

Shef f ie'id, we got, into S he f fi e ld at about                       il.IQaro         ( 1 1 10 ).    We   never

had any delays            in our    journey and we drove direct                           to S he f fi e ld without

stopping.



Whe n we got to S he f fi e ld we drove                    into the       city centre and went                      for a

dr i nk at a pub called the                  *           Duck*.        We stopped at the                  pub for

about    half an hour a nd JJ'fad one                    pint    lager.



We    left   the Mucky Duck Pub,                 all   fifteen of us together went                         back to

the    cars and drove         to Hillsborough.                  All    three        cars     parked by a pub

close    to the ground,            but   I       c a n ’t remember what             the    pub was        called.

The    pub was about         five    or ten minutes walk away                        from Leppings L.n.



We    parked our      cars at this               pub at about         1 2 . 15 pm          15),    we tried to

get    in the      pub to have a drink,                 but the       pub'udas       packed and we            couldn't

get to the         bar.    This     pub was         full      of Liverpool           supporters.



Beca us e    the    pub was    so full we walked up to another                               pub,       up a hill,        I

c a n ’t remember         the name of the              pub.     We got      to this p ther               pub a4- about,

■12. 30 pm   ( 1230) , this        pub was also full              of Liverpool               suj>fforte rs .         We

had about       three or four            pints and stayed at                         PjJJz u n t i l about, 2.3Gpni_

(1430).



Whilst we were            in this    pub it was a good atmosphere,                             I never        saw any

signs    of any kind of trouble,                    neither did I see anyone who                          x w ou id say

was    drunk.



W he n we    left    the    pub at about 2.3 Q p m              (1430)       it took us about                 ten

minutes      to walk       to the football              ground.

During     this ten minute walk          to the ground we          never got any Police

directions       or escort,     there w e r e n ’t any P o l i c em e n visible         on the      route

we wal ke d to the ground.             The    route we walked was along a main                  road to

some    shops    on our    left and to a set of traffic                lights,      we turned       left

at    the traffic    lights     into Lappings Ln and a pp ro a ch e d the turnstiles

from    the d irection of the bridge.



We a r ri ve d at the Leppings Ln entrance                  to the ground at about 2 . 4 5 p m




Of the group of us who           had    left Liverpool,         some had seat          tickets and

others,    like me,       had ground tickets        for the Leppings Ln terraces.                        Me

and the four       people who        had travelled wit h me         in my        car all    had ground

tickets    for the L e p p i n gs Ln terraces.



Whe n we got      to the area outside           the entrance we split              up to go to

different       turnstiles.      I sta;            i

Whe n we arrived outside             the entrance      to the ground,            at about 2,,45-prri

(•1445),   there was       no or ga ni se d                  .st a huge mass of            people.

The    outer    perimeter    gates were                        in the area between            the

outer    gates and the       turnstiles       there was a huge mass of                people,    who

a p p e a r e d to be very tight ly      packed    in together.



T here was a further         large mass       of people s preading           backwards       from the

outer    perimeter    gates well        into the    road      in Leppings Ln,



The    five of us joined onto           this mass      of    people,    intending       to work          our

way forwards       towards     the    terrace   turnstiles.

           Whilst       in this mass       of people       in Leppingy'Ln,              at about 2. 4 5 p m     ( 1445) ,

            I could see a .P ol i ce m an        standing      on            roof of the terrace

            turnstiles,        the P o l i c em a n was    pull           you ng s t e r s u p onto t h e r o o f ,

            these y oungsters were             climbing     up onto        the turnstiles,          out of the mass

           of    people     below.



           The    only Pol ic em an       I could see,       apart        from the one on the turnstile

            roof,   was     one moun te d O f f i c e r , whose horse was stuck                   in the middle         of

           a mass of        people      on the outside        (road side)             of the outer      gates.        The

           horse was        stuck and      the P o l i c e ma n was       shouting at          people   to get       back

           and    shouting?       " D o n ’t worry,    y o u ’ll all       get       in,"



           I also       saw a P ol i ce m an   in a flat       cap starring             by the outer       perimeter

           g a t e s , he was opening and            closing      one jrf1 the gates,            to try and      control

           the    number of people getting                througrr^the turnst i l e $ .



            I never      saw any stewards         outside      the gr/und             in the turnstile area



           We had no control            about what        direction we wa nt ed               to move   in,    the    crowd

           e ve nt ua ll y moved us across            to the area by the West S tand turnstiles,

           we were       being    crushed up against           the outer         perimeter        gates,      w hich were

    JA P    closed.        I c o u l d n ’t see anv Police          in t/ie^/area of the West S tand

^          At    this    time,    about 2. 5 5 p m    ( 1 4 5 5 ) , all    five of us were still               together

           and to escape          the   crush we      climbed over the outer                   gates and dropped

           down J^nto the area            in front     of the gates and^/£l?adi ng up to the W e s t

S tand and North Stand turnstile areas.



Ail    five     of us m a na ge d to stay together and we tried to work                                      our way

a l ongside      the wall         towards    the turnstiles.                    The   crushing was as              bad

inside as        it had been outside,            we were         being           crushed up against                the

w a l 1 and the       pressure was          so bad I could feel                    the     wall moving s li ghtly

and    I was getting w o rr ie d that            the wall might                    collapse on          top of      us.

E v e n t u a l l y all   five of us still           together m a na ge d to fight                      our way

through the         crush to a turnstile.



I think       it was      just a short        time after 3pm              <15Q0)           when we      got to the

turnstile,        a l t h ou gh    1 cannot    be certain.



I showed the turnstile                operator my ticket,                 which was for the terrace

turnstiles.          He told me        I couldn't       go in,        I         was at the wrong

turnstiles.           I told him       I was stuck and            c o u l d n ’t get back out,                 he

still     said,     “You    c a n ’t come     in."


 L

 ecause       I couldn't          get back out       I just      jumped over the turnstile                          and

got    into     the ground.



I was     the    last one of our            group of five         to go through the turnstiles.

When    I got     inside     the ground        I met up> w ith Peter M c DO NN EL L and _________

                                      and                        had a l re a dy gone              into the West

Stand.



I saw a P o l ic e m an walk in g around              in the area behind the West S tand

turnstiles.           I went       up to the P o li ce ma n and told him how bad                             it was

o utside and that           I thought        someone was going                   to get killed,              The

              Po 1 i cetrian never      replied a nd just          laughed and walked away from me,                         I

              c a n ’t remember what             this P o li ce ma n   looked    like,    I d o n ’t think          I would

              recognise        him a g a i n .



              As best as        I can estimate we had got                through the turnstile at about

              one   or two minutes          past        three o ’clock    (1501)    (1502),



              There was a steady stream of                   people going up a                 rway    into     the West

0/n-          S t an d seating area.              Myself,    Peter and                          decided to try and

              qet up into the seats                in the West /StancKto view the match.

              There was a P ol i ce m an and P o l i c ew o ma n on the             bottom of the s ta irway

              checking       peoples     tickets at         random.



              Peter M c D O N N E LL went         to the stairway first and m an ag ed to -jet through

              w ith ou t    having    his ticket          checked,     I saw him walk up the stairway

              towards       the West Stand.



              M ys e l f and                            then tried to get up the stairway,                    but   the

              Police       checked our tickets             and we were      t old we     c o u l d n ’t get    in the

              seats,       we were    told to go and see another                P o li ce ma n who was         standing

              nearby,       show him our tickets and he w ould                   let us     into the ground

              turnstiles area.



              I could see through a gate                   in a wall.       1 could see that           people were

              coming through the terrace                   turnstiles,       I could see that the Pol i cernan

              was   5 1 i11 up on the            roof of the      terrace    turnstiles        pulling        people      up

              and out       of the    crush,



              I thought        to myself         that    I was   not going      to be    put out      in the        crush

          a ga i n and me and                         decided to try and sneak                  nto the West

          Stand *



          E v e n t u a l l y myself and                                     id to get up into the Weslj

          I remember Peter BE A R D S L E Y hit^/the                 cross   bar.



          The       last     time   I saw ? j.    r   Me DONN E L L was about        three minutes      beforj

          BEARDSLEY           hit t ia^:ross b a r , as me and                        had gone      towards      the

          s t a irway to l/y and get              in the first         time.    1 can remember         seeing

              eter M c D g N N E L L walking      up the West Stand e n t r a n c e stairway.                I
* w n >         n e m h /r   seeing him stop and walk             back down a couple of steps.                   I

              iuo/duse he was         looking    for me and                             As he wa l k e d back
          H
              irawn these      couple    of steps       I think      the P o 1 iceman at the        bottom       of the

          s t a i r w a y must have asked             to see P e t e r ’s ticket,      because      1 saw him turn

          back around and walk                 back    up the stairway and out of my                view. I then

          saw the P o l ic e ma n foliow Peter                 up the stairway,         I suppose     1the

          P o l i c e m a n was     going after Peter           to check his ticket.            I n&ver, saw

          Peter M e D ON N E L L again after             that    time.



          lihen I got          up into the back          of the West Stand,           a-T""! have    p r eviously

              said,    Peter B E A RD S LE Y hit       the   cross    bar,   a^hort      time after      this        I saw

          a P o l ic e m a n wearing a flat             cap run onto^^ie         pitch and then the g a m e

          was       stopped.



              It was just after          the game       had s t o p p ed that       I noticed   people were

              climbing       over the    fence     in front      of the L ep pi ng s Ln terraces and onto

              the   Q-itch.     As they were          trying    to get over         the fencing     some of the

              supporters       were    being     pushed back      into the t e r r a c ing by       uhe Polit.e._

At, first     I just    thought      that the fans were        invading the
                                                                        ^
                                                                                     pitch.         I only

realised that something              serious    had h a p pened when       I saw people            lying

on the    pitch and other           people giving      them m ou th to m ou th         resuscitation.



I d i d n ’t see a barrier          break    in the terraces,       I did not see any signs

of any kind of d isturbance             or other     trouble.



I never     saw any signs       of surging on the terraces               behind the goal,             but

I have to say that          the terracing         behind the goal was so             packed that           I

d o n ’t think     there was any       room for a surge        to occur.



To the best        of my k no wledge        I. never w it n es s ed any deaths,          I was      not    in

a position to be able           to assist any of the dead or                 injured supporters.



W hen   I last saw Peter H e D O N N E L L,       on the stairway        leading       to the West

S ta n d seating area,        he was    in good health.           To the best of my

k no wledge     he had not been        injured     in the   crush outside          the turnstiles,

neither     had    I or any of the others who tra ve ll ed               in my car.



I went    to the FA Cup semi-final              last year    (1988)      (Qj3Q0S8) at

Hi 11s b o r o u g h , the re we re a lot more P o l i c e me n ajr last years                game,

There weren't        a s u fficient     number of Po 1 i cerryjn outside            the ground, this.

year    and as fa r as       I am    concerned no control          of s u p p o r t e r s .    I

think    this     lac k of o rg an is a ti o n and   control      by the Police          c ontributed

to   causing      the deaths and       injuries O f f e r e d .



After    the game had been stopped               I think the Police were, vj^ry slow                  in

reacting      to what was      happening       in the terraces.           I think the medi cal

services and a m bulances            should have got to the scene quicker                      than they

did.

            There were        no stewards            inside the g r o u n d to direct            the supp or te rs         to

            other areas        of the terracing,                 also      the   loud speakers were          not used as

            they should have                  been to direct          people     in the terraces       to emptier

            areas.



            I left the football                   ground at          I think at about      r?pm <1700)       with

                                                    and                          we all met      up back by the

            cars,        eventually everyone               from the three          cars    turned up except          for

            Peter McDONNfcLL.



            We went        to a hospital            in Sheffield,           I c a n ’t remember w hich one,           to try

            and Krace Peter MeDONNELL,                     when he failed to              return to the       cars,    but

            we were        unable            to find any    record of him.           E v e nt u al l y all   three    cars

            returned home to Liverpool.

Dear Lord Justice Taylor.

Following the tragedy at Hillsborough, the All-Party Football
Commi ttee had an urgent meeting to discuss the a-f-fair. The
Committee decided unanimously to request that, at a suitable
time, we give evidence to your enquiry as legislators who do
love and have knowledge o-f our national game. We did take
part in the Popplewell Inquiry some -four years ago and -feel,
once again, that we have a valuable contribution to make.

I look -forward to hearing -from you,


Yours sincerely,
          ■

Tom Pendry MP
Chairman o-f the All-Party Football Committee,

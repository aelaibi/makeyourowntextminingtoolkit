      Dear Sirs

      Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


      If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
      of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
      on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
      due course.

      I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
      evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
      coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
      inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

      Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
      under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
      witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
      this and in determining who I wish to invite    to attend.

      Without prejudice in any way to my rights in    the matter, I am writing toyou
      to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
      appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
      consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

      May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
      attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

      I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
      names for consideration is nothing more than    that, and that   thedecision as
      to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

      I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
      heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
      submit.

      Yours ^faithfully

  We acknowledge receipt of the summary in respect of the above and can inform you that Mrs Burke, Ian
  Burke, Christine, Peter Murphy and Social Worker tfeureen Rowe will be attending the inquest. However,
  they would like further information upon the blood ethanol analysis. In those circumstances we would
  be grateful if you would arrange for Dr. Forrest to be in attendance or the pathologist Professor
  Jones to be in a position to answer the families questions upon the level of ethanol and its likely
  effect upon the deceased.

 Re: HENRY THOMAS BURKE (deceased) No.31.

  As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
  Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
  be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
  on the 15th of January 1990.

  I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
  has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
  behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
  Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

  I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
  Prosecutions has announced his decision aa to what action (if any)
  he may wish to undertake.

  I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
  or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
  matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
  a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
  on this matter further.

  I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
  is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
  fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

  Yours faithfully,



  S.L.Popper,
  H.M. Coroner.

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

         Dear Sirs,

 )       Re: HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS - YOUR CLIENT - LINDA HOWARD.

         With reference to your letter of the 29th of August and my subsequent letter,
         I am writing to let you know that I have decided to ask David Anthony Lackey
         to give evidence at the resumed inquest. Very provisionally he is expected
         to give evidence in the week beginning 26.11.90.

         If your client wished to hear his evidence can you please make sure that you
         (or the solicitor for the Steering Committee if they represent you at the
         Inquest) check with the listing officer, Sgt. Tredgold -              to
         check the date and time.

         The other gentleman you mention (Christopher Cartmell) does not appear to
         have been with the deceased on the terrace and in any case, seems to be a
         friend of Mr. Howard Senior deceased.


         Yours faithfully,




         S.L.Popper,
         H.M.Coroner.

o               Dear Sirs

                Re     Hillsborough Inquests

                We act on behalf of Mrs Linda Howard of ______________________________
                ________________ who lost her ex-husband/ Thomas Howard/ and her 14 year
                old son; Thomas Anthony Howard/ in the above tragedy.

                From the Coroner's depositions/ we note that there were two witnesses in the
                crowd who attempted to rescue both Mr Howard Jnr and Mr Howard Snr, their
                names are given in the depositions as David Anthony Lackey/ and Christopher
                Cartmell.

                Our client is still extremely distressed by the loss of her loved ones and
                feels that if she could contact the above two gentlemen who were the last
                people really to speak to either her son or her ex-husband whilst they were
                alive/ it may ease her suffering.

                We would be grateful therefore if you could either kindly provide us with
                their addresses/ so that we or our client can contact them direct/ or if you
                feel that this would not be appropriate/ perhaps you would contact those two
                gentlemen direct and let them have our client's address/ so they can, if they
                wish/ contact her direct.

                We thank you in anticipation of your kind and sympathetic co-operation.

                 ours faithfully

        Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


        If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
        of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
        on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
        due course.

        I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
        evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
        coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
        inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

        Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
        under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
        witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
        this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

        Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
        to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
        appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
        consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

        May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
        attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

        I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
        names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
        to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

        I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
        heard from you by the end of     ember I will assume you have no names to
        submit.

        Yours faithfully.

                       We   have been asked by Mrs Linda Howard of
                                                     to assume the conduct and investigation of
                       matters arising out of the Hillsborough Disaster, on her behalf. Mr
                       Howard Senior was her former husband, and Thomas was her 14 year old
                       son. As indicated, we have been instructed to pursue matters and should
                       be pleased if you could let us have copies of the post mortem reports.
                       Any necessary fee will of course be discharged.

                       We look forward to hearing from you in early course.

Dear            Sirs,

He:
                         m m m          hqwmd bo.i*
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990,

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
n*atter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
aj substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours, faithfully,

        Dear M r s . Howard,

        Re THOMAS ANTHONY HOWARD (deceased).

         There is one other detail which we require for registration purposes in the
         case of young people who died under the age of sixteen.

         That information is the                  occupation if any of the mother. Unfortunately we
         have not got a record                    of this in your case and I     would be  grateful if you
         could please complete                    the attached form, sign and date     it  and return itin
         the envelope provided                    by return of post.


         Yours sincerely,



         S.L.Popper,

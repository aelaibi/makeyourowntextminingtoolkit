BACKGROUND



The contents and recommendations of this advisory document are based

upon    the    research        findings   of    a Football      Working    Group which was

established within the Greater Manchester Police in February 1992.                        The

group's report was published locally in September 1992 and initially

presented at a national level to the Football Licensing Authority.                           It

is as a result of consultation with and the support of that body that

the present report has been produced.                       Whilst   the report does not

purport       to   be    all    embracing,     it   is    nonetheless     recommended   as     a

guidance document on the policing of football matches nationally.                            The

proposals contained herein have relevance for every Force tasked with

the policing of football games and other major sporting events.                         It is

suggested that its principles are adopted throughout England and Vales.



During    the      course      of    the Working      Group's    research    (which   focused

primarily on            the   eight Greater Manchester          clubs), a     further   eight

football clubs outside the Greater Manchester Police Force area were

identified for comparison purposes.                   In addition, particular clubs and

Police Forces which had been identified as being progressive (in terms

of 'best practice') were studied.                   Visits were made to each club and

their     respective           Police     division,       the   stewarding    and     policing

operations         observed,        and the    findings    reported accordingly.        It    is

 therefore inevitable that reference may be made in the body of this
document to procedures              and working practices within,                 for    instance,

Greater Manchester (or any of the areas studied), which will not be

applicable to other Police areas.                 Flexibility of interpretation may be

necessary by individual Forces.



CURRENT ATTITUDES TO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL



During the 1970's, the behaviour of the football hooligan became the

scourge of our nation's football grounds and their environs.                              In order

to control and contain the manifold forms of anti-social behaviour

displayed,    both        football clubs         and the Police necessarily utilised

elaborate,    manpower          intensive    measures       which       proved    successful     in

preventing and deterring such behaviour.



In   the   1980's        two   events,     the Bradford         Fire    and   the Hillsborough

Stadium Disaster, were instrumental in changing attitudes towards the

marshalling        and     control    of     football      supporters.           The    safety   of

spectators     as        opposed     to    the   prevention       of     hooliganism       assumed

paramouncy.



Despite      the     widely         held     view        that     the     threat        posed    by

football-associated violence has now abated,                        the policing levels at

football grounds remain fairly high                  (although numbers have recently

started to fall in some areas). The high levels have been maintained

because     the     Police         generally      have     increasingly          taken    on     the

responsibility for ensuring the safety of the public and the clubs have

been more than happy for them to do so.
I
    1.6   Much   of   the    Police    operation at     football   grounds   remains   directed

          towards public safety, as evidenced by specific references to Police

          roles and responsibilities in this regard in many match operational

          orders.     The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds, more commonly referred

          to     as   'The    Green    Guide'   is unequivocal     in    stating   where   that

          responsibility is vested (paragraph 28):-


                  ■The responsibility for the safety of spectators lies at all
                  times with the ground management, i.e. those who stage the
                  event and/or administer the ground. Local authority safety
                  officers, police and fire officers will advise management on
                  how to discharge this responsibility and, in certain
                  circumstances, may require measures to be taken in order to
                  achieve reasonable safety standards.       This does not,
                  however,   exonerate   the   ground  management   from   its
                  responsibilities for the safety of spectators.”

9   1.7   The     management's        relationship with   the   Police    and the division of

           responsibilities between the two is expanded upon in paragraph 286 of

           the Guide:-

9                 "...   for management    to discharge    its  responsibility
                  properly, a special police presence inside the ground may be
                  necessary. The number and disposition of the Police must be
                  determined by the Chief Police Officer in whose area the
                  ground is located.   Where there is such a presence there
                  should be a clear, written understanding or "statement of
                  intent" agreed between the police and the ground management
                  setting out the functions and responsibilities of each as to
                  crowd safety...   Dealing with disorder (as distinct from
                  normal ground operations and crowd management on the
                  premises) as in any other circumstances will fall to the
                  police."


    1.8    The   Football     Licensing     Authority's document        entitled   "Guidance   on

           Safety Certificates" published in May 1992, is equally specific.                Under

           the section entitled "Responsibility for Safety" it states (paragraph
1          3.1);-


a
                                                  -3-
i
             "The   Safety  Certificate  should make   it  clear  that
             responsibility for the safety of spectators lies with the
             certificate holder and not with the police or certifying
             authority."


       On the subject of "Division of Responsibility" (paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2)

       the philosophy outlined above is further reinforced:*


             "The role of the police is to maintain public order and to
             prevent the commission of offences... all safety-related
             tasks and posts should be assumed to he the responsibility
             of the certificate holder, all public order-related ones
                                                                                 1
             that of the police."


1.9    These statements clearly spell out the message to both football clubs

       and Police Forces alike.   Other signals have also been sent to these

       bodies, the most impactive emanating from the Home Office.



       FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS



1.10   Since the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report into the

       Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, hitherto overlooked considerations have

       assumed importance in the present financial climate.



1.11   Recommendation 53 of that report stated:-


             "Police Authorities should review the charges they make to
             clubs for the costs of policing inside grounds so as to
             ensure that realistic charges are made.     The Home Office
             should take steps to ensure consistency of practice, subject
             to local discretion and the need to have regard to local
             circumstances."


1.12   As a direct result, on the 22nd May 1991,    the Home Office forwarded

       circular no.   36/1991 to all Chief Constables   in England and Wales.




                                      .4.
           This document (Appendix G) concluded by asking all Police authorities

           to     introduce    arrangements        for     the   realistic        charging     for   Police

           services supplied in relation to football matches.



    1.13   The    response    □£   some      Police Authorities          to     this   request has       been

           swifter than others.             In one area studied, the "realistic charging" to

           a    particular     football       league     club    would   have     resulted     in    a   987X

           increase in their Police bill, had the full effect of costing at the

           then current manpower levels been imposed.



    1.14   The Football Trust has also been responsible for focusing the attention

           of club accountants on policing costs.                      From the commencement of the

           1992/93 season, grants awarded to clubs to defray Police costs are no

           longer available to members of the Premier League.                            Clubs from the

           lower divisions are encouraged to improve stewarding arrangements as a

           result of a change In the formula used to calculate grant aid, with a

           greater proportion of the total funds being made available solely for

    1.15   The cumulative effect of the guidelines and directives issued by the

           Home Office, Police Authorities, the Football Licensing Authority and

           the Football Trust is likely to have the following results:-

              number of officers deployed at football matches.



1.16   If   certain clubs were not to do this, and if Police staffing levels

       remained      static,      some   clubs    would        be   in   danger     of   going     into

       liquidation.



1.17   It   is     against      this   background       that    this     document    advocates      the

       development of a common approach to the policing of football matches,

       It also recommends that Forces take steps to initiate action at local

       level as follows:-



       1.     A critical examination of                the resourcescurrently deployed at

                 each Premier League and Football League ground and an assessment

                 of future needs.



       2.     An examination of a phased               withdrawal of Police for all purposes

                 other   than    preventing      and    dealing     with    outbreaks     of     public

              disorder,      preventing the commission of offences                   and assisting

                 clubs   (under        certain    circumstances)           in   fulfilling        their

                 responsibilities to public safety.



       3.     The adoption of a Statement of Intent,                       based upon a standard

              model.

    2.1       Several Forces have already initiated reviews                of staffing levels at:

              football grounds.           It is recommended that this process be formalised

              and   extended         nationally.   Once     initiated,   a rolling   programme   of

              reviews following the broad principles outlined in the "Future Policy*

              section of this report will inevitably lead to more efficient policing

              and financial savings to both clubs and Police.



    2.2        It is suggested that an independent,             objective assessment be made of

               Police resources currently deployed at all football grounds.                  It is

               likely that in many cases it will be possible to make immediate staff

               reductions.      In addition, it may be possible to identify certain posts,

               currently filled by Police officers, which would be suitable for future

               replacement by a properly trained steward.



    2.3        Proposed policing levels should be flexible yet justifiable                and take

               into account the "best practice" recommendations              discussed in Section 5

               of this report.          Ultimately, Police staffing levels should reflect the

               -realistic potential         for public disorder that       remains at a specific

               game.



        2.4    A. reduction in inter-divisional abstractions,               coupled with increased

               operational availability of officers are just two of the benefits which

               will accrue to Forces locally.               The financial attraction to football


I              clubs to improve their stewarding operation is potentially huge.                  The

               replacement of Police officers at football grounds bv properly trained

I               stewards is undoubtedly the wav forward.



                                                          -7-
This process will be helped by the much clearer definition of the

division of responsibility between a football club and the Police at a

particular game.     (This is discussed in more detail in Section 3).         The

speed of change will mainly rely on the willingness               of a club    to

enhance its stewarding arrangements.         An increasing number of clubs

have already recognised this, no doubt as a way of reducing policing

costs, and are actively improving the numbers, quality and training of

their stewards.



As   stewarding   levels   at   clubs   increase   and   their   professionalism

develops, Police     Commanders will be     able   to reduce     their policing

commitment accordingly.     Such a phasing process will ultimately lead to

more football games being policed solely by club stewards under the

control of the ground safety officer.        A Police reserve may be held in

the ground, but only deployed to deal with occurrences of disorder or

criminal offences.     The policing of problems          away from the ground,

(traffic, town centre patrols etc.) should also be the subject of a

general review.
PHASED WITHDRAWAL OF POLICE OFFICERS FROM FOQTRATT fljPflTIWRg



BACKGROUND



Considerable controversy was aroused during the course of the public

enquiry   into   the   Bradford    Fire    Disaster   as   to   the   individual

responsibilities of club and Police.         In paragraph 3.6 of his interim

report, Mr. Justice Popplewell quoted from a report produced for the

Minister of Housing and Local Government in 1969, as follows


     "The responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is
     divided between the police and the club operating the ground.
     The broad line of division being that police are responsible
     for movement of spectators in public thoroughfares and from
     public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is
     responsible for the control of spectators once they are on
     Che club's premises..."


Mr. Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with that view and went

on to observe that to all intents and purposes the Police have to take

charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour.              He then

said (paragraph 3.8 of his report):


      “It follows, therefore, that as a matter of practice, while
      the physical safety of the building and the maintenance and
      good housekeeping of the ground must always be          the
      responsibility of the club, the police have to take the de
      facto responsibility of organising the crowd, with all that
      entails, during the game..."


 In practice, the Police have in the past assumed responsibility for the

 control and safety of spectators within grounds           and indeed in many

 areas continue to do so.         This    is reflected in much of the Police

 planning.   For example, in one Police division's Match Order, a duty of

 a Match Commander is stated to be:-
     "to liaise with the club Safety Officer to ensure that all
     programmed safety measures have been implemented and checks
     carried out prior to the admission of the public into the
     ground."


Another example of a perceived role of a Hatch Commander is to:-


     "Determine strategy, policy, control and monitor events to
     achieve the declared intent of the operation, with particular
     regard to the safety of all spectators."


Within the same document, one of the declared intentions of the Police

operation is "to ensure, as far as possible,        for the safety of all

spectators/visitors attending the ground."



Whilst in many ways it is admirable and reflective of Police attitudes

towards public safety in general that they have stepped forward and

assumed this responsibility, this is not without a potential sanction

against a Chief Constable or Individual members of a Force.



In many Forces the policing service provided at football games has

evolved through informal arrangements developed as a result of local

contacts with clubs.      Little thought,   if any, has been given to the

division of responsibility and the Police have often assumed almost

total control.



From this informality it naturally follows that if, in providing this

service,   the   Police    expressly   or    by   implication   accept   any

responsibility for   crowd safety or control,      then a Chief Constable
and/or any individual officers may be           liable   for   damagesif their

actions in this regard were considered negligent.



If, therefore, in the example quoted at paragraph 3.3 above, the club

Safety Officer did not carry out his/her duty to                    ensure    that all

programmed safety measures had been implemented, and                 there were, for

example, no fire extinguishers within a particular stand which caught

fire and resulted in injury or the death of spectators, then the Chief

Constable and the Hatch Commander could conceivably be held negligent

and liable for damages.



In reality,   although Police Forces have accepted responsibility for

crowd safety and control      at football matches,           themajority of           the

practical measures put into place to ensure crowd safety and control

are carried out by the club and some of this is generally duplicated by

the Police.   In fact few of these measures are implemented solely by

the Police.   Appendix F, which is by no means an exhaustive list, gives

examples of these measures.         The extent of this duplication will of

course vary from one ground to another, but is used to illustrate the

general situation.



Whilst the Police match day operation has, in the past, been directed

towards   safety,   the most positive        function performed by           Police    to

 ensure safety is simply being present and maintaining law and order.

This   influence    will   remain   during    the   course     of    any     change    in

 responsibility for safety issues, for as long as a Police presence is

maintained inside football grounds.
       CURRENT ATTITUDES



3.10   Although the division of responsibilities between individual football

       clubs and the Police has been the subject of some disagreement, there

       are now many authorities which place responsibility for the safety and

       control of spectators squarely at the feet of the individual clubs.

       Indeed,     in    his      final   report,       Mr.   Justice       Popplewell,        having

       reconsidered the issue expressed the following view:-


            "Because, as a matter of practice, police officers have
            regularly attended in large numbers at football grounds, it
            has somehow been assumed by the clubs that the responsibility
            for control of what goes on inside the ground has passed from
            them to the police, A police presence is there to assist in
            the enforcement of law and order.      Those responsible for
            organising a private function, however, have the primary and
            continuing obligation and responsibility to ensure reasonable
            safety for those who are invited on to their premises."


       The two publications quoted at paragraphs 1.6 - 1.8 above : The Green

       Guide     and    The    Football   Licensing       Authority's       Guidance     on    Safety

       Certificates       each     reflect      the    view   that    the     football    club     is

       responsible       for     the   safety     of    spectators,     the    Police     for     the

       maintenance of public order and the prevention of offences.



3.11   Many football clubs now acknowledge their responsibilities                         and some

       clubs have declared this in their Statement of Safety Policy.                          One such

       document states that it is a specific responsibility of the club:-


               "to ensure that the stewards control and direct members of
               the public who are entering, leaving or within the ground
               thereby ensuring their reasonable safety.     Stewards will
               direct spectators to seats and other areas, retain clear
               gangways and generally enforce the ground regulations for
                                                                                                         11
               the reasonable safety of persons within the ground."



                                                -12'
3.12    The introduction of full cost recovery for Police services at football

        matches   necessitates       the   adoption     of more      specific      and    formalised

        arrangements for the supply of this service under Section 15(1) of the

        Police Act 1964.       In order to circumvent the problems associated with

        previous arrangements, i.e. the implications arising out of the assumed

        responsibilities       of Police     officers;      the potential          for    litigation

        should    negligence    be    alleged;    the    lack   of    any    clear       and   defined

        division of responsibility between clubs and Police, it is also vital

        that a Specification of Section 15(1) Services is also prepared.                            A

        model for these documents is shown at Appendix A.



3.13    This Specification (which is discussed more fully in Section 4 with

        Statement of Intent), for the first time provides a clear definition of

        the Special Police Services at football games.                      Briefly,      this is to

        arrest offenders, keep the peace and prevent offences.                           There is no

        responsibility for ensuring safety of persons in the stadium.



3.14    The document effectively avoids liability in relation to safety and

        with a new and much simpler Statement of Intent approaches Lord Justice

        Taylor's    criteria.        Taken together      and with the acknowledgement by

         football clubs     of changed circumstances            and their responsibilities,

         these    new   arrangements       have   already   proved      to    be     an    acceptable

         alternative.     In any event an order made by a club for the supply of

         Special Police     Services under        Section 15(1) has          to acknowledge        the

         Specification outlined above.



 3.15    With the establishment of a clear responsibility for Police at football
       matches and an increasing acceptance by clubs of their responsibility,

       the concept of phased withdrawal is not only feasible but is already a

       reality to Police and to several clubs in at least one Force area who

       see   the    replacement    of    Police   officers   by    stewards      as   a way    of

       sustaining commercial viability.



3.16   The fact that the more successful clubs may wish to sustain high levels

       of Police services should not detract from the concept of phasing.

       They too should be encouraged to follow the general trend and increase

       their level of stewarding.



       TMPT-EMENTATION



3.17   In order to further improve the conditions for, and affect the speed of

       phasing, there are a number of factors which need to be considered by

       Police and football clubs.



       Statement of Intent



3.18   A model Statement of Intent (see Section 4 and Appendix B) has been

       drafted and complements the Specification for Police Services referred

       to in paragraph 3.13 above.           The Statement describes the division of

       responsibility between the Police and a club                 and,       once agreed and

       signed      by   both,   should    form    an    appendix   to    the    ground      Safety

       Certificate.       It    is much simpler        than previous     examples     and    clubs

       should find little         to prevent      its agreement.        In the event of any

       issues being raised, then this should be pursued through the respective

       Safety Advisory Group,



                                             -14-
     Britten Statement: of Safety Policy



19 The     Football Licensing Authority's         Guidance    on Safety       Certificates

     recommends that all football league and premier league clubs should

     issue their own written Statement of Safety Policy.                   Many clubs have

     not yet produced such a document and should be encouraged to do so via

     the appropriate Safety Advisory Croup.             Such a document should confirm

     to    the   Match    Commander   the    division   of,   and    the   acceptance     of,

     responsibility by the club.



     Safety Certificates



20 It is in the interest of Match Commanders to ensure that they have

     copies of the relevant Safety Certificate and associated documents.

     Any default on the part of the club should be brought to the notice of

     the Safety Advisory Group.          This has not always happened.           Similarly,

     Match Commanders should try to persuade the certifying authorities, via

     the Safety Advisory Groups,         to format the Safety Certificate in line

     with current Football Licensing Authority Guidelines.



     Match CnMMTiilBr




21   By now it should be evident that the documents necessary to formalise

     the policing of football games henceforth clearly define the respective

     role of the Police and football club.              This fundamentally changes the

     role of the Match Commander (described more fully in paragraph 4.25),

     and    largely      removes   him/her   from the    invidious    position    faced    in

     respect of liability under the hitherto informal policing arrangements.
                                                                                              I
3.22   Briefly, the main role of the Match Commander will be to: -



         (i)    maintain law and order,

        (ii)    assist the club with their responsibility for safety and crowd

                control.



3.23   This raises    a number of issues, first of which is the title of Match

       Commander.     It is true that in the past,             the senior   Police officer

       present has    commanded the whole match day operation.              This, however,

       can no    longer be   the     case    as the   Police    are   relinquishing   their

       previously assumed and accepted responsibilities towards safety. This

       will now fall on the club,           no doubt via the club's Safety Officer.

       With this in mind, it is believed that the term 'Match Commander'                 is

       wholly inappropriate.       It paints a misleading picture and perpetuates

       past practices in the minds of Police and club officials and employees.

       The title Police Commander would be more appropriate.



3.24   During the course of his/her duties, the Police Commander, because of

       his/her knowledge and experience, may well be called upon to offer

       advice and assistance to the club in order that                  it may fulfil its

       responsibility to crowd safety.         Whilst every effort should be made to

       assist, any advice must be exactly that and safety decisions should be

       made by the club or         its   representative.        Any divergence   from this

       policy will imply that the Police have in fact assumed responsibility

       for safety and will then expose the Chief Constable and individual

       officers to potential liability in the event of any negligence arising

       as a result of this decision.



                                            -16-
      Safetry Officer



25    With the transfer of responsibility of crowd safety and control to

      football clubs, much of the Police Commander's former responsibilities

      will fall directly on the shoulders of the club's Safety Officer, who

      in essence will      be    in charge       of running the          match   day    operation.

      Whilst many football clubs now have Safety Officers, the majority are

      relatively new to the post.            Many are former Police officers, however

      not all have had the experience of match command or received recognised

      training in this area of policing.



26    Accompanying this responsibility,            at the moment,         is the inexperience

      and uncertainty of the individuals who will have to perform the role.

      Whilst the mantle of responsibility has moved across, the ability to

      satisfactorily perform the function will take longer to acquire.



.27   Police Commanders should fulfil their                newly defined responsibilities

      and should be available to assist and advise the Safety Officer and the

       club during this transitional period.                  The Police Commander's legal

       liability   should not         be   compromised     in    this     essentially        advisory

       capacity (discussed in detail in paragraphs 3.37 - 3.38).



.28    Whilst Safety Officers should develop their skills through contact with

       Police   Commanders       at   matches,    a   clear     training    need       for   them   in

       managing    the   match    day      operation has      been   identified.         Formalised

       training should not be seen as solely a Police-led function.                          Ideally,

       a   co-ordinated      approach       through    the      Safety    Advisory       Group,     in
       conjunction   with      the    fire   and    ambulance   services   and     the     Local

       Authority, is the direction that a long-term strategy should take.



3.29   In the short term, it is considered that it would be beneficial to both

       Police Forces and football clubs for Safety Officers and their deputies

       to attend an awareness course at the club's expense.                    This would be

       broadly    based   on    the    current     Major   Sporting   Events     Course,     but

       attendance should not be seen as an acceptance by a Police Force that a

       Safety Officer has attained a particular standard of competence.



3.30   It is essential at this stage to underline the pivotal role of a Safety

       Officer and a properly trained deputy.               Forces may need to consider

       their course of action if a situation arises whereby a club no longer

       has these two individuals in post.

3.31   The Green Guide (1990) states:-


            "It should be emphasised to stewards that they are deployed
                                                                                                   E
            to assist in the safe operation of the ground, not to view
            the activity caking place.

            Staffing levels and     stewarding requirements will vary
            depending upon the size and configuration of the ground, the                           k
            nature of the event and crowd levels, but there are six basic                          li
            duties which stewards are called upon to carry out.    These
            are:-

            (a)       to control or direct spectators who are entering or                          li
                     leaving the ground, to help achieve an even flow of
                     people to the viewing areas;                                                  ■]
            (b)      to recognise crowd densities, signs of crowd distress
                     and crowd dynamics so as to help ensure safe dispersal
                     of spectators on the terraces or viewing slopes;                              ~

9                 (d)
                          fire;
                           to staff entrances, exits to and from the viewing
                          accommodation and other strategic points, especially
                          exit doors and exit gates from the ground which are
1                  (e)
                          not continuously open whilst the ground is in use;
                          to assist police as appropriate or as requested with
                          crowd control; and

9                  (f)     to undertake specific duties in an emergency."


           The guide     also recommends age limits, fitness, training, identification
1          and supervisory functions of stewards.


1
    3.32   Research has shown that a large percentage of stewards operating at

8          grounds within certain areas failed to meet these standards.



9          Initial observations during the period of the research revealed that:-


9            (i)     a   significant   proportion   of   clubs   had   not   appointed   Safety

1                    Officers,

            (ii)     the majority of stewards in existence were unsuitable in respect

3                    of age and/or ability,

           (iii)     clothing, identification and equipment were either non-existent
1                    or of poor quality,

I           (iv)     training was inadequate and carried out on an ad hoc basis from

                     club to club.

1
           The result was that stewards were in the main low status individuals
»          who,     either through lack of training or ability,              were   incapable of

1          fulfilling their responsibilities in respect of safety.              Many of the so

           called Safety Stewards were in fact long-standing fans who assumed the

3.33 In those cases where clubs have been made aware of the implications of

     full cost recovery and change in responsibilities,                   it is fair to say

     that most have reacted positively, indeed it is in their own interests

     to do so.         Almost without exception,       the clubs have now appointed a
                                                                                                      ftj

      steward for the job.        Likewise the levels of remuneration to stewards

     are also being reconsidered and stewards at certain clubs will, for the

     first time, receive payment.

                                                                                                      I
3.34 Whilst it is evident that the standard of stewarding nationally is                               pi

      improving and no doubt will continue to do so, it is essential that the
                                                                                                      L
      Police do not leave clubs with the impression that they are immediately

      avoiding previously accepted responsibilities,                   and that   there     is   a

      realistic and smooth handover period.
                                                                                                      I

3.35 Such a period must not compromise the principle that the club and not
                                                                                                      I
      the Police are responsible for crowd safety and control.                       However, as      jl

      discussed in relation to the Police Commander at paragraph 3.27 above,

      the     Police    should   assist      the    club   in    the     execution     of   their

      responsibilities subject to the following conditions:-                                          a-;
                                                                                                      I
        (i)    that the assistance given is at the specific request of the

               club; and

       (ii)    in providing such assistance, the club accept that                    it cannot be     J(|

               provided     as   part   of   the    Special     Police    Services    as    it   is



                                             -20-
         specifically     avoided,   in   the   Specification,        and may     only   be

         provided gratuitously.        (This is explained further in paragraph

         3.37 - 3.38).



By ensuring these conditions are met, not only are the Chief Constable

and individual officers legally protected but the club also benefits

from Police experience        gained over many years, and thus achieves                   a

smooth handover.



The   timescale    of    officers    withdrawing    will     to   a   large     degree   be

dictated by the clubs who themselves will be under economic pressure to

act   quickly.     As the professionalism of thestewards                increases, then

the   requirement       for Police     assistance    will     become     less    and more

officers can then be withdrawn as they are replaced by stewards.



It must be said that during this transitional period, if officers are

assisting the club with their safety responsibility on a regular or

pre-platmed basis because the clubs do not have the requisite quantity

or quality of stewards,         then the Force may be vulnerable to                   legal

action     for    any    negligence.      There     are     two   reasons       for   this,

specifically:-



  (i)    If the officers provided gratuitously are not actually charged

         for, then economic pressure will not be applied to the clubs who

         may well       once again be encouraged toleave it to the Police.

         The clubs must therefore be charged.
 (ii)   If officers are charged for, and in the planning stages it was

        evident that there was a requirement to provide officers                     for

        safety roles, then it would be difficult to argue that they were

        provided gratuitously          and did not    form part of       the    Special

        Police Services.        This could jeopardise the newly established

        Police responsibility and may expose officers to the liability

        that the new arrangement sought to avoid.



This dilemma can be resolved by following the procedure proposed below

during the handover period:-



  (i)   Police Commanders must ensure that the Match Order and any other

        documentation does not          identify   any officer as performing           a

        perceived safety function,

 (ii)   at the commencement of the handover period,               the senior Police

        officer responsible for making the policing arrangements for a

        particular club should estimate the maximum number of safety

        roles the Police could be asked to perform during a match day

        operation,

(iii)   based on that estimate, the staffing requirement for individual

        matches should be increased by that number of officers,

 (iv)   during   the    match    day    operation,    these   officers      should    be

        strategically deployed in the area of the missing steward to

        perform public order duties.         If, however, during the course of

        the event      a request   is made by        the   club   for any      of   these

        officers to perform a specific safety duty, then the officers

        should be in a position to respond to that request.                 This would
              then   allow   clubs   Co be   charged      for    these       officers without

              compromising the original policing plan, or diluting the legal

              protection afforded to officers.



39    It is essential that both clubs and Safety Advisory Groups are made

      fully aware of the reasoning behind the above course of action.                      Clubs

      should not be left with the impression that Forces are manipulating

      attendance levels in any way.          The proposed solution merely provides

      the stimulus for the progression towards high profile stewarding with

      low profile policing,       to the benefit of both parties.                   The message

      should be made crystal-clear:-



        (i)   that the Police have a public order and not a safety role,

       (ii)   if stewarding arrangements are not sufficient to comply with the

              safety      certificate   requirements,      it    would       be   open   to     the

              certifying authority to prevent the football match taking place,

      (iii)   the Police are willing to assist the club with their safety

              responsibilities in order for the match to be played, but the

              officers thus deployed will be charged for accordingly.



.40   Ultimately, the aim of the Police should be the complete withdrawal of

      officers from football grounds.         If, however, the stewarding operation

      has reached an acceptable standard and individual Police Commanders

      still consider it necessary to police a particular ground,                         then the

      officers     thus   provided would     act simply         as    a   reserve    contingent,

       strategically      deployed   ready   to   react    to        crime   or     incidents    of

       disorder.
3.41   There are many duties currently performed by the Police which could and

       should be performed by properly trained stewards.                    In the majority of

       cases    these       roles   have   a     safety    implication.     These    duties   are

       considered in the following paragraphs.



       C.C.T.V.



3.42   It is essential that the Safety Officer is able to properly monitor

       spectators in all areas of the ground.                  The best ways of doing this

       are:-



         (i)   by individual stewards monitoring sectors,

        (ii)   by C.C.T.V.



       It follows,      therefore,     that the club should take responsibility for

       monitoring C.C.T.V. screens for overcrowding and safety.                      By doing so

       this    gives    a    club   and    the    Safety    Officer   the   proper    tools   for

       fulfilling their defined responsibilities.



3.43   If this facility is denied the club, or a partial responsibility not

       offered to them at an early stage then, in the event of an incident, it

       could again be argued that the Police were responsible for the C.C.T.V.

       cameras and in the event of any claims for negligence,                       could become

       liable.



3.44   In the event of the club taking control of all the C.C.T.V. cameras,




                                                 -24-
I




           then agreement should be reached to ensure that a copy of any video

           recording was made available to the Police upon request.         The Police

           Commander could well wish to continue to monitor the C.C.T.V.          screen

           together with the club's staff to fulfil his responsibility in respect

           of incidents of public disorder.

                                                                             J

           Perimeter Track



    3.45   The Police officer who is present on the perimeter track (to authorise

           stewards to allow spectators immediate access to the pitch in the event

           of overcrowding) clearly fulfils a safety role.       The decision to allow

           access onto the pitch in these circumstances should be that of the

           club's Safety Officer and not the Police Commander.



    3.46   Despite the fact that by passing this responsibility to the club, the

           Police    would    not   be    following   Lord   Justice   Taylor's    final

           recommendations, it is justified on the basis of the same issues argued

           previously    in paragraphs 3.4 to 3.9.    It is recommended therefore that

           Forces   do not accept responsibility for performing this function.       If

           incidents of overcrowding come to the notice of the Police then the

           following action will be open to them:-



             (i)    in the event of a non-urgent nature the matter should be brought

                    to   the attention   of the club's Safety Officer for appropriate

                    action.   (The Police Commander would obviously be available for

                    advice); or

            (ii)    in the event of an urgent nature where injury may occur or life



                                              -25-
               put at risk,    then appropriate action should be taken in line
                                                                                       I
               with an officer's fundamental duty to protect life.



       Searching Spectators



3.47   It is a recommendation of this report that the routine searching of

       spectators as a condition of entry specified in ground regulations to

       football stadia (which a club is responsible for enforcing) should be

       performed by officials of the club rather than by the Police,



3.48   Precedent exists for private organisations       to search members of the

       public entering or invited into premises for a specific reason.           For

       example:-



         (i)   specialised    security   companies   searching   patrons   attending

               organised pop concerts, political conferences, etc.,

        (ii)   doormen searching patrons entering nightclubs.



3.49   As clubs take on this responsibility, it could well be prudent for the

       Police Commander to provide officers to support the club's staff in the

       event of any prohibited article being found.         The Police would,     of

       course, still be expected to use their search powers under the Police

       and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, in other than routine cases where there

       is reasonable suspicion that an unlawful article is being carried, and

       also the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol) Act 1985.

           SUMMARY



    3.50   As Police staffing levels within football grounds begin to reduce in

           response to increased stewarding,      the functional responsibilities of

           the Safety Officer and stewards will increase accordingly.    Many of the

           Safety Officers in the areas studied are working towards the concept of

           overall match control   and   actively recruiting suitable stewards    to

           achieve this aim.   High levels of properly trained stewards with low

           level policing already works well in some Force areas and is achievable

           nationally.

STATEMENT fYF TWTTNT




Lord Justice Taylor first coined the phrase "Statement of Intent".

Recommendation 11 of his final report into the Hillsborough Stadium

Disaster states


      "There should be a written Statement of Intent, agreed
      between the club and the police, setting out their respective
      functions as to crowd safety and control and in particular as
      to the filling of each self-contained pen or other standing
      area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or
      area to avoid overcrowding. Any variation of the document in
      respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in
      advance."


The   Football   Licensing Authority's        Guidance    on   Safety   Certificates

(paragraph 6.3) and The Green Guide (paragraph 286) both recognise the

importance of such a document yet,            such is the variation of opinion

between individual bodies as to the form and function of this written

statement,   that    in   formulating     a   suitable,   standard      Statement   of

Intent, it may not be possible to fully satisfy all the requirements of

THE TAYLOR RECOMMENDATIONS



Whilst Lord Justice Taylor accepts in the body of his report that, in

principle, a football club which invites the public to a match on its

premises for reward is responsible for securing safety at the event, he

also poses the question "who should monitor the terraces?"                  Should it

be the Police?      Should it be the host club via its stewards?            Should it

be both or should it be by arrangement,          depending upon the         ground or

section of the      ground in question?
He went on to say that there are clearly many aspects of crowd control

and management which are capable of being carried out by efficient

stewards including:'



(a)     manning gates,

(b)     directing spectators,

(c)     keeping gangways clear,

(d)     monitoring the density of packing         in pens or enclosures,

(e)     controlling members of the public         who are entering or leaving the

        ground to help achieve an even flow of people to the                  viewing

        areas and safe dispersal of spectators on the terraces or viewing

        slopes,

(f)     patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, e.g. raising

        alarms or extinguishing fires,

(g)     assisting    Police    as   appropriate     or    as   requested   with   crowd

        control,

(h)     undertaking specific duties in an emergency.



Indeed, he goes further by saying that at most grounds, and in most

parts    of   each   ground,   these   duties     ought   to be    capable   of being

performed by properly trained stewards and that,                  where that is so,

clubs should require stewards to perform the duties and should not take

the option of leaving it all to the Police.



He accepts, however, that there may be particular areas of a ground,

perhaps on visitors       terraces and particularly at high risk matches,

which call for the greater authority and resilience of the Police and
that the division of functions between stewards and the Police must be

a matter for local decision and,          in the last resort, for the Police

Commander to determine.



It is in order to avoid any confusion in this regard that Lord Justice

Taylor recommends that there should be such a written Statement of

Intent as outlined at paragraph 4.1, which he also says should not be a

binding legal contract.



Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation concerning the Statement of Intent

needs   close   examination    in order    to decide   the   format   for   such a

document.    The recommendation states



(a)     THERE SHOULD BE A WRITTEN STATEMENT OF INTENT AGREED BETWEEN THE

        CLUB AND THE POLICE.



It is imperative that the Statement of Intent is agreed between both

parties and in order to prove that it is agreed,             there should be a

requirement for the document to be signed by a senior Police officer

and a recognised club official, probably the Club Secretary or Safety

Officer.



It is recommended that the senior Police officer signing the document

should be the respective Divisional Commander or the recognised Police

Commander,      This is because the document by its very nature needs to be

flexible and allow for variations which themselves would also need

agreement in writing.      Because of this it would not be practical for
anyone of A.C.P.O. rank to be the normal signatory to the document.



(b)     THE DOCUMENT SHOULD SET OUT THEIR RESPECTIVE FUNCTIONS AS TO

        CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL.



The Statement of Intent need only concern itself with matters relating

to crowd safety and control.



(c)     IN PARTICULAR THE FILLING OF EACH SELF-CONTAINED STANDING AREA

        and;



(d)     THE    MONITORING     OF   SPECTATORS     IN   EACH   SUCH    AREA   TO   AVOID

        OVERCROWDING.



Paragraph 213 of Lord Justice Taylor's final report states:


        "The aim should be for the club, through its stewards, to
        perform all those functions of controlling spectators of
        which they are capable, having regard to the quality of the
        stewards, the layout of the ground and the nature of the
        match.   Where they are not able to discharge any such
        function, the police should perform it. As the proportion of
        seating at the ground increases, control by stewards should
        become the norm."


In all but the most exceptional circumstances, therefore, the Statement

of Intent should normally place these functions fairly and squarely on

the club.        There is, however, one area that needs closer examination

and that concerns the monitoring of the crowd.



 Stewards in individual areas will be tasked with monitoring the crowd

 and,    under    normal    circumstances   the    club   will   be   expected    to be
       responsible for this function.                 The most effective method of monitoring

       the crowd is C.G.T.V. which has until now always been controlled by the

       Police:    despite the.fact that the equipment is the property of the

       club.     Paragraphs 3.42          - 3.44 recommends that this should become a

       function       of    the   club,   with    the    Police   continuing    to    monitor     for

       criminal offences and disorder.



       Police Responsibilities



4.10   In Section 3 it was argued that under no circumstances should a Police

       Force accept responsibility for crowd safety or control.                      Following the

       recommended content of the Statement of Intent, described in paragraph

       4.7 above,          then it need only concern itself with those                 issues.     In

       practical       terms this would mean that the Statement,because it only

       addressed       crowd safety        and control,       could say that     the club were

       responsible for that and the Police were responsible for nothing.                         That

       would be nonsense and never reach agreement.



4.11   The Statement is intended to determine the division of function between

       the     club    and     Police.     As     the    Police   no   longer have a       defined

       responsibility for safety, then it would seem sensible to outline the

       relative responsibilities of Police and club in relation to the broader

       aspects of a match day operation.



4.12   One     must    be     mindful     of    the    fundamental tenet   of        the office    of

       constable:      to protect life and property.               Whilst there should be no

       formal acceptance of any responsibility for safety within a football



                                                  -32-
      ground,    it must be      recognised that under certain circumstances                    the

      Police would he under a duty to act and assist the club in their

      responsibilities and on occasions even assume primacy.                       Similarly,    it

      must be     accepted that the Police are present to maintain the peace

      wherever possible.



13    Based     solely on The Taylor recommendations, it would not be difficult

      to draft a Statement of Intent which clearly outlined that:-



      (a)     the document was not a binding contract,

      (b)     officials     of   the    club    will    accept      responsibility      for   crowd

              control within the ground and in particular for the filling of

              each self contained pen or area to avoid overcrowding,

      (c)       the Police will deal with crime and disorder inside                     or in the

                immediate vicinity of the ground,

       (d)      the Police may assist the club with their responsibilities as to

                crowd safety and control.



      LEGAL ADVICE



.14   Whilst Lord Justice Taylor stresses that any Statement of Intent should

       not be a binding contract,              but a document to show the division of

       functions     and    avoid      misunderstanding,       it     is,   by    definition,     an

       agreement.      It   is    the    use    of     such   phraseology        that   has   caused

       fundamental concern to the legal advisor consulted during the course of

       the preparation of this report.
                                                                                                    1

                                                                                                             E
4.15   Writing     in    his   role    as     advisor    to    a   Police    Authority     he   notes

       initially:-


                       "The Taylor Report fails to take account of the
                       constitutional nature of the Police service. There can
                       he no contract or any form of agreement between any
                       Police officer and another party about the supply of
                       Police   services.   Furthermore,   even  if   a Chief
                       Constable purports to make a contract, he cannot fetter
                       either his own operational discretion nor that of any
                       member of the Police Force."


4.16   From this platform, the argument is developed to conclude that in order

       to protect a Police Force, its members and the Police Authority, three

       documents are necessary to complement the proposed Statement of Intent,

       namely:-



         (i)   a      specification     for    each     ground     setting   out    the    number       of

                 officers who will be present if requested and setting out what

                 services they will provide,

        (ii)   a protocol which will explain the constitutional position of the

                 Chief Constable and members of Police Forces and deny liability

                 for crowd safety,

       (iii)     an     agreement     about    payment        between   clubs      and    the   Police

               Authority.



       The resultant documents incorporating the above afe shown at Appendices

       A and B.

                                                                                                             I
       The full text of the legal advice received is shown at Appendix C.



4.17   It is evident therefore that a Statement of Intent which unequivocally


                                                -34-
     commits a Police Force to any course of action is not appropriate as it

     would necessarily be          an agreement which              could fetter         an     officer's

     operational       discretion.       The     Specification            proposed       (Appendix      A

     Schedule 1) would, however, whilst describing the Police service being

     provided     to   a   football      club,       also    partially         fulfil     the       Taylor

     requirements for a Statement of Intent.



18   This   Specification        outlines      the    service      that    a    Police       Force    will

     provide when officers are supplied under Section 15, Police Act, 1964.

     Whilst     this   document     is   essential         for    the   protection        of    a    Chief

     Constable     and his       officers,     it    lacks       an essential      ingredient         : a

     description of the responsibilities of the club.                          This does not fulfil

     the agreed division of functions envisaged, nor does it reflect all the

     proposals of the Football Licensing Authority.



     THE POOTRAT.T. LICENSING AUTHORITY



19   The    initial    observations      made        by    representatives        of     the    Football

     Licensing Authority in relation to the nature and format of a Statement

     of Intent are fully detailed in Appendix D.                        Under these guidelines,

     broadly speaking, the Statement is seen as an agreed working management

     document, produced jointly by or for the Police Commander and the club

     Safety     Officer,    to    identify who            does   what     and when,       focusing      in

     particular on the respective roles of these two individuals and those

     of the club's stewards and of Police officers.                            It should be ground

     specific and identify which particular individuals (identified by post

      rather than name) will carry out certain tasks in accordance with the
                                                                                        \




       Police and/or the club's contingency plans or operational procedures.



4.20   The Football Licensing Authority proposals for a Statement of Intent

       are essentially a description of the relative functions of the Police

       and the club.        To a large extent they duplicate the description of

       Police functions defined in the Specification discussed above.                   The

       Football Licensing Authority proposals outlined in Appendix D paragraph

       (g) have not been specifically included however, as they are functions

       which,     it is argued, are the responsibility of the club.            There are

       some implications for Police, but to accept these in the detailed way

       described could once again expose the Chief Constable and individual

       officers.      These deficiencies can be overcome to some extent and the

       most satisfactory solution is summarised in the following paragraphs.



       THE STATKk EHT OF INTENT

                                                                                                 E
4.21   The formalisation of the procedure for requesting Police services at

       football matches has largely assisted in the resolution of the dilemma

       to    draft    a   Statement   of   Intent   which   reflects   the   division       of

       responsibility, is agreeable to the clubs and protects the Police from

       liability.      It is through the adoption of a Specification (described at

       paragraph 4.16       (i) above)     as a Schedule to an Order for Supply of

       Special Police Services, that the following will be achieved:-



            (i)   The Chief Constable and his officers will be protected from
                                                                                                 E
                  liability,

        (ii)      The legal requirements of the Police Authority will be met,

                                                                                                 E
                                            -36-
      (iii)    The conditions proposed by the various bodies with a direct

               interest in the Statement of Intent will be largely fulfilled.



22    There    is     arguably     a    case    for    entitling      the       Specification        itself

      'Statement of Intent".              This course has not been followed as it is

      considered essential that Schedule 1 to the Order for Supply of Police

      Services should be a precise document which solely concerns itself with

      the responsibilities of officers at football grounds.                          By retaining the

      Specification,         it is possible to draft a Statement of Intent as a

      management       document,        more    in    keeping   with        Lord     Justice       Taylor's

      recommendations.



23 The        Statement      of    Intent       proposed      (Appendix         B)   complements        the

      Specification and describes the division of responsibility, in general

      terms, between the Police and the club.                       This remedies the deficiency

      identified in the Specification in respect of the club and fulfils many

      of the Football Licensing Authority proposals.



.24   Whilst it has not been possible to meet all the suggested criteria for

      a Statement of Intent,              in broad terms this has been achieved.                        The

       Specification in combination with the Statement of Intent provides the

       division of functions proposed by Lord Justice Taylor, thus eliminating

       the possibility of any misunderstanding of respective responsibilities.



.25    In     order    for   the       Statement      of   Intent    to     function    as     a     working

       management       document,        it    is   necessary   for       the    role   of     the    Police

       Commander to be considered and formalised.                     In addition to the primary
responsibilities       discussed      at paragraph      3.22       (to maintain     law    and

order; assist the club with their responsibility for safety and crowd

control) this role should be:-



  (i)   to consider any variations as to the Statement of Intent which

        may be     required     for    a specific       event      (whilst    always     being

        mindful of the potential effects of assuming any responsibility

        for   safety     issues.      In view      of   the    general nature       of    this

        document,      variation      is   only    likely     to    occur    in   particular

        circumstances or to reflect changes in responsibility - this is

        discussed more fully at paragraphs 4.28 - 4.29),

 (ii)   to formulate and implement a match order in relation to the

        policing    of    the   specific     football       match,    having      particular

        regard   to    the   maintenance      of    order      and    the    prevention     of

        offences,

(iii)   where appropriate, to assist or offer advice to officials of the

        club with their duties relating to crowd safety and control and

        also their enforcement of ground regulations,

 (iv)   in the event of a major incident, to declare it as such, assume

        primacy and implement the major incident plan if required.                          In

        these circumstances the employees and agents of the club will

        always work in conjunction with, and under the direction of, the

        Police Commander.



It should be clear that the Police Commander has no responsibility for

public safety under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, but he does

have vested in him his fundamental duty to protect life and property.
The    above     considerations        should     be   catered    for     in    the    Police

Operational Order and Major Incident Plan.



If    a major       incident    was   to   occur at    a   football     stadium and         the

Statement of Intent was found lacking or compromised the Police, the

Chief Constable would always be able to legitimately rely on the Order

for Supply of Special Police Services under Section 15(1) of the Police

Act, 1964, and the Specification, which clearly outlines the conditions

under which officers are supplied to clubs.



In reality, football clubs are obliged to agree the Specification when

Police services are            ordered.    If not, the Chief      Constable, in theory,

would always have the option                  of not providing    officers to Police a

game.



It is usually the case that an informal pre-season meeting takes place

between club and Police at which plans for the forthcoming season are

outlined       by    both      parties.         This meeting     should    result      in    an

understanding being reached as to which party will perform a standard

list    of     tasks   at      each   game,    e.g. searching     of    spectators,      crowd

monitoring, pitch perimeter gates supervision, dealing with incidents

of disorder, implementation of the major incident plan etc.                           The form

of the understanding should be based upon the terms of the Safety

 Certificate and the (revised) police Operational Order.                       Assuming that

 the model Statement of Intent is adopted and the role of the Police

 Commander is formalised in the Operational Order and the major incident
plan,    these discussions will         generally be a rubber-stamping of the

philosophy of these documents.           This meeting should be minuted and the

minutes sipned bv each party.



At the pre-match meeting, any special requirements                   arising from the

fixture    should be    discussed.Where particular           circumstances       arise

which would       necessitate    a    re-evaluation    of    the    previously    agreed

divisions    of    responsibility,     then   this   meeting       should   specifically

address such issues and the outcome of the discussions recorded and

signed by both parties, as envisaged by the "variations" section of the

model Statement of Intent.           An example of this would be, for instance,

where prior intelligence suggests that flares or fireworks are to be

smuggled into a football stadium and public safety thereby endangered.

The club may very well wish to ask for Police assistance to search

spectators entering the ground.          The extra officers thus employed would

be given this additional task (normally carried out solely by club

officials)   and    charged for accordingly.           Any understanding which is

reached at either the pre-season or pre-match meetings described above

should always come within the terms of the Order for Supply of Special

Intent) have already been readily agreed with the respective football

clubs.     Taken    together,     they    give   a    much   clearer        indication of

responsibilities      at football games and are recommended for national

implementation.
              FUTURE POLICY


a             INTRODUCTION


9       5.1   The preceding sections have discussed the more fundamental issues and

              proposed recommendations for change in policing football matches and

              other major       sporting     events.      Some    aspects     already    considered     are

              developed further here in an examination of the match day operation.


i             There is a marked lack of uniformity in the way Forces police football

              grounds      across    the     country.      Indeed,       within   individual      Forces,

i             variations       in   policing    methods    are     widespread.      In    an   effort    to

              introduce standardisation and increase the professionalism of match day

i             operations,      a    common    approach    is     clearly    required.     To that      end,

              recommendations        are made    in this        section of the report which will

              provide      a   detailed      framework    for     that     uniformity.     Many   of    the

              recommendations are based on perceived best practices found in Force

              areas throughout the country.



              PRE-PLANNING FOR A MAJOR SPORTING EVENT



        5.2   When making arrangements for any major sporting event which is:-



               (a)      a profit-making enterprise; and

               (b)      is taking place on private premises
i
               there are a number of fundamental considerations that must be addressed

               by    the   senior    officer    tasked with        the   pre-planning     of   the Police



                                                         -41-
    i
    i
operation.     These considerations are:-



  (i)   Why are the Police being asked to attend the event?

 (ii)   What      duties will the Policeundertake?

(iii)   Who will pay for the Police resources deployed in and at the

        ground?

 (iv)   Who will     be    responsible    for   performing those        duties    not

        undertaken by the Police?

  (v)   What will the Police do in the event of a major disaster?



In order to address these issues the senior Police officer must at the

earliest opportunity satisfy himself/herself that:-



  (i)   Special Police Services are formally ordered by the organisers,

 (ii)   the division of responsibilities between              the Police    and the

        organisers are clearly understood by all,

(iii)   that both    the   organisers     and the    Police have    a    recognised

        contingency plan,

 (iv)   so far as possible          the terms of the       Safety Certificate     are

        adequate.



Safet-y Certificate



All professional football matches and other major sporting events held

within a     recognised    sports    stadium can    only    take place    under   the

provisions of the Safety Certificate, which is issued to the club or

organiser by the relevant local authority under the provisions of the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, as amended by the Fire Safety and

Safety of Places of Sports Act, 1987.



In determining what terms and conditions should be included in a Safety

Certificate,     the   certifying    authority       maintain   and    chair   a   Safety

Advisory Group which normally includes representatives of the Police,

fire service,    ambulance service and building authority.                In addition,

che club or the organisers participate in the group's discussions.



The Football Licensing Authority have published a Guidance on Safety

Certificates which has been circulated to all local authorities and to

the Police.      Police representatives attending Safety Advisory Group

meetings    should     actively    support     the   recommended      format   for    such

certificates and where appropriate encourage its adoption.



During     the   course     of     Safety      Advisory    Group      meetings     Police

representatives are often asked for opinion and advice on many issues.

Officers should be circumspect when giving advice on safety matters and

opinions should generally be restricted to policing issues.



Police Commanders charged with policing a major sporting event should

have   a   working     knowledge    of   the    contents   of   the    relevant      Safety

Certificate and any transgressions by the club should be brought to the

attention of the certifying authority.                NoC to do so would have the

effect of condoning such breaches.

5.9    When planning a major sporting event, the organisers must be made aware

       that any requirement for Police officers at the event (see below) will

       1964,   and are chargeable to the organiser.        To that end the Police         1

a          Safety Ttgiwi;



i   5.12   When the senior Police officer organising the policing of a football



a          match or other major sporting event is engaged in the pre-planning,

           serious consideration should be given to the responsibilities of the

           Police Force involved and,              if Special Police Services are provided,
i          then        the   Chief    Constable    (and    any   individual   Police    officer)   is

a          responsible:-



a          (a)          for any negligence in providing Special Police Services,

            (b)         damages arising from a failure to provide them.
a
a   5.13   It could be          said chat the following are responsibilities which the

           Police could not,             and indeed would not wish         to divorce     themselves

a           from:-


a                (i)    ensuring the free flow of traffic,


a               (ii)    maintaining the peace,

            (iix)       preventing offences,

a
                                                         -45-

                                                                                                   I
        (iv)       apprehending offenders,

            (v)    implementing Police contingency plans.



5,14   As a general guide, the Police should not accept any responsibility for                     1
       safety issues under the Safety Certificate although there would be no

       objection to advice being given to a nominated Safety Officer on safety

       issues by the Police.           This topic has already been addressed in much

       greater detail in Sections 3 and 4 of this report.


                                                                                                   I
       Statement of Intent



5,15   The senior Police officer together with the club or organiser, through

       the        Safety   Advisory    Group,     should      consider   their   division     of

       responsibilities, and should document the outcome of such discussions

       in an agreed Statement of Intent,                Extreme caution should be exercised

       in     drafting     such   a   document    and    it   is   envisaged   that   for   most

       circumstances the model Statement of Intent at Appendix B will be

       adequate.       The issue of a Statement of Intent is addressed in detail in                I
       Section 4.



       Contingency Plans



5,16   Contingency planning           is an essential part         of organising      any major

       sporting event and should be fully considered from the outset.



5.17   In general individual contingency plans should;-
                                                                                                   I
            (i)    dovetail with the Force major incident contingency plan,


                                                 *46-
      (ii)      dovetail with the club or organiser's contingency plan,

      (iii)     identify specific roles for individual officers in the event of

                an emergency,

       (iv)     provide the tools for each officer to perform his identified

                role including documentation.



,18   It   is    recommended    that    a   comprehensive    review      of   all    existing

      contingency plans relating to individual football grounds                     should be

      undertaken.     Such plans would, of course, be affected by the reduction

      of   staffing    levels   at     grounds.   Where     individual    clubs     have   not

      prepared their own contingency plans, they should be urged to do so, if

      necessary via the Safety Advisory Group.



      Cutting Equipment



.19   Recommendation 21 of Lord Justice Taylor's final report states


              "Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided
              by the club at each ground where there are perimeter fences
              to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release
              numbers of spectators if necessary.      Agreement should be
              reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police,
              the fire brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be
              trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decision of
              a nominated senior police officer."


i.20 The fire brigade should not be tasked with using this equipment                   for the

       simple reason that they may not be present at the ground when                   its use

       is required.     The remaining options therefore are the Police or a club

       official.      The equipment is supplied by the club, maintained by the

       club and kept on the club's premises.              In addition, the club's staff

       employed on a match day are by and large static whereas most Police
       officers rarely work two matches in succession.              It seems commonsense,

       therefore,     that the      club as opposed

       responsible for using this equipment.
                                                         to the Police      should be made

                                                         (At the grounds where perimeter
                                                                                                   i
       fences remain and this recommendation is still relevant).



5.21   The recommendation says that agreement must be reached and, if that is

       to be between the club and the Police, it is strongly argued that it

       should be      a written agreement and form part of               the   club's    Safety

       Certificate, identifying the club as being responsible for its usage.

       If this      is not    the     case   then agreement   should be reached by          the

       Divisional Commander raising the issue with the Safety Advisory Group.



       HANNING FOR THE EVERT



       Intelligence



5.22   In planning for any major sporting event,              the importance of good and

       accurate intelligence cannot be over emphasised.                 It is by evaluation

       of    intelligence    that     football matches     are categorised and      resource

       levels are assessed.            Inaccurate intelligence can have a tremendous

       cost implication to both Police Forces and to individual clubs.
                                                                                                   1
5.23   There      already    exists     within    this   country   an   excellent       football   [
       intelligence network in the form of the National Criminal Intelligence

       Service Football Unit.          This unit is fed intelligence by:-
                                                                                                   L
                                                                                                   fi
            (i)   members of the public direct,

        (ii)      Force Intelligence Units,

       (iii)      Divisional Football Intelligence officers.

                                                 -48-


                                                                                                       I.
24    In addition,      a standard report is completed by the local Police and

      forwarded to the N.C.I.S.            in respect of each professional football

      match played within the         country.       This   then allows   an   intelligence

      picture     to   be   painted   in   respect    of    the behaviour   of   all   clubs

      supporters at home and away fixtures.             This intelligence is circulated

      to divisions responsible for policing football matches, on a quarterly

      basis.



25    This publication should be the starting point for any officer tasked

      with planning the policing of any major football match and will provide

      much positive and negative intelligence.                Experience shows that much

      emphasis is placed on positive intelligence (i.e. information has been

      received that something will occur at a specific location) and such

      intelligence often results in increased staffing levels.                 However, the

      same is not always the case in respect of negative intelligence where

      the behaviour of a club's supporters over an extended period allows for

      an accurate prediction that there is little likelihood of any incidents

      of public disorder occurring at the event.



.26   Such intelligence should be given as much if not more importance than

       specific    information which        is received;     because   it is known to be

       accurate and has been tested over a prolonged period.                   By using such

       intelligence in a positive way, some Divisional Commanders responsible

       for policing professional football matches have taken the radical step

       of removing all Police officers from a ground for specific identified

       games, with all the cost and operational benefits that follow.



.27    Although specific intelligence is often received and acted upon by the
       respective division there are many occasions where the intelligence

       does not appear at first sight to have been accurate.      There is little,

       if any, subsequent evaluation of that intelligence by the division as

       to its accuracy and reliability, or whether successful Police action

       resulted from it.



5.28   tfhilst intelligence is already collated by the divisions, much more is

       available which could again assist the Divisional Commander in reducing

       expensive resources required to Police an event.          For example,    the

       exact   time   and   specific   location of arrests   or ejections   are not

       normally documented.      This could well reveal that only one area of a        I
       ground needs policing at all.       Other incidents also occur which would

       add to the broad intelligence base and are largely undocumented.         This

       information is only available if officers can accurately remember the

       incident.



5.29   Another source of intelligence which should be utilised more is the

       club itself and the stewards.        A pre-match meeting should take place

       between the Police Commander and the club's Safety Officer a few days

       before the event to discuss pre-match intelligence,        de*brief of the

       last event,    if not already done, and fine tuning of the match day

5.30   The 'labelling' of matches according to a fixed category has broadened

       over the years and categories currently in use range from 'A+' through

       to 'D' and others in between.        By and large mo$t Police Commanders,

       Football Liaison and Intelligence Officers consider broadly the same

                                          -50-
1
^               criteria prior Co fixing a match within a particular category, although

IS              there is no standard formula based upon objective measures and indeed
I               no standard category labels.



        5.31    Categorisation of matches is a useful management tool but realistically

                provides only a rule of thumb assessment of likely manpower levels for

                 the benefit of:-
I
                   (i)    the Police/Divisional Commander,

                  (ii)    Force Headquarters to assess future commitments,

1                (iii)    the club concerned.



        5.32     It is recognised that any definition of individual match categories

                 cannot properly take into account all local variations between football

                 clubs,    for example,      transport/trafficproblems        andcompeting events,

                 but it    is prudent and sensible thatcertain            set criteria should always

                 be considered prior to initial categorisation.                This is thought to be

                 particularly relevant at the present time primarily so that a more


    a            professional and efficient policing operation can be effected but also

                 in order     that a Police         Commander,    during pre-season      and pre-match

                 meetings    with   clubs,     is    in   a   position   to   indicate   realistic   and

                 justifiable Police staffing levels.



         5.33     It is suggested that the following criteria ALWAYS be considered*.-



                    (i)    Home supporters history,

                   (ii)    Away supporters history,

                  (iii)   Relationship between the two clubs and supporters,

         (iv)   Type of fixture (Cup tie, league match, friendly etc.),

          (v)   Anticipated attendance,

         (vi)   Anticipated number of visitors,

        (vii)   Relative league positions,                                                   G
       (viii)   Current intelligence : liaison with opposite F.I.O.
                                                                                             ii
5.34   Other criteria, particular to individual clubs may also, of necessity,

       be considered in the interim period until newly defined relative roles

       of club and Police are acknowledged by the clubs.               These additional

       criteria will in most cases include the geography and layout of the

       ground, stewarding and emergency procedure arrangements.



5.35   Due consideration of the above eight integral factors should give an

       objective and justifiable assessment of the realistic likelihood of

       disorder    in    relation   to   a   particular   fixture,   which   may   then be

       categorised accordingly.          It is recognised that at the present time

       other considerations may enter the categorisation equation but it is

       vital that both clubs and Police should work together to arrive at the

       situation      (primarily through an agreed Statement of Intent) whereby

       categorisation can be assessed on the basis of likelihood of disorder

       only.    Particular matches can then be categorised broadly:-



       Potential for Disorder:-



          U)    High         (A)

         (ii)   Medium       (B)

        (iii)   Low          (C)



                                              ■52-
1
9            Proposed Police staffing levels should then reflect this potential but

             should not be a rigid set of figures.




1     5.36   An independent objective assessment of policing levels at each football

             ground    will    lead   to    initial      proposals       for     staffing    levels   for

             particular categories of matches.              These proposals should be seen as a

             rule of thumb guide only,              Fine tuning of these levels should take
1            place    during   the    weeks     prior     to     each    match    (after    the   initial

             pre-season categorisation) and in this respect the role of the Football

             Intelligence Officer and the Football Liaison Officer is vital.

a
a     5.37             Proposed levels of policing should not be seen as minimum (nor maximum)

             levels for a set category, but guidance for management (and financial)

ji|          purposes.    Indeed, there may be certain individual Category 'A' matches

             which    necessitate     the     use   of    many    more    officers    chan    originally

             outlined.    Conversely,       selected Category *C' matches may on occasions

             be policed by stewards with a nominal Police presence at the ground.

g            Only through an objective yet flexible approach to categorisation may


g            justifiable and professional decisions be reached.




i            Match Orders and Associated floftinap.ntaeion



i     5.38   The     format and   style     of match       orders       throughout the      country vary

              considerably. The recommendations in this report regarding the Police

              responsibilities for safety related issues will necessitate a review of

              all match orders.       During the course of this research, numerous match

              orders have been examined and the following is recommended as a model.

All match orders should be a bound A5 size document thereby allowing

officers to place them easily within tunic pockets.              The order should

fall in line with the I.I.M.A.C. format and include:-



(a)     Information

        This section should include reference to a separate intelligence

        briefing sheet which should be issued to all supervisors.

(b)     Intention

        This section should be in accordance with the agreed Statement

        of Intent.

(c)     Method

        This section should include

  (i)   the role,     duties and responsibilities of each Police officer

        engaged on the operation from the Police Commander downwards

        including the duties of specialist departments and outside aid

        such as the Mounted Branch, Dog Section, Traffic officers, the

        Special   Constabulary,    Traffic     Wardens    and   the   Tactical   Aid

        Group/Operational Support Group,

 (ii)   the strategy for each phase of the operation including: -

        (a)   arrangements for home and away supporters,

        (b)   traffic diversion routes,

        (c)   local   policies    (e.g.   in   relation    to   pitch    invasions,

              lock-outs, searching spectators and stand-down procedures),

(iii)   a section on overcrowding and what steps should be                taken to

        remedy it.    This is discussed further at paragraphs 3.45 - 3.46,

 (iv)   specific plans to enable the Police to cope with any foreseeable

        pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their

        departure,

                       officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.
1          (d)         ArhniTiistration

                       This section should include provision for the supply of hot and

                       cold   drinks      for   officers        deployed       on    the     operation     (see

                       paragraphs 5.69 - 5.70).

           (e)         Communications
9                      This   section     should    include       details      of     radio     channels    and

                        telephone numbers for the club and the ground control room.



    5.40   Further sections and appendices should be included within the match

           order        including    details       of     emergency      procedures          and    individual
9          responsibilities in such circumstances, ideally based upon colour-coded

           ground        sectors    (in    consultation         with    the     club).        The    emergency

           procedures         section     should    also     contain       a    summary       of    the    major

           incident/contingency            plan    and     evacuation      procedures         together     with

           rendezvous points etc.
I
    5.41   Individual duty sheets should be issued to all officers deployed and

           they should also be             included in this section of                     the order.      These

3          sheets should contain the following information;-

               incident,

        (iv)   specific evacuation duties.



5.42   Dependent upon local circumstances,                 it will also be           appropriate to

       include appendices showing photographs of the various passes in use

       (traffic exclusion,      residents parking,           ground passes,          etc.), maps of

       traffic coning areas and local public house locations.                      The match order

       should also contain appendices               showing the format of             documentation

       required by the division to ensure accurate costing and evaluation of

       intelligence (see paragraphs 5.100 - 5.102).



5.43   Additional to the match order, a briefing checklist and intelligence

       sheet should be distributed to supervisors responsible for briefing

       individual   officers.        Likewise       in an    effort    to ensure        a   level of

       knowledge and understanding it is considered appropriate that a guide

       for supervisory officers engaged in the policing of sporting events

       should be    produced       and    distributed to       all     newly    promoted     uniform

       sergeants and to other supervisors who will Police football grounds.

       Sections within the guide should include

       POLICING THE EVENT



       Policing Methods



.44    The methods adopted by many Forces tasked with policing sporting events

       are generally of a very static nature.                       Staff are usually given broad

       d u de s    in relation to the policing of                   the event before,during and

       after the game.               Invariably these duties are to police specific areas

       inside or outside the ground.



.45    This       method,       although    very       effective,     is   also      extremely   labour

       intensive in that geographical areas are policed even though there may

       be few or no spectators there.                   For example, there is always a period

       before the turnstiles are open where numerous officers, sometimes as

       many       as    100,    are    deployed    throughout       the    ground.     Even when     the

       turnstiles are opened, experience shows that the majority of supporters

       do not enter the stadium until the last thirty minutes or so.



i.46    Similarly,        officers who have in the past been deployed on searching

        duties at the turnstiles have little to do until the thirty minutes

        before         kick    off.     Conversely,      those   officers     deployed     outside   the

        ground are invariably brought into the ground during the game, not for

        a specific reason or because they are needed, but simply because there

        is nothing            else    for them    to    do.   That    being    the case,     there   are

        invariably numerous officers who are being wastefully deployed.
                                                                                                        I




47   One method worthy of serious consideration is that known as the tidal

     system of policing.       Instead of policing geographical areas the Police

     operation moves with the ebb and flow of the spectators.



48   With this system,        the Police Commander separates his/her staff into

     separate units with each unit being given a whole policing task.                            For

     example, one or more of the units might be delegated to Police the away

     supporters.     These units        would     then be         expected   to meet      the    away

     supporters at the rail station,              coach or car parks and ensure their

     safe arrival at the ground.              On arrival,         this unit may then search

     supporters entering the ground.             As more of the spectators enter, the

     supervisor would       then feed        in his/her      staff commensurate           with    the

     proportion of supporters inside and outside the stand.                      Towards the end

     of the game, this tactic would then be reversed.



49   There   is   little    doubt     that    this    system of       policing    is much        less

     wasteful,     although    some     concern       has   been     expressed    about    certain

     aspects of it.        This system demands more of individual supervisors,

     usually sergeants, and to a degree this is accepted, although they have

     the capacity and should perform this role.                     It does little more than

     ensure proper        supervision    so that       staff are performing          to maximum

     efficiency.     It is also acknowledged that direct supervision of staff

     may not be possible at all times.                This occurs under existing policing

     arrangements     and     radio     communication        will      assist    this     flexible

     proposal.     In any event areas of the ground will also be monitored by

     numerous     other    individuals       including      the    Police    Commander     and    the       I
     control room staff,       all of whom will be available to express to the



                                               ■58-
a          Sergeant any concerns they may have                 if there is a lack of officers

           within the stands at any one time.



    5.50   Another perceived problem is the period ten minutes before and ten

           minutes after the kick off when all staff will be at their busiest and

           could be stretched.         There are however a number of factors that must be

           remembered, for example



             (i)    the number of staff on duty for the event will reflect the

                    pr e -match inte H i gence,

            (ii)    invariably, before most fixtures kick off,                     the crowd is very

                    passive, no penalties have been awarded and there have been no

                    disallowed goals,

           (iii)    the officers engaged outside the ground will invariably have the

                    back up of the Mounted Branch,                 Dog Section and Team Policing

                    Units, together possibly with club stewards,

             (lv)   the officers engaged within the ground can always call upon the

                    match reserve to assist if and when required,

              (v)    the only thing that the Police will be expected to deal with are

                     incidents of crime and public disorder,

             (vi)    the stands will initially be policed by the club's stewarding

                     operation.



    5.51    One     problem     that    this    system       of policing      could   create      is   the

            maintenance    of    accurate      records       for   charging      purposes    as   to   when

            officers    were    or     were    non   engaged policing       in    or at     the   ground.

            Nevertheless       the     potential     savings are     such     that    this    system    of



                                                      -59-
                                                                                         G
       policing should be considered in respect of all football grounds and

       adopted where Divisional Commanders feel it appropriate.



       Kon-Policed



5.52   When notification of a football match has been received by the Police

       one of the first considerations is how many officers will be required.

       Rarely,    if ever,     is it considered whether or not     any officers   are

       actually required at all.      It must be remembered that organised

       football matches do not demand the attendance of Police officers per se.

       Indeed there are many non-league football grounds which are not policed

       and attendances are equivalent to those of some football league clubs,



5.53   It should also be remembered that under the terms of this report's

       recommendations it is envisaged that Police officers will only police

       inside football grounds in order to:-



         (i)     prevent the commission of offences,

        (ii)     maintain order,

       (iii)     assist the club with their responsibilities towards safety (if

                 requested).



5.54   If intelligence is such that it can reasonably be anticipated that no

       offences are likely to be committed; that there will be no incidents of

       disorder and the club have reached standards whereby they do not need

       Police assistance to perform their safety duties, then why should the

       Police     be   in   attendance?   No   Divisional   Commander   would   commit

a   5.55   It is accepted that in some Force areas the staging of a professional

           football league match without Police inside the stadium is a completely

i          new concept.     However,   several    such    events have   already    taken place


a          throughout the country.     As far as it is possible to ascertain, all have

           been met with a positive result.        At least six clubs have already played


i          matches with no police      involvement.       Indeed a small number       of these

           routinely do so     (except for the occasional higher risk match).              The

i          club's Safety Officer and stewards take full control of all functions,

           including operation of the C.C.T.V. cameras.
9
1   5.56   It is a recommendation of this report that all Forces consider similar

           undertakings for selected fixtures.          This will obviously only occur where

9          the srewarding operation at the club in question has progressed to such a

           degree of professionalism that this will be appropriate and where full
3          account has been taken of all other related matters.                   Initially the


a          respective Divisional Commander may well want safeguards in place such

           as; -

i
              (i)    an indemnity from the club (Statement of Intent with variations),

i            (ii)    a reserve of officers at the ground, chargeable to the club, to

                     fulfil their responsibilities outlined at paragraph 5.53.
i
i           The Safety Advisory Group should always be consulted prior to such an

            event.    If such undertakings regularly prove successful then it is hoped

i           that the non-attendance of Police for identified fixtures would become

            the norm.




i                                                -61-
Most Police officers engaged with the policing of football matches

accept that there is now little trouble within grounds and because of

this   the    time    for consideration        of such undertakings          would appear

right.     If trouble were to return to the grounds then of course the

Police would         respond    accordingly.        The   cost   of   such   a   response,

however, would now fall on the club or organiser.



Police ACCitudes



It is fair to say that the attitude of many Police officers towards

football      supporters       has   not   always    been    positive.       Some   Police

Commanders already address this subject at pre-match briefings and in

match orders.        It is considered essential that all Forces demonstrate a

positive attitude at all times towards genuine football supporters, and

are seen to be there to assist in the enjoyment of the event rather

chan as the enemy or enforcer.



Some Forces have adopted a "meet and greet" policy whereby an officer

boards a coach on its arrival, before the supporters disembark,                          and

positively welcomes them to the ground and expresses the hope that they

enjoy their visit to the area.              The officer then gives directions to

the appropriate stands and asks them to enter the ground as soon as

possible.      The supporters are discouraged from drinking alcohol and the

officer      then    explains    the   standard     of    behaviour    expected     of   the

supporters.



This message is also reinforced in some Force areas when supporters
      enter the ground by way of a Police broadcast which not only covers

      emergency procedures but also contains a welcoming message in which the

      Police Commander Is introduced to the public by name, as is the Safety

      Officer.      The Police then indicate the standard of behaviour acceptable

      within the ground.



61    The success of introducing such policies has been demonstrated in one

      Force in the form of numerous letters received expressing the delight

      in    the    way    in which      the   supporters   were    treated by    the    Police,

      Similarly,         in   a   number   of Forces,   Police    Commanders    have    adopted

      policies which are reiterated at all briefings.                For example



           (i)    EE FIRM, FRIENDLY AND FAIR,

       (ii)       BE POSITIVE, PLEASANT AND POLITE.



62    One view that has been expressed, particularly by club stewards, was

      that the service provided by, and the attitude of officers from the

      "home"       division       was   always   more   positive     than   those      providing

      inter-divisional aid.



      Briefings



.63   Briefing parades are an essential element in transmitting information

       from management to the workforce and should always be relevant and

       concise.      Ideally where circumstances permit, a joint briefing with the

       club's stewarding staff and the Police should be held.                   Where this is

       done it is important that it is seen as a joint briefing as opposed to
       the stewards attending the Police briefing.



5.64   Where this type of briefing is not possible because of the size of

       accommodation available or the numbers attending,                     then consideration

       should be    given      to   a   system    of     cascade     briefings    by   the    Police

       Commander and Safety Officer commencing with their respective senior

       staff followed by joint Police/steward briefings.                      By holding joint

       briefings it is hoped that a feeling of team spirit will be generated.

       This will improve the operation and also encourage the cross flow of

       information.      Where joint briefings are not possible a senior Police

       officer and senior steward should attend each others briefings.



5.65   Debriefing is also considered essential and ideally should be                            done

       before officers stand down from duty.                  It is accepted that at the end

       of a game,       because the Police operation is still                 running when the

       stewarding operation has ended,             a joint debrief could not be held.

       However, the club's Safety Officer should ideally be in attendance.



5.66   Where debriefs of all staff are not considered practical, they should

       be   held   by    senior     supervisors         who   have    information      from    their

       subordinates.      In these circumstances, Police and steward supervisors

       should complete a debrief sheet to be handed in at the end of the

       operation    (negative       returns      also),       thus   maximising     the      incoming

       intelligence      and   enabling    future        operations     to   be   fine-tuned      and

       adjusted accordingly.

,67    In recent years, the use of conspicuity jackets by Police officers at

       football grounds has proved highly effective.            Not only does it make

       officers highly visible to spectators with any deterrent value that may

       have, but it also makes them just as visible to the Police Commander

       which in turn makes his/her job that much easier when considering or

       assessing deployment.



.68    The reduction in staffing levels recommended in this report makes the

       role of each officer at a game more vital.          It is essential that there

       is effective communication between the ground control room and every

       officer.      The issue of a personal radio to all officers engaged on the

       match   day    operation presents    no   problem   as   sufficient   radios   are

       usually available.      However,    problems do exist,     particularly at the

       larger grounds with officers not hearing radio transmissions due to

       crowd noise.      This can be overcome by the use of efficient ear pieces.



       Welfare of officers



5.69    Within some Force areas, many officers attending football matches are

        left to their own devices if they require any form of refreshments.

        This often results in officers openly queuing at a variety of outlets,

        purchasing hot drinks and consuming them in full view of the public.

        In other areas, hot and cold drinks are provided before the officers

        parade for duty and are available thereafter from a designated area.

        This is sometimes at the expense of the club.
5.70   It appears paradoxical that chose officers who are engaged on duties

       within the ground control room, which is invariably heated,             usually

       have a ready supply of drinks whilst those officers deployed outside

       often in the cold and the wet have not.         Consideration should be given

       to addressing this issue locally with individual clubs in the first

       instance.   Ultimately, however, if the clubs are not prepared to supply

       the drinks, the cost should be borne by individual Forces.



       Los i n g of Events



5.71   In many Forces, the logging of incidents during match day operations is

       ad hoc.     Few grounds have a formal log of events.            The recommended

       arrangements    in    the   following     paragraphs   should   be   considered
                                                                                         £
       separately from the requirements for a club to keep its own records as            ||

       laid down by the Safety Certificate.



5.72   It is recommended that the Police or club communications (Police in the

       short term) maintain a formal log in order that:-                                 I
         (i)   an accurate record of events is available,

        (ii)   an accurate assessment can be made at alater date             of events   I
               which will provide a valuable tool         in categorising the next

               fixture between the same opponents.



5.73   It is not envisaged that all radio communications will be logged or
                                                                                         L
       that the log will contain great detail, provided it is sufficient to

       act as an aide memoire.      Whilst the list below is not exhaustive, the




                                          -66-                                           L
      following should always be recorded:-



        (i)   the serial numbers of any C.C.T.V. cassettes being used for the

              event,

       (ii)   any occurrence within the confines of the ground, including the

              exact time and location and also if the events are recorded on

              C.C.T.V.,

      (iii)   the movement of staff, originally deployed away from the ground,

              into    the     stadium      itself      and       the    specific       reason     for       such

              deployment       (this      could have         a    financial         implication        to    the

              club),

       (iv)   any policy decisions made by the Police Commander including:-

              (a)    reasons for assuming responsibilities not previously agreed

                     with the club in the Statement of Intent,

              (b)    reasons for holding back away supporters,

              (c)    requests for additional resources,

         (v) whether or not the C.C.T.V. video cassettes are required for

              evidential or intelligence purposes,



.74    Safety will     not     be    a    responsibility           for       the    Police     under    normal

       circumstances,       although       in    the    event      of    an        emergency     the    Police

       communicator        could    be    in    the    position         of    having      to    contact      key

       personnel     within    the       stadium.      At    the beginning            of the match           day

       operation     the    Police       Commander     should ensure               that   details       of    the

       following personnel and how or where they can be contacted are known

       and also logged:-



         (i) club's Safety Officer,
 (ii)      match day doctors,

(iii)      senior ambulance personnel (how many staff),

 (iv)      senior St. John's ambulance officer (how many staff),

     (v)   club electrician,

 (vi)      the cutting equipment operator,



A formalised check list should be devised in respect of each individual

ground so that the checking of Police equipment can be logged.              Such a

check list would be unique to each ground but may include such things

as: -



     (i)   checking the ground and immediate vicinity for debris that could

           be used as missiles,

 (li)      testing Police radio equipment,

(iii)      testing that the tannoy override system is working,



POLICE DUTIES



The general concept of policing football stadia has been discussed in

Sections 3 and 4,      In addition to the specific posts already identified

as    suitable   for   replacement   of Police   officers   by   stewards    (e.g.

searching spectators and monitoring C.C.T.V.), there are other duties

currently performed by Police officers which can be discontinued or the

number of officers reduced.       These posts are identified below.



Staff Officers



There appears to be no common practice in the allocation of staff
1
I          officers to senior supervisors.               At some grounds none of the Police

           Commanders have staff officers whilst at others the Police Commander,

           the   ground    Inspector      and   the    outside     Inspector    each has     a   staff

           officer.      During an emergency situation, staff officers are considered

           essential.      However,      in such circumstances staff can be                drawn from

           officers deployed in the ground, having previously been identified in

           the pre-match planning.




%   5.78   It has been argued that the Police Commander needs a staff officer                        in

           order to      ensure that he is fully aware of all radio transmissions                    on

a          the 'command' and 'normal' channels.                  However,    it is the role of the

           communicator to ensure that the Police Commander is made aware of all

           relevant occurrences and requests.                   If staff officers are deployed,

           then those in and at the ground, with their respective commander, would

           be chargeable to the club.              Over a season (21 games) this would be at a

           cost in the region of £3,000 per staff officer (Constable rank).                      This,

           however, may be justified at larger grounds where the staff officer
a          provides a specialist service to the Police Commander.


i   5.79   At    most     grounds      it is not    envisaged that      staff        officers will   be

           deployed as a matter of routine, although their role in the event of a

           major      incident is recognised and should be                  catered for within the

           Police contingency plan.


s           Communications



    5.80    It   is     common   for    two   Police    radio    operators     and    a communications

           supervisor to be employed within a ground control room.                      One operator

           is dedicated to the match control channel with the other to the command

           channel.     Under   normal    circumstances,         there   is   very      little    radio

           traffic    on the    command channel.        There     appears     no   reason why       the

           command    channel   cannot be     used    in   the    talk through mode,             thereby

           eliminating the need for an operator on that channel which can still be

           monitored by the supervisor and the Police Commander.                   In an emergency

           situation     an   effective    command     channel      would     become     vital.      An

           experienced operator can be identified in the match order and deployed

           on other duties until required in the event of a major incident.



           Detention Room and Prison Van Staff



    5.81   Whilst    it may be    appropriate       to staff detention rooms             for     certain

           identified fixtures (e.g Category 'A' games) on many occasions it is

           not cost effective to do so and it is recommended that alternative

           procedures should be considered, after an examination of local arrest

           rates.     This would not of course preclude the use of the detention

           facility to hold violent prisoners whilst awaiting transport.                       Any such

           procedures    inside   and     outside    the   stadium       should    be    designed     to

           minimise the period during which the arresting officer is away from                             E
           his/her post.

                                                                                                           E
    5.82   Alternatives worthy of consideration would be:-
                                                                                                           I
             (i)     utilising the sub-divisional van,                                                     E
            (ii)     allocate a dedicated van to the event which could be utilised

                                                                                                           E
                                                -70-
                                                                                                           I
                                                                                                           E
              for anti-vandal duties whilst not conveying prisoners,

      (ill)   giving    a    Sergeant    and    Constable        other   duties   with     a    dual

              responsibility to staff the detention room if required.



      However,    safeguards would have to be               in place     to    ensure that          the

      arresting officer is properly identified before he/she and the prisoner

      part company (e.g. photographed) and that after the event has finished,

      the arresting officer attends at the custody office to process the

      prisoner.



83    Prison vans      are    normally    deployed at        football       grounds   when      large

      numbers of arrests are anticipated and it is desired to keep home and

      away prisoners        separated.    Under       these circumstances,        the use of a

      prison van is convenient.          However, such a deployment again has a staff

      and cost implication.        Vhen considering the use of a prison van, Police

      Commanders should be mindful of the likelihood of arresting any home

      supporters and, if such arrests can be anticipated, the likely number.

      It could be possible to process away supporters through the detention

      room whilst the home supporters are processed in the normal fashion,

      being taken directly to the local Police station.



      Deployment: of Officers



.84   Where particular fixtures are considered trouble free, in an effort to

       demonstrate the reduced responsibility of the Police and to reinforce

       to the club that they and not the Police are running the event, Police

       Commanders      should   actively       seek    a   low    profile     deployment       in   the
       stadium, including the match reserve.          This could be at the rear of the

       terrace or at the back of a stand.              Conversely,    or in response to

       particular incidents, the Police Commander has the option of an overt

       Police presence.



5.85   Where certain sections of the ground are considered troublesome then

       the use of dedicated officers         to police that area for a prolonged

       period   should   be   considered   in    an   effort   to   give   those   officers

       ownership of the problem.      Experience in several Force areas shows this

       tactic to be effective for a number of reasons, namely:-



         (i)    the   officer(s)   know   they have    been    tasked with     a   specific

                policing problem and management are awaiting a result,

        (ii)    if the problem is not solved, the officers know full well that

                they will be faced with the same problem at the next match,

       (iii)    supporters soon find themselves in a position of being able to

                identify with individual        officers   and know what standard        of

                behaviour is not considered acceptable.



       Deployment: of the Stiecial Constabulary



5.86   The concept of full cost recovery was introduced by the Home Office to

       present a business like approach and deter clubs from leaving it all to

       the Police.     The Special Constabulary receive an allowance in respect

       of any duties they perform including those at football matches.                   If

       they continue to be deployed in or at football                grounds then their

       services are essentially free of charge.            This compromises the concept



                                           -72-
       of full cost recovery and may influence a club's willingness to improve

       stewarding   arrangements.     Consequently,    if    special    constables     are

       deployed on match days, this should normally be away from the ground on

       traffic duty.



5.87   Where such deployment is made, these officers should be identified- in

       the planning stages and included in the match order.            This is often not

       the case as some       special constables parade for       duty without prior

       notification.     Consequently regular officers are identified for those

       duties which are then duplicated.       It is essential that match control

       should   always   be   able   to   identify   all    officers    engaged   on   the

       operation.



       POLICE RESPONSE TO INCIDENTS



5.88   The definition of Police responsibilities at football grounds and the

       proposed reduction in the number of officers deployed has implications

        for the Police response to incidents in the future.            The following are

        a number of critical areas;-



        Kninih Scares and Evacuations



5.89    Force instructions generally state that in the event of a bomb                  (or

        indeed a suspected bomb) being found or reported, initial Police action

        should be confined to:-



        (a)     notifying the owner of the premises; and
       (b)        assisting the            owner      or person          in charge    to    evacuate          and

                  search the premises if requested.



       Some Police Commanders have                       in fact gone further              than this          and    1
       accepted       responsibility            for      conducting        the    evacuation.           If    the

       Police are to be involved in any form of evacuation, it should be at                                          E
       the specific request of the club.                            This will then afford officers

       some      form     of     protection         as       outlined      in     paragraph    9        of    the

       Specification for Special Police Services (Appendix A Schedule 1).



       P i t c h I n v a s io n s a n d En£<rrc-ftmftTifc



5.90   Section 4 of the Football Offences Act 1991 makes it an offence for
                                                                                                                     t
       any person at a designated football match to encroach on the playing

       area or an. area adjacent to the playing area where spectators are

       not      normally          permitted,           without           lawful     excuse.         If        the

       recommendations of this report are implemented, fewer officers will

       in future be deployed on the perimeter track.



5.91   In addition to being a breach of the law, such actions would also
                                                                                                                     I
       constitute a breach of the ground regulations which are enforceable

       by the club.             Some Forces already make it clear that it is the

       responsibility of stewards to clear individual supporters from the                                            I
       playing       area.        Police       officers            may   assist     stewards       in        these

       circumstances and, in any event, will continue to arrest offenders

       for this offence.                                                                                             I

                                                            -74-                                                     I
                                                                                                                     I
5.92   In the event of a mass pitch invasion,      this would clearly be a

       public order problem and the Police would be expected to act.    Fewer

       officers will be at football grounds, although invariably before any

       such pitch invasions there is a period of high tension during which

       the Police Commander can put into operation previously considered

       strategies to combat the threat.



       Rtnliisinn fYrrlwl-g




5.93   One role commonly undertaken by      divisional Football   Intelligence

       Officers is the maintenance of a full list or index of persons who

       are currently excluded from that particular football ground together

       with photographs.      A full list of exclusions   together with their

       photographs should be maintained within the ground control room for

       reference and use by the C.C.T.V. operators.



       E je c tio n s



5.94   Following a case in one force area, the policy of processing persons

       ejected from football grounds through the detention room has ceased.

       Persons ejected from football grounds are now taken directly out of

        the ground and if they are not prepared to supply their name or

        address a brief description is taken by the officer.



 5.95 The majority of ejections are made for expediency or because the




                                          -75-
       behaviour    of   an   individual   does      not warrant   arrest    but    is   still

       unacceptable.      This usually means         that there has been a breach of

       ground regulations which, under normal circumstances,                should be dealt

       with   by   the   club's   stewards,    although    the   Police   will     assist   on

       request.



5.96   Lord Justice Taylor made the following observations in the final report

       into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster (paragraph 261) as to whether

       spectators should be arrested or simply ejected (referring particularly

       to the offence of "being drunk in a designated sports ground")



              "... In England, although arrests are made, there Is a
              tendency to eject many offenders without arresting them. In
              Scotland the police take a firm line.      They do not eject
                                                                                                 L
              offenders; they arrest them.      The English approach may
              partly be due to a commendable desire not to be seen as
              hostile to football spectators.      However, it is also a
              matter of expediency.      Making an arrest requires the
              arresting officer to take the offender to a police room and
              go through the prescribed procedure and paperwork.      This
              takes the officer away from his post for a minimum of a
              quarter of an hour. At some grounds (Hillsborough was one)
              evidence suggests a much lengthier absence is common.
              Clearly, if a serial of eight officers is posted to a bank
              of turnstiles, three or four arrests may greatly reduce the
              team for a significant period.        There is a tendency,
              therefore, to avoid making arrests save in the worst cases.
              I do not wish to advocate repressive measures which would be
              counter to all I have said about the need for a new attitude
              towards spectators. On the other hand, it cannot be a good
              ground for declining to make an arrest that one cannot spare                       I
              an officer    to   do  it.    I therefore recommend that
              consideration be given to streamlining arrest procedures so
              as to divert an arresting officer from his post; for the
              minimum time. One method I have seen adopted is for the
              officer to give only basic details of the arrest and be
              photographed with the offender before resuming his duties.
              He can then return after the match to complete the
              documentation."
                                                                                                 E

      return to their allocated post at the earliest opportunity, may have

      had    merit    whilst     the    Police    accepted     responsibility          for    safety.

      Henceforth,        as their responsibility is to maintain order and arrest

      offenders,       then    should    the     ejection    policy       be   altered       and   more

      offenders be arrested?            The principle above is unlikely to be radically

      changed      and    Police     Commanders     will    always    wish      to   maximise        the

      availability of officers at a ground.



98    At many grounds,         even those within the same Force area, there is no

      common policy in relation to the way offences at football matches are

      dealt with.         At some grounds officers are instructed to arrest whilst

      at others ejections are commonplace.                 Any arrest policy will be subject

      to    some     variation     in   application because          of    differing     events      and

      priorities.         Some level of conformity is however desirable, at the very

      least on a Force-wide basis.              To achieve this it is recommended that an

      enforcement policy for football grounds                  is developed and published.

      This    would       minimise      the    confusion    and   misunderstanding            that    is

       experienced by officers who police more than one ground.                        In addition,

       uncertainty in the minds of spectators as to what is or is not regarded

       as unacceptable behaviour at particular grounds will be removed.



       POST MATCH



       Investigations



.99    Retrospective Police action using footage from static C.C.T.V, cameras

       or those operated by football intelligence officers has proved highly
      successful      and    contributed    to   the    decrease      in     general      levels     of

      disorder   observed      at    football    grounds.      With     the    removal       of more

      officers from grounds, the requirement for post match investigations

      could increase.        In view of the proposed increase in responsibility for

      the operation and monitoring of C.C.T.V. by the club, agreement should

      be   reached to provide          recordings   to the Police for evidential and

      intelligence purposes.




100    The    only current post match requirement on many divisions                              is the

       completion of a Football Match Summary form which is then forwarded to

       the    National      Criminal    Intelligence     Service      Football       Unit.        This,

       combined with the evaluation of pre-match intelligence, the event log

       and    de-brief      information discussed earlier             will    enable      Divisional

       Commanders to assess their future needs when policing events of a

       similar nature.



101    This    information and any other            from a particular              game    should be

       carefully      evaluated      and   conclusions      documented        on    a     post    event

       evaluation form with a suggested category for the next fixture between

       the    same    clubs.    By     doing this      after   each    game    it       ensures    that

       informed and objective decisions             are made,         rather than relying on

       memory    at    the beginning       of the      following      football      season.        This

       structured approach is desirable even though other factors may have a

       later bearing on the categorisation.
5.102    The post event evaluation form and the following documents which, with

         the    exception   of    the   nominal     roll    and   time   sheet   developed   for

         accounting purposes, have been discussed in the preceding paragraphs,

         should be compiled as a "match file” :-



           (i)    Nominal roll,

          (ii)    Time sheet,

         (iii)    Events log,

          (iv)    Key posts form,

           (v)    De-brief sheets,

          (Vi)    Football Hatch Summary form,

         (vii)    Post event evaluation



         LEGAL TS SITES



5.103    During the course of the research conducted for this report, numerous

         well    tried    and    tested   Police        tactics   were   witnessed   at   various

         grounds.     The origin of the powers being used however was not always

         clear and it was felt prudent to seek legal opinion from the Crown

         Prosecution Service.           This    is outlined in paragraphs 5.104 - 5.124

         below.



          Keeping Awav Supporters Back



 5.104    This perhaps can be regarded as a problematic area but one that is

          capable of resolution by referral to the Common Law powers concerning

          breaches    of the peace.            Whilst    it is appreciated that at        certain
        grounds the holding back of away supporters is done as a matter of
                                                                                              1
        course whilst the home supporters disperse, the better practice would                 ||

        be for officers to actually apply their minds as to whether or not

        there was a real, as opposed to a remote, possibility of a breach of                  ^

        the peace occurring if such away supporters were not held back.

                                                                                              L
5.105   The authority for this is Moss -v- McLachlan which concerns Police

        officers, in the Nottinghamshire area, preventing militant miners from

        South Yorkshire travelling any great distance off the motorway and

        going to various pits in the Nottinghamshire area, where members of

        the Union of Democratic Mineworkers were still working.               The history     £

        of that dispute gave good reason for the officers involved to stop the                g

        convoy of miners from Yorkshire because previous visits had resulted

        in substantial     disorder.     There was     ample material upon which        an

        officer could properly justify his/her decision if it was subject to

        scrutiny, as indeed it was in that particular case.
                                                                                              II
                                                                                              Kl



5.106   By analogy, it must be the case, that if one is really examining in                   £
        detail   whether   legally     the   step    can   be   taken   of   holding   away   ^

        supporters back,    then it can only be on the basis that an officer

        reasonably anticipates,        that but for that action,        a breach of the

        peace could take place.      Therefore it is more likely in, say, Category            ^

        'A' matches, that that risk exists.            If a senior officer is of the
                                                                                              I
                                                                                              •*

        view that such a risk is negligible then on the relevant principle,

        strictly speaking, no such step could be taken.             The question arises

        as to who is likely to be liable.           The only thing that really springs

        to mind is a civil suit for false imprisonment or detainer by Police



                                             -80-
      officers    against the people kept inside.                 Therefore,    the position

      needs to be approached with some caution,



107   It should always be borne in mind that the word 'reasonable' crops up

      in the definition of the extent of the power (exercisable to citizens

      as well as Police officers) to deal with breaches of the peace.                        In

      other words it imports an objective assessment and that will mean that

      the Court will feel entitled to examine the information, intelligence

      or material open to the officers or officer who made the decision and

      see whether or not in all the circumstances that was a reasonable

      decision to make.       There is ample authority that the Courts do have to

      take account of the exigencies of the situation, i.e. how serious an

      outbreak of disorder it was and how little time there was available to

      make any particular decision.



108   Police     Commanders    should,     then,   make     the     decision   to   hold   away

      supporters back at the end of a game on the realistic basis that a

      breach of the peace could take place if they were not held back.                       The

      reasons for doing so should be stated in the match log.



       Cordoning off a Football Ground



,109 The tactical option of a Police cordon is to regulate                     entry to ticket

       holders.     The considerations in the above paragraphs with respect to

       keeping away supporters back after the game                    apply equally to       the

       Police     cordon.     At   a    Category     ’A ’   game,    for   example,   with    an

       anticipated spectator           capacity or    a U.E.F.A.       regulated game where
      local and nationalist passions are heightened, a realistic potential

      for   disorder    arises    if   non-ticket          holders   are   admitted      to    the

      proximity of the ground.           If,    on this basis,        the Police Commander

      reasonably anticipates a breach of the peace,                  then a Police cordon

      would be justified.        This would not be the case, however,                at a game

      where it was felt there was no particular risk of disorder,



      Sr«tn«i of a Detention Room


                                                                                                       i
5.110 The   purpose    of   detention rooms           at football    grounds    is   simply to

      provide a place where the prisoner can be kept safely pending the

      arrival of transport to take him/her to a designated Police station.

      This is really no different from an arrest that may take place on the

      street where a prisoner is put into the back of a Police vehicle

      pending the arrival of a divisional van.                The provisions of Section 30

      of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 requires that a person

      arrested must be taken to a Police station 'as soon as practicable

      after arrest'.        The requirement under Section 30(2) is to take that

      detained person to a designated Police station.                  There are only very

      limited    circumstances      in    which        a   person    can   be    taken        to   a

      non-designated Police station.



5.111 Provided the only function served               by the detention room is that it is

      to await transport then there can be no question that it achieves the

      status of being a Police station.                A custody officer could operate in

      such a situation at what would be a non-designated Police station but,

      of course, other obligations would then be triggered such as those in



                                               ■82-
       che Codes of Practice.           As long as there are no procedures undertaken

       at   this    detention      room that       are    normally     characteristic        of    a

       designated (or even a T^on-designated Police station) then it should

       not be regarded as anything more than a detention area.                     Charging and

       bailing     somebody from        such    an area     might be    regarded     as   such      a

       characteristic.



112    In cases     of   large outbreaks         of public disorder where            substantial

       numbers     of people      are being arrested and are kept              at a location

       pending     transport      to   Police    stations    they    are   detainees      and not

       prisoners.       Whether    or not          the place of their detention is outdoorsor

       indoors that status         should          not change.



       SsaTfthinff Spectators



,113   Page 14 of part 'A' of the revised Codes of Practice clearly indicates

       that Police officers are entitled to routinely search persons entering

       sports grounds or other premises with their consent or as a condition

       of entry.     Whilst it is understandable why, from a practical point of

       view,     such    routine       searching    might    be   excluded    from     the    usual

       provisions of the code and of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, it

       nevertheless seems to run contrary to the spirit of the Act and the

        code   to have     such exclusions          that permit blanket       searching,          even

        though that may take place on the type of premises specified.



.114    The position is        perhaps not as problematic              as it could be where
officers     seek      to   conduct      a   search     by   consent,       rather     than    in

compliance      with    the    criteria      in   the   code      itself,    because    then a

question could clearly arise as to whether or not there genuinely was

consent    offered by         the    person being       searched.          However,    in     this

particular situation that should not arise.                       It is clear that routine

searching is permitted where entry is sought into a sports ground.                              It

is interesting to note, however,                  that there is also a reference to

conditions of entry.



In practice, where searches are being conducted as a condition of

entry, the following should always be borne in mind:-



  (i)     It is best practice to search prior to the customer entering

          the ground rather than when inside,

 (ii)     The contractual conditions should be well publicised and clear,

        visible notices should be on display at or before the point of

          entry.



The reasons for this are as follows:-



  (i)     Once a customer has paid his/her money,                      it can properly be

          argued that the offer and acceptance have been completed and

          the   contract       becomes       binding    at     that   point.      It    cannot,

          therefore,        then    be   argued    that,     in    order    to   complete      the

          contract, the customer should then agree to be searched because

          the contract is, in essence, already complete.

 (ii)     When two parties enter into a contract both should be fully
                 aware     of     all   the   conditions    of   that   agreement     prior   to

                 completion.        It is,     therefore,   no use having the conditions

                 inside     the    ground     which   the   customer    can   read   after    the

                 contract has been completed.



.116   Failure to adequately notify customers of the conditions of entry

       could have legal implications for both the club and the Police.                        For

       example, if having paid and entered the ground, a customer refused to

       be searched and was therefore ejected, and during the course of that

       ejection the Police officer or steward was assaulted by the customer,

       any subsequent assault charge could be in jeopardy of failing if the

       customer successfully argued that the steward or Police officer were

       acting illegally.



.117 Despite the advice given above,                  it is recommended that the routine

       searching of spectators entering football grounds should be conducted

       by the club who are inviting them into their premises, at their own

       expense.          Any searches conducted by Police officers should fall in

       line with the spirit of existing legislation in the form of the Police

       and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Sporting Events                        (Control of

       Alcohol) Act 1985.



        E je c tio n s



.118    Following on from paragraph 5.94 - 5.98 above, if a person is to be

        ejected from the ground for a breach of the contractual conditions, it

        is only right and proper that customers know of the conditions prior
        to entry.     To a degree the power of ejection must depend upon the

        terms and conditions under which a spectator enters the ground and it

        begs the question whether or not the conditions have to be lengthy,

        convoluted and perhaps detailed.       It must be appreciated that this is

        quite a grey area and it must be determined what exactly will trigger

        the power to eject.



5.119   Clearly, disorderly behaviour could arise from a breach of the peace

        or a reasonably anticipated breach of the peace and that need not be

        enshrined in any form of contractual condition or term.       Uhat must be

        remembered, is that if, for instance, swearing took place and that was

        interpreted by the steward concerned as a breach of contract, what is

        the next step?    Breaches of contracts will either be sound in damages

        or will lead one party to be able to repudiate the contract, which in

        these circumstances would mean to eject that party from the ground.

        But there may equally be cases where, though there is a breach of

        contract, it may not necessarily amount to disorderly behaviour.       For

        instance, swearing in the middle of a popular terrace would not equate

        to swearing in the children's enclosure and for that reason may not be

        disorderly.



5.120   At many football grounds stewards are actively being encouraged to

        eject for breach of ground regulations with officers being used simply

        to prevent any possible breaches of the peace.       In order to encourage

        this, at some grounds officers are being told not to question what a

        steward has seen or heard but simply to comply with the steward's

        request and assist where necessary in ejecting the person.



                                        -86-
9
I   5.121    This practice is of some concern to the Crown Prosecution Service and


9            should be     addressed.         For   instance,       if a steward was

             seeking to eject, detain or arrest for a breach of the peace or an
                                                                                               erroneously




1            anticipated breach of the peace and had sought the assistance of an

             officer, when in actual fact the action taken by                           the steward was

1            unlawful,     then      it   must   follow      that    the   officer      also    is    acting

             unlawfully.       Whilst officers have wider powers than citizens (though
I            not with     regard      to breaches       of     the peace)      the   Crown Prosecution

a            decisions of such stewards.             They are very unlikely to accept that an

             officer was justified in acting the way he did simply because he was
i            carrying out the instruction of a steward.                        It would therefore be


i            prudent for officers to satisfy themselves that any such ejection,

             detention or arrest is properly justified.

9             Consequently, if the Police are faced with any investigations, one of

              the first groups of potential witnesses to be approached will be the

3             stewards.        Indeed,      it may be      as a result of something seen by a

              steward that Police take certain actions.                      Stewards must, therefore,
I             be made aware of their potential role as witnesses and subsequent


9             consequences.



1    5.123    As with any other criminal case, the prosecution has the right to call



a                                                       -87-



i
        witnesses from whom witness statements have been taken and serve or

        tender statements.       It is under a duty to tender the names of persons

        who may be able to give material evidence, but who have been unwilling

        to make a witness statement for the prosecution.             The duty to tender

        remains intact despite that unwillingness.           Hence, in respect of club

        stewards who are in the vicinity of, or who witness criminal acts, if

        the prosecution do not intend to use them as witnesses the prosecution

        is nevertheless duty bound to tender such witnesses to the defence.

        It is best to anticipate this problem in advance given that officers

        who were      on duty would be      given the task of trying to establish

        exactly who saw what.



5.124   This clearly calls for a very responsible approach on the part of

        those people     who    are    employed as   stewards because     in appropriate

        cases, no doubt, the club will be as keen to see incidents of criminal

        misconduct prosecuted as will the Police.



        STEffAKDING OPERATIONS



5.125   It is accepted that Police Forces are not in a position to enforce any

        change   in    the   stewarding    operations   of   individual   football   clubs

        within their Force areas.         However, during the course of the research,

        some operations        were   observed to be    excellent whilst     others were

        totally inadequate.           Drawn from   this experience   and identified     at

        Appendix E are some of the observed best practices which Forces may

        wish to individually pursue with their clubs.




                                                                                             1
            BEHAVIOUR O F SPECTATORS




    5.126   During recent years,        the behaviour of spectators attending football

            grounds   has improved dramatically.          The Sporting Events     (Control of

            Alcohol) Act 1985 and other football related legislation,                together

            with enhanced Police professionalism at football events, has had a

            significant impact on standards of behaviour.



    5.127   Some spectators have been attending football matches for many years

            and in    a ll   honesty do n o t    consider    that their behaviour may be a

            breach    ofany    rules.     They   simply     feel   that   this   behaviour     is

            acceptable.      In consultation with the Police, a club should consider

            the introduction of a behaviour policy which clearly i l l u s t r a t e s         to

            spectators what      is ,   and what    is not,    acceptable behaviour.         This

            policy can then be highlighted to the supporters via:-



               (i)    the club programme,

              (ii)    press releases,


s            (iii)

              (iv)
                      supporters club meeting,

                      Police "meet and greet" teams,

               (v)    tannoy/scoreboard announcements.



    5.128    Where the behaviour of individual supporters is found to be lacking

             and an arrest results, some clubs have introduced a system of banning

             that supporter from the ground for future games.             This is done by way

        considered it may be thought that implementation would be impractical

        and such bans would be impossible to impose.           However,   those clubs

        that have introduced such a system have found it to be              extremely

        successful because, to a large degree, it is self policing.              No-one

        would suggest that people banned from grounds in this way do not gain

        admittance to watch a match, but what has been found is that their

        behaviour improves because they do not want to draw attention to

        themselves.



        IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS



5.129   The three central themes of this report (audit of football grounds,

        phased withdrawal, Statement of Intent) each have major implications

        for individual Police Forces.         Many of the other recommendations are

        aimed primarily at encouraging local Police Commanders to implement

        changes     at   their   particular    football   grounds.   Some   of    these

        recommendations highlight issues which will need to be addressed at a

        Force or regional level.      Specifically they include



          (i)     preparing an awareness course for safety officers,

         (ii)     producing a guide for supervisory officers,

        (iii)     preparing new forms,

         (iv)     amending existing Force orders,

          (v)     standardising match orders,

         (vi)     standardising policy.



5.130   In order to initiate all of the proposals contained herein (and to



                                          -90-
              maintain the impetus thereafter), it would also be necessary to set up

              an implementation and inspectorate team.



ifl   5.131   The practical effect of all the recommendations contained herein will

              need to be impressed upon individual clubs and Safety Advisory Groups

              at the earliest: opportunity.

CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS




The enquiries    that fo llo w e d   the Bradford Fire and the Hillsborough

Stadium Disaster are the most recent o f a number over the past 60 years

that have examined the problem of crowd control and safety at football

stadia.   The apportionment of responsibility between Police and clubs

was first discussed in 1924 with the principle that the Police were

responsible for all matters relating to law and order and the clubs

with arrangements for the convenience of the public.



It is clear from established practice in many Forces that the Police

have assumed a far greater responsibility than that ever envisaged.

The football clubs were content to let this happen as It helped them

financially and operationally.          Moreover,   we    have     for a   long   time

provided our services at a cut price.



The   Taylor   Report   was   the    ninth   official    enquiry    into   safety    at

football grounds and followed three editions of the Green Guide.                  Much

of the previous advice        and recommendations had gone unheeded.                The

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster highlighted the deficiencies and, perhaps

for the first time, painfully illustrated the liability attached to

some of the assumed functions performed by Police Commanders and other

officers at football grounds.



The implementation of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations has seen

many improvements at grounds throughout the country, although several

seasons have passed without there being,            in many cases, a clear and

understandable division of responsibility between the functions of the

Police and club.
The policing arrangements in many Forces have largely developed as an

informal     process   between      the   Divisional     Commander    and   the   local

football club, the extent of this relationship perhaps being reflected

in   the    policing   priority      at   a   particular    ground.     Through    this

localised informality a lack of conformity has evolved in policing

grounds.     One aspect where this is immediately apparent is in manning

levels.



Whilst it must be acknowledged that the character of each football

ground demands different levels of policing, an unjustifiable variation

currently exists throughout the country.             An audit of each ground will

provide     an objective assessment           of staffing levels      for appropriate

categories of game and will allow a flexible response to the many and

varied factors affecting each match.



The new levels should recognise the fundamental change in functions and

that Police will no longer have specific responsibility for safety of

spectators in a stadium.            This division of responsibility is now made

much clearer in one Force area where the Police Authority has already

 introduced full cost recovery for policing services at football stadia.



 The first schedule to the Order for Supply of Special Police Services

 under     Section 15(1)     Police Act 1964       is a Specification of Special

 Police Services and defines the function and responsibility of Police

 at football grounds.        This document is complemented by a much simpler

 Statement     of   Intent    and    together     they   describe     the   division   of

 responsibility between the Police and a club and effectively limit the

 liability to which individual officers were previously exposed.                       In
                                                                                     L
       ordering Special Police Services Che club explicitly acknowledges the

       Specification.    The Statement of Intent is a simple non-contractual

       agreement and should be acceptable to all clubs.
                                                                                     i
                                                                                     II
6.9    The   introduction of full cost     recovery has presented a     compelling

       financial incentive for clubs to reduce policing costs by increased

       stewarding.



6.10   This report outlines proposals to assist clubs in the transition from a

       high profile policing operation to a high profile stewarding one.      This

       trend should be encouraged and developed.       The financial strength of

       any particular club should not inhibit this process and they should be

       urged towards this objective to free officers for operational use.



6.11   Research suggests that, particularly at some smaller clubs, there will

       be fixtures where a minimum number of Police will be required inside

       grounds.   This will    of course depend on the appropriate      level and

       standard of stewarding being achieved before the match day operation

       can be left to the Safety Officer and his/her staff.       This could occur

       in the very near future on a limited basis and at these games a Police

       ground reserve only would be deployed in response to incidents.



6.12   Finally, this report discusses a number of proposals which will assist

       the Police Commander to fulfil his/her role and responsibilities and

       will provide     each Police   Force with   a structured   and standardised

       approach to the policing of sporting events. These recommendations can

       be summarised as follows:-

In trouble-free grounds, Police Commanders     5.84              71-72
should actively seek a low profile Police
presence

Where particular areas of a ground are         5.85              72
considered troublesome, then the use of
dedicated officers to P o li c e that area
should be considered

Where the Special Constabulary are deployed,   5,86-5.87         72-73
the individual officers should be catered
for within the match order and utilised
away from the ground

Details of exclusion orders should be          5.93              75
maintained within the control room dur­
ing the match day operation

An enforcement policy for offences at foot-    5.98              77
ball grounds should be developed and
published

Careful consideration should be given to       5.104   - 5.109   79 - 82
any decision to hold back away supporters
or cordon off a ground

If officers are assisting stewards to          5.118   - 5.121   85 - 87
eject a spectator they should always seek
the reasons for such ejections and satisfy
themselves they are not acting unlawfully
beforehand.

Chief Constable, or his authorised representative in accordance with the
provisions of the Safety Certificate issued in respect of the Stadium.


Payment for an S,P,S. shall be made within twenty eight days of demand
by the Police Authority and, if payment is not made within such time,
with effect from (date of implementation)       the Police Authority will
institute proceedings forthwith to recover the sum demanded,           together
with interest at the rate at which they require to borrow money (if the

                                   SCHEDULE 1


                 SPECIFICATION FOR SPECIAL POLICE SERVICES


This specification defines the Special Police Services which the Chief
Constable will provide at sports grounds when circumstances permit and
when a person has requested provision of Special Police Services in
accordance with Section 15 of the Police Act 1964.


In issuing this specification, the Chief Constable does not intend to
create    any contract enforceable in           law as to:-


(a)       whether any or any amount             of Special Police Serviceswill be
          provided at all when requested or
(b)       that   the   Special     Police Services    provided      will   be    of   any
          particular quality      or effectiveness or provided in accordance
          with the provisions of this specification.               The purpose of this
          specification is to indicate for the benefit of the Club,                   the
          nature of the Special Police Services which the Chief Constable
          is likely to provide when Special Police Services are requested
          under Section 15 of the Police Act 1964 for a sports ground.


The Chief Constable,       in specifying the need for the attendance of a
specific number of police officers, in accordance with the provisions of
a Safety Certificate for the Stadium gives no warranty that no offences
will be committed or property damaged while such number of officers are
present in the Stadium.


In this specification, any reference to (a) the (name of force) shall
 include the Chief Constable and any person nominated by him for the
purpose     (b) "The Stadium" means the sports ground for which Special
 Police    Services    have   been     requested     and   shall     include    the   land
 surrounding the Stadium and owned or occupied by the Club (c) the Club
 means the person, company or body requesting a Special Police Service at
     a sports ground (d) Special Police Services means services requested in
     accordance with the provisions of Section 15 of the Police Act 1964 and
     (e) Police Commander means the officer of the (name of force) who is in
     charge of all police officers present at The Stadium on the occasion of
     any event for which Special Police Services have been requested.


5.   Police officers who provide         Special     Police    Services   in     the   Stadium
     will;-


     (a)      arrest offenders,
     (b)      keep the peace,
     (c)      prevent offences


     in the stadium and on the public Highway among persons queuing to enter
     the stadium insofar as is practicable tinder the circumstances prevailing
     at the relevant time.


6.   Police officers       aforesaid   may   also,   if     requested,    give    advice     to
     officials of the Club on the means of ensuring the safety of persons in
     the Stadium but the Club may not rely on such advice and must ensure,
     for themselves and in reliance on their own knowledge or that obtained
     from sources other than the (name of force), the safety of persons in
     the Stadium.


7.   Police officers in the Stadium will be under the operational command of
     the Police Commander with whom the Club should liaise in relation to any
     activity of such police officers.


8.   Neither the Police Commander nor any officer of the (name of force) will
     be responsible for ensuring the safety of persons in the Stadium.


9.   Any activities necessary for maintaining the safety of persons in the
     Stadium    or   for    ensuring    anything     else     other   than     the     necessary
     activities referred to in paragraph 5 for the provision of sporting or
     other entertainment in the Stadium will not be undertaken by (name of
     force) as part of the Special Police Services but if any such activities



                                             -5-
are in fact provided by any police officer present in the stadium for
the purpose of providing Special Police Services on the request of an
official of the Club, such activities are gratuitous and the Club cannot
rely on them as ensuring any benefit to the Club or the safety of
spectators.

This Statenent of Intent does not create a legally binding contract or
agreement between (name of force) and (name of club) Football Club but simply
defines the respective duties of the Club and the Police as recommended in
the final report into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster


                      RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FOOTRAT.t. CTITB

     Officials of the football club will be responsible for the safety,
control and monitoring of the crowd entering, leaving and within the stadium
and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or area and the
monitoring of each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding and any other steps
necessary to ensure crowd safety.

     The club will also be responsible for enforcing ground regulations.

                     RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE /'NAME OF FORCED

     The (name of force) may assist club officials where necessary with their
duties relating to crowd control and safety.

     The (name of force) will endeavour insofar as is practicable under the
circumstances prevailing at the relevant time to respond to incidents of
disorder inside or in the vicinity of the stadium during the match day
operation.

     In any circumstance where the Police Commander decides that he/she has
to take overall control of all safety and public order aspects at (name of
ground) Football Stadium by virtue of his duty to preserve life and protect
property, he/she shall notify the Safety Officer of that decision.     During
this period of police primacy, the employees and agents of the club will work
in conjunction with and under the direction of the Police Commander.

                                      VARIATIONS

     Any variations as to the division of responsibility will be agreed in
writing between the club and the police and will be appended to this
document, signed by the same representatives identified hereunder.

                                 LEGAL, ADVICE - STATEMENT OF INTENT



a   (a)   The Taylor report fails to take account of the constitutional nature of
          the Police Service.            There can be no contract or any form of agreement
          between any police officer and another party about the supply of police
          services.        Furthermore,      even if a Chief Constable purports to make a
          contract, he cannot fetter either his own operational discretion nor
          that of any member of the Police Force.


    (b)   Section     15    of   the     Police   Act   1964     is    the        starting     point   for   any
          consideration of the issues relating to policing activities at sports
          stadia.     The activities of police officers in sports stadia take place
          because a Special Police Service has been ordered under Section 15.                                 If
          officers are not in a sports stadium as a result of Section 15, they can
          only go in under the statutory provisions of the Police and Criminal
          Evidence Act 1934 or by invitation.


    (c)   Special Police Services under Section 15 can be defined but they cannot
          be   the    subject       of    agreement.          There   needs         to   be,    therefore,     a
          specification against which clubs can place orders for Special Police
          Services.        This specification can set out what police officers will do
          once they get to the ground and, indeed, it could provide for them to do
          anything which was lawful.


    (d)   The ordering by a club of Special Police Services does not guarantee
          that officers will be made available to provide those services.                                    If,
          however,     officers        are   made available,          the    Chief Constable           (and any
          individual police officer)              is responsible            (a)     for any negligence in
          providing special services and (b)                    damages arising from a failure to
          provide them.          The latter differs from the position in respect of the
          performance of statutory police duties.


    (e)    Although the Taylor report stated that Police and clubs should agree
           where their respective responsibilities for crowd safety lie, it did not
           say what would happen if they could not agree, but the logical outcome
           of failure to agree would be that no Police would be provided at



                                                        -1-
      matches.        The    Football    Licensing       Authority's     'Guidance   on   Safety
      Certificates'         (May 1992) (the Guide) assumes that safety, in accordance
      with the Safety Certificate, would be the responsibility of the clubs
      and public order that of the Police.


(f)   A Safety Certificate drawn up in accordance with the Guide could still
      impose some liability on a Chief Constable as a result of the following
      activities:-


        (i)     The determining by his Senior Officers of a number of Police
                Officers who need to be at the ground to ensure public order.
       (ii)     The failure by his officers present at the ground reasonably to
                ensure public order.
      (iii)     For the failure of his officers to comply with the provisions of
                the 'Statement of Intent' referred to at Paragraph 6.3 of the
                Guide.
       (iv)     By an officer at the ground assuming, de facto,                  responsibility
                for    crowd    safety    and   the      reliance   on    this   assumption   of
                responsibility by the club.


(g)   Potential for liability can be minimised if the Chief Constable gives
      written notice, in some form:-


      (a) That his determination of the number of officers needed                     to police
                                                                                                   I
              the ground relates only to public order;
      (b) That the presence of such number of officers does not                       guarantee
              either crowd safety or public order;
      (c) The number given is to enable clubs to take steps to comply with                         I
              the Safety Certificate only.
                                                                                                   ft
(h)   If the policing of football matches, etc., is to continue, there needs
      to be, in my opinion, three documents to make the Police Force and its                       ^
      members and the Police Authority reasonably 'bomb proof', namely:-


      (a)     A specification for each ground setting out the number of officers
                                                                                                   1
              who will be present, if requested, and setting out what services                     B




                                                -   2-
                  they will provide (i.e. maintaining public order under reasonably
                  foreseeable conditions);
          (b)     A protocol (which would be the Statement of Intent: referred to in
                  Section 6     of     the Guide)       which will explain         the    constitutional
                  position of the Chief Constable and members of Police Forces, deny
                  all liability for crowd safety and, where variations apply, give
                  notice of the matters set out in (g) above; and
          (c)     An agreement about payment between clubs and the Police Authority.


          Documents       (a)   and    (b)    above will       not be    contracts       (i.e.    documents
          setting out terms for breach of which enables one party to sue the
          other)    but    should be          signed by    the    club's      representatives      only    in
          acknowledgement that they have seen their contents.


    (i)   If it is not politically possible for the Force to refuse to provide
          policing     services because           the    clubs   will    not    agree    to a basis        of
          provision       which       obviates    any     liability     for     death    and     injury    to
          spectators,       I must draw your attention to the position of individual
          police officers who are involved in policing sports grounds.                                  If an
          individual police officer is sued as well as the Chief Constable, under

1         Section 48 of the Police Act,                 the Chief Constable's insurance policy
          covers him provided that the Police Authority have agreed to extend
          cover.     What happens in practice is that individual officers are usually
            automatically covered... however, what happened in South Yorkshire was
            that the matter was referred to the Police Authority who, I believe,
            refused to extend liability to the Match Commander.                          It is possible,
          however unlikely,            that    this   could happen       to other       police    officers.
            There is, therefore, good reason to try to make both the Chief Constable
            and   individual      officers       bomb-proof      (a)    to    reduce    the    claims     made
            against the insurers (which would consequentially help to keep premiums
            down) and (b)       to ensure that individual officers were not exposed.


    NOTE:


            I think that the statements                 in Paragraph 6.3 of the Guide that                  'a
            Statement of Intent' is not 'a legal document' is misleading.                           Whether
            or not a document affects, in any way, anyone's legal rights depends on



                                                         -3-
what use it is put to.   A document could be a contract, a notice or a
protocol (i.e. a non-binding agreement).   A non-binding agreement is not
•necessarily a 'non-legal document'.   Although the parties to it cannot
sue each other for breach of the terms of it, they could, depending on
the wording,   sue each other   if one party had relied on it to his
detriment (or possibly failed to take notice of information contained in
it to another person's detriment).     The contents of a protocol could
also be relevant, in legal proceedings, if a third party were to sue one
of the signatories to a protocol.
                                                                                   APPENDIX D


              THE TOOTBATT- T.TCTMSIKG AUTHORITY - STATEMENT OF INTEKT


       Nature of the Statement


(a)    The   Statement    of Intent    should not be     confused with,        duplicate    or
       conflict    with   either    the   Safety    Certificate    issued     by   the   local
       authority    in respect of the football ground or            the contract for the
       provision    of police      services at the ground under Section 15 of the
       Police Act 1964 (commonly referred to as the Special Service Agreement).


(b) The Statement of Intent is not a contract and should expressly make this
       point clear at the outset though it is a document of record.                    It is a
       management    document   produced    jointly    by   or    for   the   police     Ground
       Commander    and his opposite number at the club            (i.e. the club Safety
       Officer) to identify who does what and when.          In    principle there should
       be no difference of approach between this document and the police and
       club's own operational orders or written procedures for the match in
       question.


(c) The Statement of Intent should be a working document, clearly understood
       by both parties and capable of amendment as the need arises or as
       circumstances change.        The procedures and parameters for changes from
       match to match need to be spelled out in the statement.


(d)     The Statement of Intent must be an agreed document to which both parties
        are committed.     It must not be imposed by one party on the other.                 In
        the event of failure to agree on any matter,               the Safety Certificate
        holder will need to satisfy the certifying authority as to the adequacy
        of the alternative arrangements in force.


 (e)    Each Statement of Intent should cover one football ground only (even if
        a single police force is involved at more than one ground at which it
        adopts an identical approach). Where two clubs share one ground it may
        be necessary for there to be two separate Statements of Intent.

      Contents of the Statement:                                                                 **


(f)   The Statement of Intent needs to indicate what tasks shall be undertaken                   £
      by the club and what by the police,             focusing in particular on the
      respective   roles     of   the   club     Safety   Officer   and   police   Ground        jjj
      Commander/Senior Officer present and those of the club's stewards and of
      police officers.                                                                      ||


(g)   The Statement of Intent should also specifically identify:-                                ^


         (i)   who should be in charge of measures to monitor and control crowd
               movement and should take decisions to open or close gates or

                                   STEWARDTNG OPERATIONS


Recruitment


Clubs have          often       expressed      the view    that because        remuneration    is
relatively          low    it    is   difficult      to   recruit    stewards    of   the   right
calibre.          This complaint does not stand up to scrutiny when it is shown
that certain clubs employ responsible stewards who also hold down full
time       jobs     such    as     fire      officers,    managers,    engineers,      teachers,
residential social workers and nurses as well as students.                            One major
club recently advertised for stewards and received in excess of 500
responses.          More clubs are becoming increasingly selective and will not
employ candidates who:-


     (i)    cannot provide two satisfactory references,
 Cii)       is an active supporter of the club interested in watching the
            game,
(iii)       is unemployed,
 (iv)       does not fall in line with the physical requirements as laid
            down by Lord Justice Taylor.


The vast majority of stewards are male but research indicates that
where female stewards do operate, they are considered by their peers to
be an essential resource.


Training


To    ensure       the    quality of any           stewarding operation,        football    clubs
should be committed to effective and thorough training to the standard
laid       down by        the Football League.            Many    clubs now     certificate    an
appropriate         standard       of stewarding and require            a minimum      level   of
training before stewards will be used during a match day operation.
This may include initially being in company with another steward.                            Some
stewards          are     issued      with     a   personal      instruction    booklet     which
contains:-
  (i)    general requirements,
 (ii)    stadium evacuation procedures
(iii)    useful telephone numbers,
 (iv)    stewards duties,
  <v)    ground regulations,
 (Vi)    coded messages,
(vii)    plan of the ground.


The rear of the booklet contains 3. steward testing record.                  During the
match day operation a steward can be tested by a supervisor on his/her
knowledge of their duties and the level of standard achieved can be
regularly recorded.


Check Sheets


Some grounds have designed check sheets to ensure that a systematic
approach    is made     in     checking the    safety of     the    stadium and     that
equipment is in place and functional.           Many of these checks are carried
out by sector supervisors after the stewards briefing has taken place
and the Safety Officer will not allow the turnstiles to be opened until
notification has been received that all the checks have been made and
everything is satisfactory.


Duty Sheets


The     planning   at   clubs    generally    lacks   the   thoroughness     of police
practice.     At a number of grounds, however,              all stewards are being
given     individual    duty    sheets   comparable    to   those    which   have   been
recommended for issue to police officers in this report.                 The style of
the sheet varies but most are laminated cards and include:-


   (i)    maps of the ground,
  (ii)    ground regulations,
 (iii)    evacuation procedure,
  (iv)    description of the individual's duty.
Stewards Incident: Groups


At one Premier League ground, the club's Safety Officer has formed a
Stewards    Incident Group consisting of four trusted stewards.      This
group has a roving commission and is deployed to assist colleagues who
are,   or who could reasonably expect,      to be faced with a difficult
situation.    These stewards are not considered as bouncers or aggressive
but are there to assist in a professional manner.      Indeed, they were
witnessed going onto a terrace to remove a drunk and dealt with the
incident very effectively.


Not only has the introduction of such a unit given other stewards some
confidence in performing their duties, but it also transmits a positive
message to the spectators and the Police that the club are in the first
instance prepared to respond to problems without immediate recourse to
the Police.    It also encourages individual stewards to take appropriate
action rather than ignore events or immediately seek Police assistance.


Emiinmgnt


Effective lines of communication are vital and the availability and use
of personal radios by stewards should be increased.


There is national inconsistency in the type or colour of conspicuity
jackets worn by stewards.    The F.A. have recommended that supervisors
should wear white coats,     fire stewards    should wear red and safety
stewards orange.    There is, however, a different school of thought that
all stewards should wear coats similar in style and colour as those
worn by the Police, thus giving an overall impression of authority to
the spectators.    Both views have merit.


T-ahmi-r Saving Measures


Some clubs have taken steps to alleviate particular problems which in
turn has allowed a reduction in staff previously allocated to tackle
the problem.    For example, in an effort to prevent spectators climbing
onto the perimeter fence to gesticulate at times of excitement, or in
order to prevent fences being climbed by spectators wishing to transfer
from one area to another, one club paints the top of the fencing with
anti-vandal paint.   This type of paint is in everyday use and leaves a
residue of paint on any person touching it.   Notices warning spectators
of its use are of course displayed and it has proved very effective.


Another method used where certain areas within grounds are expected to
be sparsely attended is the use of bomb tape to cordon off the area,
therefore leaving a smaller area of the ground to marshal.    Experience
has shown this to be a simple but effective measure and few people have
been seen to breach this type of cordon.

Dear Sir

H U E QFETCE CERCOLftR MO 3 6 /1 9 9 1

CHHRGES K R PC O CD G FOOmATJ. MMCHES


           JUstioe Taylor's report on his inquiry into the Hillsboroucih
stadium disaster reccmmended that:

       "Police Authorities^ should review the charges they make to      for
       the costs of policing inside grounds so as to ensure that realistic
       charges are made.     Hie Home Office should take steps to ensure
       consistency of practice/ subject to local discretion and the need to
       have regard to local circumstances." (Recommendation 53)

2.    m e reasoning behind this recamendation was given in paragraph 210 of
the report:

            tenptation to the clubs to leave it all to the police is stronger
           they are not required to make a realistic payment for ]^vi■if-**
       services. No charge is made for officers outside the ground g-iwo
       maintaining law and order in the streets is a normal public function of
       the police. At the present time, the practice as to recovering costs
       of policing inside the grounds from clubs varies greatly fran pia™> to
       place, different formulae being used. In same areas, the charge lnario
       is the actual cost of the officers attending in the ground. At others
       it os made on a sliding scale, dependent on whether the match is
       category A (high risk). B a r e . At others, it is dependent on the size
       of the crowd attending. At seme, it appears to be entirely arbitrary
       and at one. ground it. is said to be nil. Xn_inv^view a more consist**rrt-
       and businesslike approach should be made to such                if
       were to find it mare economical to recruit efficient stewards than to
       delegate duties to the police, there could be a significant reduction
       p the number of police deployed at football grounds, to the benefit of
       the community at large."


                                         -1-
The statutory position

3.    Section 15(1) of the Police Act 1964 provides that "the chief officer
of police of any police force may provide, at the request of any person,
special police services at any premises or in any locality in the police area
far Which the farce is maintained, subject to the payment to the police
authority of charges on such scales as may be determined by that authority."
It has always been accepted that the presence of police officers within
football grounds falls within this provision.

4.    Safely certificates are required for stadia designated by the Secretary
of State under section 1(1) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1575. They
are issued by local authorities and contain such rules and conditions as the
local authority consider necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety
at the ground. Where certificates require the holder to arrange for the
attendance of an adequate number of police officers within the ground, the
extent of the provision of police services mist, under section 2 of the 1975
Act as amended, be reserved for the determination of the chief officer of
police of the force in question.

Extent of charges under section 15

5.    It has been the view of successive Hdme Secretaries since 1968 that the
costs of special services should be paid in full by those using the service
and that no part of these costs should be allowed to add to the general level
of police expenditure. Charges should be reviewed and adjusted as necessary
- at least annually. Hie aim in principle should be to recover the full cost
of those police officers who are deployed at football matches on the private
property of the football club (and where officers are posted outside the
ground for part of their tour of duty and inside it for the remainder, the
full cost of the time spent inside should similarly be recovered). 'Full
costs* means the total cost of a police officer including pay, overtime,
national insurance, notional pension charges, rent allowance, compensatory
grant, uniform, administrative costs, overheads such as costs of travel to
and frcsn the ground and so on. In calculating charges, police authorities
are reccnnnended to follcw the methodology set out by the Audit Commission in
their report 'Taking care of the Coppers' (November 1990; Annex A).

ftiarrpm   and deployment policies

6.    If the full cost is to be recovered, there must be a direct link
between deployment and charges: the more officers the force finds it
necessary to deploy for duty on the club's private property, the more the
club should have to pay. Under present charging policies this is not always
the case.

7.    One reason far this may be that some forces charge only for the number
of officers mentioned in an agreement made with the club - even where the
chief officer of police considers it necessary, because of the nature of the
match or the reputation of visiting supporters, to deploy inside the ground
more officers than such an agreement provides for. 'this practice should be
reviewed and any agreements should specifically provide far special
circumstances calling far the deployment of more officers than usual.
8.   Otherfarces determine charges on the basis of a fixed formala. Where
the same formula is used far bath charging and deployment, the eccncciic cost
may be recovered. Bat where the charging formula bears no relation to
deployment (e.g. because deployment is based on the chief officer's
assessment of the need vfcereas charges are based on 2 constables - with
supervising officers pro rata - per 1000 of actual attendance), charges are
likely to fall seme way short of recovering the full economic costs.

9.   Police and clubs should have full discussions an deployment to ensure
that the police can take into account any information the club can provide
which might help determine the deployment operationally necessary; as far as
practicable clubs should have a good idea of the likely costs involved.

local considerations

10.   As Lard Justice Taylor acknowledged,     local circumstances cannot be
ignored. In particular -

      a.      Hie nature and location of the ground and the standard of
              physical aids to crowd control are major considerations in
              determining the number of officers to be deployed inside the
              ground. Facilities are often poorest at the grounds of clubs who
              are least able to pay the full econcsnic cost of policing.

      b.      The financial plight of many clubs cannot be lightly dismissed.
              Asking clubs to pay unrealistically high charges far policing
              could lead to problems with recovering debt and even to
              bankruptcy.

Stewardincr

11.   There are, however, steps which the poorer clubs could take to help
themselves. In particular, more,, and better trained, stewards would help to
reduce the policing requirement. Manning gates, directing spectators to the
correct areas, keeping gangways clear and monitoring the density of packing
in pens and enclosures are all mentioned by lord Justice Taylor as examples
of duties which could be carried out by suitable, properly trained stewards.
The Association of Chief Police Officers are willing to provide advice on the
training of stewards and the Home Secretary hopes that the standards of
stewarding can be raised co-operatively so as to reduce the burden an farces.

Discretion to phase in full cost charging1

12.   Olie Home Secretary hopes therefore that all police authorities will
introduce arrangements for full recovery of costs incurred under section 15;
he recognises that many authorities have already done this. But where a club
is not being charged on this basis and would have serious difficulty in
meeting immediately the full costs of policing - particularly in view of the
expenditure needed to implement the other recommendations of the Taylor
report - the Home secretary would have no objection if a police authority
used its discretion to phase in full charges over a period. This should not,
however, exceed five years.
13.   Although this circular is directed at football as a response to the
Taylor report, the same principles apply to other events and police
authorities are recommended to use the same approach for special police
services provided under section 15 for other commercial events.

14.   An additional copy of this circular is enclosed for the Treasurer.

                                     Yours faithfully.
